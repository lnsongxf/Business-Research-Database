I use pairwise stability and a vertical preference restriction on one side to identify preferences on both sides of the market.

Due to residents' willingness to pay for desirable programs and capacity constraints, salaries in any competitive equilibrium would remain, on average, at least $23,000 below the marginal product of labor. Therefore, the match is not the likely cause of low salaries.
