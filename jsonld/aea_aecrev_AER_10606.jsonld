There are large differences in the frequency with which students from seemingly similar schools reach high achievement levels. The distribution of unexplained school effects includes a thick tail of schools that produce many more high-achieving students than is typical. Several additional analyses suggest that the differences are not primarily due to unobserved differences in student characteristics. The differences are persistent across time, suggesting that differences in the effectiveness of educational programs are not primarily due to direct peer effects.", "ex:volume": "106", "ex:source": "American Economic Review", "ex:title": "Do Schools Matter for High Math Achievement?

This paper studies China's rising domestic content in exports using firm- and customs transaction-level data. The approach embraces firm heterogeneity and hence reduces aggregation bias.

Such substitution was induced by the country's trade and investment liberalization, which deepened its engagement in global value chains and led to a greater variety of domestic materials becoming available at lower prices.", "ex:volume": "106", "ex:source": "American Economic Review", "ex:title": "Domestic Value Added in Exports: Theory and Firm Evidence from China", "ex:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=AYa78H7tjYV5cZlgn5y2iNWY_HPcSUuP", "ex:pages": "1402-36", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Hiau Looi Kee"}, {"ex:name": "Heiwai Tang"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "We integrate tools to monitor information acquisition in field experiments on discrimination and examine whether gaps arise already when decision makers choose the effort level for reading an application.
