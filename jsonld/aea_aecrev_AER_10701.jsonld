[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "The interaction between community and markets remains a central theme in the social sciences. The empirical evidence is rich: in some instances, markets strengthen social ties, while in others they undermine them. The impact of markets on inequality and welfare also varies widely. This paper develops a model where individuals in a social network choose whether to participate in their network and whether to participate in the market. We show that individual behavior is defined by the q-core of the network and the key to understanding the conflicting evidence is whether the market and the network are complements or substitutes.", "ex:volume": "107", "ex:source": "American Economic Review", "ex:title": "Networks, Markets, and Inequality", "ex:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=RbmUZva63JdBVrZIRxELwGWX3O1sNGYT", "ex:pages": "1-30", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2017", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Julien Gagnon", "Sanjeev Goyal"]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "I introduce and study dynamic persuasion mechanisms.
