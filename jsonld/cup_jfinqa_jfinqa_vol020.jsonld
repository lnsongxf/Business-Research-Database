This analysis explores the power of various investment selection criteria to identify efficient portfolios from investment strategies involving call options and treasury bills, stocks, and covered option writing. The preference structure for strategies incorporating options is compared to traditional stock-fixed income investments, and the importance of options to investor utility maximization is illustrated. This study reveals that rules of stochastic dominance that place few restrictions on investor preference functions and asset return distribution are appropriate criteria by which to rank portfolios containing options and other assets.", "ex:volume": "20", "ex:source": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "ex:title": "Efficiency Analysis and Option Portfolio Selection", "ex:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000011807", "ex:pages": "435-450", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1985", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Booth, James R."}, {"ex:name": "Tehranian, Hassan"}, {"ex:name": "Trennepohl, Gary L."}]}, {"ex:issue": "04", "ex:abstract": "This paper addresses both how best to incorporate forecasts of future excess market returns into a market-timing strategy and what additional return to expect as a consequence. In contrast to the work of Jensen [8] and Grant ([4], [5], and [6]), the results specifically consider and measure the attractiveness to a risk-averse investor of the positively skewed distribution of portfolio returns expected from a market-timed portfolio. The usual mean and variance characterization of a risky portfolio is not sufficient in the case of a markettimed portfolio, and a simple utility model is employed to measure the incremental value of a market-timing strategy. The results are given as a function of the relative volatility of the market, the quality of available forecasts, and the risk attitude of the investor.", "ex:volume": "20", "ex:source": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "ex:title": "Market Timing and Risk Reduction", "ex:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000011819", "ex:pages": "451-459", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1985", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Pfeifer, Phillip E."}]}, {"ex:issue": "04", "ex:abstract": "This research develops and tests a model for the prediction of tender offer outcomes.

Thus, there must be an equality between the market values of real assets and the values of optimally levered firms. The standard measure of the advantage to leverage compares the values of levered and unlevered assets, and can be misleading and difficult to interpret. We show that a meaningful measure of the advantage to debt is the extra rate of return, net of a market premium for bankruptcy risk, earned by a levered firm relative to an otherwise-identical unlevered firm. We construct an option valuation model to calculate such a measure and present extensive simulation results.
