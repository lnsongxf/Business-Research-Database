In the case of Eurodollar CDs, the additional and major systematic factor explaining the spread (<italic>vis a vis</italic> T-bills) is the exemption of Eurodollar CDs from the Federal Reserve's “tax” via reserve requirements. An empirical section confirms the role of standard default risk, liquidity risk, and market “absorption” variables in determining short-term deviations from tax-adjusted parity. The taxadjusted parity condition, however, remains the major systematic and medium-term determinant—certainly more important than has been suggested previously in the literature.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "ex:volume": "21", "ex:title": "State Taxes and Reserve Requirements as Major Determinants of Yield Spreads among Money Market Instruments", "ex:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000012308", "ex:pages": "427-436", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1986", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Fabozzi, Frank J."}, {"ex:name": "Thurston, Thom B."}]}, {"ex:issue": "04", "ex:abstract": "The following paper presents a general derivation of the jump process option pricing formula. In particular, a general jump process formula is derived via an analysis of the limiting behavior of the binomial option pricing formula. In deriving the formula, a very simple central limit theorem known as Poisson's Limit Theorem is applied. The simplicity of the analysis allows the establishment of precisely the connections between the specification of the underlying binomial stock return process and the specific form of the corresponding continuous-time jump process formula. Several examples are provided to illustrate these connections.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "ex:volume": "21", "ex:title": "A General Derivation of the Jump Process Option Pricing Formula", "ex:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S002210900001231X", "ex:pages": "437-446", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1986", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Page, Frank H."}, {"ex:name": "Sanders, Anthony B."}]}, {"ex:issue": "04", "ex:abstract": "Portfolios of stocks issued by small firms are well known to earn rates of return in excess of those commensurate with their market sensitivities. One common explanation for this phenomenon is that small firm stocks are riskier than large firm stocks because less information is available about the former than about the latter. A necessary condition for such an explanation to be valid is that the information effect not be eliminated by combining the individual stocks into portfolios. This paper uses jump-diffusion return models to gauge the impact of information by firm size. The results show that portfolios of small firm stocks are no more prone to information surprises than are portfolios of large firm stocks. However, portfolios of small firm stocks are found to react more severely than portfolios of large firm stocks when surprises do occur.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "ex:volume": "21", "ex:title": "Using Jump-Diffusion Return Models to Measure Differential Information by Firm Size", "ex:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000012321", "ex:pages": "447-458", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1986", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Brauer, Greggory A."}]}, {"ex:issue": "04", "ex:abstract": "The word revolution is entirely appropriate for describing the changes in financial institutions and instruments that have occurred in the past twenty years.
