If recorded price errors are sufficiently nonrandom, they result in biased returns and in biased and inconsistent estimates of market model regression coefficients. This paper argues that tax-induced flow-supply pressures cause end-of-the-year recorded price errors to be nonrandom enough to create the appearance of anomalous turn-of-the-year stock return behavior. Empirical tests of returns and market model regression coefficients during the turn-of-the-year period cannot reject this errors-in-variables explanation of the turn-ofthe-year effect.", "ex:volume": "24", "ex:source": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "ex:title": "Errors in Recorded Security Prices and the Turn-ofthe-Year Effect", "ex:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000013715", "ex:pages": "513-526", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "1989", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["James B.
