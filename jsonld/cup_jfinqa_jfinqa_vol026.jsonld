Specifically, we find that both spot and forward exchange rates for the U.K., Germany, Japan, and Canada have unit roots and are cointegrated. We also find that the co-integrating parameter in the regression of realized spot on forward rates for each currency is approximately one, implying that researchers who use this specification to test the UFRH may falsely accept the hypothesis simply because of the specification used in the test. Using an alternative error correction specification, we find that the UFRH is resoundingly rejected for all currencies and that the coefficients in this specification exhibit temporal instability.

This occurs because the hedge decreases the sensitivity of senior claim value to incremental investment, allowing equity holders to capture a larger portion of the incremental benefit from new investment. Hedging also allows the firm to credibly commit to meet obligations in states where it otherwise could not, which improves contract terms the firm can negotiate with customers, creditors, and managers. These benefits cannot be duplicated by individual hedging, and each result holds independent of agents' risk preferences.", "ex:volume": "26", "ex:source": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "ex:title": "Forward Contracts and Firm Value: Investment Incentive and Contracting Effects", "ex:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000007808", "ex:pages": "519-532", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1991", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Hendrik Bessembinder"}]}, {"ex:issue": "04", "ex:abstract": "The role of fiduciaries with conflicting interests has received considerable attention recently. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the role of a fiduciary casting votes under conflicting interests in proxy contests that seek to control the corporation and those waged solely for the purpose of deciding an issue.
