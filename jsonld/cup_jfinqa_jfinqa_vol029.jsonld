Specifically, the paper focuses on how insider trading affects insiders' choice among investment projects.

Thiseffect might be beneficial, however, because insiders' risk aversion pulls them toward aconservative investment policy.

However, this paper identifies a U-shaped relation between announcement day risk-adjusted excess returns and the percentage decline in dividends. The significantly smaller than expected price reaction to dividend omissions cannot be traced to growth opportunities, nor to a tendency for firms to delay omission announcements. While omitting firms provide higher per share dividends within five years of the dividend action than do firms that severely reduce payments, future dividends are unrelated to the market's response.", "ex:volume": "29", "ex:source": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "ex:title": "Are Dividend Omissions Truly the Cruelest Cut of All?", "ex:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000009030", "ex:pages": "459-480", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1994", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "William G.

While the first informed trader is better informed, the second informed trader can make inferences about this extra information; in fact, the second informed trader can make sharper inferences from the order flow than the market maker about the extra information. In this setting, competition among the informed traders has a very interesting form. The informed trader with the additional information trades less intensely on that information early on, and both informed traders trade very intensely on their common information. This makes it more difficult for the trader with less information to learn about the information he does not have. When there are only a few remaining trading periods and the information known to both traders has largely been revealed through their trading, then the trader with the additional information trades more intensely on the basis of his private information.", "ex:volume": "29", "ex:source": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "ex:title": "Strategic Trading with Asymmetrically Informed Traders and Long-Lived Information", "ex:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000000016", "ex:pages": "499-518", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1994", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "F.

The moment restrictions implied by the financial and market microstructure models are jointly tested using Hansen's (1982) GMM approach.

Within this sufficiently simple framework, I obtain closed-form expressions for the estimators, standard errors of the estimators, and the test statistic, which affords an opportunity to examine the precision of the estimators and the power of the test as the return interval increases. I show that apparent rejections of the random walk model cannot be sustained when tests of the model are adjusted for market micro structure effects, and I discuss other applications of the methodology.", "ex:volume": "29", "ex:source": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "ex:title": "Econometrics of Financial Models and Market Microstructure Effects", "ex:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000000028", "ex:pages": "519-540", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1994", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Tom Smith"}]}, {"ex:issue": "04", "ex:abstract": "We examine 38 takeovers of distressed firms and find that these takeovers are more likely to involve firms in the same industry and less likely to be hostile takeovers than are acquisitions in general.

We provide further evidence on the cash flow signaling and overinvestment hypotheses by examining revisions in analysts' earnings forecasts and changes in capital expenditures following dividend change announcements. We find that analysts significantly revise their earnings forecasts following dividend changes and that Q < 1 firms actually increase their capital expenditures following dividend increases and decrease them following dividend decreases.
