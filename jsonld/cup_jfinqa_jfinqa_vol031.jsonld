Consistent with these conjectures, this study finds that analyst following exerts a significant and positive impact on firms' market value. We also find evidence that security analysts have a stronger incentive to follow stocks of high quality companies, since such stocks arc easier to market.

Distinguishing between scheduled and unscheduled announcements, we hypothesize that since the timing, although not the content, of scheduled announcements is known a priori, the pre-release ISD will impound the anticipated impact of important releases on price volatility and that the ISD will normally decline post-release as this uncertainty is resolved. Conversely, we hypothesize that the unexpected high volatility caused by major unscheduled releases will cause market participants to adjust upward their estimates of likely volatility over the remaining life of the option resulting in an increase in the ISD. Our evidence supports both hypotheses. The ISDs that we consider are from the T-Bond, Eurodollar, and Deutschemark options markets. We examine scheduled macroeconomic news releases such as the employment report and the PPI. We also find that the observed tendency for the ISD to fall on Fridays and rise on Mondays is due to the weekday pattern of scheduled news releases.", "ex:volume": "31", "ex:source": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "ex:title": "The Creation and Resolution of Market Uncertainty: The Impact of Information Releases on Implied Volatility", "ex:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000023784", "ex:pages": "513-539", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1996", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Ederington, Louis H."}, {"ex:name": "Lee, Jae Ha"}]}, {"ex:issue": "04", "ex:abstract": "Previous tests of stock index arbitrage models have rejected the no-arbitrage constraint imposed by these models.

A contingent-claims pricing methodology that overcomes state variable dimensionality problems is developed to examine mortgage pools with many distinct underlying assets and whose loan cash flow values are subject to interest rate uncertainty. Security structure and the correlation structure of collateralizing assets within a pool are found to be important determinants of tranche price and required yield spread. By disentangling default loss risk from default-related call risk, we show it is possible that mezzanine investment classes may require lower yield spreads than higher priority investment classes. Of particular interest is the finding that reduced cash flow volatility obtained through pool diversification may actually decrease the value of the first-loss (junior) tranche. When examining the relationship of pool size and tranche value, we find that five to 10 distinct mortgages are required to realize most of the effects of asset diversification.", "ex:volume": "31", "ex:source": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "ex:title": "The Pricing of Multiclass Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities", "ex:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000023814", "ex:pages": "581-603", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1996", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Childs, Paul D."}, {"ex:name": "Ott, Steven H."}, {"ex:name": "Riddiough, Timothy J."}]}, {"ex:issue": "04", "ex:abstract": "This paper derives and numerically simulates maximum likelihood estimators for the drift in several important diffusion price models.
