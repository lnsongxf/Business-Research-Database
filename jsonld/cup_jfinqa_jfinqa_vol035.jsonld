Using a Nasdaq proprietary data set that identifies trade direction, we examine the validity of several trade classification algorithms. We find that the quote rule, the tick rule, and the Lee and Ready (1991) rule correctly classify 76.4%, 77.66%, and 81.05% of the trades, respectively. However, all classification rules have only a very limited success in classifying trades executed inside the quotes, introducing a bias in the accuracy of classifying large trades, trades during high volume periods, and ECN trades. We also find that extant algorithms do a mediocre job when used for calculating effective spreads. For Nasdaq trades, we propose a new and simple classification algorithm that improves over extant algorithms.", "ex:volume": "35", "ex:source": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "ex:title": "The Accuracy of Trade Classification Rules: Evidence from Nasdaq", "ex:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000009303", "ex:pages": "529-551", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2000", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Ellis, Katrina"}, {"ex:name": "Michaely, Roni"}, {"ex:name": "O'Hara, Maureen"}]}, {"ex:issue": "04", "ex:abstract": "This study directly tests the ability of several competing methods to identify market buy and sell orders using intra-day quote and trade prices, and identifies factors that affect the accuracy of the methods.

We illustrate the problems that can arise by reexamining the findings of Bekaert and Hodrick(1992), who detected evidence of in-sample predictability in international equity and foreign exchange markets using VAR methodology for a variety of countries from 1981–1989. The VAR predictions are significantly biased in most out-of-sample forecasts and are conclusively outperformed by a simple benchmark model at horizons of up to six months. This remains true even after corrections for small sample bias and the introduction Bayesian parameter restrictions. A Monte Carlo analysis indicates that the data are unlikely to have been generated by a stable VAR. This conclusion is supported by an examination of structural break statistics. We show that implied long-horizon statistics calculated from the VAR parameter estimates are very unreliable.", "ex:volume": "35", "ex:source": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "ex:title": "Predictability in International Asset Returns: A Reexamination", "ex:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000009339", "ex:pages": "601-620", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2000", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Neely, Christopher J."}, {"ex:name": "Weller, Paul"}]}, {"ex:issue": "04", "ex:abstract": "This paper examines the association between block ownership and market liquidity.
