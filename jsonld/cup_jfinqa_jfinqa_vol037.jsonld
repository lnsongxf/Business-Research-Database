We find that price adjustments are quicker by as much as one hour on Nasdaq. This result is not due to differences in issuer characteristics or announcement effects across the markets, but due to differences in market structures. Greater risk taking by dealers, more rapid order execution, and more frequent informed trading (SOES bandits) on Nasdaq, as well as stale limit orders and a less efficient opening price-setting mechanism on the NYSE/AMEX, all contribute to faster stock price adjustments on Nasdaq.", "ex:volume": "37", "ex:source": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "ex:title": "Does Market Structure Affect the Immediacy of Stock Price Responses to News?", "ex:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000002878", "ex:pages": "617-648", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2002", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Masulis, Ronald W."}, {"ex:name": "Shivakumar, Lakshmanan"}]}, {"ex:issue": "04", "ex:abstract": "This paper extends the seminal Cox-Ross-Rubinstein ((1979), CRR hereafter) binomial model to multiple assets.

The method requires the valuation of just two options: a European option and a twice-exercisable option. I first derive the risk-neutral distributions of asset prices under two forward risk-adjusted measures. Closed form solutions for European options on foreign assets are then obtained by applying these risk-neutral distributions. This article also provides analytic solutions for pricing twice exercisable options that are at most two-dimensional even though the valuation problem involves four risk factors at two exercise dates. I report the results of numerical evaluations of American option values using my method and show how they vary with the interest rate parameters.

The average call option value is 2.25% of par. Over time, call values remain close to zero until one year before the first call date, reach a maximum at the beginning of the callable period, and slowly decrease thereafter. The determinants of call values are examined. The results show that bonds of firms that have called aggressively in the past have larger call values. Additionally, lower interest rates, smaller slopes of the yield curve, and higher interest rate volatility lead to larger call values. The results also show that call values increase with time to maturity in the callable period but decrease with time to maturity in the call protection period. Lower rated, higher coupon bonds have larger call values. There is no evidence that the length of the call protection period affects call values.", "ex:volume": "37", "ex:source": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "ex:title": "An Empirical Examination of Call Option Values Implicit in U.S. Corporate Bonds", "ex:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000002908", "ex:pages": "693-721", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2002", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "King, Tao-Hsien Dolly"}]}]
