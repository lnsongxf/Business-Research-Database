Using U.S. data, we find that downside cash flow and discount rate betas carry the largest premia. Downside cash flow risk is priced consistently across different samples, periods, and return decomposition methods. It is the only component of beta with significant out-of-sample predictive ability. Downside cash flow premia mainly occur for small stocks, while large stocks are compensated for symmetric cash-flow-related risk.", "ex:volume": "47", "ex:source": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "ex:title": "Cash Flow and Discount Rate Risk in Up and Down Markets: What Is Actually Priced?", "ex:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109012000567", "ex:pages": "1279-1301", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Botshekan, Mahmoud"}, {"ex:name": "Kraeussl, Roman"}, {"ex:name": "Lucas, Andre"}]}]
