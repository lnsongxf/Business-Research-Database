[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "In this paper, we develop conjectures for understanding how information technology (IT) strategy and IT investments jointly influence profitability and the market value of the firm. We view IT strategy as an expression of the dominant strategic objective that the firm chooses to emphasize, which can be revenue expansion, cost reduction, or a dual emphasis in which both goals are pursued. Using data from more than 300 firms in the United States, we find that at the mean value of IT investments, firms with a dual IT strategic emphasis have a higher market value as measured by Tobin’s Q than firms with a revenue or a cost emphasis, but they have similar levels of profitability. Of greater importance, IT strategic emphasis plays a significant role in moderating the relationship between IT investments and firm performance. Dual-emphasis firms have a stronger IT–Tobin’s Q relationship than revenue-emphasis firms. Dual-emphasis firms also have a stronger IT– profitability relationship than either revenue- or cost-emphasis firms. Overall, these findings imply that, at low levels of IT investment, the firm may need to choose between revenue expansion and cost reduction, but at higher levels of IT investment, dual-emphasis in IT strategy or IT strategic ambidexterity increasingly pays off.", "ex:volume": "40", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "How Information Technology Strategy and Investments Influence Firm Performance:  Conjecture and Emirical Evidence", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol40/iss1/12", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Information technology strategic emphasis", "IT ambidexterity", "IT strategic ambidexterity", "firm performance", "profitability", "IT investments", "revenue growth", "cost reduction", "dual emphasis"], "ex:creator": ["Sunil Mithas", "Roland T.

Routine activity theory is synthesized with survival modeling, specifically a Weibull hazard model, and users’ system access behavior is investigated using seven months of field data from the institution.

Immediate compliance with alerts, as opposed to delayed compliance or noncompliance, is a key factor in improving student safety on campuses. This paper investigates the critical antecedents that motivate students to comply immediately with messages from campus emergency notification systems. Drawing on Etzioni’s compliance theory, a model is developed. Using a scenario-based survey method, the model is tested in five types of events—snowstorm, active shooter, building fire, health-related, and robbery—and with more than 800 college students from the Northern region of the United States.

We build on and extend MIS research on process digitization and digital versus traditional communication media to study how and to what extent social media—one form of digital mass media—are emancipatory (i.e., permitting wide-spread participation in public discourse and surfacing of diverse perspectives) versus hegemonic (i.e., contributing to ideological control by a few). While a pressing concern to activists and scholars, systematic study of this issue has been elusive, owing partially to the complexity of the emancipation and hegemony concepts. Using a case study approach, we iteratively engaged with data on the discourse surrounding the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and source literature to identify six facets of interpretive media packages (i.e., competing social constructions of an issue) as measurable constructs pertinent to emancipation and hegemony. These facets included three structural constraints (on authorship, citation, and influence) and three content restrictions (on frames, signatures, and emotion). We investigated propositions regarding effects of social versus traditional media and lean versus rich social media on these interpretive media package facets by comparing the SOPA discourse across two lean traditional and social media (newspapers and Twitter) and two rich traditional and social media (television and YouTube). Our findings paradoxically revealed social media to be emancipatory with regard to structural constraints, but hegemonic with regard to an important content restriction (i.e., frames). Lean social media mitigated structural advantages and exacerbated content problems. These findings suggest that, as with traditional media, some inevitable evils accompany the societal benefits of social media and that mass media is having a detrimental effect on public discourse. We offer practical steps by which private and public institutions may counter this effect, theoretical implications for wider consideration of the six interpretive media package facets proposed here, and encouragement to MIS researchers to increase their efforts to compare different digitized processes so that a more comprehensive theory of the effects of different forms of digitized processes can be developed.", "ex:volume": "40", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Are Social Media Emancipatory or Hegemonic?

Given the powerful information dissemination capabilities, information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been suggested as interventions to build infant care awareness and to modify healthcare behaviors. We examine how the use of one ICT intervention—specifically, eHealth kiosks disseminating authenticated and accessible medical information—can alleviate the problem of high infant mortality in rural India. We investigate how mothers’ social networks affect their use of eHealth kiosks, seeking professional medical care for their infants and, ultimately, infant mortality. Drawing on the social epidemiology and social networks literatures, we focus on advice and hindrance from both strong and weak ties as the conduit of social influence on mothers’ health-related behaviors for the care of their infants. Over a period of 7 years, we studied 4,620 infants across 10 villages where the eHealth kiosks were implemented along with support resources for proxy use. The results revealed that (1) eHealth kiosk use promotes seeking professional medical care and reduces infant mortality, (2) mothers are especially vulnerable to hindrance from both strong and weak ties as they choose to maintain the status quo of traditional infant healthcare practices (e.g., reliance on untrained personnel, superstitions, fatalism) in villages, and (3) advice from both strong and weak ties offers the potential to break down misplaced beliefs about infant healthcare practices and to develop literacy on seeking professional medical care. In contrast, in a comparative group of 10 neighboring villages, the reduction in infant mortality was not as pronounced and the effect of professional medical care in reducing infant mortality was lower. Our findings suggest that an ICT intervention can effectively address one of society’s most important problems (i.e., infant mortality) even in parts of the world with limited resources and deep suspicion of technology and change.

Our case study comparison of two settings—retail stores and post offices—reveals that actors’ appropriations extended beyond the IT artifact to include technical, role, usage, social, and policy appropriations. The intended users (poor clients in remote and underserved areas) barely interacted with the IT artifact or other system elements; instead, they relied upon remote bankers (correspondents) to appropriate the system on their behalf.

We find that when little space can be dedicated to advertising under the advertising model, the brokerage model generates more revenue for the platform than the advertising model. When a significant proportion of space is dedicated to advertising under the advertising model, matching probability on a platform plays a critical role in determining which revenue model can generate more revenue: If the matching probability is high, the brokerage model generates more revenue; otherwise, the advertising model generates more revenue. Buyers are always better off under the advertising model because of larger participation by the sellers in the platform’s free service. Sellers are better off under the advertising model in most scenarios. The only exception is when the matching probability is low and the platform dedicates considerable space to advertising.

For this situation, we develop simple information revelation policies that do not use any knowledge of the valuations and establish their performance guarantees. Two, the ad exchange has distributional knowledge about bidder valuations. For this situation, we develop an informed heuristic that exploits this information.

The tree-based approach is particularly advantageous in the analyses of big data, or data with large sample sizes and a large number of variables.

We also find statistically and economically significant effects of display advertising on increasing consumers’ propensity to make a purchase. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the longer the duration of exposure to display advertising, the more likely the consumers are to engage in direct search behaviors (e.g., direct visits) rather than indirect ones (e.g., search engine inquiries).

We present scalable approaches to address privacy concerns when sharing transactional databases. Although the benefits of sharing are well documented and the number of firms sharing transactional data has increased over the years, the rate at which this number has grown is not quite what it could have been. Concerns about revealing proprietary information have prevented some retailers from sharing, despite the obvious advantages in an increasingly networked economy. In the context of sharing transactional data, sensitive information is typically based on relationships derived from frequently occurring itemsets, result of surprisingly successful promotions by the retailer, or unexpected relationships identified by the retailer while mining the data. Prior work in this area includes optimal approaches based on integer programming to maximize the accuracy of shared databases, while hiding all sensitive itemsets. While these approaches were shown to solve problems involving up to 10 million transactions, many transactional databases in the big data context are considerably larger and the existing integer programming-based procedures do not scale well enough to solve these larger problems. Consequently, there is no effective solution procedure for such databases in extant literature.In this paper, we first present an optimal procedure leveraging intuition from linear programming based column generation. Next, we identify a common structure that exists in these problems, and show how it can be taken advantage of through an approach based on sorting and column generation to make the process more efficient. We then illustrate how this structure can be incorporated into the column generation based procedure to develop an effective, scalable heuristic. Computational experiments are conducted on databases with 50 million and 100 million transactions, involving problems that could not be solved using existing optimal procedures. These experiments show that the optimal column generation based procedure can solve problem instances significantly larger than those tackled previously, and that the scalable heuristic identifies near-optimal solutions quickly in all instances where the optimal solution is known. We investigate the impact of hiding sensitive itemsets on the quality of a rule-based recommender system derived from the shared data. As expected, recommendation quality decreases as the number of sensitive itemsets increases; however, recommendation accuracy stays above 80% of the original rate when using the unmodified data even when there are 1,000 sensitive itemsets to hide. The effect on recommendation accuracy from using the heuristic relative to the optimal approach was very small: the accuracies with the heuristic were over 97% of the corresponding accuracies with the optimal approach in every experiment, and over 99% in the vast majority.", "ex:volume": "40", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Privacy and Big Data:  Scalable Approaches to Sanitize Large Transactional Databases for Sharing", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol40/iss4/10", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Data quality", "optimization", "column generation", "itemset hiding", "recommendation quality"], "ex:creator": ["Syam Menon", "Sumit Sarkar"]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "The number of mobile apps launched in the market has exponentially grown to more than 2 million, but little is known about how users choose and consume apps of numerous categories.

Consumers that do not participate in profiling and some that participate are worse off under voluntary profiling. Neither social welfare nor aggregate consumer surplus is necessarily higher under voluntary profiling; even when voluntary profiling leads to an increase in social welfare, it may come at the expense of consumer surplus. If the seller cannot price discriminate and charge only a uniform price for everyone or the seller can only charge different prices based on the consumer’s participation status, then aggregate consumer surplus under voluntary profiling is higher and a reduction in privacy cost has a positive impact on all consumers as well as the seller. However, when personalized pricing is possible, reducing privacy cost alone may reduce aggregate consumer surplus. The primary reason for these results is that voluntary profiling allows the seller to identify high valuation consumers that have no incentive to participate and set a higher price for them (compared to no profiling) while simultaneously benefitting from the profile information of low valuation consumers that participate.

Combining extant literature with insights from the case, we argue that incumbent firms face four competing concerns—capability (existing versus requisite), focus (product versus process), collaboration (internal versus external), and governance (control versus flexibility)—and that these concerns are systemically interrelated. Firms must therefore manage these concerns cohesively by continuously balancing new opportunities and established practices.", "ex:volume": "41", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Embracing Digital Innovation in Incumbent Firms:  How Volvo Cars Managed Competing Concerns", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol41/iss1/14", "ex:date": "2017", "ex:keyword": ["Digital innovation", "incumbent firms", "competing concerns"], "ex:creator": ["Fredrik Svahn", "Lars Mathiassen", "Rikard Lindgren"]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "For a period starting in 2015, Apple, Google, and Microsoft became the most valuable companies in the world. Each was marked by an external developer ecosystem. Anecdotally, at least, developers matter. Using a formal model of code spillovers, we show how a rising number of developers can invert the firm. That is, firms will choose to innovate using open external contracts in preference to closed vertical integration. The locus of value creation moves from inside the firm to outside. Distinct from physical goods, digital goods afford firms the chance to optimize spillovers. Further, firms that pursue high risk innovations with more developers can be more profitable than firms that pursue low risk innovations with fewer developers. More developers give platform firms more chances at success. Our contribution is to show why developers might cause a shift in organizational form and to provide a theory of how platform firms optimize their own intellectual property regimes in order to maximize growth.

This study theorizes that effective processing and management of customer information flows requires organizations to possess \"relational information processing capability\" (RIPC) and \"analytical information processing capability\" (AIPC). Drawing on and extending the theories of absorptive capacity and complementarities in the context of innovation, we posit that RIPC and AIPC complement product-focused customer involvement (PCI) and information-intensive customer involvement (ICI) practices, respectively, to enhance the amount of firm innovation. To test our hypotheses, we collected archival data from more than 300 large U.S. manufacturing firms and mapped their RIPC and AIPC to specific IT applications.Consistent with our theorizing, we find that RIPC positively moderates the relationship between PCI and amount of firm innovation and that AIPC positively moderates the relationship between ICI and amount of firm innovation. In further exploratory analysis, we find a positive three-way interaction between AIPC, RIPC, and PCI. Taken together, the results suggest that configurations of IT-enabled capabilities alone are not enough for innovation; instead, firms benefit more when specific configurations of IT-enabled capabilities are leveraged in unison with specific types of customer involvement. The study contributes to theory and practice by shedding light on important complementarities between specific types of customer involvement (PCI and ICI) and specific IT-enabled capabilities (RIPC and AIPC).", "ex:volume": "41", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Leveraging Customer Involvement for Fueling Innovation:  The Role of Relational and Analytical Information Processing Capabilities", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol41/iss1/16", "ex:date": "2017", "ex:keyword": ["Digital innovation", "customer involvement", "information technology", "relational information processing capability", "analytical information processing capability", "business value of IT"], "ex:creator": ["Terence J.

In this paper, we draw on the knowledge-based view of the firm to investigate how search in external knowledge sources and information technology for knowledge absorption jointly influence process innovation performance. Our model is tested on a nine-year panel (2003–2011) of Swiss firms from a wide range of manufacturing industries. Using instrumental variables, and disaggregating by type of IT, we find that data access systems and network connectivity hold very different potential for the effective absorption of external knowledge, and the subsequent realized economic gains from process innovation.
