[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Within the emerging context of the digitization of health care, electronic health records (EHRs) constitute a significant technological advance in the way medical information is stored, communicated, and processed by the multiple parties involved in health care delivery.  However, in spite of the anticipated value potential of this technology, there is widespread concern that consumer privacy issues may impede its diffusion. In this study, we pose the question:  Can individuals be persuaded to change their attitudes and opt-in behavioral intentions toward EHRs, and allow their medical information to be digitized even in the presence of significant privacy concerns?  To investigate this question, we integrate an individual’s concern for information privacy (CFIP) with the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) to examine attitude change and likelihood of opting-in to an EHR system.  We theorize that issue involvement and argument framing interact to influence attitude change, and that concern for information privacy further moderates the effects of these variables.  We also propose that likelihood of adoption is driven by concern for information privacy and attitude.  We test our predictions using an experiment with 366 subjects where we manipulate the framing of the arguments supporting EHRs.  We find that an individual’s CFIP interacts with argument framing and issue involvement to affect attitudes toward the use of EHRs.  In addition, results suggest that attitude toward EHR use and CFIP directly influence opt-in behavioral intentions.  An important finding for both theory and practice is that even when people have high concerns for privacy, their attitudes can be positively altered with appropriate message framing.

Competing with free is particularly concerning for movie studios, whose content may be more prone to single-use consumption than other industries such as music.  This issue has gained renewed importance recently with the advent of new digital video recording and distribution technologies, and the widespread availability of Internet piracy.We examine competition between “free” and paid video content in two important contexts:  the impact of legitimate free distribution in one channel on sales through paid channels, and the impact of illegitimate free distribution in pirated channels on sales through paid channels.  We do this by studying the impact of movie broadcasts on DVD demand and the impact of piracy availability at the time of broadcast on DVD demand.  Our data include all movies shown on over-the-air and cable television during an eight-month period in 2005–2006.With respect to the impact of movie broadcasts on piracy and sales, we find that movie broadcasts on over-the-air networks result in a significant increase in both DVD sales at Amazon. com and illegal downloads for those movies that are available on BitTorrent at the time of broadcast.  With respect to the impact of piracy on sales, we use the television broadcast as an exogenous demand shock and find that the availability of pirated content at the time of broadcast has no effect on post-broadcast DVD sales gains.Together our results suggest that creative artists can use product differentiation and market segmentation strategies to compete with freely available copies of their content.  Specifically, the post-broadcast increase in DVD sales suggests that giving away content in one channel can stimulate sales in a paid channel if the free content is sufficiently differentiated from its paid counterpart.  Likewise, our finding that the presence of pirated content does not cannibalize sales for the movies in our sample suggests that if free and paid products appeal to separate customer segments, the presence of free products need not harm paid sales.", "ex:volume": "33", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Competing with Free:  The Impact of Movie Broadcasts on DVD Sales and Internet Piracy", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol33/iss2/7", "ex:date": "2009", "ex:keyword": [":  Information goods", "movie broadcasts", "movie promotion", "DVD sales", "movie piracy", "broadcast flag", "consumer surplus"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Michael D.

An individual’s coworkers can be important sources of help in overcoming knowledge barriers constraining use of a complex system, and such interactions with others can determine an employee’s ability to influence eventual system configuration and features.  We incorporate network density (reflecting “get-help” ties for an employee) and network centrality (reflecting “give-help” ties for an employee), drawn from prior social network research, as key predictors of system use.  Further, we conceptualize valued network density and valued network centrality, both of which take into account ties to those with relevant system-related information, knowledge, and resources, and employ them as additional predictors.  We suggest that these constructs together are coping and influencing pathways by which they have an effect on system use.

This paper addresses this particular absence by investigating the impact of environment-based voluntariness on the relationships among the four primary TAM constructs. A meta-analysis of 71 empirical studies provides strong support for the hypotheses that environment-based voluntariness moderates the effects of ease of use and usefulness on behavioral intention, but not the effect of ease of use on usefulness. Moreover, inconsistent with our expectations, environment-based voluntariness does not moderate the effects of ease of use and usefulness on usage. By further analyzing the data set, we suggest this may be because of the relatively small sample size, the presence of other factors, or the inappropriate measurement of usage in previous studies.

An informational cascade occurs when it is optimal for an online user, having observed others’ actions, to follow the adoption decision of the preceding individual without regard to his own information.  Informational cascades are often rational for individual decision making; however, it may lead to adoption of inferior products.  With easy availability of information about other users’ choices, the Internet offers an ideal environment for informational cascades.  In this paper, we empirically examine informational cascades in the context of online software adoption.  We find user behavior in adopting software products is consistent with the predictions of the informational cascades literature.  Our results demonstrate that online users’ choices of software products exhibit distinct jumps and drops with changes in download ranking, as predicted by informational cascades theory.  Furthermore, we find that user reviews have no impact on user adoption of the most popular product, while having an increasingly positive impact on the adoption of lower ranking products.  The phenomenon persists after controlling for alternative explanations such as network effects, word-of-mouth effects, and product diffusion.  Our results validate informational cascades as an important driver for decision making on the Internet.

Whereas post-adoption research has recently paid attention to repeated use, the information systems field still lacks a systematic investiation into other behavioral outcomes that transcend mere usage.  In an attempt to extend the horizons of post-adoption research, we develop and test a model that explains post-adoption behaviors in the context of online services.  First, drawing on a dual model of relationship maintenance in consumer behavior research, we propose a conceptual framework to study and explain online consumer behavior.  In particular, our model predicts that two contrasting mechanisms, that is, dedication and constraint, are the main drivers of post-adoption phenomena (i.e., consumers’ post-adoption reactions to online services—beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors).  We empirically test the proposed dual model through the use of data collected from 510 users of online portals.  The results of structural equation modeling analysis indicate that, as expected, the dedication- and constraint-based mechanisms simultaneously, yet differentially, determine online consumer behavior.

Drawing from cybernetic theory and coping theory, TTAT delineates the avoidance behavior as a dynamic positive feedback loop in which users go through two cognitive processes, threat appraisal and coping appraisal, to decide how to cope with IT threats.  In the threat appraisal, users will perceive an IT threat if they believe that they are susceptible to malicious IT and that the negative consequences are severe.  The threat perception leads to coping appraisal, in which users assess the degree to which the IT threat can be avoided by taking safeguarding measures based on perceived effectiveness and costs of the safeguarding measure and self-efficacy of taking the safeguarding measure.  TTAT posits that users are motivated to avoid malicious IT when they perceive a threat and believe that the threat is avoidable by taking safeguarding measures; if users believe that the threat cannot be fully avoided by taking safeguarding measures, they would engage in emotion-focused coping.

In this paper, we focus on how and why conducting negotiations via computer media can affect this process, especially when negotiators have unequal power.  Our research model is based on theories from the information systems, negotiation, and social psychology literatures.  Via a laboratory experiment, we find that concessions made by the first individual to make an offer (the first mover) were not typically reciprocated by his/her negotiating opponent (the second mover).  Thus, in the context of computer-mediated negotiation, it appears that second movers are, among other things, more likely to violate the well-established norm of reciprocity.  This can result in significant disadvantages for the first mover, independent of power differences between negotiators.  In addition, we find that, contrary to face-to-face negotiations, increased power of one negotiator resulted in his/her having less influence in terms of getting larger concessions from the other negotiator.

In a controlled laboratory experiment involving student subjects, proxies for entry level programmers working on entry level tasks, two factors were manipulated:  programming setting (collaborative pair versus individuals) and programming task complexity (high versus low).  Participants who worked in the individual condition were randomly combined into nominal pairs.  The performance and affective responses of the collaborating pairs were then compared with those of the best performers and the second best performers of each nominal pair.  Results indicated that programming pairs performed at the level above the second best performers and at the level of the best performers in each nominal pair.  This relationship was found to be consistent across both levels of task complexity.  Consequently, there was no evidence of an “assembly bonus effect,” where the performance of a collaborating pair exceeds the performance of its best member working alone.

The ability to detect the presence or absence of between-group differences and accurately estimate the strength of moderating effects is important in studies that attempt to show contingent effects.  In the past, IS scholars have used a variety of approaches to examine these effects, with the partial least squares (PLS) pooled significance test for multigroup becoming the most common (e.g., Ahuja and Thatcher 2005; Enns et al. 2003; Zhu et al. 2006).  In other areas of social sciences (Epitropaki and Martin 2005) and management (Mayer and Gavin 2005; Song et al. 2005) research, however, there is greater emphasis on the use of covariance-based structural equation modeling multigroup analysis.  This paper compares these two methods through Monte Carlo simulation.  Our findings demonstrate the conditions under which covariance-based multigroup analysis is more appropriate as well as those under which there either is no difference or the component-based approach is preferable.  In particular, we find that when data are normally distributed, with a small sample size and correlated exogenous variables, the component-based approach is more likely to detect differences between-group than is the covariance-based approach.

Classes or entity types play a central role in conceptual modeling for information systems requirements analysis, as well as in the design of databases and object-oriented software.  Furthermore, classification is the primary task in applications such as data mining and the development of domain ontologies to support information sharing in semantic web applications.  However, despite the pervasiveness of classification, little research has proposed well-grounded guidelines for identifying, evaluating, and choosing classes when modeling a domain or designing information systems artifacts.  In this paper, we adopt the cognitive notions of inference and economy to derive a set of principles to guide effective and efficient classification.  We present a model for characterizing what may be considered useful classes in a given context based on the inferences that can be drawn from membership in a class.  This foundation is then used to suggest practical design rules for evaluating and refining potential classes.  We illustrate the use of the rules by showing that applying them to a previously published example yields meaningful changes.

IS professionals are engaged in the design and implementation of information technology artifacts aimed at improving the performance of business organizations.  Business managers commonly view performance through an economic lens, defining the overall goal as the maximization of firm value; that is, the long-term profit of the firm.  These managers understandably ask questions such as:  “Why do investments in IT artifacts often not result in an increase in firm value?” and “What IT artifacts will do so?”  The first is a theory-based, causal-related question.  The second is a design-based, problem-solving question.  Each represents a critical class of research questions in the IS discipline.Answering the first question requires an understanding of phenomena that occur at the intersection of organizations, people, and information technologies—the locus of the information systems discipline (Lee 1999).  Researchers addressing it develop and justify theories that provide deep principled explanations of these phenomena.  Such theories aim to explain what happened, why it happened, and possibly to predict what will happen within a given context.  It is the focus of much of the research published in the IS literature.While such theories may be strictly explanatory in nature, their relevancy and value are determined by the degree to which they enable managers to design work-systems that improve organizational performance (Alter 2003; Benbasat and Zmud 1999).  This is the focus of the second question.  Answering it is fundamentally a design task that requires, “shaping artifacts and events to create a more desirable future” (Boland 2002).

The other is that such use leaves us unsure about whether or not we have selected an efficient way, in terms of survey completion time, to assess these constructs.  Past researchers have used short form scales to address the issue of efficiency, but there are problems that may result from such efforts.  In this study, we address both shortcomings by exploring the use of a semantic differential scale, which we refer to as a fast form, to assess the constructs of TAM.  In this regard, we do three things.  First, we describe how fast form as a scale may be developed.  Second, we conduct a psychometric evaluation of the constructs that are measured by the fast form and examine their relationships.  Third, we assess the efficiency of the fast form by comparing the time required to complete a survey with it to that which is required to complete a survey with Likert scales.  Our results confirm that the constructs that are measured by the fast form are psychometrically equivalent to those that are measured by the Likert scales.  The relationship among these constructs was unchanged, providing strong evidence for nomological validity.

Specifically, the purpose of this study is to explore the role of habit and its antecedents in the context of continued IS usage.Building on previous work in other disciplines, we define habit in the context of IS usage as the extent to which people tend to perform behaviors (use IS) automatically because of learning.  Using recent work on the continued usage of IS (IS continuance), we have developed a model suggesting that continued IS usage is not only a consequence of intention, but also of habit.  In particular, in our research model, we propose IS habit to moderate the influence of intention such that its importance in determining behavior decreases as the behavior in question takes on a more habitual nature.  Integrating past research on habit and IS continuance further, we suggest how antecedents of behavior/behavioral intention as identified by IS continuance research relate to drivers of habitualization.We empirically tested the model in the context of voluntary continued WWW usage.  Our results support the argument that habit acts as a moderating variable of the relationship between intentions and IS continuance behavior, which may put a boundary condition on the explanatory power of intentions in the context of continued IS usage.

Emotional dissonance is studied as a factor of IT professionals’ work exhaustion, job satisfaction, and turnover intention, modeled as an extension to the work of Moore (2000a).  The results indicate emotional dissonance predicts work exhaustion better than do perceived workload, role conflict, or role ambiguity, constructs which have long been associated with work exhaustion.  Job satisfaction is influenced directly by role ambiguity and work exhaustion.  In turn, job satisfaction influences employee turnover intention.

This taxonomy consists of six types of behavioral responses—refusal, misrepresentation, removal, negative word-of-mouth, complaining directly to online companies, and complaining indirectly to third-party organizations—that are classified into three categories:  information provision, private action, and public action.  Our second goal is to develop a nomological model with several salient antecedents—concerns for information privacy, perceived justice, and societal benefits from complaining—of IPPR, and to show how the antecedents differentially affect the six types of IPPR.  The nomological model is tested with data collected from 523 Internet users.  The results indicate that some discernible patterns emerge in the relationships between the antecedents and the three groups of IPPR.  These patterns enable researchers to better understand why a certain type of IPPR is similar to or distinct from other types of IPPR.

Building on previous research on information systems outsourcing, a theoretical framework for exploring the opensourcing phenomenon is derived.  The first phase of the research concerned qualitative case studies involving three commercial organizations (IONA Technologies, Philips Medical Systems, and Telefonica) that had “liberated” what had hitherto been proprietary software and sought to grow a global open source community around their product.  We followed this with a large-scale survey involving additional exemplars of the phenomenon.  The study identifies a number of symmetrical and complementary customer and community obligations that are associated with opensourcing success.  We also identify a number of tension points on which customer and community perceptions tend to vary.  Overall the key watchwords for opensourcing are openness, trust, tact, professionalism, transparency, and complementariness:  The customer and community need to establish a trusted partnership of shared responsibility in building an overall opensourcing ecosystem.  The study reveals an ongoing shift from OSS as a community of individual developers to OSS as a community of commercial organizations, primarily small to medium-sized enterprises.  It also reveals that opensourcing provides ample opportunity for companies to headhunt top developers, hence moving from outsourcing to a largely unknown OSS workforce toward recruitment of developers from a global open source community whose talents have become known as a result of the opensourcing experience.", "ex:volume": "32", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "\"Outsourcing to an Unknown Workforce:  Exploring Opensourcing as a Global Sourcing Strategy", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol32/iss2/11", "ex:date": "2008", "ex:keyword": ["Open source", "opensourcing", "offshoring", "outsourcing", "global software development", "crowdsourcing", "multimethod research"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Par J.

Much  less is known about knowledge transfer problems associated with transformational technologies, which afford the creation, modification, and manipulation of digital artifacts.  Yet, these technologies play a critical role in offshoring by allowing the distribution of work at the task level, what we call task-based offshoring.  For example, computer-aided engineering applications transform input like physical dimensions, location coordinates, and material properties into computational models that can be shared electronically among engineers around the world as they work together on analysis tasks. Digital artifacts created via transformational technologies often embody implicit knowledge that must be correctly interpreted to successfully act upon the artifacts.  To explore what problems might arise in interpreting this implicit knowledge across time and space, and how individuals might remedy these problems, we studied a firm that sent engineering tasks from home sites in Mexico and the United States to an offshore site in India.  Despite having proper formal education and ample tool skills, the Indian engineers had difficulty interpreting the implicit knowledge embodied in artifacts sent to them from Mexico and the United States.  To resolve and prevent the problems that subsequently arose, individuals from the home sites developed five new work practices to transfer occupational knowledge to the offshore site.  The five practices were defining requirements, monitoring progress, fixing returns, routing tasks strategically, and filtering quality.  The extent to which sending engineers in our study were free from having to enact these new work practices because on-site coordinators acted on their behalf predicted their perceptions of the effectiveness of the offshoring arrangement, but Indian engineers preferred learning from sending engineers, not on-site coordinators.

However, if wage differences are so high, why is there such a high level of variation in the economic success between offshored IS projects?  This study argues that offshore outsourcing involves a number of extra costs for the client organization that account for the economic failure of offshore projects.  The objective is to disaggregate these extra costs into their constituent parts and to explain why they differ between offshored software projects.  The focus is on software development and maintenance projects that are offshored to Indian vendors.  A theoretical framework is developed a priori based on transaction cost economics (TCE) and the knowledge-based view of the firm, complemented by factors that acknowledge the specific offshore context.  The framework is empirically explored using a multiple case study design including six offshored software projects in a large German financial service institution.  The results of our analysis indicate that the client incurs post- contractual extra costs for four types of activities:  (1) requirements specification and design, (2) knowledge transfer, (3) control, and (4) coordination.  In projects that require a high level of client-specific knowledge about idiosyncratic business processes and software systems, these extra costs were found to be substantially higher than in projects where more general knowledge was needed.  Notably, these costs most often arose independently from the threat of opportunistic behavior, challenging the predominant TCE logic of market failure.  Rather, the client extra costs were particularly high in client-specific projects because the effort for managing the consequences of the knowledge asymmetries between client and vendor was particularly high in these projects.  Prior experiences of the vendor with related client projects were found to reduce the level of extra costs but could not fully offset the increase in extra costs in highly client-specific projects.  Moreover, cultural and geographic distance between client and vendor as well as personnel turnover were found to increase client extra costs.  Slight evidence was found, however, that the cost-increasing impact of these factors was also leveraged in projects with a high level of required client-specific knowledge (moderator effect).", "ex:volume": "32", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Explaining Variations in Client Extra Costs Between Software Projects Offshored to India", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol32/iss2/9", "ex:date": "2008", "ex:keyword": ["Offshoring", "outsourcing", "software application services", "transaction cost economics", "knowledge-based view", "absorptive capacity", "cross-cultural study", "asset specificity", "multiple case study"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Jens Dibbern"}, {"ex:name": "Jessica Winkler"}, {"ex:name": "Armin Heinzl"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "In a world that is flat, where all clients and providers can easily transact with one another, offshoring represents the proposition that information technology providers from low-wage nations can now underbid providers from high-wage nations and win contracts.

We analyzed the entire history of transactions at one of the major online programming marketplaces, a marketplace for outsourcing small IT projects.

In a sense, the American clients have a higher preference for offshore providers. Among non-American clients the preference for domestic providers is mitigated when both client and provider are from an English-speaking nation. Relative bid price, often very low already, also determines the winning bid, as does the ratio of purchasing power parity (PPP) between the country of the client and the country of the provider.

We illustrate the conditions under which knowledge transfers during offshoring may reduce a domestic firm’s in-house production costs, leading to total cost savings in both the short term and the long term.  Alternatively, when knowledge transfers are not sufficiently large, some short-lived offshoring projects may generate substantial cost savings to the domestic firm; however, long-lived offshoring projects may cause a disruption in the knowledge supply chain, resulting in substantial losses in the later stages of the project.  A firm that fails to realize the costs associated with such a disruption soon enough in the project life may find itself locked into a disadvantageous offshoring agreement without any recourse.  However, a domestic firm may be able to overcome a disruption in its knowledge supply chain by exploiting the learning-by-doing production knowledge generated by the foreign vendor’s economies of scale.
