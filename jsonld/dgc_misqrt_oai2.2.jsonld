By identifying the lead actors of the initiation, development, and approval stages in IT governance, the patterns of 57 IT investment decisions at 6 hospitals are analyzed.  The results reveal seven IT governance archetypes: (1) top management monarchy, (2) top management–IT duopoly, (3) IT monarchy, (4) administration monarchy, (5) administration– IT duopoly, (6) professional monarchy, and (7) professional– IT duopoly.  Each archetype is analyzed by taking into account four specific factors:  IT investment level, external influence, organizational centralization, and IT function power. This study makes several contributions to IT governance theory and practice.  First, IT governance is reframed to include pre-decision stages, highlighting the importance of participants other than the final decision maker.  Second, the variation of IT governance archetypes suggests that even when top management approval is required, the IT department may not play a key role in the IT investment decision process.  Third, governance of the pre-decision initiation and development stages is found to be jointly affected by several contextual factors, suggesting that the allocation of final decision rights is only a part of IT governance.  While decision rights may be allocated by the organization a priori, the actual patterns of IT governance are contingent on contextual factors.  It is important to understand how IT governance archetypes are shaped because they may affect desired outcomes of IT investments.", "ex:volume": "32", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Information Technology Governance in Information Technology Investment Decision Processes:  The Impact of Investment Characteristics, External Environment, and Internal Context", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol32/iss1/6", "ex:date": "2008", "ex:keyword": ["IT investment", "decision-making process", "IT governance", "centralization", "IT function power", "external environment", "investment characteristics", "monarchy", "duopoly"], "ex:creator": ["Yajiong Xue", "Huigang Liang", "William R.

Fewer DSS studies have integrated decision process variables, such as user beliefs and attitudes, in their models.  In this paper, we examine the mediating role of decision process variables in the use of an online customer DSS.  We do so through an experimental study of an alternative-based and an attribute-based DSS for product customization by online customers.  Using cognitive fit and flow theories, we develop a theoretical model with four mediating decision process variables (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, and perceived control) and two of their antecedents:  interface design (attribute-based versus alternative-based) and task complexity (choice set size).  Our results show that the impact of DSS interface design on behavioral intentions is fully mediated by perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment, although not by perceived control.  Specifically, we verify that users of an attribute-based DSS express higher perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment than users of an alternative-based one.  In addition, we find that task complexity has an interesting relationship with usefulness and enjoyment, both of which follow an inverted U-shaped curve as choice set size increases.  Finally, we find that for users of the alternative-based DSS, perceived ease of use and perceived control decrease as task complexity increases.  However, the attribute-based DSS alleviates that decline for both variables.  Among other contributions, our results indicate the importance of including decision process variables when studying DSS as well as the complex effect of task complexity on those variables.

Our analysis reveals that the most critical dimension for practice is the importance of the research to the needs of practice.  The solution we propose to address that need is to conduct an applicability check on the research objects of interest.

Many EUS studies in the past have attempted to identify the antecedents of EUS, yet most of the relationships found have been criticized for their lack of a strong theoretical underpinning.  Today it is generally understood that IS failure is due to psychological and organizational issues rather than technological issues, hence individual differences must be addressed.  This study proposes a new model with an objective to extend our understanding of the antecedents of EUS by incorporating three well-founded theories of motivation, namely expectation theory, needs theory, and equity theory.  The uniqueness of the model not only recognizes the three different needs (i.e., work performance, relatedness, and self-development) that users may have with IS use, but also the corresponding inputs required from each individual to achieve those needs fulfillments, which have been ignored in most previous studies.  This input/needs fulfillment ratio, referred to as equitable needs fulfillment, is likely to vary from one individual to another and satisfaction will only result in a user if the needs being fulfilled are perceived as “worthy” to obtain.The partial least squares (PLS) method of structural equation modeling was used to analyze 922 survey returns collected form the hotel and airline sectors.  The results of the study show that IS end users do have different needs.  Equitable work performance fulfillment and equitable relatedness fulfillment play a significant role in affecting the satisfaction of end users.  The results also indicate that the impact of perceived IS performance expectations on EUS is not as significant as most previous studies have suggested.  The conclusion is that merely focusing on the technical soundness of the IS and the way in which it benefits employees may not be sufficient.

The system was designed by a European consortium led by a Spanish polytechnic in cooperation with two universities in Lima and the Peruvian Ministry of Health.

The central analytical focus of this article is on the interplay between the public health care system, which used the telemedicine system, and local health care practices. The manner in which scientific medicine was delivered through information technology and public health care services is analyzed in terms of the health personnel’s activity, the local population’s conceptions of health, and the trajectories followed by patients seeking recovery. The author participated in the design of the second evaluation of the telemedicine system and acted as a participant observer in the regional hospital and peripheral clinics. In addition to interviewing health care staff from the study area, the author also met with traditional healers and patients in the districts whether or not they were involved in the telemedicine project. New institutional theory provided the analytical framework for the interpretation of the observed behavior of the public health care staff, traditional healers, and potential patients. Empirically, this study describes the informal aspects of the functioning of the telemedicine system, and its partial mismatch with the definitions of health and illness employed by local communities and healers.   An argument is made that people’s construction of their health, which is embedded in their normal patterns of action, should be identified, and then considered in the design, implementation, and evaluation of future telemedicine projects.

Its mission has been to empower managers, IS engineers, and information and communication technology users with knowledge and techniques for effective decision making. However, empirical research frequently encounters human activity that is at odds with the assumed pattern of rational  behavior. Recent work tries to explain behavior in IS and organizational change in terms of social processes rather than as a consideration of rational techniques of professional practice. In this paper, this ambivalence is addressed within the IS field with regard to technical/rational knowledge and practice. We draw from the theoretical work of Michel Foucault on power/knowledge and the aesthetics of existence to argue that the rational techniques of IS practice and the power dynamics of an organization and its social context are closely intertwined, requiring each other to be sustained. Furthermore, we develop a context-specific notion of rationality in IS innovation, through which interested parties judge the value of an innovation for their lives and consequently support or subvert its course.

Road warriors are IT professionals who spend most of their workweek away from home at a client site.  Building on Moore’s (2000) work on turnover intention, this article develops and tests a model that is context-specific to the road warrior situation. The model highlights the effects of work-family conflict and job autonomy, factors especially applicable to the road warrior’s circumstances. Data were gathered from a company in the computer and software services industry.  This study provides empirical evidence for the effects of work-family conflict, perceived work overload, fairness of rewards, and job autonomy on organizational commitment and work exhaustion for road warriors.  The results suggest that work-family conflict is a key source of stress among IT road warriors because they have to juggle family and job duties as they work at distant client sites during the week. These findings suggest that the context of the IT worker matters to turnover intention, and that models that are adaptive to the work context will more effectively predict and explain turnover intention.", "ex:volume": "31", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "ICT Road Warriors:  Balancing Work-Family Conflict, Job Autonomy, and Work Overload to Mitigate Turnover Intentions", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol31/iss1/3", "ex:date": "2007", "ex:keyword": ["Turnover", "turnover intention", "IT personnel", "road warrior", "organizational commitment", "work-family conflict", "work overload", "autonomy", "fairness", "work exhaustion"], "ex:creator": ["Manju K.

We collaborated with a local firm to host the experiment on its website with its real domain name, and the subjects were not informed of the experiment.  Hence, it provided a field observation of the subjects' behavioral responses toward the privacy assurances.  We found that (1) the existence of a privacy statement induced more subjects to disclose their personal information but that of a privacy seal did not; (2) monetary incentive had a positive influence on disclosure; and (3) information request had a negative influence on disclosure.  These results were robust in other specifications that used alternative measures for some of our model variables.

Specifically, this model explains how top management mediates the impact of external institutional pressures on the degree of usage of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. The hypotheses were tested using survey data from companies that have already implemented ERP systems. Results from partial least squares (PLS) analyses suggest that mimetic pressures positively affect top management beliefs, which then positively affects top management participation in the ERP assimilation process. In turn, top management participation is confirmed to positively affect the degree of ERP usage. Results also suggest that coercive pressures positively affect top management participation without the mediation of top management beliefs. Surprisingly, we do not find support for our hypothesis that top management participation mediates the effect of normative pressures on ERP usage—but instead we find that normative pressures directly affect ERP usage. Our findings highlight the important role of top management in mediating the effect of institutional pressures on IT assimilation. We confirm that, institutional pressures, which are known to be important for IT adoption and implementation, also contribute to post-implementation assimilation when the integration processes are prolonged and outcomes are dynamic and uncertain.", "ex:volume": "31", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Assimilation of Enterprise Systems:  The Effect of Institutional Pressures and the Mediating Role of Top Management", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol31/iss1/6", "ex:date": "2007", "ex:keyword": ["Enterprise resource planning", "technology assimilation", "innovation diffusion", "top management", "institutional theory"], "ex:creator": ["Huigang Liang", "Nilesh Saraf", "Qing Hu", "Yajiong Xue"]}]
