Even if uncertainty has been widely touted as the primary barrier to online transactions, the literature has viewed uncertainty as a “background” mediator with insufficient conceptualization and measurement. To better understand the nature of uncertainty and mitigate its potentially harmful effects on B2C e-commerce adoption (especially for important purchases), this study draws upon and extends the principal-agent perspective to identify and propose a set of four antecedents of perceived uncertainty in online buyer-seller relationships – perceived information asymmetry, fears of seller opportunism, information privacy concerns, and information security concerns - which are drawn from the agency problems of adverse selection (hidden information) and moral hazard (hidden action).   To mitigate uncertainty in online exchange relationships, this study builds upon the principal-agent perspective to propose a set of four uncertainty mitigating factors – trust, website informativeness, product diagnosticity, and social presence - that facilitate online exchange relationships by overcoming the agency problems of hidden information and hidden action through the logic of signals and incentives.   The proposed structural model is empirically tested with longitudinal data from 521 consumers for two products (prescription drugs and books) that differ on their level of purchase involvement. The results support our model, delineating the process by which buyers engage in online exchange relationships by mitigating uncertainty.

This study tests empirically whether these mappings are observed in practice. The research site is a large Irish financial services organization with well established IT risk management practices not tied to any real options framework. Our analysis of the risk management plans developed for a broad portfolio of 50 IT investments finds ample empirical support for OBRiM’s risk-option mappings. This shows that IT managers follow the logic of option-based risk management, though purely based on intuition. Unfortunately, reliance on this logic based on intuition alone could lead to suboptimal or counterproductive risk management practices.

We suggest that the form of the multidimensional compatibility construct is best modeled as a multivariate structural model.   Based on their conceptual definitions, we develop operational measures for the four compatibility variables.  We assess the nomological validity of our conceptualization by situating it within the technology acceptance model.

The results show that users were more likely to adhere to recommendation of the KBS when an explanation facility was available. Choice patterns in using explanations indicated that novices used feedforward explanations more than experts did, while experts were more likely than novices to use feedback explanations. Novices also used more declarative knowledge and initial problem solving type explanations, while experts used more procedural knowledge explanations.

We argue that successful EMPs must provide compensatory benefits for sellers in the case of high price transparency and for buyers in the case of low price transparency.  To understand how EMPs could succeed, regardless of price transparency, we examined the relationships among EMP strategy, price transparency, and performance by analyzing all 19 EMPs that compete by selling a broad range of standard electronics components. We found that all EMPs pursuing a low cost strategy had high price transparency and performed poorly. All EMPs that performed well pursued strategies of differentiation, but, interestingly, not all successful EMPs avoided price transparency: Some EMPs succeeded despite enabling high price transparency. We therefore examined two differentiated EMPs in greater depth – one with high price transparency, the other with low price transparency – to show how they achieved strategic alignment of activities and resources and provided compensatory benefits for their customers.", "ex:volume": "30", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Electronic Marketplaces and Price Transparency:  Strategy, Information Technology, and Success", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol30/iss3/9", "ex:date": "2006", "ex:keyword": ["Electronic marketplaces", "Electronic market theory", "Electronic commerce", "Internet", "Price transparency", "Strategic alignment", "Electronic components industry"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Christina Soh"}, {"ex:name": "M.

This capability enables firms to unbundle information flows from physical flows, and to share information with their supply chain partners to create information-based approaches for superior demand planning, for the staging and movement of physical products, and for streamlining voluminous and complex financial work processes.

In professional contexts, opportunism reduced outsourcing and frequency increased outsourcing; in political contexts, bounded rationality fostered outsourcing and frequency dissuaded outsourcing.  However, no institutional moderation was noted for the situational conditions of asset-specificity and uncertainty.  Instead, situational conditions were found to increase the incidence of outsourcing across both contexts.

Prior work is predicated on the belief that higher levels of comprehension are associated with higher levels of performance on modification tasks.  This study provides a more complete understanding of the relationship between software comprehension and modification.  We conceptualize software maintenance as interlinking comprehension and modification, and argue that the relationship between the two is moderated by cognitive fit.  Specifically, cognitive fit exists when the software maintainer’s dominant mental representation of the software and their mental representation of the modification task emphasize the same type of knowledge.  We hypothesize that when cognitive fit exists, greater improvements in comprehension are associated with higher levels of performance on a modification task.  When cognitive fit does not exist, however, the software maintainer’s mental representations of the software and of the modification task do not emphasize the same type of knowledge, which may mean that attention is devoted to comprehension at the expense of modification, resulting in lower performance on the modification task.  In these circumstances, comprehension and modification tasks may interfere with each other, an effect known as dual-task interference.  We therefore hypothesize that performance on a modification task is moderated by the fit between the mental representation of the software and that of the modification task.   We tested our theory by varying cognitive fit to create matched and mis-matched conditions in a single experiment that used IT professionals as subjects.  Our findings support our theory:  cognitive fit moderates the relationship between comprehension and modification.

Building on the resource-based view (RBV) of diversification and the economic theory of complementarities, the study identifies the relatedness and complementarity of IT resources as two major sources of cross-unit IT synergy. It argues that IT relatedness—the use of common IT infrastructure technologies and common IT management processes across business units—creates sub-additive cost synergies, whereas complementarities among IT infrastructure technologies and IT management processes create super-additive value synergies. In a sample of 356 multibusiness Fortune1000 firms, the study finds that sub-additive cost synergies arising from the use of related IT resources or management processes do not have any effects on corporate performance, whereas the super-additive value synergies arising from the use of a complementary set of IT resources and management processes have significant effects on corporate performance. The diversification level of the firm moderates the relationship between IT synergies and corporate performance.

The process is captured through two online consumer behaviors: (1) getting information and (2) purchasing a product from a Web vendor. First, we simultaneously model the association between these two contingent online behaviors and their respective intentions by appealing to consumer behavior theories and the theory of implementation intentions, respectively. Second, following TPB, we derive for each behavior its intention, attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control (PBC). Third, we elicit and test a comprehensive set of salient beliefs for each behavior.   A longitudinal study with online consumers supports the proposed e-commerce adoption model, validating the predictive power of TPB and the proposed conceptualization of PBC as a higher-order factor formed by self-efficacy and controllability.

We offer a framework that articulates both the dynamic approach to IT-dependent strategic advantage currently receiving attention in the literature and the underlying drivers of sustainability. This framework models how and why the characteristics of the IT-dependent strategic initiative enable sustained competitive advantage, and how the determinants of sustainability are developed and strengthened over time. This explanation facilitates the pre-implementation analysis of planned initiatives by innovators, as well as the post-implementation evaluation of existing initiatives so as to identify the basis of their sustainability.  In carrying out this study, we examined the interdisciplinary literature on strategic information systems. Using a structured methodology, we reviewed the titles and abstracts of 648 articles drawn from information systems, strategic management, and marketing literature. We then examined and individually coded a relevant subset of 117 articles. The literature has identified four barriers to erosion of competitive advantage for IT-dependent strategic initiatives and has surfaced the structural determinants of their magnitude. Previous work has also begun to theorize about the process by which these barriers to erosion evolve over time. Our review reveals that significant exploratory research and theoretical development have occurred in this area, but there is a paucity of research providing rigorous tests of theoretical propositions.    Our work makes three principal contributions. First, it formalizes the definition of IT-dependent strategic initiative. Second, it organizes the extant interdisciplinary research around an integrative framework that should prove useful to both research and practice.

We further examined extant models to (1) carry out a preliminary specification of the nature of the relationships between these components and (2) refine our understanding of the multilevel nature of the phenomenon. Using analytic induction, we examined data from three case studies of clinical information systems implementations in hospital settings, focusing on physicians’ resistance behaviors.  The resulting mixed-determinants model suggests that group resistance behaviors vary during implementation. When a system is introduced, users in a group will first assess it in terms of the interplay between its features and individual and/or organizational-level initial conditions.  They then make projections about the consequences of its use. If expected consequences are threatening, resistance behaviors will result. During implementation, should some trigger occur to either modify or activate an initial condition involving the balance of power between the group and other user groups, it will also modify the object of resistance, from system to system significance. If the relevant initial conditions pertain to the power of the resisting group vis-à-vis the system advocates, the object of resistance will also be modified, from system significance to system advocates. Resistance behaviors will follow if threats are perceived from the interaction between the object of resistance and initial conditions. We also found that the bottom-up process by which group resistance behaviors emerge from individual behaviors is not the same in early versus late implementation. In early implementation, the emergence process is one of compilation, described as a combination of independent, individual behaviors.

The elusive link between IT and financial firm performance calls for further research into intermediate organizational variables through which IT may influence firm performance.

In the context of multibusiness firms, the study examines how the IT resources of a firm should be organized and managed to enhance the firm’s KM capability, and whether and how KM capability influences firm performance. The study develops two hypothesizes: (1) IT relatedness of the firm’s business units enhances cross-unit KM capability; (2) KM capability, in turn, leads to superior firm performance. Data from 250 Fortune1000 firms provide empirical support for these hypotheses. IT relatedness of business units enhances the cross-unit KM capability of the firm.

The analysis suggests that while most firms are lagging in their supplier-side initiatives relative to the customer-side, supplier-side digitization has a strong positive impact on customer-side digitization, which, in turn, leads to better financial performance.

In this study, we apply theory from cognitive psychology and adopt the individual, rather than the group, as the unit of analysis.  We present a model of idea generation cognition based on Hintzman’s MINERVA2 global matching model of memory cognition and additional literature from cognitive psychology on cueing and categorization.  Based on this model, we present a technique called cause cueing, which directs subjects’ attention to the causes of the target problem that they themselves have identified, and hypothesize that this will increase the number of ideas that an individual generates.  Also based on the model—and consistent with current views on production blocking—we hypothesize that receiving input from others during brainstorming will reduce the number of ideas that an individual generates.  Following is an EBS-based study that offers an empirical examination of (1) the effects of cueing attention to natural categories (causes) during idea generation and (2) the effects of cueing attention to ad hoc categories, represented by input from others, during idea generation.  A total of 82 subjects were randomly assigned to one of four conditions in a 2 × 2 factorial design ANOVA experiment.  Results indicate strong support for our model of idea generation as memory cognition.  Cueing participant attention to natural self-generated search categories via the cause cueing technique greatly increased the generation of ideas and high quality ideas, whether or not participants were also cued to attend to ad hoc categories (input from others).  Cueing attention to input from others was detrimental to the generation of ideas and the number of high quality ideas, clearly diminishing the positive effects of cueing to natural categories.

Emerging insights suggest that a clan can be informated if the principal can improve the perceived legitimacy of the information (the message), legitimize the technical messenger (customized user interface), legitimize the human messenger (boundary spanners and influential clan members), and facilitate an environment where clan-based discussion, using the information provided by the principal, is incorporated into the process of concertive control.", "ex:volume": "28", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Informating the Clan: Controlling Physicians’ Costs and Outcomes", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol28/iss3/4", "ex:date": "2004", "ex:keyword": ["Action research", "Informating", "Clan", "Control and IT implementation", "It-based performance monitoring", "Agency theory", "Concertive control", "Health care information systems"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Rajiv Kohli"}, {"ex:name": "William J.

In addition to developing a set of design principles and considering their implications for both research and practice, this article also includes a self-assessment of the study by evaluating it according to the criteria for canonical action research.", "ex:volume": "28", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Design Principles for Competence Management Systems: A Synthesis of an Action Research Study", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol28/iss3/6", "ex:date": "2004", "ex:keyword": ["Canonical action research", "Competence management systems", "Core competence", "Design principles", "Hr management", "Prototypes", "Skill-based approach"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Rikard Lindgren"}, {"ex:name": "Ola Henfridsson"}, {"ex:name": "Ulrike Schultze"}]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "While many large businesses start out as a small enterprise, remarkably little is known about how an organization actually changes internally during the periods of growth. Small business growth is known to strain internal communication processes, for example, which likely limits growth opportunities. Information systems are often called upon to remedy such deficiencies. Through a participatory action research project, we investigated the ways in which a small business management team developed an IS-enabled solution to address their growth needs. During the progression of the project, a new outcome of organizational effectiveness, internal transparency, was identified and developed. Adopting a punctuated equilibrium perspective, a theoretical process model is proposed that sheds light on a relationship between internal transparency, small business growth and IS.  The paper concludes with observations that internal transparency may well be a concept that offers significant potential for MIS research as well as a discussion about the applicability and credibility of participatory action research for this project.", "ex:volume": "28", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Small Business Growth and Internal Transparency: The Role of Information Systems", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol28/iss3/7", "ex:date": "2004", "ex:keyword": ["Business growth", "It investment", "Small business", "Internal transparency", "Process models"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Christopher T.

Recognizing the difficulty that a practitioner and a scientific researcher can have in communicating across the world of science and the world of practice, dialogical action research offers, as its centerpiece, reflective one-on-one dialogues between the practitioner and the scientific researcher, taking place periodically in a setting removed from the practitioner’s organization.  The dialogue itself serves as the interface between the world of science, marked by theoria and the scientific attitude, and the world of the practitioner, marked by praxis and the natural attitude of everyday life.  The dialogue attempts to address knowledge heterogeneity, which refers to the different forms that knowledge takes in the world of science and the world of practice, and knowledge contextuality, which refers to the dependence of the meaning of knowledge, such as a scientific theory or professional expertise, on its context.  In successive dialogues, the scientific researcher and the practitioner build a mutual understanding, including an understanding of the organization and its problems.  The scientific researcher, based on one or more of the scientific theories in her discipline, formulates and suggests one or more actions for the practitioner to take in order to solve or remedy a problem in his organization.  Dialogical action research recognizes that the practitioner’s experience, expertise, and tacit knowledge, or praxis, largely shapes how he understands the suggested actions and appropriates them as his own.  Upon returning to his organization, he takes one or more of the suggested actions, depending on his reading of the situation at hand.  The reactions or responses of the problem to the actions or stimuli of the practitioner would embody, in the practitioner’s eyes, success or failure in solving or remedying the problem and, in the scientific researcher’s eyes, evidence confirming or disconfirming the theory on which the action was based.  The scientific researcher may then suggest, based on her theories, additional actions, hence initiating another cycle of action and learning.  To illustrate dialogical action research, this paper reconstructs some dialogues between an information systems researcher and a managing director at a European company called Omega Corporation.", "ex:volume": "28", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Dialogical Action Research at Omega Corporation", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol28/iss3/8", "ex:date": "2004", "ex:keyword": ["Action research", "Qualitative research", "Research methods", "Case studies", "Phenomenology"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Pär Mårtensson"}, {"ex:name": "Allen S.

As we explain, not explicitly addressing this gray area can have negative, although often inadvertent, effects on the innovative nature of IS research; we explore this danger through three pitfalls. We then propose a stance of strategic ambiguity to deal with the gray area. Strategic ambiguity calls for deliberately withholding judgment on the relevance of research in the gray area and acceptance of gray-area research provided it meets the excellence required by professional journals. We believe that strategic ambiguity benefits innovative IS research without harming the essential role of the IT artifact.", "ex:volume": "28", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Operationalizing the Essential Role of the Information Technology Artifact in Information Systems Research: Gray Area, Pitfalls, and the Importance of Strategic Ambiguity", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol28/iss2/2", "ex:date": "2004", "ex:keyword": ["Is discipline", "It artifact", "Gray area", "Strategic ambiguity"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Andrew B.

Much as Sony focused on the quality of the picture on its Beta format, we as IS researchers have focused on the number of ideas generated as the dominant measure of electronic brainstorming effectiveness.  When VHS killed Beta, Sony discovered that image quality was a secondary consideration for most VCR users.  Despite the compelling research on its performance benefits, electronic brainstorming has not yet displaced–or even joined–verbal brainstorming as a widely used idea generation technique.  This paper presents arguments that users may not be primarily concerned with the number of ideas generated when planning a brainstorming session, but rather may equally desire group well being and member support.  We present theoretical arguments and empirical evidence suggesting that electronic brainstorming is not as effective as verbal brainstorming at providing group well being and member support. We believe that these arguments may also apply to other group and individual research areas and may also call for a reevaluation of the technology acceptance model (TAM).  Finally, we suggest further research that may help electronic brainstorming avoid the fate of the Beta format.", "ex:volume": "28", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Beta Versus VHS and the Acceptance of Electronic Brainstorming Technology", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol28/iss1/2", "ex:date": "2004", "ex:keyword": ["Electronic brainstorming", "Group support systems", "Technology acceptance model", "Technology adoption", "Brainstorming", "Idea generation", "Nominal group technique"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Alan R.
