Findings from a study of 10 operational telemedicine projects in health care delivery systems are presented.  The results presented here confirm, extend, and apparently contradict prior studies of interpersonal trust.  Four types of interpersonal trust—calculative, competence, relational, and integrated—are identified and operationalized as a single construct.  We found support for an association between calculative, competence, and relational interpersonal trust and performance.  Our finding of a positive association between integrated interpersonal trust and performance not only yields the strongest support for a relationship between trust and VCR performance but also contradicts prior research.  Our findings indicate that the different types of trust are interrelated in that positive assessments of all three types of trust are necessary if VCRs are to have strongly positive performance.  The study also established that if any one type of trust is negative, then it is very likely that VCR performance will not be positive.  Our findings indicate that integrated types of interpersonal trust are interdependent, and the various patterns of interaction among them are such that they are mutually reinforcing.

These, in turn, enable suppliers to both create value and retain a portion of the value created by the use of these systems in interfirm relationships.   Data from 131 suppliers using an SCMS implemented by one large retailer support hypotheses that relationship-specific intangible investments play a mediating role linking SCMS use to benefits.  Evidence that patterns of IT use are significant determinants of relationship-specific investments in business processes and domain expertise provides a finer-grained explanation of the logic of IT-enabled electronic integration.

In this paper, we examine the theoretical constructs that shape this user concept and contrast these with alternative views that help to reconceptualize the user as a social actor.  Despite pervasive ICT use, social actors are not primarily users of ICTs.  Most people who use ICT applications utilize multiple applications, in various roles, and as part of their efforts to produce goods and services while interacting with a variety of other people, and often in multiple social contexts.  Moreover, the socially thin user construct limits our understanding of information selection, manipulation, communication, and exchange within complex social contexts. Using analyses from a recent study of online information service use, we develop an institutionalist concept of a social actor whose everyday interactions are infused with ICT use. We then encourage a shift from the user concept to a concept of the social actor in IS research.

First, a positive market share to price relationship is identified, offering support for the network externalities hypothesis even though the market examined is based on open standards.  Second, the results suggest that the market under study behaves as a two-sided market in that firms able to capture market share for one product enjoy benefits in terms of both market share and price for the complement.  Third, the positive price benefits of securing consumer mindshare, of supporting dominant standards, and from offering a trial product are demonstrated.  Last, a negative price shock is also identified in the period after a well-known, free-pricing rival has entered the market.

EKPs are organizational activity patterns that exhibit three characteristics in combination:  an emergent process of deliberations with no best structure or sequence; requirements for knowledge that are complex (both general and situational), distributed across people, and evolving dynamically; and an actor set that is unpredictable in terms of job roles or prior knowledge.  Examples of EKPs include basic research, new product development, strategic business planning, and organization design.  EKPs differ qualitatively from semi-structured decision making processes; therefore, they have unique requirements that are not all thoroughly supported by familiar classes of systems, such as executive information systems, expert systems, electronic communication systems, organizational memory systems, or repositories.  Further, the development literature on familiar classes of systems does not provide adequate guidance on how to build systems that support EKPs.  Consequently, EKPs require a new IS design theory, as explicated by Walls et al. (1992).   We created such a theory while designing and deploying a system for the EKP of organization design.  The system was demonstrated through subsequent empirical analysis to be successful in supporting the process.  Abstracting from the experience of building this system, we developed an IS design theory for EKP support systems.  This new IS design theory is an important theoretical contribution, because it both provides guidance to developers and sets an agenda for academic research.  EKP design theory makes the development process more tractable for developers by restricting the range of effective features (or rules for selecting features) and the range of effective development practices to a more manageable set.

Some measures have a narrow focus while others aggregate innovative behaviors across a set of innovations or stages in the assimilation lifecycle.  There appear to be some significant tradeoffs involving aggregation:  more aggregated measures can be more robust and generalizable and can promote stronger predictive validity, while less aggregated measures allow more context-specific investigations and can preserve clearer theoretical interpretations. This article begins with a conceptual analysis that identifies the circumstances when these tradeoffs are most likely to favor aggregated measures.  It is found that aggregation should be favorable when: (1) the researcher's interest is in general innovation or a model that generalizes to a class of innovations, (2) antecedents have effects in the same direction in all assimilation stages, (3) characteristics of organizations can be treated as constant across the innovations in the study, (4) characteristics of innovations can not be treated as constant across organizations in the study, (5) the set of innovations being aggregated includes substitutes or moderate complements, and (6) sources of noise in the measurement of innovation may be present. The article then presents an empirical study using data on the adoption of software process technologies by 608 U.S. based corporations. This study—which had circumstances quite favorable to aggregation— found that aggregating across three innovations within a technology class more than doubled the variance explained compared to single innovation models.  Aggregating across assimilation stages also had a slight positive effect on predictive validity.

However, current technology can affect not only how we communicate but also what we communicate. As a result, the issue for designers of communication support systems has become broader: how should technology be designed to make communication more effective by changing the medium and the attributes of the message itself?  The answer to this question requires a shift from current preoccupations with the medium of communication to a view that assesses the balance between medium and message form.  There is also a need to look more closely at the process of communication in order to identify more precisely any potential areas of computer support.   This paper provides the spadework for a new model of organizational communication, and uses it to review existing research, as well as to suggest directions for future research and development.  Beginning with the crucial aspects of action, relationship, and choice, an integrated model of how people communicate is developed. This model incorporates three basic factors: (1) inputs to the communication process (task, sender-receiver distance, and values and norms of communication with a particular emphasis on inter-cultural communication); (2) a cognitive-affective process of communication; and (3) the communication impact on action and relationship. The glue that bonds these factors together is a set of communication strategies aimed at reducing the complexity of communication.    The model provides a balance between relationship and action, between cognition and affect, and between message and medium. Such a balance has been lacking in previous work, and we believe it reflects a more realistic picture of communication behavior in organizations. A set of propositions generated from the model sets an agenda for studying the communication process as well as its inputs and outputs.

This study analyzes how an inter-organizational virtual team, tasked with creating a highly innovative product over a 10 month period, adapted the use of a collaborative technology and successfully achieved its challenging objectives.  The study of such a virtual team is especially useful for extending our understanding of the adaptation process as virtual teams have more malleable structures than typical organizational units and controlled group experiments. Data were obtained from observations of weekly virtual meetings, electronic log files, interviews, and weekly questionnaires administered to team members.  We found that the team initially experienced significant misalignments among the pre-existing organizational environment, group, and technology structures.  To resolve these misalignments, the team modified the organizational environment and group structures, leaving the technology structure intact.  However, as the team proceeded, a series of events unfolded that caused the team to reevaluate and further modify its structures.  This final set of modifications involved reverting  back to the pre-existing  organizational environment, while new technology and group structures emerged as different from both the pre-existing and the initial ones.  A new model of the adaptation process—one that integrates these findings and those of several previous models—is proposed.", "ex:volume": "24", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Technology Adaptation:  The Case of a Computer-Supported Inter-organizational Virtual Team", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol24/iss4/2", "ex:date": "2000", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Ann Majchrzak", "Ronald E.

This research—the first to simultaneously study these variables—examined subjects who completed a problem involving spatially-referenced information.  The experiment was guided by a research model synthesized from various perspectives, including the theory of cognitive fit, prior research on map reading and interpretation, and research examining subject expertise and experience. The results are largely supportive of the research model and demonstrate that SDSS, an increasingly important class of management decision-making technology, increased the efficiency of users working on more complex problems.  Professionals were found to be more accurate but less efficient than students; however, professionals who used the SDSS were no more accurate than professionals using paper maps. Need for cognition, a construct that focuses on an individual’s willingness to engage in problem solving tasks, was found to be marginally related to accuracy.

The behavior that underlies many runaway systems can best be characterized as “escalation of commitment to a failing course of action.” The objectives of this study were to:  (1) understand the extent to which IS projects are prone to escalate, (2) compare the outcomes of projects that escalate with those that do not, and (3) test whether constructs associated with different theories of escalation can be used to discriminate between projects that escalate and those that do not.  A survey was administered to IS audit and control professionals and, to establish a baseline for comparison, the survey was designed to gather data on projects that did not escalate as well as those that did escalate.   The results of our research suggest that between 30% and 40% of all IS projects exhibit some degree of escalation.  Projects that escalated had project outcomes that were significantly worse in terms of perceived implementation performance and perceived budget/schedule performance, as compared to projects that did not escalate. Using constructs from theories that have been used to explain the escalation phenomenon, we were able to test various logistic regression models for their ability to discriminate between projects that escalate and those that do not.  To construct our models, we explored constructs derived from self-justification theory, prospect theory, agency theory, and approach avoidance theory.  While constructs derived from all four theories were significant in logistic regression models, the completion effect construct derived from approach avoidance theory provided the best classification of projects, correctly classifying over 70% of both escalated and non-escalated projects.", "ex:volume": "24", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Why Software Projects Escalate:  An Empirical Analysis and Test of Four Theoretical Models", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol24/iss4/4", "ex:date": "2000", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Mark Keil", "Joan Mann", "Arun Rai"]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Extant explanations of why users behave in particular ways toward information technologies have tended to focus predominantly on instrumental beliefs as drivers of individual usage intentions.  Prior work in individual psychology, however, suggests that holistic experiences with technology as captured in constructs such as enjoyment and flow are potentially important explanatory variables in technology acceptance theories.  In this paper, we describe a multi-dimensional construct labeled cognitive absorption and defined as a state of deep involvement with software.  Cognitive absorption, theorized as being exhibited through the five dimensions of temporal dissociation, focused immersion, heightened enjoyment, control, and curiosity, is posited to be a proximal antecedent of two important beliefs about technology use: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.  In addition, we propose that the individual traits of playfulness and personal innovativeness are important determinants of cognitive absorption.  Based on the conceptual definition of this construct, operational measures for each dimension are developed.  Using the World Wide Web as the target technology, scale validation indicates that the operational measures have acceptable psychometric properties and confirmatory factor analysis supports the proposed multi-dimensional structure.  Structural equation analysis provides evidence for the theorized nomological net of cognitive absorption.

In such an environment, IT human capital has assumed considerable significance. Insightful IT leaders recognize that the greatest impediments to success are often related to people rather than to information, technology, and systems. What is not quite clear to IT leaders, however, is exactly how to develop and leverage this human capital in support of business needs. The transformation of IT from a back-office support role to a strategic business partner requires new roles and competencies for IT leaders and professionals. Key challenges for IT leaders are to envision these roles and competencies and to develop and implement programs to translate this vision to reality. This paper describes the IT human resource vision that is guiding such a transformation at 3M—a large multi-product, diversified manufacturing firm (1998 sales: $15 billion)—and focuses on the implementation of its leadership initiative. This initiative was instrumental in not only allowing 3M to develop needed skills and behaviors among its IT professionals, it also helped 3M evade an industry-wide recruitment and retention trend. The major conceptual models guiding the leadership initiative as well as implementation details are presented. Challenges encountered on the way and the lessons learned from the journey are discussed. 3M’s experiences provide opportunities for managers in other organizations to develop valuable insights regarding the management of human capital in IT.", "ex:volume": "24", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Aligning the IT Human Resource with Business Vision: The Leadership Initiative at 3M", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol24/iss2/7", "ex:date": "2000", "ex:keyword": ["Information Systems Professionals", "Leadership Development", "Human Resource Strategy", "Managing IT Professionals", "Recruiting and Retaining IT Professionals"], "ex:creator": ["Robert Roepke", "Ritu Agarwal", "Thomas W.
