Yet, it is often claimed that the actual benefits of IT are disappointing at best, and that IT spending has failed to yield significant productivity gains -- hence the productivity paradox. Evidence is fragmented and somewhat mitigated. This paper argues that the current state of empirical research results from a failure to understand the interplay between IT and managerial work. It addresses this issue by analyzing patterns of association between IT usage and the nature of managerial work in different organizational contexts. Fifty-nine semi- structured interviews were conducted with middle line managers in three large companies: a Bank, a Telecommunications company, and a Utility. In addition, daily activities and IT usage were logged. The data indicate that the relationship between the level of IT usage and the nature of managerial work was stronger in the two organizations that were reorienting their strategies (Bank, Telecommunications) than in the one pursuing its existing strategy (Utility). It was also found that the pattern of the relationship between IT usage and the nature of managerial work depended on the kind of strategic reorientation implemented by the firm. For instance, in the Bank, the level of IT usage was associated with the amount of time spent by managers on information-related activities (e.g., reading reports, gathering information) and on disturbance handling activities (e.g., resolving conflicts, managing crises). In the Telecommunications company, IT usage was associated with more time spent on information-related activities and less on negotiation-related activities (e.g., discussions with colleagues on resource sharing, discussions with subordinates on performance standards). This finding suggests that heavy IT users paid greater attention to and spent more time on the roles they performed best with the technology (information-related activities), and may in fact have been embarking on an over-specialization trajectory.", "ex:volume": "22", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Information Technology and the Nature of Managerial Work: From the Productivity Paradox to the Icarus Paradox?", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol22/iss3/3", "ex:date": "1998", "ex:keyword": ["IS evaluation", "IS impacts", "management roles", "organizational strategies", "IS usage"], "ex:creator": ["Alain Pinsonneault", "Suzanne Rivard"]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:volume": "22", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Redesigning Reengineering Through Measurement-Driven Inference", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol22/iss4/4", "ex:date": "1998", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Mark Nissen"]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:volume": "22", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Survey Instruments in Information Systems", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol22/iss4/6", "ex:date": "1998", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Peter Newsted", "Sid Huff", "Malcolm Munro"]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:volume": "22", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Editor's Comments Volume 22 Iss. 3", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol22/iss3/1", "ex:date": "1998", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Bob Zmud"]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "This longitudinal case study examines the use of desktop videoconferencing in one organization.

Being perhaps the first empirical attempt, this exploratory study identifies four information systems( IS) variables related to DRMin a distributed environment. It also seeks to examine the notion of gestalt fit to describe the nature of the relationships among these variables. In addition, the study evaluates whether intemally congruent groups outperform their opposites in realizing DRMs uccess. The results of cluster analysis support the view of gestalt fit by identifying five clusters. The results also suggest that organizations represented by a well-blended configuration of high intersite data dependence, high centralization of IS decisions, high concentration IS resources at the central site, and low DRM-related autonomy granted to local sites appear to realize a greater degree of DRM success than the other groups.

As the outsourcing market continues to grow and as new contracting options emerge, the accumulated experiences of firms offer significant opportunities for learning. This paper builds on a previous collection of data on 61 IT sourcing decisions made in 40 U.S. and U.K. organizations during the period 1991 to 1995. This paper reanalyzed transcribed interviews from 145 participants. Using \"expected cost savings achieved\" as an indicator of success, five best practices were identified in the case companies. First, selective outsourcing decisions had higher success rates than total outsourcing or total insourcing decisions. Second, senior executives and IT managers who made decisions together had higher success rates than either stakeholder group acting alone. Third, organizations that invited both internal and external bids had higher success rates than organizations that merely compared external bids with current IT costs. Fourth, short-term contracts achieved higher success rates than long-term contracts. Fifth, detailed fee-for-service contracts had higher success rates than other types of fee-for-service contracts. The critical elements of three contracting models are described: fee-for-service contracts, strategic alliances/ partnerships, and buying-in of vendor resources. When the practices generated from the case studies are compared with current practices, we begin to understand which practices are proving robust and why new practices emerge. For example, in the participating companies, the rhetoric of a \"partnership\" was misused to describe contracts that are actually fee-for-service contracts. Today, practitioners who understand the inherent conflicts in fixed fee-for-service contracts are demanding what they perceive to be more favorable contracting options, such as flexibly priced contracts, performance-based contracts, and strategic alliances based on shared risks and rewards. This analysis reconciles some of the apparent discrepancies in past findings about the best ways to source IT.", "ex:volume": "22", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "An Empirical Investigation of Information Technology Sourcing Practices: Lessons From Experience", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol22/iss3/6", "ex:date": "1998", "ex:keyword": ["empirical research", "management of computing and IS", "measuring IS success", "contract", "strategic alliances", "outsourcing of IS"], "ex:creator": ["Mary C.
