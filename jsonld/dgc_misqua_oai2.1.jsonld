[{"ex:abstract": "As business and technology environments change at an unprecedented rate, software development agility to respond to changing user requirements has become increasingly critical for software development performance.  Agile software development approaches, which emphasize sense-and-respond, self-organization, cross-functional teams, and continuous adaptation, have been adopted by an increasing number of organizations to improve their software development agility.  However, the agile development literature is largely anecdotal and prescriptive, lacking empirical evidence and theoretical foundation to support the principles and practices of agile development.  Little research has empirically examined the software development agility construct in terms of its dimensions, determinants, and effects on software development performance.  As a result, there is a lack of understanding about how organizations can effectively implement an agile development approach.Using an integrated research approach that combines quantitative and qualitative data analyses, this research opens the black box of agile development by empirically examining the relationships among two dimensions of software development agility (software team response extensiveness and software team response efficiency), two antecedents that can be controlled (team autonomy and team diversity), and three aspects of software development performance (on-time completion, on-budget completion, and software functionality).  Our PLS results of survey responses of 399 software project managers suggest that the relationships among these variables are more complex than what has been perceived by the literature.  The results suggest a tradeoff relationship between response extensiveness and response efficiency.  These two agility dimensions impact software development performance differently:  response efficiency positively affects all of on-time completion, on-budget completion, and software functionality, whereas response extensiveness positively affects only software functionality.  The results also suggest that team autonomy has a positive effect on response efficiency and a negative effect on response extensiveness, and that team diversity has a positive effect on response extensiveness.  We conducted 10 post hoc case studies to qualitatively cross-validate our PLS results and provide rich, additional insights regarding the complex, dynamic interplays between autonomy, diversity, agility, and performance.  The qualitative analysis also provides explanations for both supported and unsupported hypotheses.  We discuss these qualitative analysis results and conclude with the theoretical and practical implications of our research findings for agile development approaches.", "ex:volume": "34", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Toward Agile:  An Integrated Analysis of Quantitative and Qualitative Field Data", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol34/iss1/7", "ex:date": "2010", "ex:keyword": ["Software development agility", "agile software development", "team autonomy", "team diversity", "software development performance", "requirement change", "partial least square", "case study"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Gwanhoo Lee"}, {"ex:name": "Weidong Xia"}]}, {"ex:abstract": "This study explores how team leaders sense the need for technology adaptation intervention in distributed, computer-mediated (“virtual”) teams.

Community learning and organizational learning thus build upon one another in a reciprocal cycle over time, as the stock of interpretations, adoption rationales, implementation strategies, and utilization patterns is expanded and refined.  We advance an overall model of this learning cycle, drawing on two community-level theories (management fashion and organizing vision), both of which complement the dominant emphases of the literature on IT innovation and learning.  Relative to this cycle, we then empirically examine, in particular, the dependence of community learning on organizational learning.  Sampling the public discourse on enterprise resource planning (ERP) over a 14-year period, we explore how different kinds of organizational actors can play different roles, at different times, in contributing different types of knowledge to an innovation’s public discourse.

To offer a more generalized and richer description of the four mechanisms, this study extends IFTU by drawing on the process model of memory in cognitive psychology.  In addition, based on the extended IFTU paradigm, a three-wave panel model is developed that incorporates not only proximal effects but also distal effects of the four mechanisms on post-adoption phenomena.  Three different sets of data (n = 195, 160, and 342, respectively) are used to test the proposed model.  The results of data analysis show that, as expected, the four mechanisms have proximal effects on subsequent evaluations and behavior.  Furthermore, consistent with the memory perspective, the sequential updating and habit mechanisms are found to have distal effects on post-adoption phenomena even after controlling for their proximal effects.  Overall, the findings of this study indicate that the memory perspective offers not only a seamless explanation of the four mechanisms underlying technology use but also yields deeper insights that can be validated only through a three-or-more-wave panel study.

It was expected that human images with facial features would induce a user to perceive the website as more appealing, having warmth or social presence, and as more trustworthy.  In turn, higher levels of image appeal and perceived social presence were predicted to result in trust.  All expected relationships in the model were supported except no direct relationship was found between the human image conditions and trust.

In particular, missing in the explanation of user decision making is the concept of status quo bias, that is, that user resistance can be due to the bias or preference to stay with the current situation.  Motivated thus, this study develops a model to explain user resistance prior to a new IS implementation by integrating the technology acceptance and resistance literatures with the status quo bias perspective.  The results of testing the model in the context of a new enterprise system implementation indicate the central role of switching costs in increasing user resistance.  Further, switching costs also mediate the relationship between other antecedents (colleague opinion and self-efficacy for change) and user resistance.  Additionally, perceived value and organizational support for change are found to reduce user resistance.

As worldwide competition exerts increasing pressure on the IS function of firms to become geographically unbundled, and IS services are dispersed among increasingly distant and unfamiliar locations, the issue of risk emerges as a significant factor in decisions about where to locate offshore facilities.  Drawing from prior research in IS outsourcing/offshoring and theoretical perspectives from international strategy and multinational management, we examine the determinants of risk firms bear in their offshoring decisions.  In particular, the current paper explores firm-level and environment-level “push” factors that drive firms to accept increasingly greater degrees of host country risk.  We predict that firm-level risk outcomes for locating IS offshore facilities will be influenced by prior firm-specific experience, the relative gap between home and host country risk levels, and the overall movement by IS offshore services providers toward increasingly riskier locations. We test these hypotheses on a proprietary data set of more than 850 information technology and software offshoring projects in 55 host countries worldwide during the period 2000 through 2005.  We find that firm-specific experience and the core “risk gap” between home and host country are predictive of companies pursuing progressively riskier locations, but that their effects dissipate as environment-wide experience is incorporated into our model.  Our analysis suggests that broader dynamics in the competitive environment are powerful contributors to the overall observation that IS offshoring is moving to increasingly high-risk locations.  This trend has implications for the management, security, and global integration of information systems.

Although the IS literature on continuing IT use emphasizes the role of habitual behavior that does not require conscious behavioral intention, it does so in a way that largely remains faithful to the theoretical tradition of planned behavior and reasoned action.  However, a close reading of reference literatures on automatic behavior (behavior that is not consciously controlled) and the influences of emotion on behavior suggests that planned behavior and reasoned action may not provide the best theoretical foundation for the study of continuing IT use.

We identify organizational and interpersonal cultural differences as critical success factors in this context.  Using data from a longitudinal field study of 155 offshore IS projects managed by 22 project leaders, we found evidence of a relationship between hypothesized relational factors and two measures of offshore IS project success—namely, project cost overruns and client satisfaction—over and above the effects of project characteristics and agency factors.  Specifically, we found that information exchange, joint problem solving, and trust reduce project cost overruns and improve client satisfaction.  We also found a relationship between cultural differences at the organizational and team level, and offshore IS project success.  The model explained 40 percent and 41 percent of the variance in project cost overruns and client satisfaction, respectively, for projects with a client representative.  For projects with no client representative, the model explained 35 percent and 37 percent of the variance in project cost overruns and client satisfaction, respectively.

Recent theoretical models of trading and sorting in used-good markets provide testable predictions to use to examine the presence of adverse selection and trade patterns in such dynamic markets.  A key aspect of such empirical analyses is to distinguish between product-level uncertainty and seller-level uncertainty, an aspect the extant literature has largely ignored.  Based on a unique, 5-month panel data set of user-generated content on used good quality and seller reputation feedback collected from Amazon, this paper examines trade patterns in online used-good markets across four product categories (PDAs, digital cameras, audio players, and laptops).  Drawing on two different empirical tests and using content analysis to mine the textual feedback of seller reputations, the paper provides evidence that adverse selection continues to exist in online markets.  First, it is shown that after controlling for price and other product, and for seller-related  factors, higher quality goods take a longer time to sell compared to lower quality goods.  Second, this result also holds when the relationship between sellers’ reputation scores and time to sell is examined.  Third, it is shown that price declines are larger for more unreliable products, and that products with higher levels of intrinsic unreliability exhibit a more negative relationship between price decline and volume of used good trade.  Together, our findings suggest that despite the presence of signaling mechanisms such as reputation feedback and product condition disclosures, the information asymmetry problem between buyers and sellers persists in online markets due to both product-based and seller-based information uncertainty.

Three types of decision aids with different decision strategy support capabilities (an additive-compensatory based aid, an elimination-based aid, and a hybrid aid supporting both strategies) are compared in terms of users’ perceptions of strategy restrictiveness, advice quality, and cognitive effort.  These comparisons are grounded on the properties of normativeness and complementarity of decision strategies employed by the aids.  A normative strategy takes into account both the users’ attribute preferences and the relative importance of such preferences, and allows for trade-offs among preferences (e.g., additive–compensatory).  Strategy complementarity indicates support for decision rules based on multiple strategies (e.g., both additive–compensatory and elimination strategies).The experimental results support the validity of the extended effort–accuracy–restrictiveness framework and the effects of strategy normativeness, but not the effects of strategy complementarity.  In addition to the perceptions of cognitive effort and advice quality, perceived strategy restrictiveness exerts a significant influence on consumers’ intentions to use online decision aids.

In this study, we pose the question:  Can individuals be persuaded to change their attitudes and opt-in behavioral intentions toward EHRs, and allow their medical information to be digitized even in the presence of significant privacy concerns?  To investigate this question, we integrate an individual’s concern for information privacy (CFIP) with the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) to examine attitude change and likelihood of opting-in to an EHR system.  We theorize that issue involvement and argument framing interact to influence attitude change, and that concern for information privacy further moderates the effects of these variables.  We also propose that likelihood of adoption is driven by concern for information privacy and attitude.  We test our predictions using an experiment with 366 subjects where we manipulate the framing of the arguments supporting EHRs.  We find that an individual’s CFIP interacts with argument framing and issue involvement to affect attitudes toward the use of EHRs.  In addition, results suggest that attitude toward EHR use and CFIP directly influence opt-in behavioral intentions.

Competing with free is particularly concerning for movie studios, whose content may be more prone to single-use consumption than other industries such as music.  This issue has gained renewed importance recently with the advent of new digital video recording and distribution technologies, and the widespread availability of Internet piracy.We examine competition between “free” and paid video content in two important contexts:  the impact of legitimate free distribution in one channel on sales through paid channels, and the impact of illegitimate free distribution in pirated channels on sales through paid channels.  We do this by studying the impact of movie broadcasts on DVD demand and the impact of piracy availability at the time of broadcast on DVD demand.  Our data include all movies shown on over-the-air and cable television during an eight-month period in 2005–2006.With respect to the impact of movie broadcasts on piracy and sales, we find that movie broadcasts on over-the-air networks result in a significant increase in both DVD sales at Amazon. com and illegal downloads for those movies that are available on BitTorrent at the time of broadcast.  With respect to the impact of piracy on sales, we use the television broadcast as an exogenous demand shock and find that the availability of pirated content at the time of broadcast has no effect on post-broadcast DVD sales gains.Together our results suggest that creative artists can use product differentiation and market segmentation strategies to compete with freely available copies of their content.  Specifically, the post-broadcast increase in DVD sales suggests that giving away content in one channel can stimulate sales in a paid channel if the free content is sufficiently differentiated from its paid counterpart.  Likewise, our finding that the presence of pirated content does not cannibalize sales for the movies in our sample suggests that if free and paid products appeal to separate customer segments, the presence of free products need not harm paid sales.", "ex:volume": "33", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Competing with Free:  The Impact of Movie Broadcasts on DVD Sales and Internet Piracy", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol33/iss2/7", "ex:date": "2009", "ex:keyword": [":  Information goods", "movie broadcasts", "movie promotion", "DVD sales", "movie piracy", "broadcast flag", "consumer surplus"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Michael D.

An individual’s coworkers can be important sources of help in overcoming knowledge barriers constraining use of a complex system, and such interactions with others can determine an employee’s ability to influence eventual system configuration and features.  We incorporate network density (reflecting “get-help” ties for an employee) and network centrality (reflecting “give-help” ties for an employee), drawn from prior social network research, as key predictors of system use.  Further, we conceptualize valued network density and valued network centrality, both of which take into account ties to those with relevant system-related information, knowledge, and resources, and employ them as additional predictors.  We suggest that these constructs together are coping and influencing pathways by which they have an effect on system use.

This paper addresses this particular absence by investigating the impact of environment-based voluntariness on the relationships among the four primary TAM constructs. A meta-analysis of 71 empirical studies provides strong support for the hypotheses that environment-based voluntariness moderates the effects of ease of use and usefulness on behavioral intention, but not the effect of ease of use on usefulness. Moreover, inconsistent with our expectations, environment-based voluntariness does not moderate the effects of ease of use and usefulness on usage. By further analyzing the data set, we suggest this may be because of the relatively small sample size, the presence of other factors, or the inappropriate measurement of usage in previous studies.

An informational cascade occurs when it is optimal for an online user, having observed others’ actions, to follow the adoption decision of the preceding individual without regard to his own information.

With easy availability of information about other users’ choices, the Internet offers an ideal environment for informational cascades.  In this paper, we empirically examine informational cascades in the context of online software adoption.  We find user behavior in adopting software products is consistent with the predictions of the informational cascades literature.  Our results demonstrate that online users’ choices of software products exhibit distinct jumps and drops with changes in download ranking, as predicted by informational cascades theory.  Furthermore, we find that user reviews have no impact on user adoption of the most popular product, while having an increasingly positive impact on the adoption of lower ranking products.  The phenomenon persists after controlling for alternative explanations such as network effects, word-of-mouth effects, and product diffusion.  Our results validate informational cascades as an important driver for decision making on the Internet.

Although a firm’s survival depends much on repeated use, whether or not a firm survives is also influenced by a variety of other behavioral outcomes that include, but are not limited to, word-of-mouth, willingness to pay, and inattentiveness to alternatives.  Whereas post-adoption research has recently paid attention to repeated use, the information systems field still lacks a systematic investiation into other behavioral outcomes that transcend mere usage.  In an attempt to extend the horizons of post-adoption research, we develop and test a model that explains post-adoption behaviors in the context of online services.  First, drawing on a dual model of relationship maintenance in consumer behavior research, we propose a conceptual framework to study and explain online consumer behavior.  In particular, our model predicts that two contrasting mechanisms, that is, dedication and constraint, are the main drivers of post-adoption phenomena (i.e., consumers’ post-adoption reactions to online services—beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors).  We empirically test the proposed dual model through the use of data collected from 510 users of online portals.  The results of structural equation modeling analysis indicate that, as expected, the dedication- and constraint-based mechanisms simultaneously, yet differentially, determine online consumer behavior.

Drawing from cybernetic theory and coping theory, TTAT delineates the avoidance behavior as a dynamic positive feedback loop in which users go through two cognitive processes, threat appraisal and coping appraisal, to decide how to cope with IT threats.  In the threat appraisal, users will perceive an IT threat if they believe that they are susceptible to malicious IT and that the negative consequences are severe.  The threat perception leads to coping appraisal, in which users assess the degree to which the IT threat can be avoided by taking safeguarding measures based on perceived effectiveness and costs of the safeguarding measure and self-efficacy of taking the safeguarding measure.  TTAT posits that users are motivated to avoid malicious IT when they perceive a threat and believe that the threat is avoidable by taking safeguarding measures; if users believe that the threat cannot be fully avoided by taking safeguarding measures, they would engage in emotion-focused coping.

In this paper, we focus on how and why conducting negotiations via computer media can affect this process, especially when negotiators have unequal power.  Our research model is based on theories from the information systems, negotiation, and social psychology literatures.  Via a laboratory experiment, we find that concessions made by the first individual to make an offer (the first mover) were not typically reciprocated by his/her negotiating opponent (the second mover).  Thus, in the context of computer-mediated negotiation, it appears that second movers are, among other things, more likely to violate the well-established norm of reciprocity.  This can result in significant disadvantages for the first mover, independent of power differences between negotiators.  In addition, we find that, contrary to face-to-face negotiations, increased power of one negotiator resulted in his/her having less influence in terms of getting larger concessions from the other negotiator.

Pair programming, a core practice of this methodology, involves two programmers working collaboratively to develop software.  This study examined the efficacy of pair programming by comparing the performance effectiveness and affective responses of collaborating pairs with those of individual programmers treated as nominal pairs.  In a controlled laboratory experiment involving student subjects, proxies for entry level programmers working on entry level tasks, two factors were manipulated:  programming setting (collaborative pair versus individuals) and programming task complexity (high versus low).  Participants who worked in the individual condition were randomly combined into nominal pairs.  The performance and affective responses of the collaborating pairs were then compared with those of the best performers and the second best performers of each nominal pair.  Results indicated that programming pairs performed at the level above the second best performers and at the level of the best performers in each nominal pair.  This relationship was found to be consistent across both levels of task complexity.  Consequently, there was no evidence of an “assembly bonus effect,” where the performance of a collaborating pair exceeds the performance of its best member working alone.  While this finding may appear counterintuitive due to the general perception of two heads being better than one, it is consistent with the findings in small group research.  When affective responses were considered, programming pairs reported higher levels of satisfaction than those of the best and second-best performing members in nominal pairs.

This paper compares these two methods through Monte Carlo simulation.  Our findings demonstrate the conditions under which covariance-based multigroup analysis is more appropriate as well as those under which there either is no difference or the component-based approach is preferable.  In particular, we find that when data are normally distributed, with a small sample size and correlated exogenous variables, the component-based approach is more likely to detect differences between-group than is the covariance-based approach.  Both approaches will consistently detect differences under conditions of normality with large sample sizes.  With non-normally distributed data, neither technique could consistently detect differences across the groups in two of the paths, suggesting that both techniques struggle with the prediction of a highly skewed and kurtotic dependent variable.

These managers understandably ask questions such as:  “Why do investments in IT artifacts often not result in an increase in firm value?” and “What IT artifacts will do so?”  The first is a theory-based, causal-related question.  The second is a design-based, problem-solving question.

Researchers addressing it develop and justify theories that provide deep principled explanations of these phenomena.  Such theories aim to explain what happened, why it happened, and possibly to predict what will happen within a given context.

One is that such use prevents us from exposing the model’s constructs to a robust test of their measure and relationships to each other, termed their nomological validity.  The other is that such use leaves us unsure about whether or not we have selected an efficient way, in terms of survey completion time, to assess these constructs.  Past researchers have used short form scales to address the issue of efficiency, but there are problems that may result from such efforts.  In this study, we address both shortcomings by exploring the use of a semantic differential scale, which we refer to as a fast form, to assess the constructs of TAM.  In this regard, we do three things.  First, we describe how fast form as a scale may be developed.  Second, we conduct a psychometric evaluation of the constructs that are measured by the fast form and examine their relationships.  Third, we assess the efficiency of the fast form by comparing the time required to complete a survey with it to that which is required to complete a survey with Likert scales.  Our results confirm that the constructs that are measured by the fast form are psychometrically equivalent to those that are measured by the Likert scales.  The relationship among these constructs was unchanged, providing strong evidence for nomological validity.

Specifically, the purpose of this study is to explore the role of habit and its antecedents in the context of continued IS usage.Building on previous work in other disciplines, we define habit in the context of IS usage as the extent to which people tend to perform behaviors (use IS) automatically because of learning.  Using recent work on the continued usage of IS (IS continuance), we have developed a model suggesting that continued IS usage is not only a consequence of intention, but also of habit.  In particular, in our research model, we propose IS habit to moderate the influence of intention such that its importance in determining behavior decreases as the behavior in question takes on a more habitual nature.  Integrating past research on habit and IS continuance further, we suggest how antecedents of behavior/behavioral intention as identified by IS continuance research relate to drivers of habitualization.We empirically tested the model in the context of voluntary continued WWW usage.  Our results support the argument that habit acts as a moderating variable of the relationship between intentions and IS continuance behavior, which may put a boundary condition on the explanatory power of intentions in the context of continued IS usage.  The data also support that satisfaction, frequency of past behavior, and comprehensiveness of usage are key to habit formation and thus relevant in the context of IS continuance behavior.

In this study, we develop a model of how three behavioral dimensions associated with transactive memory systems (TMS) in virtual teams—expertise location, task–knowledge coordination, and cognition-based trust—and their impacts on team performance change over time.  Drawing on the data from a study that involves 38 virtual teams of MBA students performing a complex web-based business simulation game over an 8-week period, we found that in the early stage of the project, the frequency and volume of task-oriented communications among team members played an important role in forming expertise location and cognition-based trust.  Once TMS were established, however, task-oriented communication became less important.  Instead, toward the end of the project, task–knowledge coordination emerges as a key construct that influences team performance, mediating the impact of all other constructs.  Our study demonstrates that TMS can be formed even in virtual team environments where interactions take place solely through electronic media, although they take a relatively long time to develop.

The nomological model is tested with data collected from 523 Internet users.  The results indicate that some discernible patterns emerge in the relationships between the antecedents and the three groups of IPPR.

Building on previous research on information systems outsourcing, a theoretical framework for exploring the opensourcing phenomenon is derived.  The first phase of the research concerned qualitative case studies involving three commercial organizations (IONA Technologies, Philips Medical Systems, and Telefonica) that had “liberated” what had hitherto been proprietary software and sought to grow a global open source community around their product.  We followed this with a large-scale survey involving additional exemplars of the phenomenon.  The study identifies a number of symmetrical and complementary customer and community obligations that are associated with opensourcing success.  We also identify a number of tension points on which customer and community perceptions tend to vary.  Overall the key watchwords for opensourcing are openness, trust, tact, professionalism, transparency, and complementariness:  The customer and community need to establish a trusted partnership of shared responsibility in building an overall opensourcing ecosystem.  The study reveals an ongoing shift from OSS as a community of individual developers to OSS as a community of commercial organizations, primarily small to medium-sized enterprises.  It also reveals that opensourcing provides ample opportunity for companies to headhunt top developers, hence moving from outsourcing to a largely unknown OSS workforce toward recruitment of developers from a global open source community whose talents have become known as a result of the opensourcing experience.", "ex:volume": "32", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "\"Outsourcing to an Unknown Workforce:  Exploring Opensourcing as a Global Sourcing Strategy", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol32/iss2/11", "ex:date": "2008", "ex:keyword": ["Open source", "opensourcing", "offshoring", "outsourcing", "global software development", "crowdsourcing", "multimethod research"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Par J.

Much  less is known about knowledge transfer problems associated with transformational technologies, which afford the creation, modification, and manipulation of digital artifacts.  Yet, these technologies play a critical role in offshoring by allowing the distribution of work at the task level, what we call task-based offshoring.  For example, computer-aided engineering applications transform input like physical dimensions, location coordinates, and material properties into computational models that can be shared electronically among engineers around the world as they work together on analysis tasks. Digital artifacts created via transformational technologies often embody implicit knowledge that must be correctly interpreted to successfully act upon the artifacts.  To explore what problems might arise in interpreting this implicit knowledge across time and space, and how individuals might remedy these problems, we studied a firm that sent engineering tasks from home sites in Mexico and the United States to an offshore site in India.  Despite having proper formal education and ample tool skills, the Indian engineers had difficulty interpreting the implicit knowledge embodied in artifacts sent to them from Mexico and the United States.  To resolve and prevent the problems that subsequently arose, individuals from the home sites developed five new work practices to transfer occupational knowledge to the offshore site.  The five practices were defining requirements, monitoring progress, fixing returns, routing tasks strategically, and filtering quality.  The extent to which sending engineers in our study were free from having to enact these new work practices because on-site coordinators acted on their behalf predicted their perceptions of the effectiveness of the offshoring arrangement, but Indian engineers preferred learning from sending engineers, not on-site coordinators.

However, if wage differences are so high, why is there such a high level of variation in the economic success between offshored IS projects?  This study argues that offshore outsourcing involves a number of extra costs for the client organization that account for the economic failure of offshore projects.  The objective is to disaggregate these extra costs into their constituent parts and to explain why they differ between offshored software projects.  The focus is on software development and maintenance projects that are offshored to Indian vendors.  A theoretical framework is developed a priori based on transaction cost economics (TCE) and the knowledge-based view of the firm, complemented by factors that acknowledge the specific offshore context.  The framework is empirically explored using a multiple case study design including six offshored software projects in a large German financial service institution.  The results of our analysis indicate that the client incurs post- contractual extra costs for four types of activities:  (1) requirements specification and design, (2) knowledge transfer, (3) control, and (4) coordination.  In projects that require a high level of client-specific knowledge about idiosyncratic business processes and software systems, these extra costs were found to be substantially higher than in projects where more general knowledge was needed.  Notably, these costs most often arose independently from the threat of opportunistic behavior, challenging the predominant TCE logic of market failure.  Rather, the client extra costs were particularly high in client-specific projects because the effort for managing the consequences of the knowledge asymmetries between client and vendor was particularly high in these projects.  Prior experiences of the vendor with related client projects were found to reduce the level of extra costs but could not fully offset the increase in extra costs in highly client-specific projects.  Moreover, cultural and geographic distance between client and vendor as well as personnel turnover were found to increase client extra costs.  Slight evidence was found, however, that the cost-increasing impact of these factors was also leveraged in projects with a high level of required client-specific knowledge (moderator effect).", "ex:volume": "32", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Explaining Variations in Client Extra Costs Between Software Projects Offshored to India", "ex:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol32/iss2/9", "ex:date": "2008", "ex:keyword": ["Offshoring", "outsourcing", "software application services", "transaction cost economics", "knowledge-based view", "absorptive capacity", "cross-cultural study", "asset specificity", "multiple case study"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Jens Dibbern"}, {"ex:name": "Jessica Winkler"}, {"ex:name": "Armin Heinzl"}]}, {"ex:abstract": "In a world that is flat, where all clients and providers can easily transact with one another, offshoring represents the proposition that information technology providers from low-wage nations can now underbid providers from high-wage nations and win contracts.  We examined a particularly flat “world”—an online programming marketplace—and found that this profound tilt to low-wage nations is overstated. We analyzed the entire history of transactions at one of the major online programming marketplaces, a marketplace for outsourcing small IT projects.  The data spanned 38 months and included over 263,000 bids by over 31,000 providers from 70 countries on over 20,000 small IT projects requested by over 7,900 clients from 59 countries.Contrary to the world-is-flat proposition, the data in this particular site show some client preference for domestic providers.  However, the largest group of clients, the American clients, are a marked exception to clients in the rest of the world:  they give relatively less preference to domestic providers. In a sense, the American clients have a higher preference for offshore providers. Among non-American clients the preference for domestic providers is mitigated when both client and provider are from an English-speaking nation. Relative bid price, often very low already, also determines the winning bid, as does the ratio of purchasing power parity (PPP) between the country of the client and the country of the provider. Nonetheless, the strongest determinant of the winning bid is client loyalty: the client gives very strong preference to a provider with whom there has been a previous relationship, regardless of whether the provider is offshore or domestic.", "ex:volume": "32", "ex:source": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "ex:title": "Is the World Really Flat?

As part of these companies, the Irish sites act as a bridge in their offshoring arrangements:  While the U.S. sites offshore work to Ireland, the Irish sites offshore work further to India and, hence, have experience of being both customer and vendor in two-stage offshore sourcing relationships. Using a framework derived from relational exchange theory (RET), we conducted multiple case study research to investigate and develop an initial theoretical model of the implementation of this two-stage offshoring bridge model.  Our study shows that while both companies act as bridges in two-stage offshoring arrangements, their approaches differ in relation to (1) team integration, (2) organizational level implementation, and (3) site hierarchy.  Although, there are opportunities afforded by the bridge model at present, the extent to which these opportunities will be viable into the future is open to question.  As revealed in our study, temporal location seems to favor a bridge location such as Ireland, certainly with United States–Asian partners.  However, location alone will not be enough to maintain position in future two-stage offshoring arrangements.  Furthermore, our research supports the view that offshoring tends to progress through a staged sequence of progressively lower cost destinations.

Specifically, we model a domestic firm’s use of a selective offshore strategy (i.e., offshoring only a portion of its information technology activities) to exploit, through IT investments or contractual provisions, the foreign vendor’s large, scale-driven repository of production knowledge.  We illustrate the conditions under which knowledge transfers during offshoring may reduce a domestic firm’s in-house production costs, leading to total cost savings in both the short term and the long term.  Alternatively, when knowledge transfers are not sufficiently large, some short-lived offshoring projects may generate substantial cost savings to the domestic firm; however, long-lived offshoring projects may cause a disruption in the knowledge supply chain, resulting in substantial losses in the later stages of the project.  A firm that fails to realize the costs associated with such a disruption soon enough in the project life may find itself locked into a disadvantageous offshoring agreement without any recourse.  However, a domestic firm may be able to overcome a disruption in its knowledge supply chain by exploiting the learning-by-doing production knowledge generated by the foreign vendor’s economies of scale.

This allows them to make sense of their tasks and their environment, and it increases the likelihood that congruent and actionable understandings emerge.
