Empirical results suggest that successful competitors' use of franchising explains variance in the focal chain's use of franchising beyond what is explained by the importance of local managerial inputs and the threat of franchisee opportunism.

Although we agree that the nexus of entrepreneur and opportunity is one that requires understanding within the context of social structure and the individual agency. Our view of structure differs substantially from Giddens and by implication Sarason et al. (2006). We discuss the implications. Second, since strata in social reality have different ontologies we propose it follows that they are viewed as a dualism. Third, agents have causal power, and ultimate concerns which they try to fallibly to put into practice. We propose entrepreneurship as the study of the interplay between the structures of a society and the agents within it, the implications of fallibility is made explicit. Finally, we take issue with Sarason et al.'s argument for an interpretist epistemology.

This theoretical study considers an entrepreneur seeking early-stage financing from either a specialist or a generalist investor in the context of stage financing. It is assumed that an early-stage specialist is less efficient in assisting a venture beyond the early-stage round than a generalist. This leads to the following tradeoff: by initially selecting an early-stage specialist, the entrepreneur benefits from increased investor incentives in the first round. Such incentives generate additional value for the entrepreneurial venture, improving valuation in the interim round and thereby mitigating the risk of dilution against follow-up investors and potentially even of premature discontinuation of the project. However, early-stage specialists are more reluctant to finance later rounds. Conversely, using a generalist secures efficient follow-up funding but also leads to weaker investor incentives in the early stage. With this tradeoff, the presence of asymmetric information about the quality of entrepreneurial projects particularly affects generalists; entrepreneurs with strong projects more often choose specialists, while entrepreneurs with weak projects select generalists to secure efficient continuation. The use of convertible securities or adjustment warrants in contracts cannot always eliminate the effect of asymmetric information.

Optimal allocation turns out to be a function of both personal and external factors that condition the relevant payoffs and such factors can be empirically observed.

We then account for the institutional logics that characterize different new venture audience groups, and use this as a basis for uncovering how and why the legitimacy criteria for a new technology venture may vary depending on the audience. We then consider how leaders of entrepreneurial ventures may use framing as a means to manage legitimacy judgments across various audiences, and thereby improve their chances of accessing critical financial resources for venture survival and growth.", "ex:keywords": ["Entrepreneurship; New ventures; Legitimacy; Resource acquisition; Institutional logics;"], "ex:source": "Journal of Business Venturing", "ex:title": "Legitimate to whom?

Doing so, we utilize a sequential decision-judgment perspective to uniquely theorize that entrepreneurs' mental representations qualified by doubt carry over from initial entrepreneurial inaction decisions to consequentially impact assessments of opportunities that follow. Using two multi-stage scenario experiments where 244 founder entrepreneurs made a total of 690 sequential opportunity decisions, we find that initial inaction decisions negatively affect entrepreneurs' likelihood of subsequent action judgments. However, this effect is mitigated when entrepreneurs perceive subsequent opportunities as dissimilar, rather than similar. In that way, the initial inaction decision reduces assessments of the likelihood of subsequent action, but opportunity characteristics, such as dissimilarity, can spur entrepreneurs back toward action.", "ex:keywords": [""], "ex:source": "Journal of Business Venturing", "ex:title": "Past as prologue: Entrepreneurial inaction decisions and subsequent action judgments", "ex:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883902616301872", "ex:pages": "107-127", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "32", "ex:template": "Template-type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2017", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Wood, Matthew S."}, {"ex:name": "Williams, David W."}, {"ex:name": "Drover, Will"}]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "This study draws upon affective events theory, research regarding funders' perceptions, and research regarding expectation alignment between products and their presenters to develop and test an indirect effects model of crowdfunding resource allocation decisions. To test our hypothesized relationships, we drew upon a sample of 102 participants who each assessed ten different product pitches made by ten different entrepreneurs. Results from the study indicate that perceived product creativity is positively related to crowdfunding performance, both directly and indirectly, via positive affective reactions of prospective funders. Moreover, we find the indirect effect of product creativity is contingent upon the extent to which funders perceive an entrepreneur to be passionate, such that perceived entrepreneurial passion increases the positive nature of the indirect effect.

Herein, we briefly review this nascent literature, argue that it has so far overlooked alternatives in favor of an overly planned and instrumental perspective, and consider the implications of incorporating the notion of uncertainty into investigations of how entrepreneurs engage in networking. We therefore take a novel perspective on entrepreneurial networking and theorize about how entrepreneurs act when desired ties cannot be identified in advance, networking outcomes cannot be predicted, and ongoing social interactions fuel the emergence of new objectives. Overall, we add important insights to the literature, as we flesh out a dynamic networking process that unfolds alongside efforts to create a new venture.
