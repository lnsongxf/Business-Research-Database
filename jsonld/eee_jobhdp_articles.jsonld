Finally, we show that people are willing to work harder when they experience more comparative optimism in higher control scenarios and when they experience less comparative pessimism in lower control scenarios, illustrating that motivating people to strive harder for positive outcomes can result from exacerbated or attenuated bias, depending on the context (Study 3).", "ex:volume": "108", "ex:source": "Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes", "ex:title": "Biases in social comparisons: Optimism or pessimism?", "ex:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749-5978(08)00056-3", "ex:pages": "39-52", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2009", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Geeta Menon", "Ellie J.

The effect was robust across settings with and without forgone payoffs and when the consequences for risk taking are delayed until the end of the experiment.

While previous findings suggest that feedback makes choices “deviate” from the predictions of prospect theory (Jessup, Bishara, &amp; Busemeyer, 2008), we find a stronger effect: Our results suggest that information from description is neglected in the presence of feedback.

Across two studies using experience sampling methodology, we found that smartphone use for work at night increased depletion the next morning via its effects on sleep. Morning depletion in turn diminished daily work engagement. The indirect effects of smartphone use on depletion and engagement the next day were incremental to the effects of other electronic devices (e.g., computer, tablet, and television use).

Both institutional and psychological measures of equality were associated with greater national team performance. Egalitarian countries also had higher talent levels, which mediated the link between egalitarianism and performance. Furthermore, psychological equality mediated the effects of institutional equality on performance: Countries with greater institutional equality had better performing national teams because they psychologically endorsed egalitarianism. Overall, the findings support a serial mediation model: institutional equality→psychological equality→top talent levels→performance. Importantly, psychological equality at Time 1 predicted the performance of national football teams at Time 2 more than a decade later. All of these effects held when controlling for a host of country-level variables. The forces of equality appear to be a critical driver of talent levels and ultimately performance.

The first study investigated that hypothesis in a natural setting where young adults rated their health behavior and that of their parents. Consistent with our hypothesis, results of a moderated regression analysis showed that for participants high (vs. low) in dispositional NFCC the relation between parents’ and offspring behavior is stronger, implying normative continuity.

In the first study, NFCC was induced by means of environmental noise whereas in the second study it was varied via group composition, consisting of participants with High vs. Low scores on the NFCC Scale. Results of both studies confirmed the hypothesis that cultures under high need for closure show a greater normative stability across generations.

Using two prominent self-theories (self-affirmation, a self-as-object framework) and ego depletion theory (a self-as-subject perspective), we first show how results across disparate literatures in organizational behavior may be accounted for by common underlying mechanisms, and the advances that emerge from recognizing this convergence. We then consider a variety of ways in which insights into organizational behavior may be gleaned from examining the self-as-object and self-as-subject conjointly. Processes associated with the self-as-object and self-as-subject combine interactively to influence employees’ attitudes and behavior, and they also influence one another. Furthermore, considering the two self-processes in tandem shows how: (1) effects that appear to be similar differ meaningfully in the mechanisms accounting for them, and (2) seemingly discrepant results may be reconciled.

We then consider a variety of ways in which insights into organizational behavior may be gleaned from examining the self-as-object and self-as-subject conjointly. Processes associated with the self-as-object and self-as-subject combine interactively to influence employees’ attitudes and behavior, and they also influence one another.

We then explore new developments regarding the interactions between regulatory focus and the psychological experience of being above or below the status quo, and note how this research helps to further distinguish regulatory focus from more general models of approach-avoidance. We then close with a discussion of new research on the relation among regulatory focus, politics, and culture, and between regulatory focus and ethics—both of which may be of special interest to organizational psychologists and decision scientists.", "ex:volume": "136", "ex:source": "Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes", "ex:title": "Securing foundations and advancing frontiers: Prevention and promotion effects on judgment &amp; decision making", "ex:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074959781630231X", "ex:pages": "56-67", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Regulatory focus promotion prevention decision making judgment"], "ex:creator": ["E.

To explain such inaction, management scholars have been developing the area of behavioral ethics and the more specific topic of bounded ethicality—the systematic and predictable ways in which even good people engage in unethical conduct without their own awareness. In this paper, we review research on both bounded ethicality and bounded awareness, and connect the two areas to highlight the challenges of encouraging managers and leaders to notice and act to stop unethical conduct. We close with directions for future research and suggest that noticing unethical behavior should be considered a critical leadership skill.", "ex:volume": "136", "ex:source": "Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes", "ex:title": "Bounded awareness: Implications for ethical decision making", "ex:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597815001181", "ex:pages": "95-105", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Ethics", "Decision making", "Bounded awareness"], "ex:creator": ["Max H.
