The PROSAD system maximizes an advertiser's profit per keyword without the need for human intervention. A closed-form solution for the optimized bid and a newly developed “costs-per-profit” heuristic enable advertisers to submit good bids even when there is significant noise in the data.

Foster's was facing a common management problem: harnessing its portfolio of Beringer California Collection wines to increase profitability, improve its competitive position, and defend against a disruptive new entrant in the U.S. wine market called Yellow Tail. Category Optimizer combines the parsimony of an internal market structure with the advances that have been made in <i>assortment planning in operations research</i>, <i>assortment and stock-keeping-unit--level modeling</i>, <i>mixed logits</i>, and the <i>marketing literature on the perceptions of variety of assortment</i> to develop and estimate a model on readily available store scanner data. The model subsequently uses these results to inform strategic and tactical decision making. This approach led to recommendations that initially seemed counterintuitive; the normal response would be for Foster's to consider lowering prices to maintain share and volume, a strategy not inconsistent with many of the recommendations of past models. However, considering the additional degrees of freedom that a product range offered for defense, we demonstrated that a combination of price increases together with the introduction of a volume-flanker product in a new channel would improve profits, increase revenue, and protect and enhance market share. These were successfully implemented in early 2008, earning rich dividends for the company; increasing profitability by 70%, revenue by 3%, and earnings before interest and taxes by 8.5%; and having a positive impact on its brand ranking.

We show that introducing collusion costs into the discussion has relevant implications. Indeed, sufficiently high collusion costs modify the underlying market structure, thus altering the product differentiation--collusion sustainability relationship with respect to the case where collusion costs are absent or low. In particular, if the gains from collusion are increasing (decreasing) with the degree of product differentiation, the relationship between product differentiation and collusion sustainability is always positive (negative), whereas if the gains from collusion are inverted U-shaped, the relationship is inverted U-shaped too.

By restricting its handsets to one service provider, a handset vendor may be able to induce a rival handset vendor to compete less aggressively.

The interaction between advertising and consumer communications and their joint impact on brand identity is the focal point of this paper. We present a model in which consumer preference for functional attributes may correlate with the identity they desire to project of themselves. This correlation is known to the firm but not to the consumers. Both the firm and the consumers can communicate their desired brand identity, although the actual brand identity is determined endogeneously by the composition of consumers who purchase it (i.e., what types of people consume the brand). We find that sometimes the firm can strengthen the identity of its brand by refraining from advertising. This result is based on the following intermediate finding: advertising can diminish the endogeneous informativeness of consumer communications by making it one-sided. Furthermore, it turns out that refraining from brand image advertising may be optimal for the firm when the product is especially well positioned to create a strong identity---i.e., when consumer preferences for functional and self-expressive attributes are highly correlated.", "ex:volume": "32", "ex:source": "Marketing Science", "ex:title": "Advertising and Consumers' Communications", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.1120.0753", "ex:pages": "294-309", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": ["Advertising", "Communication", "Word of mouth", "Branding", "Brand image"], "ex:creator": ["Dmitri Kuksov", "Ron Shachar", "Kangkang Wang"]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "From 2003 to 2012, the ISMS-MSI Practice Prize/Award competition has documented 25 impactful projects, with associated papers appearing in <i>Marketing Science</i>.

There is no one successful approach, and although some factors are correlated with impactful marketing science models, there are a number of pathways by which a project can add value to its client organization. Simpler, easier-to-use models that offer robust and improved results can have a stronger impact than academically sophisticated models can.

But given that such communications can affect rivals' incentives to develop the same new product, a firm may decide to preannounce untruthfully in order to deter competitors. We examine an incumbent's preannouncement strategy when there is uncertainty regarding the commercial viability of a new product opportunity and a threat of rival entry. Each firm has a private assessment of the market potential for the new product. Two competitive incentives arise for the incumbent in terms of discouraging rival entry: it can use preemptive communication or it can remain silent and instill a pessimistic market potential outlook. We find that an incumbent prefers to follow a <i>vaporware strategy</i>---i.e., declares plans to pursue a new product opportunity even when it may have no development intentions---when its market forecasting capabilities are weak and the demand-side benefits from preannouncing are small. By contrast, when the incumbent has strong market forecasting capabilities and the demand-side benefits are small, the incumbent adopts a <i>suddenware strategy</i>---i.e., remains silent about its new product plans even when it actually plans to develop the new product. Finally, when its market forecasting capabilities are strong and the demand-side benefits are large, the incumbent prefers to engage in a <i>trueware strategy</i>---i.e., truthfully preannounces development plans. We show that an interplay between competition-related and demand-related considerations is what allows trueware to emerge as an equilibrium in the absence of any ex post cost to engaging in vaporware.

Our approach determines which categories are most important to shoppers' store choice decisions and helps determine in which categories the retailer provides superior value. In addition, our approach allows us to understand the impact of the retailer's long-run merchandising policy decisions on the value it provides. Previous store choice research considered the effects of pricing, assortment and other merchandising decisions at the store level but did not focus on the effect of specific categories on store choice. This focus leads us to formulate a model that can (1) measure and explain the differential impact that specific categories have on shoppers' store choice decisions and (2) measure the relative value of retailers' category offerings, partitioning that value into the component resulting from retailer merchandising and the component that is nonmerchandising related. The model form captures differences in category value across stores (i.e., the store's category positioning) by specifying a spatial model for the store choice and category incidence intercepts.

We consider two horizontally differentiated firms where some consumers own the product of one firm and the rest own the other firm's product. One firm upgrades its existing product by adding a new feature. In the absence of any cost or capability constraints, to protect its competitive position, the other firm would prefer to upgrade its product by adding a differentiated new feature. We show that if consumers' preferences are context-dependent and the new feature is of an incremental type, the second mover prefers to imitate the first mover by adding the same feature even when there is no cost disadvantage to differentiate itself. This happens because context-dependent preferences cause consumers to dislike brands that are very differentiated from one another. Thus, if the second mover mimics the first mover, both firms can charge higher prices for their upgraded products (i.e., imitation leads to higher prices). This outcome, in turn, leads the first mover to pick a new feature such that it would induce the second mover to imitate.

Recently, these sectors have witnessed the growing popularity of peer-to-peer Web-based used goods markets as important transaction channels between buyers and sellers. Given that these two issues are critically linked from both supply and demand perspectives, in this paper we study the role that consumer valuation of used products plays in shaping a manufacturer's incentive to offer a returns policy option to a retailer when used goods might be devalued compared to new ones as a result of physical deterioration (or obsolescence). We do so through a two-period dyadic channel framework where the retailer faces uncertain demand for a durable product from a renewable set of customers who are impatient but forward looking. The manufacturer, on the other hand, needs to decide whether or not to offer a returns contract to the retailer. We first characterize the necessary and sufficient condition under which a returns contract is the equilibrium strategy as well as the corresponding channel decisions. Further analysis of this condition reveals that a higher consumer valuation of used products increases the likelihood of a returns contract being the equilibrium strategy. This result seems to be robust except when the potential demands for the two periods are quite deterministic and uncorrelated. However, it contradicts the burgeoning managerial trend to replace returns contracts with price-only ones in sectors where used goods are valued relatively highly by the consumers.

When one firm can mandate a royalty fee from the complementor producer (as often occurs in arrangements between hardware and software makers), we find that the value-capture problem is mitigated to some extent and consumer surplus rises. However, because royalty fees greatly reduce the incentives of the firm paying them to invest in quality, the arrangement exacerbates the value-creation problem and leads to even lower total quality. Surprisingly, this result can reverse with competition. Specifically, when the firm charging the royalty fee faces a vertically differentiated competitor, the value-creation problem is greatly reduced---opening the door for the possibility of a Pareto-improving outcome in which all firms and consumers benefit.

The present work contributes to the existing literature by developing an integrated model of usage and retention in contractual settings. The proposed method fully leverages the interdependencies between these two behaviors even when they occur on different time scales (or “clocks”), as is typically the case in most contractual/subscription-based business settings. We propose a model in which usage and renewal are modeled simultaneously by assuming that both behaviors reflect a common latent variable that evolves over time.

The model is validated using data from an organization in which an annual membership is required to gain the right to buy its products and services. We show that the proposed model outperforms a set of benchmark models on several important dimensions. Furthermore, the model provides several insights that can be useful for managers.

We focus on two important drivers: the NBM's ability to differentiate on the quality dimensions and his cost advantage over the outside supplier of SB. To completely characterize the NBM's response, we consider two regimes. In the first regime, the NBM is a monopolist producer. In the second regime, the retailer has the added option of procuring an SB product from an independent, nonstrategic SB manufacturer.

Furthermore, the firm will increase the effort it devotes to co-creation as the number of potential co-creating customers increases.We show that the profit of a firm facing a centralized pattern of externalities among customers (with an expert, or lead user, in the center) can be higher than its profit when facing a decentralized pattern of externalities among customers and clearly dominates its profit when customers do not have any cross externalities. Thus, we provide a different justification for the use of lead users, one that depends on their network centrality and not on having lower cost, more information, or greater ability than the firm. Because the decentralized pattern has more links than the centralized pattern, our results demonstrate the importance of the pattern of links between customers, and not just their number, in determining the profitability of co-creation.Furthermore, we find that the lead user's externality spillover to other connected users, her neighbors, acts as a force multiplier on the efforts exerted by all participants in equilibrium. Specifically, a higher spillover from the lead user increases the efforts of the firm, the neighbors, and the lead user herself, and this may lead to beneficial outcomes for all.Finally, we show that in co-creation environments, a monopolist firm may benefit by committing to a single price rather than exercising price discrimination.

We achieve this by adopting an attribute-based approach to capture preferences, substitution patterns, and cross-marketing mix effects. To solve the optimization problem, we propose new very large neighborhood search heuristics. We apply our methodology to store-level scanner data on liquid laundry detergent. The optimal assortments are expected to enhance retailer profit considerably (37.3%), and this profit increases even more (to 43.7%) when SKU prices are optimized simultaneously.", "ex:volume": "32", "ex:source": "Marketing Science", "ex:title": "Optimizing Retail Assortments", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2013.0800", "ex:pages": "699-715", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": ["Retail assortments", "Optimization", "Product attributes", "Substitution", "Similarity", "Endogeneity", "Heuristics", "Micromarketing", "Pricing", "Hierarchical bayes", "Gibbs sampling"], "ex:creator": ["Robert P.

Profits can increase for all firms even if the exiting consumers have strong preferences for only one of the products in the market. In shrinking markets, it is reasonable to assume that the people who are likely to exit the market first are people who are “least committed” to the category. In particular, people who are the least satisfied with the existing offers are the most likely to change their behavior by finding an alternative or adopting a new technology. Similarly, in growing markets, consumers who enter the market late are generally the least committed to the category.

We provide a framework to understand the dynamic, long-term effects of bundling on demand. The primary explanation for the profitability of bundling relies on homogenization of consumer valuations for the bundle, allowing the firm to extract more surplus.

We also find that bundles are treated as separate products (distinct from component products) by consumers. Sales of both hardware and software components decrease in the absence of bundling, and consumers who had previously purchased bundles might delay purchases, resulting in lower revenues.

The main objective of this research is twofold. On the one hand, we want to understand, in the context of paid-search advertising, the effects of competition (measured by the number of ads on the paid-search listings) on click volume and the cost per click (CPC) of paid-search ads. On the other hand, we are interested in understanding the determinants of competition, that is, how various demand and supply factors affect the entry probability of firms and, consequently, the total number of entrants for a keyword. We regard each keyword as a market and build an integrative model consisting of three key components: (i) the realized click volume of each entrant as a function of the baseline click volume and the decay factor; (ii) the vector of realized CPCs of those entrants as a function of the decay factor and the order statistics of the value per click at an equilibrium condition; and (iii) the number of entrants, the product of the number of potential entrants multiplied by the entry probability; the entry probability is determined by the expected revenue (a function of expected click volume, CPC, and value per click) and the entry cost at the equilibrium condition of an incomplete information game. The proposed modeling framework entails several econometric challenges. To cope with these challenges, we develop a Bayesian estimation approach to make model inferences. Our proposed model is applied to a data set of 1,597 keywords associated with digital camera/video and their accessories with full information on competition.

The environment sorts these mutations, determining winners and losers. Abundant mutations often cause different market participants to become winners, displacing past winners. Abundant mutations also often cause market growth because the natural selection mechanism leaves more surviving favorable mutations. So one nonobvious falsifiable implication of our theory is that displacement precedes growth and stability precedes decline. Another is that risk taking, diversity of opinions, and experimentation should precede growth.We develop a metric for measuring displacement. Using multiple publicly available data sets (one including sales for top firms for 55 years and another including sales for all automobile models for 25 years), we find that our metric provides a practical way to measure the rate of mutation and confirm our theory's predictions.

In contrast, the impact of attribute advertising and emotion advertising decreases over time. Also, consistent with prior research, we observe that rational messages (i.e., attribute-oriented advertising) wears out a bit faster than emotion-oriented advertising. Moreover, the volume of OWOM does not have a significant impact on sales. This suggests that, in our data, “what people say” is more important than “how much people say.” Next, we find that recommendation OWOM valence is driven primarily by the valence of attribute OWOM when the product is new and driven by the valence of emotion OWOM when the product is more mature.

We propose an automated nonparametric data fusion solution to this problem. The proposed methods are not restricted to specific types of variables and distributions. They require no prior knowledge about how data at hand may behave differently from standard theoretical distributions, and they automate the process of generating suitable distributions that match data, therefore making our methods particularly useful for linking data with complex distributional shapes. In addition, these methods have strong theoretical support; permit highly efficient direct fusion to relate a mixture of continuous, semicontinuous, and discrete variables; and enable nonparametric identification of entire distributions of fusion variables, including higher moments and tail percentiles. These novel and promising features overcome important limitations of existing methods and have the potential to increase fusion effectiveness. We apply the proposed methods to overcome data constraints in a study of counterfeiting. By combining data sets from multiple sources, data fusion provides a feasible approach to studying the relationship between counterfeit purchases and various marketing elements, such as consumers' purchase motivations, behaviors, and attitudes; brand marketing channels; promotions; and advertisements.

Despite the prevalence of packaging constraints on choice, economic models of choice have been slow to deal with their effects on parameter estimates and policy implications. In this paper we propose a general framework for dealing with indivisible demand in economic models of choice, and we show how to estimate model parameters using Bayesian methods.

Using a game theory model with firms of different advertising budgets, we study the phenomenon of poaching, its impact on how firms allocate their advertising budgets to traditional and sponsored search advertising, and the search engine's policy on poaching. We find that, as budget asymmetry increases, the smaller-budget firm poaches more on the keywords of the larger-budget firm. This may induce the larger-budget firm to allocate more of its budget to traditional advertising, which, in turn, hurts the search engine's advertising revenues.

We find that buyers in our data set can be best represented by two latent states of trust toward the seller---a “vigilant” state that is characterized by heightened price sensitivity and a cautious approach to ordering and a “relaxed” state with purchase behaviors that are consistent with high relational trust. The seller's pricing decisions can transition buyers between these two states. An optimal dynamic and targeted pricing strategy based on our model suggests a 52% improvement in profitability compared with the status quo.

Our theoretical framework analyzes market equilibria under competition from counterfeiting as well as under monopoly branding. A key theoretical prediction is that emerging markets can be self-corrective with respect to counterfeiting issues in the following sense: First, counterfeiters can earn positive profits by pooling with authentic brands only when consumers have good faith in the market (i.e., they believe there is low probability that any product is a counterfeit). When the proportion of counterfeits in the market exceeds a cutoff value, brands invest in self-differentiation from the competitive-fringe counterfeiters. Second, to attain a separating equilibrium with counterfeiters, branded incumbents upgrade the searchable quality (e.g., appearance) of their products more and improve the experiential quality (e.g., functionality) less compared with monopoly equilibrium. However, in the pooling equilibrium with sporadic counterfeits, authentic firms instead may invest in experiential quality to attract more of the expert consumers who are well versed in quality. This prediction uncovers the nature of product differentiation in the searchable dimension and helps with analyzing real-world innovation strategies employed by authentic firms in response to entries by counterfeit entities.

Nevertheless, in industries with significant gray marketing, we observe many firms with decentralized decision making. Our study assesses whether decentralized decision making can be optimal when a manufacturer faces gray market distribution. We consider a market where a focal firm competes with an existing competitor that produces a differentiated product and a gray marketer that sources an identical product from a lower-priced foreign market. We find that decentralization is optimal under quantity-based competition, provided the gray market is relatively uncompetitive and the level of competitive intensity between the focal firm and the competitor is high. Decentralization leads a firm to make aggressive production decisions, which leads to lower prices, yet it also leads to higher market share for the firm compared to centralization. When the level of competitive intensity between a firm and its competitor is high, the gain in market share more than offsets the loss due to lower prices. As a result, the focal firm is better off decentralizing its operations independent of (a) whether the competitor operates in the foreign market, and (b) the competitor’s organizational structure. This finding contradicts the belief that centralized decision making is always optimal when authorized manufacturers attempt to limit the negative impact of gray markets.

Top executives invoke these customer-centric beliefs when initiating corporate reorganizations. However, a lack of empirical evidence linking these customer-centric structures to better long-term financial performance raises doubts if corporate structure can truly foster customer centricity and better position a firm to satisfy customers and hence exhibit superior performance. The current research addresses this question by using longitudinal data (1998–2010) that links <i>Fortune</i> 500 firms’ corporate-level structure to performance. Utilizing a dueling mediator model with allowance for endogeneity in a firm’s organizational structure choice, the study reveals that a corporate-level customer-centric structure translates to greater customer satisfaction, but simultaneously adds coordinating costs.

We design two conjoint studies (consistent with simultaneous and sequential decision making) with choices about washing machines and extended warranties, where subjects are given failure probabilities and repair costs. Using stated choice data from the surveys, we can nonparametrically identify product and risk preferences. We find that loss aversion is significantly more important than curvature and probability weights in explaining extended warranty choices. Importantly, failure to decompose risk-averse behavior into that arising from curvature, loss aversion, and probability weighting leads to lower washer prices and profits. These findings are robust to alternate reference point assumptions.

To measure these feedback effects, I develop an econometric framework that considers the simultaneous determination of ethanol-compatible vehicle demand and ethanol fuel supply in local markets.

Under typical market conditions, entry of an additional ethanol fuel retailer leads to a 6% increase in the probability of ethanol-compatible vehicle purchase.

We find a significant increase in customer expenditures attributable to customers joining the firm’s community. While self-selection is a concern with field data, we rule out multiple alternative explanations. Social dollars persist over the time period observed and arose primarily in the online channel. To assess the source of the social dollar, we hypothesize and test whether it is moderated by participation behaviors conceptually linked to common attributes of customer communities. Our results reveal that posters (versus lurkers) of community content and those with more (versus fewer) social ties in the community generated more (fewer) social dollars. We found a null effect for our measure of the informational advantage expected to accrue to products that differentially benefit from content posted by like-minded community members. This overall pattern of results suggests a stronger social than informational source of economic benefits for firm operators of customer communities.

Skimming pricing launches the new product 16% above the market price and subsequently increases the price relative to the market price. Penetration pricing launches the new product 18% below the market price and subsequently lowers the price relative to the market price. Firms exhibit a mix of these pricing paths across their portfolios.

Frustrated with the negative country-of-origin (COO) stereotype imposed on them, many domestic brands from emerging markets follow a variety of approaches to disguise their COO and pretend to be foreign. This paper studies the strategic aspects of this phenomenon. We consider an experience good market where consumers learn about each brand’s quality, using its COO as a prior. Each firm can invest in product quality or COO dissociation; the former generates better quality signals while the latter simply masks the firm’s COO identity. The analysis reveals a few main insights. Sharing a reputation leads to a common good problem where firms free-ride on each other’s quality investments. As a high quality firm dissociates itself from the stereotype, it ceases to contribute to the COO image but also prevents its low quality peers from free-riding on it. This incurs a negative direct effect but a positive strategic effect on the group image. Consequently, a country’s COO image may actually improve when more high quality brands shun their identities and pretend to be foreign. In equilibrium, COO image improves monotonically as firms become more efficient in providing quality. However, the prevalence of COO dissociation may first increase then decrease.

I then use these preferences to solve for a dynamic equilibrium between consumers and the firm. In the context of the online home video market, I find that when the firm is able to commit to holding prices fixed forever, providing content through the purchase market alone is sufficient. However, when the firm is unable to commit, it should serve both purchase and rental markets. Canonical theory models would predict exclusive rentals, but the purchase option enables indirect price discrimination in practice. I also find that when consumers place a premium on accessing new content, they are less likely to intertemporally substitute, thereby increasing the firm’s pricing power.

Recently marketing scholars proposed the construction of efficient heterogeneous designs where different respondents or groups of respondents get different subdesigns, and demonstrated substantial efficiency gain when such heterogeneous designs are employed. A significant hurdle in the widespread adoption of heterogeneous designs is the high computation cost, even when the number of subdesigns contained in the heterogeneous design is restricted to be small. In this paper we propose a new approach for the construction of efficient heterogeneous choice designs. In contrast to extant approaches that are based on an exact design framework where it is computationally prohibitive to do an exhaustive search to find a globally optimal design, our proposed approach is based on the continuous design framework where well-established mathematical theories can be leveraged for quick identification of a globally optimal design. The proposed approach makes it feasible to generate a highly efficient choice design that is completely heterogeneous—a unique subdesign for each individual respondent in the choice experiment. The proposed approach is the first in the marketing literature to find a completely heterogeneous choice design with assured high global design efficiency using the continuous design framework.

The preference for the product has greater heterogeneity in the stranger-network than in the friend-network. We show that when the network is small, observing friends’ actions helps the consumer make more accurate inferences about quality. As the network grows, however, the stranger-network becomes more effective. Underlying these results are two competing effects of network heterogeneity on social learning. These are the <i>individual preference effect</i>, which allows one to make a better quality judgment when the preference element of past actions is more certain, and the <i>social conforming effect</i>, wherein private signals are underused in quality judgment as people follow others’ actions. We find cascading is more likely to occur in the friend-network than in the stranger-network. For a high-quality firm, the stranger-network generates greater sales than the friend-network when the network size is sufficiently large or the private signal is sufficiently accurate.

It relies on rich field data from one of the world’s largest telecom providers who can gauge physical crowdedness in real-time in terms of the number of active mobile users in subway trains. The telecom provider randomly sent targeted mobile ads to individual users, measured purchase rates, and surveyed purchasers and nonpurchasers. Based on a sample of 14,972 mobile phone users, the results suggest that, counterintuitively, commuters in crowded subway trains are about twice as likely to respond to a mobile offer by making a purchase vis-à-vis those in noncrowded trains. On average, the purchase rates measured 2.1% with fewer than two people per square meter, and increased to 4.3% with five people per square meter, after controlling for peak and off-peak times, weekdays and weekends, mobile use behaviors, and randomly sending mobile ads to users. The effects are robust to exploiting sudden variations in crowdedness induced by unanticipated train delays underground and street closures aboveground. Follow-up surveys provide insights into the causal mechanism driving this result. A plausible explanation is mobile immersion: As increased crowding invades one’s physical space, people adaptively turn inwards and become more susceptible to mobile ads. Because crowding is often associated with negative emotions such as anxiety and risk-avoidance, the findings reveal an intriguing, positive aspect of crowding: Mobile ads can be a welcome relief in a crowded subway environment. The findings have economic significance because people living in cities commute 48 minutes each way on average, and global mobile ad spending is projected to exceed $100 billion.

Global regularity refers to the ability of a utility function to satisfy regularity properties required by economic theory in the entire feasible space of variables.

To identify the role of competitive incentives, we study the differential impact of entry based on whether the entrant belongs to the same parent firm as the incumbent theaters.

We estimate the model using a unique data set of customer voices and service interventions on Twitter. We find that redress seeking is a major driver of customer complaints, and although service intervention improves relationships, it also encourages more complaints later. Because of this dual effect, firms are likely to underestimate the returns on service intervention if measured using only voices. Furthermore, we find an “error-correction” effect in certain situations, where customers compliment or complain when others voice the opposite opinions. Finally, we characterize the distinct voicing tendencies in different relationship states, and show that uncovering the underlying relationship states enables effective targeting.

We show that current market turbulence moderates the impacts of advertising assets and R&D assets on expected cash flow from the next period but not on expected cash flows from more distant future periods.

Previous investigations of the efficacy of such initiatives in altering consumption behavior yielded contradictory findings. In this article, we use six years of point-of-sale scanner data for milk from a sample of over 1,700 supermarkets across the United States to investigate the potential of small price incentives for inducing substitution of healthier alternatives. We exploit a pricing pattern particular to milk in the United States, whereby prices in some geographical regions are flat across whole, 2%, 1%, and skim milk; whereas in other regions they are decreasing with the fat content level. The prevailing price structure is determined at a chain and regional level, and is independent of local demand conditions. This exogenous variation in price structure provides a quasi-experimental set-up to analyze the impact of small price differences on substitution across fat content. We use detailed demographics to evaluate price sensitivity and substitution patterns for different socioeconomic groups. Results show that small price differences are highly effective in inducing substitution to lower calorie options. The impact is highest for low-income households who are also most at risk for obesity. Our results suggest that a selective taxation mechanism that lowers the relative prices of healthier options, such that those price changes are reflected in shelf prices at the point-of-purchase, can serve as an effective health policy tool in the efforts to control obesity.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2015.0917\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2015.0917</ext-link>.<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"https://www.informs.org/About-INFORMS/News-Room/Press-Releases/Fat-Tax\"><b>Press Release</b></ext-link>", "ex:volume": "35", "ex:source": "Marketing Science", "ex:title": "Will a Fat Tax Work?", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2015.0917", "ex:pages": "10-26", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Fat tax", "Obesity", "Elasticity", "Milk pricing", "Quasi experiment"], "ex:creator": ["Romana Khan", "Kanishka Misra", "Vishal Singh"]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "When match uncertainty is resolved via costly evaluation, the first product sampled by a customer is more likely to make the sale.

The operational activities associated with participating in an auction, i.e., submitting the bid and the ad copy, customizing bids and ad copies based on various factors (such as the geographical region from which the query originated, the time of day and the season, the characteristics of the searcher), and continuously measuring outcomes, involve considerable effort. We call the costs that arise from such activities <i>keyword management costs</i>. To reduce these costs and increase advertisers’ participation in keyword auctions, search engines offer an opt-in tool called <i>broad match with automatic and flexible bidding</i>, wherein the search engine automatically places bids on behalf of the advertisers and takes over the above activities as well. The bids are based on the search engine’s estimates of the advertisers’ valuations and, therefore, may be less accurate than the bids the advertisers would have turned in themselves. Using a game-theoretic model, we examine the strategic role of keyword management costs, and of broad match, in sponsored search advertising. We show that because these costs inhibit participation by advertisers in keyword auctions, the search engine has to reduce the reserve price, which reduces the search engine’s profits. This motivates the search engine to offer broad match as a tool to reduce keyword management costs. If the accuracy of broad match bids is sufficiently high, advertisers adopt broad match and benefit from the cost reduction, whereas if the accuracy is very low, advertisers do not use it. Interestingly, at moderate levels of bid accuracy, advertisers individually find it attractive to reduce costs by using broad match, but competing advertisers also adopt broad match and the increased competition hurts all advertisers’ profits, thus creating a “prisoner’s dilemma.” When advertisers adopt broad match, search engine profits increase. It therefore seems natural to expect that the search engine will be motivated to improve broad match accuracy.

Specifically, technology adoption is lower when there is greater corruption, but higher when there is better enforcement and auditing. So, firms have a higher productivity gain threshold to adopt computers in corrupt business environments that suffer from patchy and variable enforcement of the tax laws.

This is because stockout recovery reduces channel-wide stockout risks and allows benefits from the reduced risks to be shared between the manufacturer and the retailer, helping alleviate double marginalization.

We present a model of consumer choice that examines trade-offs between substitutable products (theatrical and video forms), the possibility of purchasing both alternatives, a congestion externality affecting consumption at theaters with heterogeneous consumer groups, and a decay in the quality of the content over time. Our model permits a normative study of the impact of shorter release windows (zero–three months) for which there is a scarcity of relevant data. We characterize the market conditions under which a studio makes video release time and price selections indicative of direct-to-video, day-and-date, and delayed video release tactics. During seasons of peak congestion, we establish that day-and-date strategies are optimal for high-quality films with high content durability (i.e., films whose content tends to lead consumers to purchase both alternatives) whereas prices are set to perfectly segment the consumer market for films with low content durability. We find that lower congestion effects provide studios with incentives to delay release and price the video to induce multiple purchasing behavior for films with higher content durability. However, an increase in congestion effects can, in certain cases, actually lead to higher studio profitability. We also show that, at the lower range of quality, an increase in movie quality should often be accompanied by a later video release time.

We find a nonmonotonic (V-shaped) relationship between socioeconomic class and preferences for modern retail; specifically, modern retail spending and relative preference are greater among the upper and lower middle classes, relative to the middle middle class. Upper middle class preference of modern retail is driven by credit card acceptance, shorter store distance (relative to other segments), and higher vehicle ownership; whereas lower prices and low travel costs drive the preferences of the lower middle class. Modern retail is preferred more for branded and less for perishable categories. Interestingly, the lower middle class share of modern grocery retail’s revenues is largest, and this share is projected to grow as prices fall and store density increases.

Our empirical and synthetic studies suggest that the proposed method performs well for product categories equipped with as many as 70 to 100 attribute levels, which is typically considered prohibitive for decompositional preference elicitation methods. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides a natural remedy for a long-standing challenge in adaptive question design by gauging the possibility of response errors on the fly and incorporating the results into the survey design.

The old good that is turned in can either be within the same category as the new good or it may be in a different category. For example, one can turn in an old CD player to count toward a new CD player (a within-category exchange or traditional trade-in) or toward a new television (a cross-category exchange). This paper studies both within-category and multicategory exchange promotions and analyzes their similarities and differences. In a competitive setting with two firms, we model exchange promotions and establish the equilibrium outcomes. We find that categories in which consumers have a high level of waste aversion are more likely to have multicategory exchange promotions rather than within-category or no promotions. Multicategory exchange promotions can increase both consumers’ replacement purchases and their new purchases.

It is a fundamental component of numerous applications in digital marketing. McKinsey & Company view online user profiling as one of the promising opportunities companies should take advantage of to unlock “big data’s” potential. This paper proposes a modeling approach that uncovers individual user profiles from online surfing data and allows online businesses to make profile predictions when limited information is available. The approach is easily parallelized and scales well for processing massive records of user online activity. We demonstrate application of our approach to customer-base analysis and display advertising. Our empirical analysis uncovers easy-to-interpret behavior profiles and describes the distribution of such profiles. Furthermore, it reveals that even for information-rich online firms profile inference that is based solely on their internal data may produce biased results. We find that although search engines cover smaller portions of consumer Web visits than major advertising networks, their data is of higher quality. Thus, even with the smaller information set, search engines can effectively recover consumer behavioral profiles. We also show that temporal limitations imposed on individual-level tracking abilities are likely to have a differential impact across major online businesses, and that our approach is particularly effective for temporally limited data.

If too much information is provided, some of it is not as useful for the purchase decision, the average informativeness per search occasion is too low, and consumers end up choosing not to purchase the product. If too little information is provided, consumers may end up not having sufficient information to decide to purchase the product. The optimal amount of information increases with the consumer’s ex ante valuation of the product, because with greater ex ante valuation by the consumer, the firm wants to offer sufficient information for the consumer to be less likely to run out of information to check. One can also show that there is an intermediate amount of information that maximizes the consumer’s expected utility from the search problem (social welfare under some assumptions). Furthermore, this amount may be smaller than that which maximizes the probability of purchase; that is, the market outcome may lead to information overload with respect to the social welfare optimum. This paper can be seen as providing conditions under which too much information may hurt consumer decision making. Numerical analysis shows also that if consumers can choose to some extent which attributes to search through (but not perfectly), or if the firm can structure the information searched by consumers, the amount of information that maximizes the probability of purchase increases, but is close to the amount of information that maximizes the probability of purchase when the consumer cannot costlessly choose which attributes to search through.", "ex:volume": "35", "ex:source": "Marketing Science", "ex:title": "Too Much Information?

We present descriptive analyses and results from a new structural model, which indicate that earned media is more impactful than paid and owned media per exposure. However, paid media has far more exposures, so for a given percentage increase, paid media’s influence dominates earned and owned media. Earned media operate primarily through enhancing enjoyment, whereas paid media operate through reminding and owned media through reminding, but discourage live viewing. We find that media exposures help consumers learn about how well they will like the program.

In this paper, we build a theoretical model of unorganized and organized retailing in emerging economies by carefully modeling key characteristics of the retailing environment, the retailers, the consumers, and product categories. The primary insight that we obtain is that in a competitive market comprising of only unorganized retailers, the advent of organized retailing injects efficiency into the market leading to a reduction in the number of unorganized retailers. This, in turn, makes the market less competitive. Building on this basic insight, we obtain a number of counterintuitive results. For instance, (i) the presence of organized retailing may increase the prices charged by unorganized retailers; (ii) as the consumers’ transportation cost to the unorganized retailers increases, the market share of the unorganized retailing sector may increase; (iii) as the probability of bulk consumption increases and consumers prefer to purchase more from the organized retailer, prices and profits at the organized retailer may decrease; and (iv) the presence of organized retailing can lead to both consumer and social surplus being lower because consumers face higher prices at unorganized retailers and there is wastage in the economy due to bulk purchasing at organized retailers. Our model offers an explanation for certain surprising empirical observations related to retailing in emerging markets, such as why in the last few years in the Indian market the unorganized retailers who have survived the advent of organized retailing seem to be doing better.

This article extends the recency–frequency paradigm of customer-base analysis by integrating regularity in interpurchase timing in a modeling framework. By definition, regularity implies less variation in timing patterns and thus better predictability. Whereas most stochastic customer behavior models assume a Poisson process of “random” purchase occurrence, allowing for regularity in the purchase timings is beneficial in noncontractual settings because it improves inferences about customers’ latent activity status. This especially applies to those valuable customers who were previously very frequently active but have recently exhibited a longer purchase hiatus. A newly developed generalization of the well-known Pareto/NBD model accounts for varying degrees of regularity across customers by replacing the NBD component with a mixture of gamma distributions (labeled Pareto/GGG). The authors demonstrate the impact of incorporating regularity on forecasting accuracy using an extensive simulation study and a range of empirical applications. Even for mildly regular timing patterns, it is possible to improve customer-level predictions; the stronger the regularity, the greater the gain. Furthermore, the cost in terms of data requirements is marginal because only one additional summary statistic, in addition to recency and frequency, is needed that captures historical transaction timing.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2015.0963\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2015.0963</ext-link>.", "ex:volume": "35", "ex:source": "Marketing Science", "ex:title": "Ticking Away the Moments: Timing Regularity Helps to Better Predict Customer Activity", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2015.0963", "ex:pages": "779-799", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Customer-base analysis", "Customer lifetime value", "Purchase regularity", "Stochastic prediction models", "Noncontractual settings", "Pareto/NBD"], "ex:creator": ["Michael Platzer", "Thomas Reutterer"]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "The marketing and operations disciplines have increasingly accounted for the presence of strategic consumer behavior. Theory suggests that such behavior exists when consumers are able to consider future distribution of prices, and that this behavior exposes firms to intertemporal competition that results with a downward pressure on prices. However, deriving future distribution of prices is not a trivial task. Online decision support tools that provide consumers with information about future distributions of prices can facilitate strategic consumer behavior. This paper studies whether the availability of such information affects transacted prices by conducting an empirical analysis in the context of the airline industry. Studying the effect at the route level, we find significant price reduction effects as such information becomes available for a route, both in fixed-effects and difference-in-differences estimation models. This effect is consistent across the different fare percentiles and amounts to a reduction of approximately 4%–6% in transactions’ prices.

Customers in the treatment group were asked to increase their hotel nights during the 8-month promotion by a set percentage relative to their baseline to receive a reward. Overall, the promotion led to increased purchasing in the post-promotion period. However, only 20% of customers successfully reached the goal whereas 80% missed the goal. We use a propensity score analysis to examine the distinct effects of goal achievement versus goal failure. Results show that goal attainment significantly increased post-promotion purchasing whereas goal failure significantly reduced post-promotion purchasing. Additionally, we use econometric methods to empirically test a behavioral theory of relationship-based reciprocity. We find that customers in a high status tier relationship, with the most invested in the firm, are most affected by goal failure whereas customers in a low status tier relationship, with the least invested in the firm, are most affected by goal success.

First, the data are typically in an unstructured format, such as texts, images, audio, and video. Second, the sheer volume of the data makes standard analysis procedures computationally unworkable. In this study, we combine methods from cloud computing, machine learning, and text mining to illustrate how online platform content, such as Twitter, can be effectively used for forecasting. We conduct our analysis on a significant volume of nearly two billion Tweets and 400 billion Wikipedia pages. Our main findings emphasize that, by contrast to basic surface-level measures such as the volume of or sentiments in Tweets, the information content of Tweets and their timeliness significantly improve forecasting accuracy. Our method endogenously summarizes the information in Tweets. The advantage of our method is that the classification of the Tweets is based on what is in the Tweets rather than preconceived topics that may not be relevant. We also find that, by contrast to Twitter, other online data (e.g., Google Trends, Wikipedia views, IMDB reviews, and Huffington Post news) are very weak predictors of TV show demand because users tweet about TV shows before, during, and after a TV show, whereas Google searches, Wikipedia views, IMDB reviews, and news posts typically lag behind the show.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2015.0972\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2015.0972</ext-link>.", "ex:volume": "35", "ex:source": "Marketing Science", "ex:title": "A Structured Analysis of Unstructured Big Data by Leveraging Cloud Computing", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2015.0972", "ex:pages": "363-388", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Big data", "Cloud computing", "Text mining", "User generated content", "Twitter", "Google Trends"], "ex:creator": ["Xiao Liu", "Param Vir Singh", "Kannan Srinivasan"]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "The proliferation of free trials for high-tech services calls for a careful study of their effectiveness, and the drivers thereof.

Our analysis connects the existence of socially responsible innovations to the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic social responsibility preferences. In addition to deriving economic value from the product, consumers have heterogeneous intrinsic needs to consume products that are socially responsible. They also have extrinsic social comparison preferences that are based on their meetings with others in social interactions. The frequency of these meetings are endogenous to the consumption choices of consumers. A consumer enjoys a social comparison benefit if her consumption decision is more socially responsible than the consumer that she meets in a social interaction and a social comparison cost if it is less socially responsible.The analysis reveals a nonmonotonic effect of social comparison effects on innovation incentives. When the economic value of a product is relatively small, the incentive to innovate decreases as social comparison effects increase. By contrast, when the economic value of a product is sufficiently large, increases in social comparison effects increase the incentive to innovate. Social comparison benefits and costs have different effects on competition between firms. In particular, social comparison benefits soften price competition, whereas social comparison costs tend to exacerbate price competition. We also identify market conditions where a monopoly invests more or less compared to a firm facing competition.", "ex:volume": "35", "ex:source": "Marketing Science", "ex:title": "Social Responsibility and Product Innovation", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2015.0975", "ex:pages": "727-742", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Social responsibility", "R&D strategy", "Innovation", "Sustainability", "Altruism", "Social comparison", "Competitive strategy"], "ex:creator": ["Ganesh Iyer", "David A.

Consumers search extensively, engaging in 14 searches on average prior to purchase. Individual level search is confined to a small part of the attribute space. Early search is highly predictive of the characteristics of the camera eventually purchased. Search paths through the attribute space are state dependent and display “lock-in” as the search unfolds. Finally, the first-time discovery of the chosen alternative usually takes place toward the end of the search sequence.

Moreover, product researchers often evaluate a large number of these attributes (e.g., >50) in applied studies, making standard valuation techniques such as conjoint analysis difficult to implement. Product researchers instead rely on ratings data to assess features for which the respondent has had actual experience. In this paper we develop a method of monetizing rating data to standardize product evaluations among respondents. The adjusted data are shown to increase the accuracy of purchase predictions by about 20% relative to existing methods of scale adjustment, leading to better inference in models using ratings data.

We characterize the equilibrium outcomes under the three sharing formats and investigate the firms’ preferences regarding these formats. It is shown that when the retailer is risk-neutral, both firms are indifferent between voluntary and mandatory sharing. Among the three formats, ex ante, the retailer prefers the no-sharing format whereas the manufacturer prefers the mandatory-sharing format. In addition, we find that a more accurate forecast benefits both firms under voluntary- and mandatory-sharing formats, but may hurt both firms under the no-sharing format. Finally, we show that risk aversion plays a critical role in the firms’ sharing decisions and the impact of forecast accuracy. Specifically, when the retailer is risk-averse, the manufacturer may prefer the no-sharing format over the voluntary-sharing format, and improving forecast accuracy may hurt both firms even under voluntary sharing.", "ex:volume": "35", "ex:source": "Marketing Science", "ex:title": "To Share or Not to Share: Demand Forecast Sharing in a Distribution Channel", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0981", "ex:pages": "800-809", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Information sharing", "Signaling", "Forecast accuracy", "Risk aversion", "Distribution channel"], "ex:creator": ["Baojun Jiang", "Lin Tian", "Yifan Xu", "Fuqiang Zhang"]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Online Display Advertising’s importance as a marketing channel is partially due to its ability to attribute conversions to campaigns. Current industry practice to measure ad effectiveness is to run randomized experiments using placebo ads, assuming external validity for future exposures. We identify two different effects, i.e., a strategic effect of the campaign presence in marketplaces, and a selection effect due to user targeting; these are confounded in current practices. We propose two novel randomized designs to: (1) estimate the overall campaign attribution without placebo ads, (2) disaggregate the campaign presence and ad effects. Using the Potential Outcomes Causal Model, we address the selection effect by estimating the probability of selecting influenceable users. We show the ex-ante value of continuing evaluation to enhance the user selection for ad exposure mid-flight. We analyze two performance-based (CPA) and one Cost-Per-Impression (CPM) campaigns with 20 million users each. We estimate a negative CPM campaign presence effect due to cross product spillovers. Experimental evidence suggests that CPA campaigns incentivize selection of converting users regardless of the ad, up to 96% more than CPM campaigns, thus challenging the standard practice of targeting most likely converting users.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0982\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0982</ext-link>.", "ex:volume": "35", "ex:source": "Marketing Science", "ex:title": "Experimental Designs and Estimation for Online Display Advertising Attribution in Marketplaces", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0982", "ex:pages": "465-483", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Online advertising", "Experimental design", "User targeting", "Field experiments", "Bayesian estimation", "Econometrics"], "ex:creator": ["Joel Barajas", "Ram Akella", "Marius Holtan", "Aaron Flores"]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "In this paper, we propose an automated and scalable garment recommender system using real-time in-store videos that can improve the experiences of garment shoppers and increase product sales. The video-based automated recommender (VAR) system is based on observations that garment shoppers tend to try on garments and evaluate themselves in front of store mirrors. Combining state-of-the-art computer vision techniques with marketing models of consumer preferences, the system automatically identifies shoppers’ preferences based on their reactions and uses that information to make meaningful personalized recommendations. First, the system uses a camera to capture a shopper’s behavior in front of the mirror to make inferences about her preferences based on her facial expressions and the part of the garment she is examining at each time point. Second, the system identifies shoppers with preferences similar to the focal customer from a database of shoppers whose preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions are known. Finally, recommendations are made to the focal customer based on the preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions of these like-minded shoppers. Each of the three steps can be implemented with several variations, and a retailing chain can choose the specific configuration that best serves its purpose. In this paper, we present an empirical test that compares one specific type of VAR system implementation against two alternative, <i>nonautomated</i> personal recommender systems: self-explicated conjoint (SEC) and self-evaluation after try-on (SET). The results show that VAR consistently outperforms SEC and SET. A second empirical study demonstrates the feasibility of VAR in real-time applications. Participants in the second study enjoyed the VAR experience, and almost all of them tried on the recommended garments. VAR should prove to be a valuable tool for both garment retailers and shoppers.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0984\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0984</ext-link>.", "ex:volume": "35", "ex:source": "Marketing Science", "ex:title": "A Video-Based Automated Recommender (VAR) System for Garments", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0984", "ex:pages": "484-510", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Retailing", "Video analysis", "Collaborative filtering"], "ex:creator": ["Shasha Lu", "Li Xiao", "Min Ding"]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "An accurate prediction of what a customer will purchase next is of paramount importance to successful online retailing. In practice, customer purchase history data is readily available to make such predictions, sometimes complemented with customer characteristics. Given the large product assortments maintained by online retailers, scalability of the prediction method is just as important as its accuracy. We study two classes of models that use such data to predict what a customer will buy next, i.e., a novel approach that uses latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and mixtures of Dirichlet-Multinomials (MDM). A key benefit of a model-based approach is the potential to accommodate observed customer heterogeneity through the inclusion of predictor variables. We show that LDA can be extended in this direction while retaining its scalability. We apply the models to purchase data from an online retailer and contrast their predictive performance with that of a collaborative filter and a discrete choice model. Both LDA and MDM outperform the other methods. Moreover, LDA attains performance similar to that of MDM while being far more scalable, rendering it a promising approach to purchase prediction in large product assortments.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0985\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0985</ext-link>.", "ex:volume": "35", "ex:source": "Marketing Science", "ex:title": "Model-Based Purchase Predictions for Large Assortments", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0985", "ex:pages": "389-404", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Model-based predictions", "Large scale purchase prediction", "Scalability", "Purchase history data", "Latent dirichlet allocation", "Mixture of dirichlet-multinomials"], "ex:creator": ["Bruno J.D.
