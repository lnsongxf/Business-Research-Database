[{"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "We study the effects of information content in 59,814 pharmaceutical sales calls on doctors’ prescription decisions for statins, in the face of entry of competing brands and generics, using a hierarchical Bayesian distributed lag model. We conclude that adding information content to the prescription response model improves the in- and out-of-sample performance of the model. In the first six months following generic entry, it is more effective for incumbent brands to detail on drug contraindications and indications, compared to other periods, to positively differentiate from generics. In the first six months following branded entry, it is less effective for incumbent brands to detail on drug indications and costs, given increased competitive clutter. We also document substantial heterogeneity among doctors in their response to information content. Our model is helpful for analysts to more accurately assess the effectiveness of detailing.

This is especially true in countries such as China, which are experiencing a big rush toward e-commerce. The emergence of such platforms gives researchers the unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of such platforms by focusing on the growth of both buyers and sellers. In this research, we build a utility-based model to quantify both cross and direct network effects on Alibaba Group’s Taobao.com, the world’s largest online C2C platform (based in China). Specifically, we investigate the relative contributions of different factors that affect the growth of buyers and sellers on the platform. Our results suggest that the direct network effects do not play a big role in the platform’s growth (we detect a small positive direct network effect on buyer growth and no direct network effect on seller growth). More importantly, we find a significant, large and positive cross-network effect on both sides of the platform. In other words, the installed base of either side of the platform has propelled the growth of the other side (and thus the overall growth). Interestingly, this cross-network effect is asymmetric with the installed base of sellers having a much larger effect on the growth of buyers than vice versa. The growth in the number of buyers is driven primarily by the seller’s installed base and product variety with increasing importance of product variety. The growth in the number of sellers is driven by buyer’s installed base, buyer quality, and product price with increasing importance of buyer quality. We also investigate the nature of these cross-network effects over time. We find that the cross-network effect of sellers on buyers increases and then decreases to reach a stable level. By contrast, the cross-network effect of buyers on sellers is relatively stable. We discuss the policy implications of these findings for C2C platforms in general and Taobao in particular.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0976\">https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0976</ext-link>.", "ex:volume": "35", "ex:source": "Marketing Science", "ex:title": "Quantifying Cross and Direct Network Effects in Online Consumer-to-Consumer Platforms", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0976", "ex:pages": "870-893", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Platforms", "Two-sided markets", "Cross-network effect", "Direct network effect", "e-commerce", "Emerging markets", "China"], "ex:creator": ["Junhong Chu", "Puneet Manchanda"]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "Past research has primarily focused on what happens after a merger.

Anticipated synergy from subindustry similarity, however, is not realized in post-merger innovation. Furthermore, some key synergy sources are unanticipated when selecting a merger partner. For example, financial synergy from higher total assets and complementarity in total assets and debt leverage as well as knowledge synergy from breadth and depth of knowledge positively influence innovation but not partner selection. Furthermore, factors that dilute synergy (e.g., higher debt levels) are unanticipated, and firms merge with firms that detract from their innovation potential.

In this paper, we model the relationship among the advertiser’s bidding decision for keywords, the search engine’s ranking decision for these keywords, and the consumer’s click-through rate and conversion rate on each keyword, and analyze the impact of the attribution strategy on the overall return-on-investment of paid search advertising.We estimate our simultaneous equations model using a six-month panel data of several hundred keywords from an online jewelry retailer. The data comprises a quasi-experiment as the firm changed attribution strategy from last-click to first-click attribution halfway through the data window. Our results show that returns for keyword investments vary significantly under the different attribution strategies. For the focal firm, first-click attribution leads to lower revenue returns and a more pronounced decrease for more specific keywords.

The inferences obtained are then used to examine the effects of visit patterns on purchase dynamics across store visits. Using Internet clickstream data at an online retailer, we find that online store visit patterns tend to be clustered with significant variation across customers in terms of the number and size of visit clusters as well as the visit frequencies, both within and between clusters. Furthermore, the conversion rates vary significantly, depending on store visit patterns, such that they tend to be higher at later visits within a visit cluster, compared with earlier visits. The proposed model thereby offers superior fit and predictive performance than benchmark models that ignore clustered visit patterns and their impact on purchase behavior.

As such, they are often considered exempt from the sort of sample selectivity artifacts widely documented in empirical research, in part because participants are randomly assigned to experimental conditions. To conserve time and resources, experiments often focus on items participants have chosen or are familiar with, for example, postchoice satisfaction ratings, certain free recall tasks, or specifying consideration sets preceding brand choice. When consumer input even partially influences the items about which researchers request subsequent data, the potential for <i>item selectivity</i> arises. In such situations, analyses are contingent on both the choice context(s) of the experiment and the alternatives participants elect to evaluate, potentially leading to substantial item selectivity overall and to differing degrees across conditions. We examine situations in which a nonignorable “choose one of many” (polytomous) selection process limits which items offer up subsequent information, and develop methods to allow substantive results to pertain to the full set of items, not only those selected. The framework is illustrated via two experiments in which participants choose and then evaluate a frequently purchased consumer good as well as data first examined by Ratner et al. [Ratner RK, Kahn BE, Kahneman D (1999) Choosing less-preferred experiences for the sake of variety. <i>J. Consumer Res.</i> 26(1):1–15]. Results indicate substantial item selectivity that, when corrected for, can lead to markedly different interpretations of focal variable effects, such as large effect size changes and even sign reversal. Moreover, failing to flexibly account for item selectivity <i>across experimental conditions</i>, even in well-designed experimental settings, can lead to inaccurate substantive inferences about consumers’ evaluative criteria. We further demonstrate robustness to theoretically driven (but not overtly misspecified) selection rules and provide researchers with a simple, “two-step” exploratory procedure akin to a “control function” approach—involving just one additional variable added to standard models—to determine whether and to what degree item selectivity may be affecting their substantive results.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0991\">https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0991</ext-link>.", "ex:volume": "35", "ex:source": "Marketing Science", "ex:title": "When Random Assignment Is Not Enough: Accounting for Item Selectivity in Experimental Research", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0991", "ex:pages": "976-994", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Choice models", "Consumer behavior", "Decision making", "Econometric models", "Sample selection", "Heckman model", "Markov chain Monte Carlo", "Hierarchical bayes", "Variety seeking", "Assortment size"], "ex:creator": ["Fred M.

We apply the model to conjoint analysis where consumer heterogeneity plays a critical role in determining optimal marketing decisions. Our approach uses a two-stage divide-and-conquer framework, where we first divide the consumer population into segments by recovering a set of candidate segmentations using sparsity modeling, and then use each candidate segmentation to develop a set of individual-level heterogeneity representations.

We build semantic networks where nodes represent word stems in a particular idea generation topic, and edge weights capture the degree of novelty versus familiarity of word stem combinations (i.e., the weight of an edge that connects two word stems measures their scaled co-occurrence in the relevant language). Each idea contains a set of word stems, which form a semantic subnetwork. The edge weight distribution in that subnetwork reflects how the idea balances novelty with familiarity.

The authors introduce a framework of SMC-related spillover effects, and empirically estimate these with a unique data set covering 390 SMCs for products from 192 different cosmetics brands. Multiple spillover effects are found, suggesting that while SMCs can be used primarily to stimulate WOM for a focal product, marketers must also account for brand- and category-level WOM spillover effects. Specifically, seeding increases conversations about that product among nonseed consumers, and, interestingly, decreases WOM about other products from the same brand and about competitors’ products in the same category as the focal product.

For example, airlines bundle high-end first class with ancillary services (e.g., breakfast, entertainment) while hotel chains bundle ancillary services (e.g., breakfast, entertainment) at the low-end. We observe, unlike hotel lines that are highly differentiated at different geographic locations, airlines suffer low core differentiation because all passengers (first-class and economy) are at the same location (i.e., same plane, weather, delays, cancellations, etc.). In general, we find product lines with low core differentiation (e.g., airlines, amusement parks) routinely bundle high-end while product lines with highly differentiated cores (e.g., hotels, restaurants) routinely bundle low-end. High-end bundling makes the high-end more attractive, increasing line differentiation (less intraline competition) while low-end bundling decreases line differentiation. Therefore, bundling allows optimal differentiation given a differentiation constraint (complex costs). Last, firms may use strategic bundling for targeting in their core products; e.g., low-end hotels bundle targeted add-ons unattractive to high-end consumers such as lower-quality breakfasts and slower Internet.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.1004\">https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.1004</ext-link>.", "ex:volume": "36", "ex:source": "Marketing Science", "ex:title": "Product Line Bundling: Why Airlines Bundle High-End While Hotels Bundle Low-End", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.1004", "ex:pages": "124-139", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2017", "ex:keyword": ["Product line", "Strategic bundling", "Analytic model", "Pricing", "Targeted add-ons", "Ancillary services", "Fees"], "ex:creator": ["Steven M.
