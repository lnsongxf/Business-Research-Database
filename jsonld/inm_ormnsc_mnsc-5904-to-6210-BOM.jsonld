This model helps us study mechanism design problems in a dynamic environment. In particular, we consider a supplier's (principal's) problem of eliciting credible forecast information from a manufacturer (agent) when both firms obtain asymmetric demand information for the end product over multiple periods. The supplier uses demand information to better plan for a capacity investment decision. When the supplier postpones building capacity and screening the manufacturer's private information, the supplier and the manufacturer can obtain more information and update their forecasts. This delay, however, may increase (respectively, decrease) the degree of information asymmetry between the two firms, resulting in a higher (respectively, lower) cost of screening. The capacity building cost may also increase because of a tighter deadline for building capacity. Considering all such trade-offs, the supplier has to determine (i) when to stop obtaining new demand information and build capacity, (ii) whether to offer a screening contract to credibly elicit private forecast information or to determine the capacity level without information sharing, (iii) how much capacity to build, and (iv) how to design the overall mechanism so that both firms benefit from this mechanism. This paper provides an answer to these questions. In doing so, we develop a new solution approach for a class of dynamic mechanism design problems.

We propose a new approach to deal with this problem. The proposed method clusters data such that the data points within a group are similar in the nonconfidential attribute values, whereas the confidential attribute values within a group are <i>well distributed</i>. To accomplish this, the clustering method, which is based on a minimum spanning tree (MST) technique, uses two risk-utility trade-off measures in the growing and pruning stages of the MST technique, respectively. As part of our approach we also propose a novel cluster-level microperturbation method for masking data that overcomes a common problem of traditional clustering-based methods for data masking, which is their inability to preserve important statistical properties such as the variance of attributes and the covariance across attributes. We show that the mean vector and the covariance matrix of the masked data generated using the microperturbation method are unbiased estimates of the original mean vector and covariance matrix.

Our results demonstrate that consumer rebates can be particularly useful when a supply chain encounters inefficiencies stemming from strategic inventory buildup by retailers. Wary of high wholesale prices, a retailer may hold excess inventory to convey a lower willingness to pay in future interactions and thereby strategically undercut future wholesale prices. As a retaliatory consequence, the manufacturer sets high near-term wholesale prices. The “pull” promotion from consumer rebates encourages more timely retail sales and in doing so undercuts (but does not eliminate) the retailer's strategic inventories. In other words, the introduction of consumer rebates can serve as an enticement for retailers to sell, not just for consumers to buy.

This setting has previously been considered analytically intractable. By deriving component good prices as exact algebraic functions of the optimal bundle price, I reduce the multiproduct pricing problem to a univariate nonlinear optimization problem in the bundle price. When the two component goods are sufficiently asymmetric in valuations, the optimal solution is partial mixed bundling (one component good is not sold separately), for which I derive exact conditions and optimal prices. An exact analytical solution is also given for mixed bundling of two information goods (component goods with zero marginal costs). For the general case, I derive a closed-form approximation of the optimal bundle price: <i>p<sub>B</sub></i> = 0.5724<i>w</i><sub>1</sub> + 0.5695<i>w</i><sub>2</sub> + 0.3516<i>a</i><sub>1</sub> + 0.4889<i>a</i><sub>2</sub> + 0.0054(<i>a</i><sub>2</sub>/<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>)<i>w</i><sub>1</sub>-0.0201(<i>a</i><sub>2</sub>/<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>)<i>w</i><sub>2</sub>.

These decisions are largely influenced by the patient's prospect for future offers, which can be ascertained most accurately by knowing the entire composition of the waiting list. Under the current transplantation system, however, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), in an effort to strike a balance between privacy and transparency, only publishes an aggregated version of the waiting list. However, it is not clear whether the published information is good enough (compared with perfect information) to help patients make optimal decisions that maximize their individual life expectancies. We provide a novel model of this accept/reject problem from an individual patient's perspective using a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) framework, which incorporates the imperfect waiting list information as published currently into the patient's decision making. We analyze structural properties of this model. In particular, we establish conditions that guarantee a monotone value function and a threshold-type optimal policy with respect to the partially observable rank state that captures the imperfect waiting list information. Furthermore, we develop an improved solution methodology to solve a generic POMDP model. This solution method guarantees, for any fixed grid, the best possible approximation to the optimal value function by solving linear programs to compute the optimal weights used for the approximation. Finally, we compare, in a clinically driven numerical study, the results of this model with those of an existing Markov decision process model that differs from our model in assuming the availability of perfect waiting list information. This comparison allows us to assess the quality of the published imperfect information as measured by a patient's so-called price of privacy (i.e., the opportunity loss in expected life days due to a lack of perfect waiting list information). Previous work estimates a significant loss in a patient's life expectancy, on average, when the patient has no waiting list information compared with full information. In this paper, we find that the currently published partial information is nearly sufficient to eliminate this loss, resulting in a negligible price of privacy and supporting current UNOS practice.<i>This paper was accepted by Assaf Zeevi, stochastic models and simulation.</i>", "ex:volume": "59", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Alleviating the Patient's Price of Privacy Through a Partially Observable Waiting List", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1671", "ex:pages": "1836-1854", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": ["Dynamic programming", "Partially and completely observable markov decision process models", "Medical decision making", "Liver transplantation", "Value of information"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Burhaneddin Sandıkçı", "ex:email": "burhan@chicagobooth.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Lisa M.

The objective of this paper is to investigate the strength of preference for such customized distributions and to draw conclusions about the demand for personalized investment products. In two experimental studies, 256 participants could adjust the return distribution of an initially chosen B&H investment by using an interactive software program. Our main finding is that most investors make extensive use of the customization option and many are willing to pay a substantial fee for this additional flexibility. We further find that the willingness to pay for customization is lower if the fee is integrated into the display of the return distribution, making its impact on final returns more obvious. We also observe that investors can be clustered into distinct subgroups via their adjustment patterns, but individually elicited prospect theory parameters are barely able to explain and predict these adjustments. As a robustness check, we also survey real investors at an investors fair to compare their preferences with those of our main pool of student subjects. We find that the willingness to pay for customization is slightly lower for these real investors and the main effect of fee integration is also less pronounced.

Within economic geography, positive externalities such as increase in demand explain firms' desire to locate close to their rivals whereas negative externalities such as competition explain their desire to avoid them. Within the ecological tradition, density dependence theory explains this relationship in terms of legitimation of an organizational form in a particular market and subsequently increased competition for resources there.

In settings where prices are fixed, we characterize the optimal release time and demonstrate why in some cases it can actually be preferable to delay release when customer error reporting rates increase. The manner in which a firm's optimal release time responds to increases in software functionality critically hinges on whether the added functionality enhances or dilutes user error reporting; in both cases, the effect of added functionality on release timing can go in either direction, depending on both firm and product market characteristics. For example, when processing costs are relatively large compared with goodwill costs, firms with lower process maturity will release earlier when per-module error reporting contributions become diluted and release later when these contributions become enhanced.

We examine how the product line and profit are influenced by the production cost and output distribution of the technology. We prove that production cost influences product line design in a fundamentally different manner for coproduct technologies than for uniproduct technologies where the firm can produce products independently. For example, with coproducts, the size and length of the product line can both increase in the production cost.

Furthermore, I present new evidence that there were economically and statistically significant effects of investor flows on futures prices, after controlling for returns in the United States and emerging-economy stock markets, a measure of the balance sheet flexibility of large financial institutions, open interest, the futures/spot basis, and lagged returns on oil futures. The largest impacts on futures prices were from intermediate-term growth rates of index positions and managed-money spread positions.

In this setting, conflicts can arise between developers and users from divergent interests concerning the release of functionalities in the project. The release of functionalities is influenced by reuse, i.e., the effort spent by the development team to write code that can be reused within the same project or in future projects. For example, the development team may choose to spend extra effort to make certain portions of the system reusable because doing so could reduce the effort needed to develop the entire system. However, the additional effort spent on reuse could delay the release of certain critical functionality, making such a strategy suboptimal for the users. Thus, optimal reuse decisions for developers and users could be different. In addition, from the firm's perspective, reuse decisions must not only balance the objectives of developers and users for the current project, but reuse effort may be spent to benefit future projects. Our study also highlights the fact that reuse may not always be beneficial for the firm.

The volatility spread formula serves as the basis for using the generalized method of moments to estimate investors' risk aversion.

Modeling social comparison as a game between players, we find that ahead-seeking behavior leads to output polarization, whereas behind-averse behavior leads to output clustering. A social planner can mitigate these effects in two ways: (i) by providing the full reference distribution of outputs instead of an aggregate reference point based on the average output and (ii) by assigning players into uniform rather than diverse reference groups. Social planners may thus need to tailor the reference structure to the predominant mode of social comparison and their objective. A performance-focused social planner may set the reference structure so as to maximize the output of either the top or the bottom player depending on whether she puts greater marginal weight to larger or smaller outputs. When the social planner also cares about utility, she faces a dilemma because performance optimization may not be aligned with utility maximization.

A common allocation mechanism is based on a retailer's sales history: a retailer that has ordered larger quantities in the past should get a greater allocation than a retailer that has historically ordered smaller quantities. This mechanism, known as a turn-and-earn allocation rule, is commonly used in many industries such as automobiles, microprocessors, video game consoles, etc. The existing literature has considered the effect of turn-and-earn allocation rules when a manufacturer sells a single product. However, when we consider a product line, it is not clear whether the manufacturer is better off basing its allocation on the sales history of the entire product line or solely on the sales history of the product in short supply. In particular, a shortage of one product can lead retailers and consumers to move toward other products in the line. This, in turn, can have an effect on the manufacturer's optimal allocation mechanism. We examine this issue by developing a model of a supplier selling two substitutable goods through two retailers. Within this setup, we introduce a general turn-and-earn allocation rule that allows the entire sales history to influence allocation levels.

Before investing in capacity, the firm issues the optimal amount of debt, trading off the tax benefit and lower transaction cost of debt financing against the cost of financial distress and the agency cost associated with leverage. We show that in the presence of debt, resource flexibility has benefits in addition to reducing the mismatch between supply and demand. Namely, resource flexibility mitigates the shareholder--debtholder agency conflict as well as the risk of costly default. Most interestingly, we show that resource flexibility mitigates the underinvestment problem because it reduces the probability that a firm will go bankrupt with some of its capacity being fully utilized. When lenders anticipate that a firm will choose a relatively flexible capacity mix, they should provide more favorable credit terms, to which the firm should respond by issuing more debt.

Such a downward order distortion can amplify double marginalization.

To address this calibration problem, we propose the exterior-trimmed opinion pool.

Exterior trimming decreases the pool's variance and improves its calibration. A linear opinion pool, however, will remain overconfident when individuals are overconfident and not very diverse. For these situations, we suggest trimming away forecasts with moderate means or cdf values. This interior trimming increases variance and reduces overconfidence.

We further evaluate numerically the performance of these policies relative to a fully coordinated model, which is generally intractable. We find it interesting that near-optimal performance is usually achieved by a simple hierarchical policy that sets prices first, based on a nonnested stochastic model, and then uses these prices to optimize nested capacity allocation.

Solving these kinds of optimization problems exactly requires a method that can generate the whole set of nondominated points (the Pareto-optimal front). In this paper, we first give a survey of the newly developed branch and bound methods for solving MOMIP problems.

However, in a unique symmetric experiment that isolates the effect of market origin, we find evidence for the opposite: Although solutions provided by problem solvers from analogous markets show lower potential for immediate use, they demonstrate substantially higher levels of novelty. Also, compared to established novelty drivers, this effect appears highly relevant from a managerial perspective: we find that including problem solvers from analogous markets versus the target market accounts for almost two-thirds of the well-known effect of involving lead users instead of average problem solvers. This effect is further amplified when the analogous distance between the markets increases, i.e., when searching in far versus near analogous markets. Finally, results indicate that the analogous market effect is particularly strong in the upper tail of the novelty distribution, which again underscores the effect's practical importance.

In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous Bayesian semiparametric approach for modeling choice endogeneity that offers a flexible and robust alternative to parametric methods. Specifically, we construct centered Dirichlet process mixtures (CDPM) to allow uncertainty over the distribution of endogeneity errors. In a similar vein, we also model consumer preference heterogeneity nonparametrically via a CDPM. Results on simulated data show that incorrect distributional assumptions can lead to poor recovery of model parameters and price elasticities, whereas the proposed semiparametric model is able to robustly recover the true parameters in an efficient fashion. In addition, the CDPM offers the benefits of automatically inferring the number of mixture components that are appropriate for a given data set and is able to reconstruct the shape of the underlying distributions for endogeneity and heterogeneity errors. We apply our approach to two scanner panel data sets. Model comparison statistics indicate the superiority of the semiparametric specification and the results show that parameter and elasticity estimates are sensitive to the choice of distributional forms. Moreover, the CDPM specification yields evidence of multimodality, skewness, and outlying observations in these real data sets.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1811\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1811</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by J.

Executive pensions, consisting of rank-and-file (RAF) plans and supplemental executive retirement plans (SERPs), and other deferred compensation (ODC) have debt-like payoffs, and could therefore function as inside debt. However, whereas SERPs are often unfunded and unsecured, RAF plans are funded and secured to some extent, and ODC may be invested in equity and withdrawn flexibly before retirement. Special arrangements in executive debt-like compensation could hence weaken or even nullify any incentive-alignment effect. We find that higher CEO debt-like compensation leads to lower promised yield and fewer covenants in a sample of loans originated in 2006--2008. This effect is driven entirely by benefits accrued under SERPs, consistent with SERPs more closely resembling risky corporate debt; balances accrued under RAF and ODC plans do not provide similar effects. Furthermore, promised yields are lower when debt-like compensation claims can be withdrawn only after outside debt claims are expected to settle. Our findings persist after accounting for endogeneity using state personal income tax rates as an instrument for CEOs' willingness to defer compensation. Overall, the evidence suggests that executive debt-like compensation is only effective at resolving stockholder--debtholder conflicts when its payoffs are truly debt-like and that lenders' perceptions are affected not only by the magnitude of debt-like compensation but also by its seniority.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1813\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1813</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Wei Jiang, finance</i>.", "ex:volume": "60", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Inside Debt and the Design of Corporate Debt Contracts", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1813", "ex:pages": "1260-1280", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": ["Executive compensation", "Inside debt", "Debt-like compensation", "Debt contracting"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Divya Anantharaman", "ex:email": "divyaa@rutgers.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Vivian W.

However, bidders can also strategically take advantage of this flexibility, by discounting package bids and “inflating” bid prices for single items, even in the absence of cost synergies; the latter behavior can hurt the performance of the auction. It is an empirical question whether allowing package bids and running a CA improves performance in a given setting. In this paper, we develop a structural estimation approach that estimates the firms' cost structure using bidding data and use these estimates to evaluate the performance of the auction. To overcome the computational difficulties arising from the large number of bids observed in large-scale CAs, we propose a novel simplified model of bidders' behavior based on pricing package characteristics. We apply our method to the Chilean school meals auction, in which the government procures half a billion dollars' worth of meal services every year and bidders submit thousands of package bids. Our estimates suggest that bidders' cost synergies are economically significant in this application ((sim)5%), and the current CA mechanism achieves high allocative efficiency ((sim)98%) and reasonable margins for the bidders ((sim)5%).

Efficient sourcing usually provides a cost advantage, whereas responsive sourcing allows a firm to obtain more accurate demand information when making procurement decisions. By characterizing the equilibrium outcome, we find some interesting results driven by the strategic interaction between the firms. First, a firm may still use efficient sourcing in equilibrium even when the cost advantage associated with efficient sourcing does not exist. This is because the firm can dampen competition by reducing the correlation between its own demand information and the competitor's. Second, a cost hike in efficient sourcing (e.g., the rising labor cost in Asia) may benefit all the firms in the industry. The reason is that the cost hike may alleviate competition by inducing a new equilibrium sourcing structure. This paper also sheds some light on the recent backshoring trend. First, our analysis indicates that more firms will shift from efficient sourcing to responsive sourcing in equilibrium (i.e., backshore) if the market size shrinks, the demand becomes more volatile, or the sourcing costs rise simultaneously. Second, a firm's backshoring behavior reduces the competition on the cost dimension, but it also has an ambiguous informational impact on the other firms in the market. In particular, some firms may benefit from increased correlation of their demand information under Cournot competition with substitutable products.

We combine a hierarchical Bayesian model estimated on approximately one million online sessions from Travelocity, together with randomized experiments using a real-world hotel search engine application. Our archival data analysis and randomized experiments are consistent in demonstrating the following: (1) A consumer-utility-based ranking mechanism can lead to a significant increase in overall search engine revenue. (2) Significant interplay occurs between search engine ranking and product ratings. An inferior position on the search engine affects “higher-class” hotels more adversely. On the other hand, hotels with a lower customer rating are more likely to benefit from being placed on the top of the screen. These findings illustrate that product search engines could benefit from directly incorporating signals from social media into their ranking algorithms. (3) Our randomized experiments also reveal that an “active” personalized ranking system (wherein users can interact with and customize the ranking algorithm) leads to higher clicks but lower purchase propensities and lower search engine revenue compared with a “passive” personalized ranking system (wherein users cannot interact with the ranking algorithm). This result suggests that providing more information during the decision-making process may lead to fewer consumer purchases because of information overload. Therefore, product search engines should not adopt personalized ranking systems by default. Overall, our study unravels the economic impact of ranking and its interaction with social media on product search engines.<i>This paper was accepted by Lorin Hitt, information systems.</i>", "ex:volume": "60", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Examining the Impact of Ranking on Consumer Behavior and Search Engine Revenue", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1828", "ex:pages": "1632-1654", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": ["Travel search engine", "Randomized experiments", "Hierarchical bayesian methods", "Information systems", "It policy and management", "Electronic commerce"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Anindya Ghose", "ex:email": "aghose@stern.nyu.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Panagiotis G.

First, arguing that consumers' political tendencies have an unutilized predictive power for marketing models, we allow consumers' heterogeneity to depend on their voting tendencies. Second, instead of relying on the commonly used genre classifications to characterize movies, we estimate latent movie attributes. These attributes are not determined a priori by industry professionals but rather reflect consumers' perceptions, as revealed by their moviegoing behavior. Box-office data over five years from 25 counties in the U.S. Midwest provide support for this model. First, consumers' preferences are related to their political tendencies. For example, we find that counties that voted for congressional Republicans prefer movies starring young, Caucasian, female actors over those starring African American, male actors. Second, perceived attributes provide new insights into consumers' preferences. For example, one of these attributes is the movie's degree of seriousness.

Sole awards can alienate losing suppliers and cause them to defect from the supply base. To maintain the supply base and thereby control the high costs of finding and qualifying new suppliers, buyers often employ split awards, which in turn inflate purchase costs. This results in a trade-off that we investigate in an infinite-horizon stationary setting in which the relative cost position of each supplier is randomly drawn in every period. We characterize the optimal split award that minimizes long-run costs (purchasing and qualification) and show that maintaining a constant supply-base size---using a “qualify-up-to” policy---is optimal for the buyer. We find that neither the extent of multisourcing nor the buyer's value of split awards compared with winner-take-all auctions are monotonic in the qualification cost and that split-award auctions can increase ex ante system, buyer, and supplier benefits simultaneously.

This study builds on a large-scale randomized experiment of short message service (SMS) texts sent to 12,265 mobile users. We draw on contextual marketing theory to hypothesize how different combinations of mobile targeting determine consumer responses to mobile promotions. We identify that temporal targeting and geographical targeting individually increase sales purchases. Surprisingly, the sales effects of employing these two strategies simultaneously are not straightforward. When targeting proximal mobile users, our findings reveal a negative sales--lead time relationship; sending same-day mobile promotions yields an increase in the odds of consumer purchases compared with sending them two days prior to the promoted event. However, when targeting nonproximal mobile users, there is an inverted-U, curvilinear relationship. Sending one-day prior SMSs yields an increase in the odds of consumer purchases by 9.5 times compared with same-day SMSs and an increase in the odds of consumer purchases by 71% compared with two-day prior SMSs. These results are robust to unobserved heterogeneity, alternative estimation models, bootstrapped resamples, randomization checks, consumer mobile usage behavior, and segmentation of consumer scenarios. In addition, we conducted follow-up surveys to delve into the psychological mechanisms explaining the findings in our field experiment. In line with consumer construal arguments, consumers who received SMSs close (far) in time and location formed a more (less) concrete mental construal, which in turn, increased their involvement and purchase intent.

We provide a dynamic programming based algorithm that computes the optimal sequence of prices for this problem in polynomial time.

Also, when customers become more strategic (patient for service), the firm offers higher prices. This may lead to the underutilization of capacity, lower revenues, and reduced customer welfare.

As a result, the optimal spending is constant and depends on CLV for the firms with unlimited capacity, but changes dynamically and is generally unrelated to CLV when capacity is limited. In the experimental part, we introduce a concept of conditional optimality for the analysis of state-dependent decisions. Applying this concept to our data, we document a number of decision biases, specifically the subjects' tendency to overspend on retaining high-value customers and underspend on lower-value customers retention and acquisition.

Meanwhile, her performance is disclosed to an agent, who must then give the client feedback on her performance. Upon receiving the feedback, the client reports her happiness level, which in turn determines the agent's payoff. In eight studies involving 928 subjects, we vary the way the agent's cash earnings depend on the client's reported happiness. When we make the agent's earnings proportional to the client's reported happiness, the agent inflates his feedback, and the client reports a higher level of happiness (than that reported in a control condition where the agent always provides honest feedback). We show that neither the agent nor the client behaves altruistically in their reporting. The client reports being happier because she overestimates her performance and mistakenly believes that the agent's feedback is genuine. The agent stops inflating his feedback when doing so no longer benefits him. Finally, our main findings are shown to be robust with respect to several factors, including making the agent's feedback consequential in affecting the client's payoff.

Common wisdom suggests that ticket resale is harmful to event organizers' revenues, and event organizers have tried to prevent resale of tickets. For instance, Ticketmaster recently proposed paperless (nontransferrable) ticketing, which would severely limit the opportunity to resell tickets. We consider a model that allows resale from both consumers and speculators with different transaction costs for each party. Surprisingly, we find that this wisdom is incorrect when event organizers use fixed pricing policies; in fact, event organizers benefit from reductions in consumers' (and speculators') transaction costs of resale. Even when multiperiod pricing policies are used, we find that an event organizer may still benefit from ticket resale if his capacity is small. Although paperless ticketing is suggested as a way to reduce ticket resale and prevent speculators from buying tickets, our results suggest that it may reduce the capacity providers' revenues in many situations. Instead, we propose ticket options as a novel ticket pricing mechanism. We show that ticket options (where consumers would initially buy an option to buy a ticket and then exercise at a later date) naturally reduce ticket resale significantly and result in significant increases in event organizers' revenues. Furthermore, since a consumer only risks the option price (and not the whole ticket price) if she cannot attend the event, options may face less consumer resistance than paperless tickets.<i>This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management</i>.", "ex:volume": "60", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Should Event Organizers Prevent Resale of Tickets?", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1862", "ex:pages": "2160-2179", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": ["Events", "Ticket resale", "Fixed pricing", "Multiperiod pricing", "Options"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Yao Cui", "ex:email": "cuiyao@umich.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Izak Duenyas", "ex:email": "duenyas@umich.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Özge Şahin", "ex:email": "ozge.sahin@jhu.edu"}]}, {"ex:issue": "9", "ex:abstract": "Ianalyze the impact of a firm's environmental profile on its cost of equity and debt capital.

It is important to examine the above given the significant investments and the high failure rates associated with the introduction of new product extensions. In this study, we develop an analytical framework that derives revenue outcome due to an extension introduction as a function of spillover and extension effects. We empirically estimate the above effects through a Bayesian endogenous switching model that jointly models market shares of the extension and its parent brand along with the strategic decision to introduce the extension and the endogeneity in prices. By using a data set that covers 155 extensions introduced across 20 U.S. geographic markets, we obtain several new generalizable empirical insights. Our results show that spillover effects are higher for brand extensions, whereas line extensions benefit through larger extension effects.

The addition of a new brand name (i.e., sub-branding) lowers spillover effects for line extensions, whereas it increases the market performance for brand extensions.

We experimentally investigate how supply chain members' countries of origin---China versus the United States---affect trust, trustworthiness, and strategic information sharing behavior in a cross-country supply chain. We consider a two-tier supply chain in which the upstream supplier solicits demand forecast information from the retailer to plan production; but the retailer has an incentive to manipulate her forecast to ensure abundant supply. The levels of trust and trustworthiness in the supply chain and supplier's capability to determine the optimal production quantity affect the efficacy of forecast sharing and the resulting profits. We develop an experimental design to disentangle these three aspects and to allow for real-time interactions between geographically distant and culturally heterogeneous participants. We observe that, when there is no prospect for long-term interactions, our Chinese participants consistently exhibit lower spontaneous trust and trustworthiness than their U.S. counterparts do. We quantify the differences in trust and trustworthiness between the two countries, and the resulting impact on supply chain efficiency. We also show that Chinese individuals exhibit higher spontaneous trust toward U.S. partners than Chinese ones, primarily because they perceive that individuals from the United States are more trusting and trustworthy in general. This positive perception toward U.S. people is indeed consistent with the U.S. participants' behavior in forecast sharing. In addition, we quantify that a Chinese supply chain enjoys a larger efficiency gain from repeated interactions than a U.S. one does, as the prospect of building a long-term relationship successfully sustains trust and trustworthiness by Chinese partners. We advocate that companies can reinforce the positive perception of westerners held by the Chinese population and commit to long-term relationships to encourage trust by Chinese partners.

Video sharing sites, social networks, online games, etc. all rely heavily on user-generated content and have been growing significantly in the last decade. We model a Hotelling style market in which consumers have heterogeneous tastes along a circular city. In a first step, we consider two ex ante identical firms whose offerings entirely depend on user-generated content. Consumers contribute content to the firm they join and benefit from the content provided by the others, their valuation being higher the closer the content contributor is to the content consumer (i.e., there are local network effects). In such a setting, we show that ex ante identical firms can acquire differentiated market positions that spontaneously emerge from user-generated content. Moreover, such differentiation may take interesting patterns, wherein a firm simultaneously attracts multiple distinct consumer segments that are isolated from each other. Greater segregation, measured by the number of disjoint segments in each platform, reduces consumer valuation for content, but interestingly, it intensifies firm competition. We show that this insight can help us refine the set of possible equilibria. In a second step, we consider firms that explicitly differentiate their offerings by generating some content on their own. We show that user-generated content may strengthen or defeat firms' intended positioning (i.e., firms attract consumers located opposite to their chosen positions) and consumer surplus may be higher in the latter case. Finally, we allow multihoming by consumers and show that the previous equilibrium patterns remain valid, but in most equilibria, a subset of consumers (located between rival firms' core clienteles) are multihomers. More multihoming consumers imply reduced differentiation and higher degree of platform competition.

Vehicles use standardized batteries that, when depleted, can be switched for fully charged batteries at switching stations, and motorists only pay for battery use. We build a model that highlights the key mechanisms driving adoption and use of electric vehicles in this new switching-station-based electric vehicle system and contrast it with conventional electric vehicles. Our model employs results from repairable item inventory theory to capture switching-station operation; we embed this model in a behavioral model of motorist use and adoption. Switching-station systems effectively transfer range risk from motorists to the station operator, who, through statistical economies of scale, can better manage it. We find that this transfer of risk can lead to higher electric vehicle adoption than in a conventional system, but it also encourages more driving than a conventional system does. We calibrate our models with motorist behavior data, electric vehicle technology data, operation costs, and emissions data to estimate the relative effectiveness of the two systems under the status quo and other plausible future scenarios. We find that the system that is more effective at reducing emissions is often less effective at reducing oil dependence, and the misalignment between the two objectives is most severe when the energy mix is coal heavy and has advanced battery technology. Increases in gasoline prices (by imposition of taxes, for instance) are much more effective in reducing carbon emissions, whereas battery-price-reducing policy interventions are more effective for reducing oil dependence. Taken together, our results help a policy maker identify the superior system for achieving the desired objectives. They also highlight that policy makers should not conflate the dual objectives of oil dependence and emissions reductions as the preferred system, and the policy interventions that further that system may be different for the two objectives.<i>This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management</i>.", "ex:volume": "61", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Electric Vehicles with a Battery Switching Station: Adoption and Environmental Impact", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1916", "ex:pages": "772-794", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": ["Sustainable operations", "Transportation", "Business model innovation", "Public policy", "Electric vehicles"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Buket Avci", "ex:email": "buketavci@smu.edu.sg"}, {"ex:name": "Karan Girotra", "ex:email": "karan.girotra@insead.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Serguei Netessine", "ex:email": "serguei.netessine@insead.edu"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Do hospitals experience safety tipping points as utilization increases, and if so, what are the implications for hospital operations management? We argue that safety tipping points occur when managerial escalation policies are exhausted and workload variability buffers are depleted. Front-line clinical staff is forced to ration resources and, at the same time, becomes more error prone as a result of elevated stress hormone levels. We confirm the existence of safety tipping points for in-hospital mortality using the discharge records of 82,280 patients across six high-mortality-risk conditions from 256 clinical departments of 83 German hospitals. Focusing on survival during the first seven days following admission, we estimate a mortality tipping point at an occupancy level of 92.5%. Among the 17% of patients in our sample who experienced occupancy above the tipping point during the first seven days of their hospital stay, high occupancy accounted for one in seven deaths. The existence of a safety tipping point has important implications for hospital management. First, flexible capacity expansion is more cost-effective for safety improvement than rigid capacity, because it will only be used when occupancy reaches the tipping point. In the context of our sample, flexible staffing saves more than 40% of the cost of a fully staffed capacity expansion, while achieving the same reduction in mortality. Second, reducing the variability of demand by pooling capacity in hospital clusters can greatly increase safety in a hospital system, because it reduces the likelihood that a patient will experience occupancy levels beyond the tipping point.

The utility has maintenance crews that perform both standard jobs (each must be done before a specified deadline) as well as respond to emergency gas leaks (that occur randomly throughout the day and could disrupt the schedule and lead to significant overtime). The goal is to perform all the standard jobs by their respective deadlines, to address all emergency jobs in a timely manner, and to minimize maintenance crew overtime. We employ a novel decomposition approach that solves the problem in two phases. The first is a job scheduling phase, where standard jobs are scheduled over a time horizon. The second is a crew assignment phase, which solves a stochastic mixed integer program to assign jobs to maintenance crews under a stochastic number of future emergencies. For the first phase, we propose a heuristic based on the rounding of a linear programming relaxation formulation and prove an analytical worst-case performance guarantee. For the second phase, we propose an algorithm for assigning crews that is motivated by the structure of an optimal solution. We used our models and heuristics to develop a decision support tool that is being piloted in one of the utility's sites.

To assess the star as well as movie characteristics effects, we utilize a switching model to account for endogenous assignment of stars and nonstars into respective movie samples. In addition to controlling for selection biases, the endogenous switching model generates managerially relevant insights into the factors that influence a star's assignment to a movie.

The net impact of the EMR system is more benign on internal medicine physicians than on pediatricians and family practitioners. We postulate that the fit provided by an EMR system to the task requirements of physicians of various specialties may be key to disentangling the productivity dynamics.

In the dynamic negotiation process, the seller can screen, whereas the buyer can signal information through their offers, and the buyer has an <i>endogenous</i> and <i>type-dependent</i> reservation profit. With rational assumptions on the seller's belief structure, we characterize the perfect Bayesian equilibrium of the bargaining game. Interestingly, we find that both quantity distortion and information rent may be avoided depending on the firms' relative patience, and the seller may reach an agreement with either the high type or the low type first, or with both simultaneously. Furthermore, we explore our model to characterize the effect of demand forecasting accuracy on firm profitability. We find that improved demand forecast benefits the buyer but hurts the seller when the buyer's forecasting accuracy is low. However, once the buyer's forecasting accuracy exceeds a threshold, both firms will benefit from further improvement of the forecast. This observation makes an interesting contrast to previous findings based on the one-shot principal--agent model, in which improvement of forecasting accuracy mostly leads to a win--lose outcome for the two firms, and the buyer has an incentive to improve his forecasting accuracy only when it is extremely low.<i>This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management.</i>", "ex:volume": "61", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Dynamic Bargaining in a Supply Chain with Asymmetric Demand Information", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1938", "ex:pages": "301-315", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": ["Dynamic bargaining", "Asymmetric information", "Screening", "Signaling", "Forecasting accuracy"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Qi Feng", "ex:email": "annabellefeng@purdue.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Guoming Lai", "ex:email": "guoming.lai@mccombs.utexas.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Lauren Xiaoyuan Lu", "ex:email": "lauren_lu@unc.edu"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "Motivated by the availability of real-time data on customer characteristics, we consider the problem of personalizing the assortment of products for each arriving customer.

We first evaluate two common wholesale price contracts that differ in which party incurs the risk associated with unsold inventory: a push contract in which the retailer incurs the risk and a pull contract in which the supplier incurs the risk. Our experimental results show that a pull contract achieves higher channel efficiency than that of a push contract, and that behavior systematically deviates from the standard theory in three ways: (1) stocking quantities are set too low, (2) wholesale prices are more favorable to the party stocking the inventory, and (3) some contracts are erroneously accepted or rejected. To account for these systematic regularities, we extend the existing theory and structurally estimate a number of behavioral models. The estimates suggest that a combination of loss aversion with errors organizes our data remarkably well. We apply our behavioral model to the advance purchase discount (APD) contract, which combines features of push and pull by allowing both parties to share the inventory risk, in a separate experiment as an out-of-sample test, and we find that it accurately predicts channel efficiency and qualitatively matches decisions. Two practical implications of our work are that (1) the push contract performs close to standard theoretical benchmarks, which implies that it is robust to behavioral biases, and (2) the APD contract weakly Pareto dominates the push contract; retailers are better off and suppliers are no worse off under the APD contract.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1940\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1940</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management.</i>", "ex:volume": "60", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Push, Pull, or Both?

In practice, sellers tend to offer probabilistic products only after major demand uncertainty has been resolved. By deferring product assignments, a firm is able to obtain more information about demand for each specific product before deciding which product to assign to consumers. However, our analysis demonstrates that PS can be an effective inventory-management mechanism even if the firm allocates products before knowing which product will be more popular and, thus, scarcer. Interestingly, we show that it can be more profitable for the firm to allocate products to consumers before, rather than after, learning the true demand for a product because, although early allocation imposes higher inventory costs (as a result of larger required inventory levels), it also enables the firm to charge higher prices. Our results also reveal that, when introducing probabilistic goods, the firm should order less inventory (relative to the case where probabilistic goods are not offered) if costs are very low but more inventory otherwise.

In such a setting, does the buyer benefit from engaging the services of a better-informed procurement service provider (PSP) compared to procuring directly from the suppliers? Intuition might suggest that hiring a PSP is always the right choice because the PSP’s knowledge of the supply base improves supplier selection and management. On the other hand, earlier studies prove that using a PSP purely for its superior knowledge about supply costs is always worse for a buyer than contracting with the suppliers directly. Our answer to this research question is more nuanced. Contrary to the findings of earlier studies, we find that the buyer may benefit from using a PSP. We identify, quantify, and explain all of the benefits and the costs of using a PSP, and describe conditions under which the benefits exceed the costs. The benefits of using a PSP are derived when one supplier is of high reliability and the other is of low reliability, from a reduction of informational costs due to implicit supplier collusion facilitated by the PSP and an improvement of supply availability. The costs of using a PSP are derived when both suppliers are of low reliability, from the loss of direct control over the supplier’s production actions, which leads to reduced supply availability and increased informational costs, and from the PSP facilitating implicit supplier collusion. Comparative statics analysis indicates that using the PSP is valuable only if the buyer diversifies with some supplier-type combinations but not others, and that hiring a PSP is not a solution to the problem of an unreliable supply base.<i>This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management</i>.", "ex:volume": "61", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Does a Procurement Service Provider Generate Value for the Buyer Through Information About Supply Risks?", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1963", "ex:pages": "979-998", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": ["Supply disruption", "Sourcing intermediation", "Mechanism design", "Supply diversification", "Information asymmetry"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Zhibin (Ben) Yang", "ex:email": "zyang@uoregon.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Volodymyr Babich", "ex:email": "vob2@georgetown.edu"}]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "In this paper we build a theoretical model of a firm repurchasing its corporate debt.

We show that workers who perceive being underpaid at the base wage increase their performance if the hourly wage increases, whereas those who feel adequately paid or overpaid at the base wage do not change their performance.

Under this policy, the firm procures a constant quantity from the regular supplier in every period and dynamically makes procurement decisions for the emergency supplier. Allon and Van Mieghem describe this practice as using the regular supplier to meet a <i>base</i> level of demand and the emergency supplier to manage demand <i>surges</i>, and they conjecture that this practice is most effective when the lead time difference between the two suppliers is large. We confirm these statements in two ways. First, we show the following analytical result: when demand is composed of a <i>base</i> demand random component plus a <i>surge</i> demand random component, which occurs with a certain small probability, the best TBS policy is close to optimal (over all policies) in a well-defined sense. Second, we also numerically investigate the cost effectiveness of the best TBS policy on a test bed of problem instances. The emphasis of this investigation is the study of the effect of the lead time difference between the two suppliers. Our study reveals that the cost difference between the best TBS policy and the optimal policy decreases dramatically as the lead time of the regular supplier increases. On our test bed, this cost difference decreases from an average (over the test bed) of 21% when the lead time from the regular supplier is two periods (the emergency supplier offers instant delivery) to 3.5% when that lead time is seven periods.<i>This paper was accepted by Martin Lariviere, operations management</i>.", "ex:volume": "61", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Analysis of Tailored Base-Surge Policies in Dual Sourcing Inventory Systems", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1971", "ex:pages": "1547-1561", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": ["Inventory/production systems", "Dual sourcing", "Multiple suppliers", "Optimal policies"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Ganesh Janakiraman", "ex:email": "ganesh@utdallas.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Sridhar Seshadri", "ex:email": "sridhar_seshadri@isb.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Anshul Sheopuri", "ex:email": "sheopuri@us.ibm.com"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "Advances in digital technologies have led to an increasing concern about piracy for providers of digital content (e.g., e-books, games, music, software, videos).

The proposed economic mechanism centers on the influence of copyright protection on consumer search when consumers can get to know the firm’s actions (e.g., price, quality) only after costly search. We show that more stringent copyright protection can induce the consumers to rationally expect lower ex post surplus, thus exerting a negative strategic effect on the consumers' willingness to search. This strategic effect may outweigh the positive main effect on the relative attractiveness of the authorized versus the pirated product, which can hence explain the optimality of incomplete and even zero copyright protection policies in markets where consumer prepurchase search is important (e.g., information goods, digital products). It is also because of this strategic effect that the firm may provide lower quality as copyright enforcement increases.

Re-examining the behavior of 316 subjects in a within-subjects design two years later, we show that these gender differences also largely persist over a longer time period and can thus be considered stable. Controlling for subjects' abilities in the different tasks, their risk attitudes, and expected performance, the gender gap in the willingness to compete is estimated in the range of 10–20 percentage points. We discuss the implications of our findings for policy interventions and organizational management.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1981\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1981</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Uri Gneezy, behavioral economics.</i>", "ex:volume": "61", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Gender Differences in the Willingness to Compete Emerge Early in Life and Persist", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1981", "ex:pages": "2339-23354", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": ["Competition", "Gender gap", "Experiment", "Children", "Teenagers", "Risk aversion"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Matthias Sutter", "ex:email": "matthias.sutter@uibk.ac.at"}, {"ex:name": "Daniela Glätzle-Rützler", "ex:email": "daniela.ruetzler@uibk.ac.at"}]}, {"ex:issue": "10", "ex:abstract": "Motivated by extant theories of herding behavior, this paper empirically identifies contrarian mutual funds as those trading most frequently against the crowd.

A key aspect of the problem is that each product is short-lived in the sense that, once introduced, its attractiveness lasts only a few periods and vanishes over time. The objective is to determine when to introduce each product to maximize the total profit over the selling season.

The structural properties of the relaxation also help us to develop several heuristics, for which we establish performance guarantees.

In this paper, we take the perspective of a profit-maximizing refiner that considers upgrading its existing simple refinery to include intermediate-conversion flexibility, i.e., the capability of converting heavy intermediate components to light ones. We present a stylized two-stage stochastic programming model of a petroleum refinery to investigate the value drivers of conversion flexibility and the impact of input and output market conditions on its economic potential. Conversion flexibility adds value to refineries by either transforming a nonprofitable situation into a profitable one (referred to as purchase benefit) or improving profitability of an already profitable situation (referred to as unit revenue benefit). In a real-data-calibrated numerical study, we find the value of conversion flexibility (VoC) to be significant, accounting for 40% of the expected profit with conversion, and the purchase benefit and unit revenue benefit are equally important. Contrary to the intuition that, as a recourse action, conversion offers higher value for greater input price volatility, we find that VoC may decrease in input price volatility as a result of the differential impacts of increasing price volatility on the purchase benefit and the unit revenue benefit. Refineries also vary in their range flexibility, i.e., the ability to accommodate a narrow or wide range of inputs of different quality levels. Whether the range flexibility increases or decreases the value of conversion flexibility is affected by the direction in which the refinery expands its processing range and the heaviness of crude oils.<i>This paper was accepted by Martin Lariviere, operations management.</i>", "ex:volume": "60", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "The Value of Operational Flexibility in the Presence of Input and Output Price Uncertainties with Oil Refining Applications", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1996", "ex:pages": "2908-2926", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": ["Operational flexibility", "Oil refining", "Petroleum industry", "Spot markets", "Stochastic models"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Lingxiu Dong", "ex:email": "dong@wustl.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Panos Kouvelis", "ex:email": "kouvelis@wustl.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Xiaole Wu", "ex:email": "wuxiaole@fudan.edu.cn"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "This paper investigates the mechanism through which short selling of a bank's stocks can trigger the failure of the bank.

Because consumers are also users, their social identities connect to the user-designers, and they feel empowerment by vicariously being involved in the design process. This formed connection leads to preference for the firm’s products. Importantly, this social identification account also effectively predicts when the effect does not materialize. First, we find that if consumers feel dissimilar to participating users, the effects are attenuated. We demonstrate that this happens when the community differs from consumers along important demographics (i.e., gender) or when consumers are nonexperts in the focal domain (i.e., they feel that they do not belong to the social group of participating users). Second, the effects are attenuated if the user-driven firm is only selectively rather than fully open to participation from all users (observing consumers do not feel socially included). These findings advance the emerging theory on user involvement and offer practical implications for firms interested in pursuing a user-driven philosophy.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1999\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1999</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Pradeep Chintagunta, marketing</i>.", "ex:volume": "61", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Why and When Consumers Prefer Products of User-Driven Firms: A Social Identification Account", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1999", "ex:pages": "1978-1988", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": ["User innovation", "User design", "User-generated products", "Crowdsourcing", "Social identity", "Corporate associations", "Consumer preferences", "Open source software"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Darren W.

Experimental results on data derived from real publisher inventory confirm that there are significant benefits for publishers if they jointly optimize over both channels.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2017\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2017</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Dimitris Bertsimas, optimization.</i>", "ex:volume": "60", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Yield Optimization of Display Advertising with Ad Exchange", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2017", "ex:pages": "2886-2907", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": ["Dynamic programming-optimal control", "Internet advertising", "Revenue management"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Santiago R.

Each agent in the market has an unknown independent private valuation that determines the distribution of the reward she obtains from the good; for example, in sponsored search settings, advertisers may initially be unsure of the value of a click. Though the induced dynamic game is complex, we simplify analysis of the market using an approximation methodology known as <i>mean field equilibrium</i> (MFE). The methodology assumes that agents optimize only with respect to long-run average estimates of the distribution of other players' bids. We show a remarkable fact: In a mean field equilibrium, the agent has an optimal strategy where she bids truthfully according to a <i>conjoint valuation</i>. The conjoint valuation is the sum of her current expected valuation, together with an overbid amount that is exactly the expected marginal benefit of one additional observation about her true private valuation. Under mild conditions on the model, we show that an MFE exists, and that it is a good approximation to a rational agent’s behavior as the number of agents increases. Formally, if every agent except one follows the MFE strategy, then the remaining agent’s loss on playing the MFE strategy converges to zero as the number of agents in the market increases. We conclude by discussing the implications of the auction format and design on the auctioneer’s revenue. In particular, we establish the revenue equivalence of standard auctions in dynamic mean field settings, and discuss optimal selection of reserve prices in dynamic auctions.<i>This paper was accepted by Assaf Zeevi, stochastic models and simulation.</i>", "ex:volume": "60", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Mean Field Equilibria of Dynamic Auctions with Learning", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2018", "ex:pages": "2949-2970", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": ["Mean field equilibrium", "Conjoint valuation", "Dynamic auction markets"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Krishnamurthy Iyer", "ex:email": "kriyer@cornell.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Ramesh Johari", "ex:email": "ramesh.johari@stanford.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Mukund Sundararajan", "ex:email": "mukunds@google.com"}]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "We consider large contact centers that handle two types of jobs—inbound and outbound—simultaneously, a process commonly referred to as <i>call blending</i>.

In modern business and society, there are rapidly growing demands for constructing analytically valid databases that also are secure and protect sensitive information to meet customer and public expectations, to minimize financial losses, and to comply with privacy regulations and laws. We propose new data perturbation and shuffling (DPS) procedures, named MORE, for this purpose. As compared with existing DPS methods, MORE can substantially increase the utility of secure databases without increasing disclosure risk. MORE is capable of preserving important nonmonotonic relationships among attributes, such as the inverted-U relationship between competition and innovation. Maintaining such relationships is often the key to determining optimal levels of policy and managerial interventions. MORE does not require data to be of particular types or have particular distributional shapes. Instead, it provides unified, flexible, and robust algorithms to mask general types of confidential variables with arbitrary distributions, thereby making it suitable for general-purpose data masking. Since MORE nests the commonly used generalized linear models as special cases, a much wider range of statistical analyses can be conducted by using the secure databases with results similar to those achieved by using the original databases. Unlike existing DPS approaches that typically require a joint model for all variables, MORE requires no modeling of nonconfidential variables and thus further increases the robustness of secure databases. Evaluation of MORE through Monte Carlo simulation studies and empirical applications demonstrates that it performs better than existing data-masking methods.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2026\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2026</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Sandra Slaughter, information systems</i>.", "ex:volume": "61", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Drive More Effective Data-Based Innovations: Enhancing the Utility of Secure Databases", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2026", "ex:pages": "520-541", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": ["Database", "Digital economy", "Innovation", "Nonparametric", "Perturbation", "Privacy", "Shuffling"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Yi Qian", "ex:email": "yi.qian@sauder.ubc.ca"}, {"ex:name": "Hui Xie", "ex:email": "huixie@uic.edu"}]}, {"ex:issue": "10", "ex:abstract": "Adaptive estimation methods have become a popular tool for capturing and forecasting changing conditions in dynamic environments.

By contrast, offshore outsourcing will be preferred by less profitable firms seeking to tap into low-cost inputs, especially as investments in information technology lower monitoring costs. Empirical analysis of a comprehensive panel of cross-border product transfers by U.S. manufacturing multinational corporations from 1989 to 2004 reveals support for these arguments.

Under VC financing, an equity-type contract emerges as optimal. Although it is not sensitive to exogenous shocks, this contract requires the entrepreneur to share a fraction of the rents with the financier, thus yielding lower effort incentives for the entrepreneur. There exists a threshold level of venture risk such that bank financing is optimal if and only if venture risk is below that threshold. Product market competition increases the value of stronger entrepreneurial incentives and thus increases the maximum level of risk the entrepreneur is willing to take before switching from bank financing to VC financing.

Whether they buy in advance or in spot, consumers’ valuations are realized in the spot period and they may range from fully independent to perfectly correlated, creating markets with different characteristics of aggregate demand for the seller. Facing these consumers, the seller chooses a portion of the total capacity to offer in advance and prices in both periods. We describe how the optimal strategy and benefits of advance selling depend on the interdependence of consumer valuation, as well as capacity level and other market parameters. We find that a change in valuation interdependence can lead to dramatically different policies for the seller. For example, when individual valuations are highly diverse and the consumer population is large, the seller must offer a discount during advance selling but may limit the advance sales. On the other hand, when valuations are highly correlated, the seller can charge a premium price during advance selling.

I show that fixed proportions technology has a <i>cost-pooling</i> value over dedicated technology, which is larger than the <i>capacity-pooling</i> value of flexible technology over dedicated technology. I identify the critical role that demand correlation plays with the fixed proportions technology: in contrast to the capacity-pooling value, which <i>decreases</i> in demand correlation, the cost-pooling value <i>increases</i> in demand correlation. Second, focusing on the fixed proportions technology, I study supply management in the presence of contract and spot markets. I investigate how the optimal supply management strategy should respond to changing market uncertainties, and the differences in this response based on the contract type. I find that when the exercise price of the contract is high, a higher contract market dependence is the best response to the increasing demand correlation or spot price variability. However, a lower contract market dependence is the best response to the same when the exercise price is low. Managerially, these results are important because they imply that the supply management strategy adopted as a response to a change in the business environment should differ depending on the contract type.

As such, we examine the conditions under which GCs may stray from their primary role as gatekeepers. Mainly, we empirically investigate claims that compensation can impair the independence or compromise the professional judgment of a GC. We measure the level of compensation using the GC’s presence or absence in the top five officers of the firm by compensation. Results are consistent with GCs straying from their role as gatekeepers, to some extent, when highly compensated in a manner similar to the CEO and CFO. In particular, firms with highly compensated GCs have lower financial reporting quality and more aggressive accounting practices, including management of the litigation reserve. However, the results also show that highly compensated GCs play an important gatekeeping role in keeping the firm in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles.

To demonstrate the efficacy of the approach for a specific, complex market, we introduce a compact bidding language for TV advertising markets and investigate the resulting winner-determination problem and the computation of core payments. For realistic instances of the respective winner-determination problems, very good solutions with a small integrality gap can be found quickly, although closing the integrality gap to find marginally better solutions or prove optimality can take a prohibitively large amount of time. Our subsequent adaptation of a constraint-generation technique for the computation of bidder-optimal core payments to this environment is a practically viable paradigm by which core-selecting auction designs can be applied to large markets with potentially hundreds of items. Such auction designs allow bidders to express their preferences with a low number of parameters, while at the same time providing incentives for truthful bidding.

We focus on two research questions: Can the adaptive base stock policy explain cross-sectional ordering behaviors under sales growth? To the extent that the adaptive base stock policy fails to explain ordering behaviors under sales growth, are there frictions that explain such a finding? Our empirical results demonstrate disparities in ordering behaviors between firms experiencing high and moderate sales growth. Contrary to theoretical prediction, this implies that inventory purchases are a function of not only current sales and changes in sales forecast but also past sales growth. As potential explanations for this departure from theoretical prediction, we show that both future demand dynamics and inventory holding risks depend on past sales growth. In addition, we find that firms' inventory holding risks may also be affected by purchasing constraints imposed by supply chain contracts.

On the other hand, low-end consumers may find a brand more attractive if high-end consumers use it. In this paper, we analyze how social effects and market structure can influence the branding of conspicuous goods. Consistent with intuition, our theoretical analysis shows that a monopolist would prefer not to use umbrella branding when consumers’ desire for uniqueness is high. By contrast, in a competitive market, umbrella branding is more profitable than individual branding when consumers have a high level of desire for uniqueness. We also identify conditions in which it is optimal for marketers of conspicuous goods to adopt either an individual branding strategy or asymmetric branding strategies. Furthermore, competing firms may offer umbrella branding even when both firms may be better off if they could commit to using individual branding. Finally, we extend the model to consider a market where consumers’ product preference is not related to social status.

The predation effect increases competition before potential bankruptcy as the nondistressed competitor behaves as if it has some first-mover advantage that could benefit a supplier with price control. The bail-out effect reflects the supplier’s incentive to grant the distressed firm concessions to preserve competition, improving supply chain efficiency and providing support for the exclusivity rule in Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code when the supplier and the distressed firm are financially linked. The abetment effect is that the supplier may deliberately abet the competitor’s predation, leading to increased operational disadvantages for the distressed firm before bankruptcy. Together these effects stress that a firm’s bankruptcy potential can hurt its competitors and benefit its suppliers/customers.

A variety of nonparametric, semiparametric, and parametric approaches, ranging from resampling-based inference to ego-level random effects to logistic regression to survival models, yield close to identical, statistically and economically significant estimates of peer influence in the general population of a freemium social network. Our estimates show that peer influence causes more than a 60% increase in odds of buying the service due to the influence coming from an adopting friend. In addition, we find that users with a smaller number of friends experience stronger relative increase in the adoption likelihood due to influence from their peers as compared to the users with a larger number of friends.

We postulate a mechanism involving risk aversion and learning, which can induce this interaction effect, and test this against several alternative explanations.

Given that responsiveness to quality decreases with variability, it is better for the firm to focus quality improvement efforts on customers experiencing low variability; increasing average quality by 1% lowers termination by 1.1% for low-variability households, but only by 0.41% for high-variability households.<i>This paper was accepted by Gérard Cachon, marketing</i>.", "ex:volume": "61", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Service Quality Variability and Termination Behavior", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2105", "ex:pages": "2739-2759", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": ["Marketing", "Service quality", "Economics", "Econometrics", "Dynamic programming", "Applications", "Customer retention"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "S.

However, little is known about how lobbying influences the policy decisions made by federal agencies.

Disease group lobbying for NIH funding has been controversial, with critics alleging that it distorts public funding toward research on diseases backed by powerful groups. Our data reveal that lobbying is associated with higher political support, in the form of congressional “soft earmarks” for the diseases. Lobbying increases with disease burden and is more likely to be associated with changes in NIH funding for diseases with higher scientific opportunity, suggesting that it may have a useful informational role. Only special grant mechanisms that steer funding toward particular diseases, which comprise less than a third of the NIH’s grants, are related to earmarks. Thus, our results suggest that lobbying by private groups influences federal funding for biomedical research.

To gain insights into reducing this waiting time, we study operations in the inpatient wards and their interface with the ED. We focus on understanding the effect of inpatient discharge policies and other operational policies on the time-of-day waiting time performance, such as the fraction of patients waiting longer than six hours in the ED before being admitted. Based on an empirical study at a Singaporean hospital, we propose a novel stochastic processing network with the following characteristics to model inpatient operations: (1) A patient’s service time in the inpatient wards depends on that patient’s admission and discharge times and length of stay. The service times capture a two-time-scale phenomenon and are not independent and identically distributed. (2) Pre- and post-allocation delays model the extra amount of waiting caused by secondary bottlenecks other than bed unavailability, such as nurse shortage. (3) Patients waiting for a bed can overflow to a nonprimary ward when the waiting time reaches a threshold, where the threshold is time dependent. We show, via simulation studies, that our model is able to capture the inpatient flow dynamics at hourly resolution and can evaluate the impact of operational policies on both the daily and time-of-day waiting time performance. In particular, our model predicts that implementing a hypothetical policy can eliminate excessive waiting for those patients who request beds in mornings. This policy incorporates the following components: a discharge distribution with the first discharge peak between 8 <sc>a.m.</sc> and 9 <sc>a.m.</sc> and 26% of patients discharging before noon, and constant-mean allocation delays throughout the day.

We do this by first demonstrating the extent to which purchase shares of the top two national brands across six different categories vary across markets, accounts (defined as chain–market interactions) and stores: market-level variation accounts for approximately 30% of the weekly purchase share variation across stores, whereas account-level and store-level variation explain an additional 13% and 5% of the variation, respectively.

We also examine how the proximity to a brand’s city of origin, the assortment share of a store’s private label, the extent of retail competition, and the demographics of the store’s neighborhood affect the purchase share’s sensitivity to the point-of-sale marketing mix, revealing several subtle effects. Finally, we measure the extent to which the variation in top national-brand purchase shares is explained by these five factors.

In markets reaching saturation, firms are trapped in a prisoner’s dilemma: the greater investments create more value, but this does not translate into greater value capture because the value created relative to competitors does not change. We also examine the (dis)advantages for a firm of having open or closed interfaces for the component it sells when the environment is competitive as well as how this is related to the endogenous emergence of two-sided platforms.<i>This paper was accepted by Bruno Cassiman, business strategy.</i>", "ex:volume": "62", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Equilibrium Innovation Ecosystems: The Dark Side of Collaborating with Complementors", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2140", "ex:pages": "534-549", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Systems competition", "Complementary products", "Interoperability", "Coopetition", "Exclusivity", "Endogenous two-sided platform"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Andrea Mantovani", "ex:email": "a.mantovani@unibo.it"}, {"ex:name": "Francisco Ruiz-Aliseda", "ex:email": "francisco.ruiz-aliseda@polytechnique.edu"}]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "To investigate the opportunity for hospitals to achieve better care at lower cost, we examine two key process quality measures, conformance quality and experiential quality, and two measures of performance, readmission rate and cost per discharge. Conformance quality represents a hospital’s level of adherence to evidence-based standards of care, whereas experiential quality represents the level of interaction between hospital’s caregivers and patients. Analyzing six years of data from 3,474 U.S. acute care hospitals, we find that combining conformance and experiential quality results in lower readmission rates. However, conformance quality and experiential quality each independently increase cost per discharge, which suggests that a readmissions–costs trade-off is unavoidable. To investigate this further, we conduct post hoc analyses by distinguishing between the granular elements of experiential quality (EQ) based on task type: response-focused EQ and communication-focused EQ. Response-focused EQ measures caregivers’ ability to respond to patient’s explicit needs, whereas communication-focused EQ measures caregivers’ ability to engage in meaningful conversations with the patient. We find that combining communication-focused EQ with conformance quality reduces readmission rates. Moreover, as conformance quality increases, the cost of improving communication-focused EQ decreases, indicating complementarity. Response-focused EQ in combination with conformance quality also results in reduced readmission rates. However, as conformance quality increases, the cost of improving response-focused EQ also increases, suggesting that these dimensions might compete for resources.

By contrast, among competing retailers, grocery stores experience the most significant loss (20% weekly revenue) mostly from fewer store visits, with a much smaller impact attributable to per-visit expenditure.

This finding is consistent with CEOs receiving a compensation premium for bearing this risk since CEOs experience large personal costs if their firms later become financially distressed. Second, financial distress risk is associated with the incentives provided to new CEOs; distress risk is positively associated with pay-performance sensitivity and equity-based compensation and is negatively associated with cash bonuses.

In particular, the seller chooses between two pricing strategies, markdown or everyday low price, and determines the optimal prices and inventory level. Two salient behavioral motives that impact consumers’ purchase decisions and the seller’s optimal strategies are anticipated regret and misperception of product availability. Regret arises when a consumer initially chooses to wait but encounters stockout later, or when the consumer buys the product at the high price but realizes that the product is still available at the markdown price. In addition, consumers often perceive the product’s future availability to be different than its actual availability. We determine and quantify that both regret and availability misperception have significant operational and profit implications for the seller. For example, ignoring these behavioral factors can result in up to 10% profit losses. We contrast the roles of consumers’ strategic (pecuniary) motives with their behavioral (nonpecuniary) motives in affecting purchase, pricing, and inventory decisions. The presence of the behavioral motives reinstates the profitability of markdown over everyday low price, in sharp contrast to prior studies of only strategic motives that suggest the contrary. We characterize how and why strategic versus behavioral motives affect decisions in distinctive manners. In doing so, this paper also introduces and determines the <i>behavioral</i> benefits of pricing in leveraging consumers’ behavioral regularities.

The standard mathematical formulation for a bandit problem makes the strong assumption that the decision maker has a full characterization of the joint distribution of the rewards, and that “arms” under this distribution are independent. These assumptions are not satisfied in many applications, and the out-of-sample performance of policies that optimize a misspecified model can be poor. Motivated by these concerns, we formulate a robust bandit problem in which a decision maker accounts for distrust in the nominal model by solving a worst-case problem against an adversary (“nature”) who has the ability to alter the underlying reward distribution and does so to minimize the decision maker’s expected total profit. Structural properties of the optimal worst-case policy are characterized by using the robust Bellman (dynamic programming) equation, and arms are shown to be no longer independent under nature’s worst-case response. One implication of this is that index policies are not optimal for the robust problem, and we propose, as an alternative, a robust version of the Gittins index. Performance bounds for the robust Gittins index are derived by using structural properties of the value function together with ideas from stochastic dynamic programming duality. We also investigate the performance of the robust Gittins index policy when applied to a Bayesian webpage design problem.

We use this notion of structural virality to analyze a unique data set of a billion diffusion events on Twitter, including the propagation of news stories, videos, images, and petitions. We find that across all domains and all sizes of events, online diffusion is characterized by surprising structural diversity; that is, popular events regularly grow via both broadcast and viral mechanisms, as well as essentially all conceivable combinations of the two. Nevertheless, we find that structural virality is typically low, and remains so independent of size, suggesting that popularity is largely driven by the size of the largest broadcast. Finally, we attempt to replicate these findings with a model of contagion characterized by a low infection rate spreading on a scale-free network. We find that although several of our empirical findings are consistent with such a model, it fails to replicate the observed diversity of structural virality, thereby suggesting new directions for future modeling efforts.<i>This paper was accepted by Lorin Hitt, information systems.</i>", "ex:volume": "62", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "The Structural Virality of Online Diffusion", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2158", "ex:pages": "180-196", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Twitter", "Diffusion", "Viral media"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Sharad Goel", "ex:email": "scgoel@stanford.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Ashton Anderson", "ex:email": "ashton@cs.stanford.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Jake Hofman", "ex:email": "jmh@microsoft.com"}, {"ex:name": "Duncan J.

For fast storage (a storage facility that can both be fully emptied and filled up in one decision period), we show analytically that negative prices can substantially alter the optimal storage policy structure, e.g., all else being equal, it can be optimal to empty an almost empty storage facility and fill up an almost full one. For more typical slow grid-level electricity storage, we numerically establish that ignoring negative prices could result in a considerable loss of value when negative prices occur more than 5% of the time. Negative prices raise another possibility: rather than storing surpluses, a merchant might buy negatively priced electricity surpluses and dispose of them, e.g., using load banks.

The total cost is then allocated to producers based on metrics such as their return shares by weight. Such weight-based proportional allocation mechanisms are criticized in practice for not taking into account the heterogeneity in the costs imposed by different producers’ products. The consequence is cost allocations that impose higher costs on certain producer groups than they can achieve independently. This may lead some producers to break away from collective systems, resulting in fragmented systems with higher total cost. Yet cost efficiency is a key legislative and producer concern.

Subjects from environments that support cooperation are more prosocial, more likely to punish selfishness, and more trusting in general.

The goal of this study is to provide recommendations that address the quality problem with minimal testing. Interestingly, some intuitive interventions—such as providing stations with better infrastructure (e.g., storage and refrigeration facilities) or subsidizing testing costs—could hurt the quality of milk in the presence of competition.

We counter free-riding by applying a credible threat of individual testing (although not its actual use in equilibrium). We then propose two interventions to combat the harmful competition among stations. The novelty of our proposals lies in utilizing the force of competition to solve a problem created by competition. The incentives in our proposals provide a new tool for the stations to compete and convert the harmful effect of competition (quality reduction) into a beneficial one (quality improvement), resulting in a socially desirable equilibrium outcome: all the farmers provide high-quality milk and each competing station conducts only one mixed test and no further testing.<i>This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management</i>.", "ex:volume": "62", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Milking the Quality Test: Improving the Milk Supply Chain Under Competing Collection Intermediaries", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2171", "ex:pages": "1259-1277", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Milk supply chain", "Adulteration", "Competition", "Inspection", "Moral hazard"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Liying Mu", "ex:email": "muliying@udel.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Milind Dawande", "ex:email": "milind@utdallas.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Xianjun Geng", "ex:email": "geng@utdallas.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Vijay Mookerjee", "ex:email": "vijay@utdallas.edu"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "For many consumer-intensive (i.e., business-to-consumer) services, delivering memorable customer experiences is a source of competitive advantage.

Our analysis expands the current understanding of the price-setting newsvendor model, incorporating the external influence from the government, who is now an additional player in the system. We quantify how demand uncertainty impacts the various players (government, industry, and consumers) when designing policies. We further show that, for convex demand functions, an increase in demand uncertainty leads to higher production quantities and lower prices, resulting in lower profits for the supplier. With this in mind, one could expect consumer surplus to increase with uncertainty. In fact, we show that this is not always the case and that the uncertainty impact on consumer surplus depends on the trade-off between lower prices and the possibility of underserving customers with high valuations.

More recently (in Italy mainly during the last decade), many countries liberalized the service provision of public transportation. Although offering local public transportation is a political and financial duty of governments, the service provision is outsourced to a private operator, while the government retains a control position, given to a regulatory agency. This is a common scheme not only in transportation. In close collaboration with the public transportation agency of the city of Bologna, Italy, we designed a methodology to optimize some aspects of the contractual relationship between that agency and the bus operator. We focus on the fines specified by the contract when the operator fails to comply with the service level it has agreed to provide, and on a procedure to measure that service level. Our approach has the advantage that it aligns the incentives of both parties to the benefit of bus riders. We model the agency–operator relationship as a multistage game and find its equilibrium to establish the best operating regime. The game-theoretical approach provides expressions for the fines that the operator should be charged if it does not satisfy the contracted services, and for the optimal agency’s budget to devote to control activities. Second, to check the compliance of the operator with the schedule specified by the contract in a resource-efficient way, we compute how to position the agency’s employees to verify if buses are running according to the specifications of the contract. This is achieved by counting bus services and by checking other quality indicators. We formulate this NP-hard problem as a mixed integer linear program and propose an algorithm to solve it that is effective in providing itineraries for the controllers working for the agency.<i>This paper was accepted by Dimitris Bertsimas, optimization.</i>", "ex:volume": "62", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Design and Control of Public-Service Contracts and an Application to Public Transportation Systems", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2174", "ex:pages": "1165-1187", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Integer programming application", "Public transportation", "Transit systems", "Vehicle routing", "Economics", "Game theory and bargaining theory"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Andrea Lodi", "ex:email": "andrea.lodi@unibo.it"}, {"ex:name": "Enrico Malaguti", "ex:email": "enrico.malaguti@unibo.it"}, {"ex:name": "Nicolás E.

Each supplier faces an exogenous random shock that may result in an order default. Each of them also has access to a recourse fund that can mitigate this risk. The suppliers can share the fund resources within an alliance, but they need to equitably allocate the profits of the alliance among the partners. In this context, suppliers need to decide whether to join larger alliances that have better chances of order fulfillment or smaller ones that may grant them higher profit allocations. We first analytically characterize the exact coalition-proof Nash-stable coalition structures that would arise for symmetric complementary or substitutable suppliers. Our analysis reveals that it is the appeal of default risk mitigation, rather than competition reduction, that motivates cooperation. In general, a riskier and/or less fragmented supply base favors larger alliances, whereas substitutable suppliers and customer demands with lower pass-through rates result in smaller ones. We then characterize the stable coalition structures for an asymmetric supplier base. We establish that grand coalition is more stable when the supplier base is more homogeneous in terms of their risk levels, rather than divided among a few highly risky suppliers and other low-risk ones. Going one step further, our investigation of endogenous recourse fund levels for the suppliers demonstrates how financing costs affect suppliers’ investments in risk-reducing resources and, consequently, their coalition formation strategy.

This suggests that a supplier should be indifferent between the two contracts. However, the sequence and magnitude of costs and revenues (i.e., losses and gains) vary significantly between the contracts, suggesting the supplier’s preference of contract type, and associated contract parameter values, may vary with the level of loss aversion. We investigate this phenomenon through two studies. The first is a preliminary study investigating whether human suppliers are indeed indifferent between these two contracts. Using a controlled laboratory experiment, with human subjects taking on the role of the supplier having to choose between contracts, we find that contract preferences change with the ratio of overage and underage costs for the channel (i.e., the newsvendor critical ratio). In particular, a buyback contract is preferred for products with low critical ratio, whereas revenue sharing is preferred for products with high critical ratio. We show these results are consistent with the behavioral tendency of loss aversion and are more significant for subjects who exhibit higher loss aversion tendencies in an out of context task. In the second (main) study, we examine differences in the performance of buyback and revenue-sharing contracts when suppliers have the authority to set contract parameters. We find that the contract frame influences the way parameters are set and the critical ratio again plays an important role. More specifically, revenue-sharing contracts are more profitable for the supplier than buyback contracts in a high critical ratio environment when accounting for the supplier’s parameter-specification behavior. Also, there is little difference in performance between the two contracts in a low critical ratio environment.

Previous research has shown that retail sales are correlated with the state of the economy. Since retailers source their products from other industries, the sales of their suppliers can also be correlated with the state of the economy. This correlation represents the source of systematic risk for an industry that propagates through a supply chain network. Specifically, we identify the following mechanisms that can affect the correlation between sales and the state of the economy in a supply chain network: propagation of systematic risk into production decisions, aggregation of orders from multiple customers in a supply chain network, and aggregation of orders over time. We find that the first effect does not amplify the correlation; however, the latter two intensify correlation and result in the amplification of correlation upstream in supply networks.

We start by assuming that consumers have a common valuation for the product and consider two product launch settings. In the first setting, the firm does not announce future release technologies and the equilibrium of the game is to release new versions cyclically with a constant level of technology improvement that is optimal for the firm.

Incentive alignment is critical to motivate both information-acquisition and sales efforts. Two popular contract forms are investigated. One is the forecast-based contract (FC) that requires the seller to submit a demand forecast: the seller obtains commissions from the realized sales but is also obliged to pay a penalty for any deviation of the sales from the forecast. The other is the classical menu of linear contracts (MLC), from which the seller can choose a contract that specifies a unique commission rate and a fixed payment. The conventional understanding suggests that the MLC is superior, but it is often assumed that information is exogenously endowed. In contrast, we find that, with an endogenous information-acquisition effort, the MLC may suffer from a conflicted moral hazard effect that creates friction between motivations for the two efforts. The FC can, however, decouple these two tasks and thus dominate the MLC. We further find that when ensuring interim participation is necessary (e.g., renegotiation cannot be prevented after information acquisition), the performance of the FC might be affected by the adverse selection effect because it is unable to effectively separate different types, at which the MLC excels. We show that when the demand and supply mismatch cost is substantial, the conflicted moral hazard effect dominates the adverse selection effect, and the FC is more efficient, and it is the converse otherwise.

These design shortcuts and other maintenance activities contribute to the accumulation of <i>technical debt</i>, that is, a buildup of software maintenance obligations that need to be addressed in the future. We model and empirically analyze the impact of technical debt on system reliability by utilizing a longitudinal data set spanning the 10-year life cycle of a commercial enterprise system deployed at 48 different client firms. We use a <i>competing risks analysis</i> approach to discern the interdependency between client and vendor maintenance activities. This allows us to assess the effect of both problematic client modifications (client errors) and software errors present in the vendor-supplied platform (vendor errors) on system failures. We also examine the relative effects of <i>modular</i> and <i>architectural</i> maintenance activities undertaken by clients in order to analyze the dynamics of technical debt reduction. The results of our analysis first establish that technical debt decreases the reliability of enterprise systems. Second, modular maintenance targeted to reduce technical debt was approximately 53% more effective than architectural maintenance in reducing the probability of a system failure due to client errors, but it had the side effect of increasing the chance of a system failure due to vendor errors by approximately 83% more than did architectural maintenance activities. Using our empirical results we illustrate how firms could evaluate their business risk exposure due to technical debt accumulation in their enterprise systems, and we assess the estimated net effects, both positive and negative, of a range of software maintenance practices.

Three features of online social communication are represented in the model. First, new social media platforms allow for increased connectivity; i.e., they enable sending messages to many more receivers, for the same fixed cost, compared to traditional word of mouth. Second, users contribute content because they derive status- or image-based utility from being listened to by their peers. Third, we capture the role of social differentiation, or how social distance between people affects their preferences for messages. In the model, agents endogenously decide whether to be a sender of information and then compete for the attention of receivers. An important point of this paper is that social communication incentives diminish even as the reach or the span of communication increases. As the span of communication increases, competition between senders for receiver attention becomes more intense, resulting in senders competing with greater equilibrium messaging effort. This in turn leads to lower equilibrium payoffs and the entry of fewer senders. This result provides a strategic rationale for the so-called participation inequality phenomenon, which is a characteristic of many social media platforms. We also show that social differentiation may enhance or deter sender entry depending on whether it can be endogenously influenced by senders. Finally, we examine how the underlying network structure (in terms of its density and its degree distribution) affects communication and uncover a nonmonotonic pattern in that increased connectivity first increases and then reduces the entry of senders.<i>This paper was accepted by Pradeep Chintagunta, marketing</i>.", "ex:volume": "62", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Competing for Attention in Social Communication Markets", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2209", "ex:pages": "2304-2320", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Marketing", "Advertising and media", "Social media", "Social networks"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Ganesh Iyer", "ex:email": "giyer@haas.berkeley.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Zsolt Katona", "ex:email": "zskatona@haas.berkeley.edu"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of capacity provisioning for an online service supported by advertising.

In the first stage of the game, firms choose whether or not to commit to a quantity. In the second stage, each firm that chose to commit sets a quantity, which represents an upper bound on how much it can sell to consumers. In the third stage, both firms set prices strategically, regardless of whether or not they committed. In the final stage, demand is allocated as consumers maximize their utilities. Firm(s) that chose not to commit to a quantity in the first stage can fulfill any quantity that consumers demand at the equilibrium prices.

This <i>symmetric</i> equilibrium allows both firms to avoid the intense price competition associated with low product differentiation.

However, labor markets are usually highly heterogeneous in terms of available task categories; in such scenarios, past performance may not be an accurate signal of future performance. To account for this natural heterogeneity, in this work, we build models that predict the performance of a worker based on prior, category-specific feedback. Our models assume that each worker has a category-specific quality, which is latent and not directly observable; what is observable, though, is the set of feedback ratings of the worker and of other contractors with similar work histories. Based on this information, we provide a series of models of increasing complexity that successfully estimate the worker’s quality. We start by building a binomial model and a multinomial model under the implicit assumption that the latent qualities of the workers are static. Next, we remove this assumption, and we build linear dynamic systems that capture the evolution of these latent qualities over time. We evaluate our models on a large corpus of over a million transactions (completed tasks) from oDesk, an online labor market with hundreds of millions of dollars in transaction volume. Our results show an improved accuracy of up to 25% compared to feedback baselines and significant improvement over the commonly used collaborative filtering approach.

In that case it is often essential that the assignments can be computed very fast.

We find that, compared with the CPC model, the CPA model can better incentivize the publisher to make efforts that can improve the purchase rate. However, the CPA model can cause an adverse selection problem: the winning advertiser tends to have a lower profit margin under the CPA model than under the CPC model. We identify the conditions under which the CPA model leads to higher publisher (or advertiser) payoffs than the CPC model. Whether publishers (or advertisers) prefer the CPA model over the CPC model depends on the advertisers’ risk aversion, uncertainty in the product market, and the presence of advertisers with low immediate sales ratios.

We consider both additive and multiplicative demand forms. This problem is, in general, intractable due to its computational complexity. We develop a simple heuristic that resolves this issue. The heuristic involves a myopic pricing policy that generates each period’s price as a function of the initial inventory level and a base-stock policy for inventory replenishment. In each period, the firm monitors its so-called price-deflated inventory position and places an order to reach a target base-stock level. The price-deflated inventory position weights the on-hand and pipeline inventory according to a factor that reflects the sensitivity of price to the net inventory level. To assess the effectiveness of our heuristic, we construct an upper bound to the exact system. The upper bound is based on an information-relaxation approach and involves a penalty function derived from the proposed heuristic. A numerical study suggests that the heuristic is near-optimal. The heuristic approach can be applied to a wide variety of inventory systems, such as systems with fixed ordering costs or fixed batch sizes. The heuristic enables us to explore the use of price as a lever to balance supply and demand.

We find that agency selling is more efficient than reselling and leads to lower retail prices; however, the e-tailers end up giving control over retail prices to the manufacturer. Therefore, the reaction by the manufacturer, who makes electronic channel pricing decisions based on their impact on demand in the traditional channel (brick-and-mortar retailing), is an important factor for e-tailers to consider. We find that when sales in the electronic channel lead to a negative effect on demand in the traditional channel, e-tailers prefer agency selling, whereas when sales in the electronic channel lead to substantial stimulation of demand in the traditional channel, e-tailers prefer reselling. This preference is mediated by competition between e-tailers—as competition between them increases, e-tailers prefer to use agency selling. We also find that when e-tailers benefit from positive externalities from the sales of the focal product (such as additional profits from sales of associated products), retail prices may be lower under reselling than under agency selling, and the e-tailers prefer reselling under some conditions for which they would prefer agency selling without the positive externalities.<i>This paper was accepted by Chris Forman, information systems.</i>", "ex:volume": "62", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Agency Selling or Reselling?

In light of this controversy, we conduct a series of field experiments whose objective is to provide insight with respect to how readers allocate their attention between a news aggregator and the original articles it links to. Our experiments are based on manipulating elements of the user interface of a Swiss mobile news aggregator. We examine how key design parameters, such as the length of the text snippet that an aggregator displays about articles, the presence of associated images, and the number of related articles on the same story, affect a reader’s propensity to visit the content producer’s site and read the full article. Our findings suggest the presence of a substitution relationship between the amount of information that aggregators offer about articles and the probability that readers will opt to read the full articles at the content producer sites.

In this paper, we develop a family of pricing heuristics that can be used to address all these challenges. Our heuristic is computationally easy to implement; it requires only a single optimization at the beginning of the selling season and automatically adjusts the prices over time. Moreover, to guarantee a strong revenue performance, the heuristic only needs to adjust the prices of a <i>small</i> number of products and do so infrequently. This property helps the seller focus his effort on the prices of the most important products instead of all products. In addition, in the case where not all products are equally admissible to price adjustment (due to existing business constraints such as contractual agreement, strategic product positioning, etc.), our heuristic can immediately substitute the price adjustment of the original products with the price adjustment of similar products and maintain an equivalent revenue performance.

For instance, in September 2013, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act went into full effect. The accompanying transparency requirements have prompted physician practices and hospitals to severely restrict pharmaceutical sales representatives’ direct access to their physicians. Despite all the attention in the popular press, scant scholarly research has investigated how these restrictions on physician access impact physician prescription behavior and competitive detailing to physicians. To analyze the impact of these restrictions, we develop a structural model of how pharmaceutical firms compete dynamically to schedule detailing to physicians. Detailing activities are known to have significant carryover effects that are captured in a first-stage model of physicians’ demand for prescription drugs. We also specify detailing policy functions that describe each firm’s observed detailing actions. In a second stage, we estimate a model that describes costs of detailing, assuming that the observed detailing levels are consistent with a Markov perfect Nash equilibrium. The estimated structural model is used to examine the implications of restrictions on the amount of detailing via counterfactual simulations. We find that restriction policies would increase the market share of a nondrug-treatment-only option but impact firms asymmetrically; firms that are strong in detailing and/or rely more on detailing would be hurt more. Unexpectedly, a policy that imposes a ceiling on detailing frequency could significantly reduce detailing of all firms in the market, including those firms with average detailing levels below the ceiling, and effectively would soften competition between firms and enhance their profits.<i>This paper was accepted by J.

In this paper, we partner with a major telecommunications company to analyze the impact of peer ratings in a real-world video-on-demand market where consumer participation is organic and where movies are costly and well known to consumers. After experimentally changing the initial conditions of product information displayed to consumers, we find that, consistent with the prior literature, peer ratings influence consumer behavior independently from underlying product quality. However, we also find that, in contrast to the prior literature, there is little evidence of long-term bias as a result of herding effects, at least in our setting. Specifically, when movies are artificially promoted or demoted in peer rating lists, subsequent reviews cause them to return to their true quality position relatively quickly. One explanation for this difference is that consumers in our empirical setting likely had more outside information about the true quality of the products they were evaluating than did consumers in the studies reported in prior literature. Although tentative, this explanation suggests that in real-world marketplaces where consumers have sufficient access to outside information about true product quality, peer ratings may be more robust to herding effects and thus provide more reliable signals of true product quality than previously thought.<i>This paper was accepted by Lorin M.

We model a market comprised of an incumbent supply chain facing the possible entry of a competing supply chain. In each supply chain, a retailer sources the product from a manufacturer, and the manufacturers must secure capacity prior to the beginning of the selling season. Due to the superior knowledge of the incumbent retailer about the consumer market, he privately observes a signal about the consumer’s demand, which may be high or low. We first confirm that the retailer cannot credibly share this forecast information only with his manufacturer within the supply chain, since, regardless of the observed signal, the retailer has an incentive to inflate to induce the manufacturer to secure a high capacity level. However, when the information is also shared with the competitor, the incumbent retailer faces the trade-off between the desire to secure an ample capacity level and the fear of intense competition. By making information publicly available, it is possible to achieve truthful information sharing; an incumbent retailer observing a high forecast benefits from the increased capacity level to such an extent that he is willing to engage in intense competition to prove his accountability for the shared information. On the other hand, an incumbent retailer with a low forecast is not willing to engage in intense competition in exchange for the high level of capacity; thus, he truthfully reveals his low forecast to weaken competition. Moreover, we demonstrate that this public information sharing can benefit all the firms in the market as well as consumers.

In recent years, many retailers have added exclusively sourced factory outlet stores into their channel mix to achieve market expansion and customer segmentation. However, the impact of adoption of this lower-quality, lower-price alternative channel on spending at the retailer’s higher-quality, higher-price retail store channel is not clear. Customers adopting the outlet channel might increase their spending in the retail store channel because of the opportunity to become familiar with the brand at a lower price point or transfer of positive associations formed through patronage of the outlet channel to the store channel. Customers adopting the lower-quality channel might also decrease their spending in the retail store channel because of brand dilution or cannibalization. To investigate this issue, we use a unique individual-level panel data set from a specialty apparel retailer from a period during which the retailer opened many factory outlet stores. This allows us to study how purchase behavior changes after customers adopt the outlet channel while carefully controlling for alternative explanations including customer heterogeneity and selection effects. We find that although customers who adopt the outlet channel spend less with the retailer compared to store-only customers, the difference cannot be attributed to the impact of adoption of the outlet channel. After controlling for heterogeneity and selection effects, we uncover a positive spillover to the retail store channel from adoption of the outlet channel. Customers who adopt the outlet channel not only make incremental purchases at the outlet channel, but also increase their spending in the retail store channel after adoption.

Hence, longer wait times may increase uninformed consumers’ perceived quality, and they may still purchase the product, even when the wait time is long. Similarly, short wait times decrease the consumers’ perceived quality, and they may walk away despite the short wait—the “empty restaurant syndrome.” This paper develops and tests a theory of observational learning that predicts these effects.

We measure how these underlying costs influence the efficiency, negotiated prices, and profit distribution across the supply chain, as well as the consistency of these outcomes with existing theory. We find that the structural issue of cost differentials dominates personal characteristics in explaining outcomes, with profits in a tier generally increasing with decreased competition in the tier and increasing with decreased competition in alternate tiers. The balanced principal model of supply chain bargaining does a good job explaining our data, and it outperforms the common assumption of leader–follower negotiations. We find a significant anchoring effect from a firm’s first bid but no effect of the sequence of those bids, no evidence of failure to close via escalation of commitment, and mixed results for a deadline effect. We also find an interesting asymmetry between the buy and sell sides in employed bidding strategy. All firms make predominantly concessionary offers after the initial anchor; however, sell-side firms that engage in aggressive anticoncessionary bidding successfully increase prices while not compromising closure rates. Buy-side firms achieve much smaller price changes from anticoncessionary tactics and risk reduced closure, yielding no net benefit.<i>This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management</i>.", "ex:volume": "62", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Bargaining in Supply Chains", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2273", "ex:pages": "3039-3058", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Bargaining", "Behavioral experiments", "Multiechelon supply chains", "Efficiency and profitability"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Stephen Leider", "ex:email": "leider@umich.edu"}, {"ex:name": "William S.

Because of uncertainty in the data available to a medium-term planner and the dynamics of the mining environment, such targets may not be feasible in the short term.

These findings are incremental to controlling for a firm’s information environment, earnings volatility, and operating leverage.

Choice context can thus influence ex post preference ordering through affecting the incentive to deliberate.
