Consistent with the idea that leverage diminishes the bargaining position of labor, we find that unions are less likely to strike when a firm has high leverage or increases leverage prior to a contract negotiation. We also find large leverage increases after a strike, consistent with the idea that firms intentionally use leverage to improve their bargaining position. This poststrike increase in leverage is particularly pronounced when the union wins the strike. Moreover, we do not find any clear indication that such increases in leverage are linked to changes in investments. In addition, firms that experience a strike subsequently invest more internationally and in right-to-work states where union are afforded fewer legal protections, and they increase their disposal of production units that are located in states where strikes have occurred.<i>This paper was accepted by Brad Barber, finance</i>.", "ex:volume": "62", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Does Capital Structure Affect the Behavior of Nonfinancial Stakeholders?

Signaling is supported through observational learning from displayed deal sales since it reveals how experienced consumers respond to the deal.

Online dating platforms offer new capabilities, such as extensive search, big data–based mate recommendations, and varying levels of anonymity, whose parallels do not exist in the physical world. Yet little is known about the causal effects of these new features. In this study we examine the impact of a particular anonymity feature, which is unique to online environments, on matching outcomes. This feature allows users to browse profiles of other users anonymously, by being able to check out a potential mate’s profile while not leaving any visible online record of the visit. Although this feature may decrease search costs and allow users to search without inhibition, it also eliminates “weak signals” of interest for their potential mates that may play an important role in establishing successful communication. We run a randomized field experiment on a major North American online dating website, where 50,000 of 100,000 randomly selected new users are gifted the ability to anonymously view profiles of other users. Compared with the control group, the users treated with anonymity become disinhibited, in that they view more profiles and are more likely to view same-sex and interracial mates. However, based on our analysis, we demonstrate causally that weak signaling is a key mechanism in achieving higher levels of matching outcomes. Anonymous users, who lose the ability to leave a weak signal, end up having fewer matches compared with their nonanonymous counterparts. This effect of anonymity is particularly strong for women, who tend not to make the first move and instead rely on the counterparty to initiate the communication. Further, the reduction in quantity of matches by anonymous users is not compensated by a corresponding increase in quality of matches.<i>This paper was accepted by Lorin Hitt, information systems</i>.", "ex:volume": "62", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "One-Way Mirrors in Online Dating: A Randomized Field Experiment", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2301", "ex:pages": "3100-3122", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["online dating", "anonymity", "weak signaling", "randomized trial", "field experiment"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Ravi Bapna", "ex:email": "rbapna@umn.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Jui Ramaprasad", "ex:email": "jui.ramaprasad@mcgill.ca"}, {"ex:name": "Galit Shmueli", "ex:email": "galit.shmueli@iss.nthu.edu.tw"}, {"ex:name": "Akhmed Umyarov", "ex:email": "aumyarov@umn.edu"}]}, {"ex:issue": "11", "ex:abstract": "Airlines use robust scheduling to mitigate the impact of unforeseeable disruptions on profits.

Findings reveal that when consumers perceive the firms are horizontally and vertically differentiated, the entrant profits by simultaneously entering the market and establishing an OEM arrangement with the incumbent. In such competitive scenarios, both buyer and seller increase profits by agreeing on wholesale prices that are not too low, which softens both horizontal and vertical conflict between the firms. Findings also show that the incumbent may prefer to pay high wholesale prices to the entrant even if the incumbent had the option to source the product independently at a lower marginal cost. When firms have the capability of producing each other’s product lines, supply relationships between them can still happen in equilibrium. In this case, an interesting result is that firms may optimally select to differentiate production and, because of the OEM relationship, sell the same product qualities to consumers. The reason for this outcome is that the OEM arrangement with differentiated production causes a strategic effect that reduces the firms’ aggressiveness when competing for consumers.

We present four main findings. First, roughly 16% of restaurant reviews on Yelp are filtered. These reviews tend to be more extreme (favorable or unfavorable) than other reviews, and the prevalence of suspicious reviews has grown significantly over time. Second, a restaurant is more likely to commit review fraud when its reputation is weak, i.e., when it has few reviews or it has recently received bad reviews. Third, chain restaurants—which benefit less from Yelp—are also less likely to commit review fraud. Fourth, when restaurants face increased competition, they become more likely to receive unfavorable fake reviews. Using a separate data set, we analyze businesses that were caught soliciting fake reviews through a sting conducted by Yelp.

Clearly, if the patch is not available to everyone, the hacker finds it easier to exploit the vulnerability in the product and, as a result, is likely to alter his effort. To understand the role of a strategic hacker, we build a game-theoretic model, where the hacker’s decision is endogenous. With this model, we find that the hacker’s effort may, on the one hand, decrease the utility that the vendor can extract from the consumers but, on the other hand, may help differentiate the legal version of the product from the pirated version. A vendor can strategically exploit the hacker’s behavior in its pricing and software maintenance decisions. The endogeneity of the hacker’s actions drives several of our findings that have interesting policy implications. For example, the vendor may increase the price and reduce market share to exploit the differentiation.

When a consumer considers purchasing a product in a product category, the consumer can gather information sequentially on several products. At each moment, the consumer can choose which product to gather more information on and whether to stop gathering information and purchase one of the products or to exit the market with no purchase. Given costly information gathering, consumers end up not gathering complete information on all the products and need to make decisions under imperfect information. Under the assumption of constant informativeness of search, we solve for the optimal search, switch, and purchase or exit behavior in such a setting, which is characterized by an optimal consideration set and a purchase threshold structure. This paper shows that a product is only considered for search or purchase if it has a sufficiently high expected utility. Given multiple products in the consumer’s consideration set, the consumer only stops searching for information and purchases a product if the difference between the expected utilities of the top two products is greater than some threshold. Comparative statics show that negative information correlation among products widens the purchase threshold, and so does an increase in the number of the choices. Under our rational consumer model, we show that choice overload can occur when consumers search or evaluate multiple alternatives before making a purchase decision.

Thus, investors exhibit preferences consistent with decreasing relative risk aversion and habit formation.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2317\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2317</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Amit Seru, finance</i>.", "ex:volume": "63", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Risk Aversion and Wealth: Evidence from Person-to-Person Lending Portfolios", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2317", "ex:pages": "279-297", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2017", "ex:keyword": ["risk aversion", "portfolio choice", "crowdfunding"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Daniel Paravisini", "ex:email": "d.paravisini@lse.ac.uk"}, {"ex:name": "Veronica Rappoport", "ex:email": "v.e.rappoport@lse.ac.uk"}, {"ex:name": "Enrichetta Ravina", "ex:email": "er2463@columbia.edu"}]}, {"ex:issue": "12", "ex:abstract": "This study tests whether international financial reporting standards (IFRS) adoption increased accounting transparency based on model-driven hypotheses.

We use data from Portugal between 2006 and 2009 on household Internet penetration and on how much schools use broadband. We use two different sets of instruments for the schools’ broadband use to alleviate endogeneity concerns. Both approaches yield similar results. We find that broadband use at school leads to higher levels of Internet penetration in neighboring households. Broadband use in schools was responsible for a year-over-year increase of 3.5 percentage points on Internet penetration in households with children. Across our data set this effect accounts for about 17% of the increase in home Internet adoption. We also find evidence of regional spillovers in Internet adoption across households. These were roughly responsible for an increase of 2.1 percentage points in Internet penetration or 38% of the total increase in household Internet penetration between 2006 and 2009.

Specifically, we ask whether firms should optimally produce “better” products when consumers are more likely to exchange information. The critical moderating factor in our model is the nature of the communication and what its primary impact is. We first look at WOM that expands awareness of a product. We show that quality may either increase or decrease as WOM expands. The answer depends, in part, on the extent to which the expansion of WOM is one of scale alone or whether it also fundamentally changes the structure of communications. Next, we examine a model in which the primary impact of WOM is to help people to evaluate the utility provided by products with which they are already familiar. Our model suggests that more WOM in this context should always lead to higher-quality products. We demonstrate that the underlying driver of this result is that the elasticity of demand with respect to quality is increasing in the proportion of consumers who are informed about the product’s quality. Taken together, the two models therefore suggest that the firm’s optimal product-policy response to the growth in social interactions depends on both the content and the structure of the underlying conversations. Finally, we compare both WOM models to analogous models of advertising and demonstrate that the firm’s optimal response to a decrease in advertising costs is quite different from that to an increase in WOM. The reason for these differences can be traced back to a fundamental distinction between advertising and WOM: although the former is optimized, the latter is far more random.<i>This paper was accepted by J.

In contrast to the implicit assumption made in the literature that announcements do not directly impact customers’ waiting costs, our key insights show that delay announcements not only impact customers’ beliefs about the system but also directly impact customers’ waiting costs. In particular, customers’ per-unit waiting cost decreases with the offered waiting times associated with the announcements. The results of our counterfactual analysis show that it may not be necessary to provide announcements with very fine granularity.<i>This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management</i>.", "ex:volume": "63", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "How Do Delay Announcements Shape Customer Behavior?

Furthermore, we find that student population and education quality dissipate the effect of athletic success on monetary payoffs. We find that success in basketball carries over more from the past than in football with additional contemporaneous marginal effects for established schools.

It is well known that inventory pooling can greatly reduce inventory costs in a centralized distribution system because it helps reduce aggregate demand uncertainty.

In this paper, we develop a model of a retail merger under uncertain demand that distinguishes between cost savings from conventional economies of scale and those from statistical economies of scale, and we show that these two sources of cost savings have substantially different impacts on firms’ decisions in a postmerger market. Contrary to the existing theory of mergers developed under deterministic demand, we find that although inventory pooling enables the postmerger firm to achieve cost savings, it always induces firms to raise their prices, and we find that marginal cost reduction induces firms to lower their prices only when it is substantial—consequently, larger cost synergies can benefit even nonparticipant firms. Finally, even if a merger induces all firms to raise their prices, it can still improve expected consumer welfare by increasing firms’ service levels under uncertain demand.<i>This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management</i>.", "ex:volume": "63", "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Newsvendor Mergers", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2338", "ex:pages": "298-316", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2017", "ex:keyword": ["price competition", "demand uncertainty", "horizontal merger", "inventory pooling"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Soo-Haeng Cho", "ex:email": "soohaeng@andrew.cmu.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Xin Wang", "ex:email": "xinwang1@andrew.cmu.edu"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "We develop a model to analyze how board governance affects firms’ financial reporting choices and managers’ incentives to manipulate accounting reports.

We demonstrate this pattern in a domain where there is agreement concerning the balance of evidence (pairings of teams according to their seed in a basketball tournament) but individual differences in the perception of the epistemicness/aleatoriness of that domain (Study 1), across a range of domains that vary in their perceived epistemicness/aleatoriness (Study 2), in a single judgment task for which we only vary the degree of randomness with which events are selected (Study 3), and when we prime participants to see events as more epistemic or aleatory (Study 4).
