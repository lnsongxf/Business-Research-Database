[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "We study a new dynamic order acceptance and assignment problem of a make-to-order manufacturing or service system that produces heterogeneous products or services using heterogeneous servers. Unlike traditional dynamic order acceptance and assignment problems, in our settings the system can strategically postpone acceptance and assignment decisions for orders in hand. The system does this while waiting for more profitable orders to come and/or more productive servers to become available, with the risk of losing orders in hand, low server utilization, and high waiting penalties. We formulate this problem as a stochastic dynamic program, characterize the structure of the optimal policy, and discuss managerial insights gained from the optimal policy.

We find increases in historical fill rate to be associated with statistically significant and managerially substantial increases in current retailer orders (i.e., demand, not just sales). Specifically, a one percentage point increase in fill rate, measured over the prior year, is associated with a statistically significant 11% increase in current retailer demand, controlling for other factors that might affect retailer demand.

We develop a framework to guide the joint sourcing strategy that minimizes the long-run average cost under a target service level. A salient feature of our modeling framework is a novel demand model that captures important continuous-time, non-Markovian characteristics of demand surge trajectories. In addition to the total magnitude as typically modeled in the literature, we define several other metrics of surges, including duration, intensity, compactness, peak position, volatility, and frequency. The resulting optimization problem is challenging because it requires evaluating, for any sample path, whether surge demand can be satisfied at every point in time\u2014a refined feature that traditional models do not have. To identify the optimal strategy, we first characterize the optimal production and deployment policy for any given strategy and then transform the original problem into two equivalent but more tractable problems.

We analyze this dynamic allocation problem and find that when warranty claims and consumer returns are jointly taken into account, the remarketing option is generally dominated by the option of refurbishing and earmarking consumer returns to fulfill warranty claims. Over the product\u2019s life cycle, the OEM should strategically emphasize earmarking of consumer returns at the early stages of the life cycle to build up earmarked inventory for the future warranty demand, whereas it should consider remarketing at the later stages of the life cycle after enough earmarked inventory is accumulated or most of the warranty demand uncertainty is resolved. These findings show that, for product categories with significant warranty coverage and refund costs, remarketing may not be the most profitable disposition option even if the product has strong remarketing potential and the OEM has the pricing leverage to tap into this market. We also show that the optimal dynamic disposition policy is a price-dependent base-stock policy where the earmarked quantity is capacitated by the new and refurbished product sales quantities.
