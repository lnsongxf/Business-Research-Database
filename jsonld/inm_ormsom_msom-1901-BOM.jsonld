[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "The bullwhip effect is a phenomenon commonly observed in supply chains. It describes how demand variance amplifies from a downstream site to an upstream site due to demand information distortion. Two different bullwhip effect measures have been used in the literature. Theorists analyze the bullwhip effect based on the <i>information</i> flow (i.e., order and demand information), whereas most empiricists measure it according to the <i>material</i> flow (i.e., shipment and sales data). It is unclear how much the discrepancy between these two measures is, and, if significant, how to reconcile the discrepancy. In this paper, we illustrate and quantify the discrepancy under three inventory systems. For the system with stationary demand and ample supply, we show that the bullwhip effect measure based on the material-flow data is always greater than that based on the information flow. For the system with correlated demand and for the system with supply shortages, we derive conditions under which the material flow measure is either greater or less than the information flow measure. We find that the discrepancy is driven by four factors: stocking level, lead time, demand correlation, and supply service level. We further propose a method to reduce the discrepancy by using the sample variances of aggregated sales data. Our method works for common demand processes with short-range dependence, and it does not require the knowledge of the underlying base-stock levels.", "ex:keywords": ["the bullwhip effect", "information and material flows", "measurement"], "ex:source": "Manufacturing & Service Operations Management", "ex:title": "Measuring the Bullwhip Effect: Discrepancy and Alignment Between Information and Material Flows", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/msom.2016.0590", "ex:pages": "36-51", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "19", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2017", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "li.chen@cornell.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853", "ex:name": "Li Chen"}, {"ex:email": "wluo@iese.edu", "ex:affiliation": "IESE Business School, University of Navarra, 08034 Barcelona, Spain", "ex:name": "Wei Luo"}, {"ex:email": "khshang@duke.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708", "ex:name": "Kevin Shang"}]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "This paper, motivated by a collaboration with a healthcare service provider, focuses on stochastic open-shop service networks with two objectives: more traditional macrolevel measures (such as minimizing total system time or minimizing total number of tardy customers) and the atypical microlevel measure of reducing the incidents of excessively long waits at any workstation within the process. While work-conserving policies are optimal for macrolevel measures, scheduling policies with strategic idleness (SI) might be helpful for microlevel measures. Using the empirical data obtained from the service provider, we provide statistical evidence that SI is used by its schedulers to manage the macro- and microlevel measures. However, the company has no specific rules on implementing SI and the schedulers make decisions based on their own experience. Our primary goal is to develop a systematic framework for the joint usage of SI with dynamic scheduling policies (DSPs). We suggest to use <i>threshold-based policies</i> to intelligently combine SI and DSPs and show that the resulting policies provide an efficient way to simultaneously address both macro- and microlevel measures.

We compare each buyer\u2019s profit under the equal price LCB with the benchmark where each buyer purchases separately from the supplier. We find that although the alliance might obtain a lower wholesale price and although the leader is always better off under equal price LCB, the follower can be worse off if the competition intensity of the leader\u2019s and follower\u2019s products is within an intermediate region. We identify a competition effect resulting from equal price LCB that can place the follower at a disadvantage in the competition. This finding implies that the equal price LCB might not be sustainable in practice. In view of this limitation, we investigate an alternative form of LCB, fixed price LCB, under which the follower pays a fixed price to the leader regardless of the wholesale price the leader obtains from the supplier.

Information resolves two types of uncertainty: product value uncertainty (i.e., consumers realize valuations when they inspect the product in store, but may end up returning the product when they purchase online) and availability uncertainty (i.e., store visits are futile when consumers encounter stockouts). We consider three information mechanisms: <i>physical showrooms</i> allow consumers to learn valuations anytime they visit the store, even during stockouts; <i>virtual showrooms</i> give consumers online access to an imperfect signal of their valuations; <i>availability information</i> provides real-time information about whether the store has a product in stock. Our main results follow. First, physical showrooms may prompt retailers to reduce store inventory, which increases availability risk and discourages store patronage. Second, virtual showrooms may increase online returns and hurt profits, if they induce excessive customer migration from store to online channels. Third, availability information may be redundant when availability risk is low and may render physical showrooms ineffective when implemented jointly.

Thus, simply expanding patient cost sharing is not the solution to overtesting. (ii) Setting a low reimbursement ceiling alone cannot eliminate overtesting. (iii) The joint effect of misdiagnosis concerns and insurance coverage can lead to both overtesting and undertesting even when no reimbursement ceiling exists.

We develop a model of premium room and standby upgrade pricing under an uncertain market size and examine how and when standby upgrades can provide additional revenue for a hotel. When guests are myopic, we show that standby upgrades can be used as a powerful price discrimination tool, especially for hotel properties with high premium-to-standard room ratios. When guests are strategic, the benefit of standby upgrades is significantly diminished; we show that standby upgrades only increase revenue when the hotel property has a low premium-to-standard room ratio.
