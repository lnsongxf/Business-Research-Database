Our findings, using data from one of the largest financial services providers in the United States, indicate that customer sensitivity to service time varies widely and predictably with observable market characteristics. In turn, we find evidence that local operating managers account for market-specific customer sensitivities to service times by deviating frequently and in predictable ways from the recommendations offered by a centralized capacity-planning model. Finally, we document that these discretionary capacity supply decisions exhibit a strong learning effect whereby experienced operating managers place more weight than their less-experienced counterparts on the market-specific trade-off between service capacity costs and customer sensitivity to service times.

Because products are returned under different operational conditions, they usually require different remanufacturing effort/costs. Motivated by a project with a major energy company that manages its inventory through options of ordering and remanufacturing returned products (cores) in various condition, in this paper, we study a single-product, periodic-review inventory system with multiple types of cores. The serviceable products used to fulfill stochastic customer demand can be either manufactured from new parts or remanufactured from the cores, and the objective is to minimize the expected total discounted cost over a finite planning horizon. We show that the optimal manufacturing-remanufacturing-disposal policy has a simple structure and can be completely characterized by a sequence of constant control parameters when manufacturing and remanufacturing leadtimes are the same. To demonstrate the value of the optimal policy, we conduct a numerical study that compares its performance with two simple heuristics, namely, pull policy without and with sorting. The results show that the reduction in system cost by using the optimal policy can be significant.

At the beginning of a planning cycle, the vendor determines a minimum committed order per period. During the cycle, he may also place a supplemental order in each period based on the observed demand signal in that period. Moreover, the vendor is committed to a specific service target evaluated over the planning cycle. This is a complex problem, and we, as an approximation, offer a single-period, two-stage modeling approach. Under this approach, the vendor determines a first-stage order as the minimum committed order with the possibility of supplementing it based on a demand signal observed at the second stage. The problem is to maximize his expected profit subject to a constraint on his overall service performance across all possible values of the demand signal. We characterize the optimal policy for in-stock rate and fill-rate targets, and make comparisons. Whereas in the classical newsvendor model a service target can be replaced by a single unit shortage cost, it is not so in our model. Instead, a set of unit shortage costs are imputed--one for each demand signal. The imputed shortage costs reflect trade-offs among the profits under different demand signals in meeting the service targets. We also show that under a given ordering policy, the in-stock rate is lower (higher) than the fill rate when the demand has an increasing (decreasing) hazard rate. This result suggests that the vendor can infer a fill-rate measure from the corresponding in-stock rate without the difficult task of tracking lost sales.

For the movies considered, our model estimates an increase in the average profit per title for new movies by 15.5% and 2.5% for revenue sharing and standard titles, respectively. We discuss the implications of revenue sharing on the profitability of the rental firm.", "ex:keywords": ["service operations", "supply chain management", "inventory theory and control"], "ex:source": "Manufacturing & Service Operations Management", "ex:title": "Now Playing: DVD Purchasing for a Multilocation Rental Firm", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/msom.1100.0314", "ex:pages": "209-226", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "13", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "opher.baron@rotman.utoronto.ca", "ex:affiliation": "Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3E6, Canada", "ex:name": "Opher Baron"}, {"ex:email": "i.hajizadeh@utoronto.ca", "ex:affiliation": "Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3E6, Canada", "ex:name": "Iman Hajizadeh"}, {"ex:email": "milner@rotman.utoronto.ca", "ex:affiliation": "Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3E6, Canada", "ex:name": "Joseph Milner"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "This paper analyzes optimal auction design when delivery of supply is uncertain. We consider a buyer facing multiple potential suppliers, each having an associated (exogenous) reliability that quantifies its risk of supply failure. We design optimal mechanisms that depend on the buyer's level of information regarding the suppliers' cost of production and reliability. When supplier reliability is known, we find that the optimal allocation resembles the allocation under full information, but with inflated production costs. When it is unknown, the same result is true when cost and reliability of a supplier are independent. Furthermore, the buyer does not have to pay any rent for information on suppliers' reliability. Moreover, we assess the benefits of the optimal mechanism compared to traditional auctions that ignore supply risk.", "ex:keywords": ["auctions", "supply risk", "information asymmetry"], "ex:source": "Manufacturing & Service Operations Management", "ex:title": "Optimal Procurement Design in the Presence of Supply Risk", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/msom.1100.0319", "ex:pages": "227-243", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "13", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "achaturvedi@iese.edu", "ex:affiliation": "IESE Business School, University of Navarra, 08034 Barcelona, Spain", "ex:name": "Aadhaar Chaturvedi"}, {"ex:email": "valbeniz@iese.edu", "ex:affiliation": "IESE Business School, University of Navarra, 08034 Barcelona, Spain", "ex:name": "Victor Martnez-de-Albniz"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Should a firm charge on a per-use basis or sell subscriptions when its service experiences congestion? Queueing-based models of pricing primarily focus on charging a fee per use for the service, in part because per-use pricing enables the firm to regulate congestion--raising the per-use price naturally reduces how frequently customers use a service. The firm has less control over usage with subscription pricing (by definition, with subscription pricing customers are not charged proportional to their actual usage), and this is a disadvantage when customers dislike congestion. However, we show that subscription pricing is more effective at earning revenue. Consequently, the firm may be better off with subscription pricing, even, surprisingly, when congestion is intuitively most problematic for the firm: e.g., as congestion becomes more disliked by consumers. We show that the absolute advantage of subscription pricing relative to per-use pricing can be substantial, whereas the potential advantage of per-use pricing is generally modest. Subscription pricing becomes relatively more attractive if consumers become more heterogeneous in their service rates (e.g., some know they are \"heavy\" users and others know they are \"light\" users) as long as capacity is fixed, the potential utilization is high, and the two segments have substantially different usage rates. Otherwise, heterogeneity in usage rates makes subscription pricing less attractive relative to per-use pricing. We conclude that subscription pricing can be effective even if congestion is relevant for the overall quality of a service.", "ex:keywords": ["service operations", "operations strategy", "pricing and revenue management", "game theory", "queueing theory"], "ex:source": "Manufacturing & Service Operations Management", "ex:title": "Pricing Services Subject to Congestion: Charge Per-Use Fees or Sell Subscriptions?", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/msom.1100.0315", "ex:pages": "244-260", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "13", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "cachon@wharton.upenn.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Operations and Information Management, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104", "ex:name": "Grard P.

Commonality always leads to increased profits, but its effect on the level of product variety depends on the type of commonality. If all common components are used for the production of the entire set of products, then the optimal variety level increases relative to the system with no commonality. However, if the common components are used by a subset of the final products, then the optimal variety level may decrease with commonality. We find that the effects of commonality on profit and variety level are stronger under a demand model in which product demands are more variable and exhibit pairwise negative correlation relative to a model with independent demands.", "ex:keywords": ["supply chain management", "OM-marketing interface", "product variety", "consumer choice", "inventory management"], "ex:source": "Manufacturing & Service Operations Management", "ex:title": "The Role of Component Commonality in Product Assortment Decisions", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/msom.1100.0317", "ex:pages": "261-270", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "13", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "fernando@duke.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708", "ex:name": "Fernando Bernstein"}, {"ex:email": "gurhan.kok@duke.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708", "ex:name": "A.
