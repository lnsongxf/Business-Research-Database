In such cases, if arrival and service rates are independent of queue length, at least one of the queues is unstable and grows indefinitely as time passes. In practice there has to be some factor that limits queue length, and a possible mechanism is to assume that both passengers and taxis become impatient and will leave if, after some fixed amount of time, they have not been “serviced.” The equations governing such a system are developed and steady-state solutions are found. It is shown that steady-state solutions always exist for both queues, the means and variances (which are finite) are given. In the last part of the paper an application to inventory theory is suggested. Here the backlog of orders corresponds to the queue of customers, and items in stock to the idle clerks.

Net profit equivalent is net sales minus variable cost, statistically determined from 52-month data, treating output of the two component groups of products as the independent variable, and their cost, the dependent variable.

The company may enter into coalitions with the customers of the distributors, and bid to supplant the distributors. It may negotiate with other manufacturing companies to supply the distributor customers, thus saving warehousing costs. So can the customers collude among themselves, with other manufacturing companies, etc. These coalitions, simultaneously entered into by the same players, who band together for and against the same party at the same time, in order to achieve joint-profit maximization in a nonzero-sum game, are defined for the first time in this paper as <i>concomitant coalitions</i>.

Over the last several years one such criterion has slowly emerged. It is only a <i>necessary</i> condition, not a sufficient one.
