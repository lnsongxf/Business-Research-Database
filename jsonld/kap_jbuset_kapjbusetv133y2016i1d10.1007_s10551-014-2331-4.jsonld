[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Ethics training—an important means to foster ethical decision-making in organisations—is carried out formally as well as informally. There are mixed findings as regards the effectiveness of formal versus informal ethics training. This study is one of its first kinds in which we have investigated the effectiveness of ethics training as it is carried out in the Indian IT sector. We have collected the views of Indian IT industry professionals concerning ethics training (N = 266), and employed positivist (regression analysis and hierarchical linear modeling) and interpretive research (content analysis). We first have argued that the importance of the perception towards ethics has bearings not only on the individual ideologies but also on the organisational ethical values. In doing so, first we have conceptualised a theoretical framework: Perception of Ethics Training in Employees and Organisations (PETINEO). Second, we have studied the correlations between various components of this model. Third, we, under the rubric of PETINEO, examined the effectiveness of ethics training programmes for the Indian IT companies. Fourth, we have elaborated upon the results of our study. Our results suggest that the combination of both formal and informal means to undertake ethics training has superior impact on ethical decision-making in the Indian IT industry as compared to the use of any one of them in isolation.", "ex:volume": "133", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Ethics Training in the Indian IT Sector: Formal, Informal or Both?", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2331-4", "ex:pages": "73-93", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "﻿Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Perception of Ethics Training in Employees and Organisations (PETINEO)", "Formal and informal ethics training", "Individual ideologies", "Corporate ethical values", "Indian IT sector"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Pratima Verma", "ex:email": "verma_pratima@yahoo.com"}, {"ex:name": "Siddharth Mohapatra", "ex:email": "siddharth.mohapatra@mail.com"}, {"ex:name": "Jan Löwstedt", "ex:email": "jlo@sbs.su.se"}]}]
