[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Social networking sites (SNS) have challenged ethical issues about users’ information security and privacy. SNS users are concerned about their privacy and need to control the information they share and its use. This paper examines the security of SNS by taking a look at the influence of users’ perceived control of information over their information-sharing behaviors. Employing an empirical study, this paper demonstrates the importance of perceived control in SNS users’ information-sharing behaviors. Specifically, perceived control has been found to be negatively related to perceived privacy risk and attitude toward information sharing, which in turn has an impact on their information-sharing behaviors. In addition, gender has been shown to be an important factor that moderates the influences of both perceived control and perceived privacy risk on SNS users’ attitudes toward information sharing. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.", "ex:volume": "133", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Exploring the Security of Information Sharing on Social Networking Sites: The Role of Perceived Control of Information", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2346-x", "ex:pages": "111-123", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Perceived control", " Privacy risk", " Information sharing", " Social networking sites", " Gender difference"], "ex:creator": ["Nick Hajli", "Xiaolin Lin"]}]
