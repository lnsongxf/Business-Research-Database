[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Despite the reasonable explanatory power of existing models of consumers’ ethical decision making, a large part of the process remains unexplained. This article draws on previous research and proposes an integrated model that includes measures of the theory of planned behavior, personal norms, self-identity, neutralization, past experience, and attitudinal ambivalence. We postulate and test a variety of direct and moderating effects in the context of a large scale survey study in London, UK. Overall, the resulting model represents an empirically robust and holistic attempt to identify the most important determinants of consumers’ support for the fair-trade movement. Implications and avenues for further research are discussed.", "ex:volume": "133", "ex:title": "Socio-Cognitive Determinants of Consumers’ Support for the Fair Trade Movement", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2347-9", "ex:pages": "95-109", "ex:keywords": ["Attitude–behavior gap", "Consumer ethical decision making", "Ethical consumerism", "Fair trade", "Theory of planned behavior"], "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Andreas Chatzidakis", "ex:email": "andreas.chatzidakis@rhul.ac.uk"}, {"ex:name": "Minas Kastanakis", "ex:email": "mkastanakis@escpeurope.eu"}, {"ex:name": "Anastasia Stathopoulou", "ex:email": "a.stathopoulou@bbk.ac.uk"}]}]
