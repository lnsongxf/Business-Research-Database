[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract This study examines the impact of Islamic Work Ethic (IWE) on organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) and knowledge-sharing behaviors (KSBs) among university employees in Pakistan. A total of 215 respondents from public sector educational institutions participated in this research. The findings suggest that IWE has a positive effect on OCBs. In other words, individuals with high IWE demonstrate more citizenship behaviors than those with low IWE. The findings also suggest a positive effect of IWE on KSBs. Individuals with high IWE exhibit more KSBs than those with low IWE. The paper also discusses the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.", "ex:volume": "133", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Impact of Islamic Work Ethics on Organizational Citizenship Behaviors and Knowledge-Sharing Behaviors", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2396-0", "ex:pages": "325-333", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Islamic Work Ethic", " Knowledge-sharing behaviors", " Organizational citizenship behaviors"], "ex:creator": ["Ghulam Murtaza", "Muhammad Abbas", "Usman Raja", "Olivier Roques", "Afsheen Khalid", "Rizwan Mushtaq"]}]
