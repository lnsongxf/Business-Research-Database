[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract In this paper we investigate whether independent directors’ attendance at board meetings enhances investor protection using a difference-in-difference approach. We find that independent directors’ attendance alleviates tunneling. This effect is more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs) than in state-owned enterprises. The reinforcement of external supervision substitutes for the role of independent directors’ attendance and this substitution effect is more significant in non-SOEs. Together, these results imply that independent directors’ attendance at board meetings can play an important role in protecting investors, especially in non-SOEs and when external supervision is weak. This paper sheds new light on independent directors’ function in corporate governance, and has implications for institutional improvements.", "ex:volume": "133", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Removing Vacant Chairs: Does Independent Directors’ Attendance at Board Meetings Matter?", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2402-6", "ex:pages": "375-393", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "﻿Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["China", "Corporate governance", "Independent directors", "Investor protection"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Huilong Liu", "ex:email": "liuhuilong@gsm.pku.edu.cn"}, {"ex:name": "Hong Wang", "ex:email": "hongwang@pku.edu.cn"}, {"ex:name": "Liansheng Wu", "ex:email": "wuls@gsm.pku.edu.cn"}]}]
