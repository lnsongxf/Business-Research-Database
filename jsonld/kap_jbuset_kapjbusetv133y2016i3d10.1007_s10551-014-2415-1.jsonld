[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Abstract The model emphasizes the ethical dynamics of compassion in hospitality settings by suggesting that under an organizational ethical climate, the hotel staff will be more morally aware of peers’ pain and suffering, and motivated to participate in delivering compassion. Based on the positive psychology focus on compassion as individual states and traits supporting interpersonal dealings, the paper operationalizes compassion based on four individual factors involved in the compassionate process: (a) empathic concern, or an other-oriented emotional response elicited by and congruent with the perceived welfare of a person in need; (b) mindfulness, a state of consciousness in which attention is focused on present-moment phenomena occurring both externally and internally; (c) kindness, or understanding the pain or suffering of others; and (d) common humanity, or seeing others’ experiences as part of the larger human experience. Data were collected from 280 employees at ten hotels in the Canary Islands (Spain). With the exception of self-interest, results of multiple linear regressions demonstrate that each of the six interpreted factors of ethical climate has substantive effects on any of the studied elements of staff compassion. The egoistic-related and principle-related climate factors generated a more consistent and intense compassionate reaction, suggesting that the staff is moved to act out of compassion either to assure that the team succeeds or to support each other out of moral obligation.", "ex:volume": "133", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Exploring the Influence of Ethical Climate on Employee Compassion in the Hospitality Industry", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2415-1", "ex:pages": "605-617", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "﻿Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Compassion", "Ethical climate", "Empathic concern", "Mindfulness", "Common humanity"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Pablo Zoghbi-Manrique-de-Lara", "ex:email": "pablo.zoghbi@ulpgc.es"}, {"ex:name": "Rita Guerra-Baez", "ex:email": "rita.guerra@ulpgc.es"}]}]
