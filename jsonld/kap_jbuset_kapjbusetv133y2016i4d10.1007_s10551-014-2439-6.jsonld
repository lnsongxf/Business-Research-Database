[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Abstract This editorial to the special issue addresses the often overlooked question of the ethical nature of social enterprises. The emerging social entrepreneurship literature has previously been dominated by enthusiasts who fail to critique the social enterprise, focusing instead on its distinction from economic entrepreneurship and potential in solving social problems. In this respect, we have found through the work presented herein that the relation between social entrepreneurship and ethics needs to be problematized. Further, we find that a range of conceptual lenses and methodological approaches is valuable as the social entrepreneurship field matures.", "ex:volume": "133", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Social Entrepreneurship and Business Ethics: Does Social Equal Ethical?", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2439-6", "ex:pages": "619-625", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Social entrepreneurship", " Ethics", " Social innovation", " Scaling"], "ex:creator": ["Elizabeth Chell", "Laura J.
