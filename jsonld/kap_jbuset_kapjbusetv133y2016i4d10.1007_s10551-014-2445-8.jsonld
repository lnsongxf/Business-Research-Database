[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Abstract This paper advances the conception of social entrepreneurs as caring entrepreneurs. We argue that the care ethics of social entrepreneurs, implying the pursuit of caring goals through caring processes, can be challenged when they engage in the process of scaling up their ventures. We propose that social entrepreneurs can sustain their care ethics as the essential dimension of their venture only if they are able to build a caring enterprise. Organizational care designates the set of organizing principles that facilitate the embedding of care ethics at an organizational level, beyond the imprinting induced by social entrepreneurs’ personal ethics.", "ex:volume": "133", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "From Caring Entrepreneur to Caring Enterprise: Addressing the Ethical Challenges of Scaling up Social Enterprises", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2445-8", "ex:pages": "659-675", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "﻿Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Ethics of care", "Social entrepreneurship", "Scaling up", "Organizational care"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Kevin André", "ex:email": "andrek@essec.fr"}, {"ex:name": "Anne-Claire Pache"}]}]
