[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Abstract This paper analyzes how national institutions impact corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the food-processing industries of France and Morocco. In this study, CSR practices are defined around two main dimensions: corporate performance (financial vs. global) and the CSR approach (defensive vs. active). Qualitative data were collected during semi-structured interviews with SME managers in charge of CSR issues. We then performed a content analysis. Our study shows that there is a distinct difference between the CSR practices adopted by SMEs in France and Morocco. Indeed, the findings suggest that under the rule-based governance system of France, most SMEs view CSR as an economic tool and it is adopted as an opportunity-seeking perspective anchored in the search for global performance. The findings also show that under the relationship-based governance system of Morocco, SMEs mainly see CSR from a constraint-reducing perspective. However, some Moroccan SMEs have begun to see the economic opportunities of CSR, especially in accessing foreign markets.", "ex:volume": "134", "ex:title": "Influence of National Institutions on the Corporate Social Responsibility Practices of Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises in the Food-processing Industry: Differences Between France and Morocco", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2417-z", "ex:pages": "117-133", "ex:keywords": ["National institutions", "SMEs", "CSR", "Food-processing industry", "France", "Morocco"], "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Jamal Baz", "ex:email": "j.elbaz@uiz.ac.ma"}, {"ex:name": "Issam Laguir", "ex:email": "i.laguir@montpellier-bs.com"}, {"ex:name": "Magalie Marais", "ex:email": "m.marais@montpellier-bs.com"}, {"ex:name": "Raffaele Staglian√≤", "ex:email": "r.stagliano@montpellier-bs.com"}]}]
