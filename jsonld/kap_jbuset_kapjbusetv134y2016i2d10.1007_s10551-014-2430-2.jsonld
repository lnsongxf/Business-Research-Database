[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract The concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has been the subject of several academic contributions, but in the health sector the development of an interest in this subject is very recent. Although many practices in healthcare are already socially responsible, progressing from a series of socially responsible behaviours to a socially responsible organization entails a more consolidated awareness of the health sector’s mission and the needs of its participants. In this paper, we will review the different studies published that address the relationship between the healthcare sector’s corporate responsibility and society, with the aims of individuating the prevailing foci that are emerging and categorizing the proposed contributions according to these foci: social responsibility and organization; social responsibility and social impact; social responsibility and competitiveness. Finally, the paper finishes with a personal definition of CSR and its correlated ethical roots.", "ex:volume": "134", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "What is the CSR’s Focus in Healthcare?", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2430-2", "ex:pages": "323-334", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Corporate social responsibility", " Healthcare", " Local community", " Appropriateness", " Social impact", " Competitiveness"], "ex:creator": ["Fabrizio Russo"]}]
