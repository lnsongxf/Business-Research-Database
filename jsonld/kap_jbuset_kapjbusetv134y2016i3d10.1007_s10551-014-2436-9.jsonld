[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Ethics are of interest to business scholars because they influence decisions, behaviors, and outcomes. While scholars have increasingly shown interest in business ethics as a research topic, there are a mounting number of studies that examine ethical issues at the organizational level of analysis. This manuscript reports the results of a systematic review of empirical research on organizational ethics published in a broad sample of business journals over a 33-year period (1980â€“2012). A total of 184 articles are analyzed to reveal gaps in the literature and, subsequently, lead to suggestions for future research; this is done in an effort to stimulate and perpetuate high quality research that more broadly impacts business scholars and practitioners.", "ex:volume": "134", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Organizational Ethics Research: A Systematic Review of Methods and Analytical Techniques", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2436-9", "ex:pages": "429-443", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Analytics", " Methods", " Statistics", " Empirical", " Ethics", " Virtues", " Organization", " Firm"], "ex:creator": ["Michael S.
