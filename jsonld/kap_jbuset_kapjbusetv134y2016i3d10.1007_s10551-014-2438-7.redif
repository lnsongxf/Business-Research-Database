[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Abstract This study aims to explore the role of informal leader–member interactions in managing counterproductive work behavior (CWB) in a non-Western context. We propose that under the Chinese background, guanxi with supervisor increases employees’ job satisfaction, which further reduces their CWB. Partial least square structural equation modeling with a sample of 272 Chinese employees confirms this mediating effect of job satisfaction. However, we also find that job satisfaction passes the effect of guanxi with supervisor on to CWB targeting people, but not to CWB targeting the organization. Implications for research on CWB and guanxi with supervisor are discussed.", "ex:volume": "134", "ex:title": "Guanxi with Supervisor and Counterproductive Work Behavior: The Mediating Role of Job Satisfaction", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2438-7", "ex:pages": "413-427", "ex:keywords": ["China", "CWB", "Job satisfaction", "Guanxi", "PLS-SEM", "Social exchange"], "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Long Zhang", "ex:email": "zhangl@hhu.edu.cn"}, {"ex:name": "Yulin Deng", "ex:email": "yulin_d@163.com"}]}]
