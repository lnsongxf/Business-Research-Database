[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Abstract This study uses the institutional perspective to examine the interaction effects between the subnational institutional context and firm-level parameters on corporate environmental behaviors, based on a unique cross-sectional data set of private firms compiled from three different sources in China. Our results suggest that both enforcement stringency of environmental regulations at the provincial-level and private firms’ foreign ownership negatively affect compensation fees, which are levies charged for firms’ emissions. Enforcement stringency also moderates the firm-level relationship between foreign ownership and compensation fees, but such a cross-level moderating effect holds only for private firms with non-HMT (Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan) investments.", "ex:volume": "134", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Environmental Management Under Subnational Institutional Constraints", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2388-0", "ex:pages": "631-648", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Foreign ownership", "Environmental management", "Institutional constraints", "Private firms", "Subnational"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Shujun Ding", "ex:email": "ding@telfer.uottawa.ca"}, {"ex:name": "Chunxin Jia", "ex:email": "cjia@gsm.pku.edu.cn"}, {"ex:name": "Zhenyu Wu", "ex:email": "zhenyu_wu@umanitoba.ca"}, {"ex:name": "Wenlong Yuan", "ex:email": "wenlong.yuan@uleth.ca"}]}]
