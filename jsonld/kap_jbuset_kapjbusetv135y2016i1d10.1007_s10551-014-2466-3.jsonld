[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Abstract In this paper, we draw inferences from the Nobel laureate Amartya Senâ€™s book, The Idea of Justice to inform the organisational justice literature. The extant societal-level theories of justice tend to emphasise aspects that are analogous to either the procedural or distributive dimensions of organisational justice. The Senian idea of comprehensive justice is different in that it synthesises the procedural- and distributive-related dimensions at the societal-level. We theorise that the Senian notion could be applied at the organisational-level to facilitate outcomes that are actually valued by the workforce. Further, we contend that the emphasis on non-parochialism in the Senian notion of justice makes it particularly relevant to the ethics of multi-national corporations (MNCs) operating in alien cultures. To support our contention, we analyse the lean manufacturing practices of a Japanese MNC operating in India. Our case analysis demonstrates how Senian thinking helps one surface unjust outcomes that would otherwise go unacknowledged. Our analysis also offers tentative support to Senian claims about the capacity of human behaviour to undermine well-designed institutions. Concurring with the Senian view, which favours combating manifest injustice rather than fixating over designing perfectly just institutions, we derive some normative implications to advance the cause of striving for outcomes that are actually valued by the workforce.", "ex:volume": "135", "ex:title": "Organisational Justice: A Senian Perspective", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2466-3", "ex:pages": "99-116", "ex:keywords": ["Comprehensive justice", "Lean manufacturing", "MNC ethics", "Rawlsian justice", "Senian justice", "Toyota production system (TPS)", "Valued outcomes and functionings"], "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Samir Shrivastava", "ex:email": "sshrivastava@swin.edu.au"}, {"ex:name": "Robert Jones", "ex:email": "rjones@swin.edu.au"}, {"ex:name": "Christopher Selvarajah", "ex:email": "cselvarajah@swin.edu.au"}, {"ex:name": "Bernadine Gramberg", "ex:email": "bvangramberg@swin.edu.au"}]}]
