[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Abstract The proliferation of public–private partnerships (PPPs) for development as an answer to many public challenges calls for careful evaluation. To this end, tailored frameworks are fundamental for helping understand the PPPs’ impact and for guiding corrective adjustment. Scholars have developed frameworks focusing on the partners’ relationships, the order of effects, and the distinction between outputs and outcomes. To capture a PPP’s complexity and multiple linkages with its environment, we argue that a thorough evaluation should adopt a stakeholder-oriented approach and consider the costs and benefits that a PPP implies for them—especially as taxpayers’ money is (at least partly) involved. For this purpose, we build on a stakeholder-oriented evaluation framework from the nonprofit business partnership literature. In line with our broad evaluation conception, we extend it with the manifold ripple effects that PPPs for development have and include the time dimension for the links between different PPP stages and related outcomes to become clearer. Applying this framework to an illustrative case, we highlight important direct and especially indirect stakeholder outcomes, which a narrow evaluation would omit, point to the challenges involved in the evaluation endeavor, and identify interesting future research areas.", "ex:volume": "135", "ex:title": "Scrutinizing Public–Private Partnerships for Development: Towards a Broad Evaluation Conception", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2730-1", "ex:pages": "71-86", "ex:keywords": ["Public–private partnerships for development", "Cross-sector social partnerships", "Evaluation", "Impact assessment", "Partnership performance"], "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Lea Stadtler", "ex:email": "lea.stadtler@unige.ch"}]}]
