[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Civic engagement in the form of social and moral awareness projects has grown in popularity among higher education practitioners in the past decades, and even more among business schools as a response to the many embarrassingly self-centered business CEO acts in recent years. Research thus far shows a wide variety of advantages tied to social and moral awareness projects, varying from greater understanding of students about the needs in society, and improved connections between the sponsoring institution and the community, to more focus in studentsâ€™ selection of future careers, and greater personal and professional emotional intelligence levels among these students. This article reviews the achievements of 156 undergraduate and graduate business students in regards to their social and moral responsibility projects, and the preferences they displayed in selecting the topics of these projects.", "ex:volume": "135", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Shaping Morally Responsible Leaders: Infusing Civic Engagement into Business Ethics Courses", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2465-4", "ex:pages": "279-291", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Business ethics", "Moral awareness", "Civic engagement", "Service learning", "Business schools", "Leadership"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Joan Marques", "ex:email": "joan.marques@woodbury.edu"}]}]
