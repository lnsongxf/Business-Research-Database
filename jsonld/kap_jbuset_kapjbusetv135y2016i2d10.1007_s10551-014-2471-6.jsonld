[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract This article builds theory at the intersection of ecological sustainability and strategic management literature—specifically, in relation to dynamic capabilities literature. By combining industrial organization economics–based, resource-based, and dynamic capability–based views, it is possible to develop a better understanding of the strategies that businesses may follow, depending on their managers’ assumptions about ecological sustainability. To develop innovative strategies for ecological sustainability, the dynamic capabilities framework needs to be extended. In particular, the sensing–seizing–maintaining competitiveness framework should operate not only within the boundaries of a business ecosystem but in relation to global biophysical ecosystems; in addition, two more dynamic capabilities should be added, namely, remapping and reaping. This framework can explicate core managerial beliefs about ecological sustainability. Finally, this approach offers opportunities for managers and academics to identify, categorize, and exploit business strategies for ecological sustainability.", "ex:volume": "135", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Building Theory at the Intersection of Ecological Sustainability and Strategic Management", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2471-6", "ex:pages": "293-307", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "﻿Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Dynamic capabilities", "Ecocentrism", "Ecological sustainability", "Transformational business strategy"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Helen Borland", "ex:email": "h.m.borland@aston.ac.uk"}, {"ex:name": "Véronique Ambrosini", "ex:email": "v.ambrosini@monash.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Adam Lindgreen", "ex:email": "lindgreena@cardiff.ac.uk"}, {"ex:name": "Joëlle Vanhamme", "ex:email": "joelle.vanhamme@edhec.edu"}]}]
