[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Although there is a growing body of research on social media, only few studies have considered organic products. Therefore, this study mapped the diffusion path of the social media resources for organic products in Mexico and South Korea through Twitter and compared the contents of tweets about organic products in terms of their semantic and hyperlink networks using webometric methods. The results indicate that for organic products, Koreans sent tweets much more frequently than Mexicans. Mexican tweets focused on basic food products in street markets, whereas Korean tweets highlighted promotions and firms, revealing the corporatist structure of its economy. In both cases, the findings support Twitter as a useful tool for Word-of-Mouth Communication on the online environment, among product consumers, and between consumers and enterprises.", "ex:volume": "135", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Organic Products in Mexico and South Korea on Twitter", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2345-y", "ex:pages": "587-603", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "ï»¿Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Organic products", "Social media", "Twitter", "Marketing", "Webometrics", "South Korea", "Mexico"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Xanat Vargas Meza"}, {"ex:name": "Han Woo Park", "ex:email": "hanpark@ynu.ac.kr"}]}]
