[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Ethical debate exists on the effect of gender diversity of the top management teams (TMTs) on organizations. This study aims to contribute to this debate by analyzing the effects of gender diversity of TMTs on the relationship between knowledge combination capability and organizations’ innovative performance. We use a sample of 205 small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) belonging to the sector of Spanish technology-based firms (TBFs). Our results indicate that gender diversity positively moderates the relationship between knowledge combination capability and innovation performance. Implications for theory and practice are discussed—among them, ways to contribute to more equal gender distribution and to the benefits of gender diversity in top management positions.", "ex:volume": "135", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Knowledge Combination Capability and Innovation: The Effects of Gender Diversity on Top Management Teams in Technology-Based Firms", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2462-7", "ex:pages": "503-515", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Gender diversity", "Innovation", "Knowledge combination capability", "Top management teams"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Jenny María Ruiz-Jiménez", "ex:email": "jmruizj@ugr.es"}, {"ex:name": "María del Mar Fuentes-Fuentes", "ex:email": "mfuentes@ugr.es"}, {"ex:name": "Matilde Ruiz-Arroyo", "ex:email": "matilderuiz@ugr.es"}]}]
