[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Using an innovative fabrication technique, eco-friendly faux leather (EFFL) has been newly developed as a green leather alternative for the Chinese and Korean markets. Value–belief–attitude logic drawn from the heuristic-systemic model (Zuckmand and Chaiken in Psychol Mark 15(7):621–642, 1998) and value–belief–norm theory (Stern et al. in Environ Behav 27(6):723–743, 1995) is proposed to explicate the consumer acceptance attitudes toward the EFFL product. The findings from the multi-group structural equation modeling analysis of online data (n = 600) support the relevancy of VBA logic in which utilitarian and hedonic value motivate pro-environmental belief, and the EFFL product attributes significantly mediate belief and positive attitude toward the EFFL product. The discrepancies across two countries and two age cohorts are noteworthy when pro-environmental belief and product-related information lead to different consumer VBA processes in specific market segments. This study presents insights which provide novel opportunities for managerial implementations and theoretical advancements in eco-friendly related subjects and issues.", "ex:volume": "135", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Green Leather for Ethical Consumers in China and Korea: Facilitating Ethical Consumption with Value–Belief–Attitude Logic", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2475-2", "ex:pages": "483-502", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Eco-friendly faux-leather (EFFL) products", " Ethical consumption", " Value–belief–attitude logic"], "ex:creator": ["Hye Jung Jung", "HaeJung Kim", "Kyung Wha Oh"]}]
