[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Abstract We develop and use an integrated individual-level model to explain the driving forces behind digital piracy (DP) practice in two nations. The proposed model combines the Norm Activation model and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology models. This study also explores the effect of culture on intention (INT) to practice DP in two nations: US (individualistic) and India (collectivistic). A survey instrument was used to collect data from 231 US and 331 Indian participants. Use of the integrated model proves to be a powerful and a viable approach to understanding DP across cultures. In each nation, all 10 path coefficients on the research model are statistically significant thereby establishing the fact that personal norm, together with other factors, influences INT to engage in DP, which in turn, may influence the actual practice. The results reveal a support for cross-cultural generalizability and applicability of the proposed model. Culture clearly plays a strong moderating role in two out of the three paths tested. The implications of the findings are discussed.", "ex:volume": "135", "ex:title": "Exploring Factors Affecting Digital Piracy Using the Norm Activation and UTAUT Models: The Role of National Culture", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2484-1", "ex:pages": "517-541", "ex:keywords": ["Personal norms", "Digital piracy", "NAM", "UTAUT", "National culture"], "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Godwin Udo", "ex:email": "gudo@utep.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Kallol Bagchi", "ex:email": "kbagch@utep.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Moutusy Maity", "ex:email": "mmaity@iiml.ac.in"}]}]
