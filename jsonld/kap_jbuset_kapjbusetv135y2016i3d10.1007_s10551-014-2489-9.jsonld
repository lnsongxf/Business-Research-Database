[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Abstract The paper documents the post-war retrenchment and failure of the post-war British Consumer Co-operative Movement. In contrast to the general failure one CEO, Terry Thomas stands out both for his success in co-operative rebranding and returning to profitability the UK Co-operative Bank and because he alone amongst the top echelons of the Co-operative Groups Management based his strategies on a clearly articulated philosophy based on his understanding of the values and purpose of the co-operative movement rooted in its historical traditions grounded in the writings and achievements of Robert Owen, The paper goes on to provide a case study of the bank’s process of transformation from loss-making subsidiary to the first positive co-operative national brand in the post-war period of its history. The author argues that lack of appropriate vision based on the founding values and purposes of the Co-operative Movement is the principal reason for the management’s and governance failures that have beset the UK Co-operative Group. Instead of using the past to help in understanding the present and planning for the future, the UK Co-operative Group Leadership ignored it or worse used the past successes to congratulate itself and disguise its manifest failures. In this, they were supported by an uncritical Co-operative Union (later renamed Co-operatives UK). Davis argues large co-operatives cannot be managed by a civil service responsible to an elected board. Co-operatives need a servant-leadership model of professional management dedicated to the transformational goals set by the founders of the co-operative movement. This needs a radical rethink and promotion of co-operative management education and a dedicated executive recruitment that seeks out value-based professionals whose attitudes and values are compatible with Co-operative values, ownership and purpose.", "ex:volume": "135", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Retrieving the Co-operative Value-Based Leadership Model of Terry Thomas", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2489-9", "ex:pages": "557-568", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "﻿Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["British Co-operative Bank", "Ethical banking", "Inclusive partnership", "Co-operative value-based management", "Leadership", "UK Co-operative Group"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Peter Davis", "ex:email": "pd8@le.ac.uk"}]}]
