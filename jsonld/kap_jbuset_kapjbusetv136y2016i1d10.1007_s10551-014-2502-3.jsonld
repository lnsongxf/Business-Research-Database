[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Abstract This study reviewed and analysed the phenomenon of employer branding. We began with a review of recent research in employer branding. Next, drawing the theoretical knowledge from OB, HRM, and marketing, a framework is developed depicting the antecedents of employer branding and its impact on the company performance. For this, primary data were collected administering a questionnaire survey on 347 top-level executives in 209 companies in India, and secondary data were collected on financial performance. The results revealed that realistic job previews, perceived organizational support, equity in reward administration, perceived organizational prestige, organizational trust, leadership of top management, psychological contract obligations, and corporate social responsibility influence employer branding, which in turn impact non-financial and financial performance of companies. Furthermore, leadership of top management is the most potent predictor of employer branding. Greater deviation of the existing state from the ideal state of antecedents adversely affects employer branding. Management can use this framework for developing strategy towards implementation of employer branding.", "ex:volume": "136", "ex:title": "Antecedents and Consequences of Employer Branding", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2502-3", "ex:pages": "57-72", "ex:keywords": ["Employer branding", "Antecedents", "Consequences", "Company performance"], "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Mukesh K.
