[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Despite growing interest in ethical consumer behaviour research, ambiguity remains regarding what motivates consumers to purchase ethical products. While researchers largely attribute the growth of ethical consumerism to an increase in ethical consumer concerns and motivations, widened distribution (mainstreaming) of ethical products, such as fairtrade, questions these assumptions. A model that integrates both individual and societal values into the theory of planned behaviour is presented and empirically tested to challenge the assumption that ethical consumption is driven by ethical considerations alone. Using data sourced from fairtrade shoppers across the UK, structural equation modelling suggests that fairtrade purchase intention is driven by both societal and self-interest values. This dual value pathway helps address conceptual limitations inherent in the underlying assumptions of existing ethical purchasing behaviour models and helps advance understanding of consumersâ€™ motivation to purchase ethical products.", "ex:volume": "136", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Towards a Framework for Understanding Fairtrade Purchase Intention in the Mainstream Environment of Supermarkets", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2509-9", "ex:pages": "181-197", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Ethical consumerism", " Fairtrade", " Schwartz value theory", " Theory of planned behaviour", " Personal values"], "ex:creator": ["Fred Amofa Yamoah", "Rachel Duffy", "Dan Petrovici", "Andrew Fearne"]}]
