[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Abstract This study examines whether sanctions imposed by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) against individual auditors result in greater auditor conservatism. Using a difference-in-differences research design, we find that clients of sanctioned individual auditors have lower discretionary accruals in the post-sanction period than in the pre-sanction period when compared to a matched control group of clients audited by individual auditors who were not sanctioned. Our findings suggest that sanctions imposed by the CSRC on individual auditors can lead to improvements in audit quality by increasing the conservatism of the sanctioned auditors. That is, individual auditors are more likely to resist their clientsâ€™ income-increasing accounting manipulations after being sanctioned by the CSRC.", "ex:volume": "136", "ex:title": "Individual Auditor Conservatism After CSRC Sanctions", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2514-z", "ex:pages": "133-146", "ex:keywords": ["Auditing ethics", "Regulatory governance", "Sanction", "Auditor conservatism"], "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Jerry Sun", "ex:email": "jyksun@uwindsor.ca"}, {"ex:name": "Steven F.
