[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Globalization is multifaceted and involves the interaction among businesses, services, governments, and societies beyond national borders. As a result, the flow of foreign direct investment (FDI), international trade in goods and services, and the economic interdependence of the nations of the world have been increasing. At the same time, much attention has been paid to the effect of corruption prevalent within many cultures and societies, and its impact on the economies, especially developing economies. This paper examines the relationship between human capital investment, the level of national corruption, and the global economic integration (GEI) of a nation in developing countries. Based on the data collected from over 60 countries, and building on the FDI and human capital theories, it was found that human capital investment and corruption are related to GEI. It was also found that the level of corruption moderates the relationship between human capital investment and GEI of developing economies. The findings of the study can help to deepen our understanding of GEI and have practical implications for developing countries in terms developing human capital, which plays a critical role in todayâ€™s knowledge-based economy.", "ex:volume": "136", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Global Economic Integration in Developing Countries: The Role of Corruption and Human Capital Investment", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2490-3", "ex:pages": "437-450", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Corruption", "Foreign direct investment", "International trade", "Global economic integration", "Human capital investment"], "ex:creator": ["Charles E.
