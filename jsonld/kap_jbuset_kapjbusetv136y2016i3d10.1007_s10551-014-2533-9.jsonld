[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Abstract This study provides a global perspective on citations of articles published in ten business ethics journals between 1999 and 2012 and establishes three findings. First, the results indicate that Journal of Business Ethics and Business and Society are the two top business ethics journals based on the distribution of normalized citations received. Second, although North America, particularly the US, remains the top producer of business ethics research, it has been surpassed by Europe in terms of weighted normalized research citations received in 2012, implying a potential diminishing global role of US influence in business ethics research over time. Third, the top-ranked US institutions have reduced their business ethics research impact in recent years, while the European institutions have sharply increased theirs.", "ex:volume": "136", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "A Citation Analysis of Business Ethics Research: A Global Perspective", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2533-9", "ex:pages": "557-573", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Business ethics journal ranking", "School ranking", "Global pattern of business ethics research"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Kam C.
