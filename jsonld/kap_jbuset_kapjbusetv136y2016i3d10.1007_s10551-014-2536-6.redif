[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Previous research on consumers’ willingness to choose a green hotel has yielded mixed results, with some studies indicating a positive relationship with the hotel’s CSR initiatives, while others suggesting that there is no booking advantage for hotels going green. The present research seeks to understand the social nature of green hotel booking decisions and proposes a conceptual framework elucidating three primary factors that underlie consumers’ propensity to choose a green hotel. The study findings indicate that, importantly, a consumer’s social relationship situation (social inclusion vs. social exclusion) with other consumers, self-affirmation (self-value/self-concept reinforcement), and the option popularity jointly influence consumers’ willingness to choose a green hotel. The authors adopt a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial experimental design to test the proposed hypotheses. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.", "ex:volume": "136", "ex:title": "The Impact of Option Popularity, Social Inclusion/Exclusion, and Self-affirmation on Consumers’ Propensity to Choose Green Hotels", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2536-6", "ex:pages": "575-585", "ex:keywords": ["CSR", "Green hotels", "Social inclusion", "Social exclusion", "Option popularity", "Self-affirmation", "Willingness to choose green hotels"], "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Yixing Lisa Gao", "ex:email": "yzg104@psu.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Anna S.
