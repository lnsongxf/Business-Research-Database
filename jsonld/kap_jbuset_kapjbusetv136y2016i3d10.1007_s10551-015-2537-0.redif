[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between perceived co-worker support, commitment to colleagues, job satisfaction, intention to help others, and pro-environmental behavior with the emphasis on eco-helping, with a view to determining the extent to which peer relationships encourage employees to engage in pro-environmental behaviors at work. This paper is framed by adopting social exchange theory through the lens of ethics of care. Data from a sample of 449 employees showed that receiving support from peers triggers an exchange process that encourages eco-helping among colleagues. The implications of the findings are discussed in the light of the social exchange literature.", "ex:volume": "136", "ex:title": "Corporate Greening, Exchange Process Among Co-workers, and Ethics of Care: An Empirical Study on the Determinants of Pro-environmental Behaviors at Coworkers-Level", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2537-0", "ex:pages": "655-673", "ex:keywords": ["Greening organizations", "Perceived co-worker support", "Commitment to colleagues", "Job satisfaction", "Intention to help others", "Eco-helping", "Ethics of care"], "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Pascal Paillé", "ex:email": "pascal.paille@fsa.ulaval.ca"}, {"ex:name": "Jorge Humberto Mejía-Morelos", "ex:email": "jhmm2007@gmail.com"}, {"ex:name": "Anne Marché-Paillé", "ex:email": "anne.marchepaille@ugent.be"}, {"ex:name": "Chih Chieh Chen", "ex:email": "cchen@swufe.edu.cn"}, {"ex:name": "Yang Chen", "ex:email": "chenyang@swufe.edu.cn"}]}]
