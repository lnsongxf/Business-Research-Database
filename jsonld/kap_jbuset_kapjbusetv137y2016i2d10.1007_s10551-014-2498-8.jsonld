[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this paper is to explore the concepts of issue legitimacy and organizational legitimacy, providing a new measure of each construct. The scales were developed and tested using data collected through a statewide survey of Alabama residents. Assessments of issue legitimacy were based on perceptions of direct-to-consumer advertising, whereas assessments of organizational legitimacy were based on perceptions of the pharmaceutical industry as a whole. The findings provide evidence that organizational legitimacy can be reliably measured using a five-item scale and issue legitimacy can be reliably measured using a six-item scale. The implications of the results and potential uses of the scales are discussed.", "ex:volume": "137", "ex:title": "Developing Measurement Scales of Organizational and Issue Legitimacy: A Case of Direct-to-Consumer Advertising in the Pharmaceutical Industry", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2498-8", "ex:pages": "405-413", "ex:keywords": ["Issues management", "Legitimacy", "Organizational legitimacy", "Direct-to-consumer advertising"], "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Jee Young Chung", "ex:email": "jeeyoungchung@suu.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Bruce K.
