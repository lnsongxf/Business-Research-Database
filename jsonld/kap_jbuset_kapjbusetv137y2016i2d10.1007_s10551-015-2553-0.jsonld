[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Research suggests that organizational justice (procedural, distributive, and interactional justice) has important impacts on work-related attitudes and behaviors, such as organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). In this article, we explore the extent to which individualism moderates the relationship between organizational justice and OCB (organizational obedience, participation, and loyalty) among citizens in Kyrgyzstan. We make additional contributions to the literature because we know very little about these constructs in this former Soviet Union country, Kyrgyzstan, an under-researched and under-represented region of the world. Results of our data collected from 402 managers and employees in Kyrgyzstan offer the following new discoveries. All three justice constructs are related to OCB. Individualism moderates only the distributive and interactive justice to OCB relationships. We develop an intricate theory with provocative implications: Procedural justice produces obedience. For “individualists,” interactional justice inspires loyalty and, interestingly, distributive justice “can only buy” participation, but “can’t buy” loyalty. Therefore, for individualists, interactional justice outweighs distributive justice for organizational loyalty. Based on Kyrgyz citizens’ justice, OCB, and individualism, our theory reveals novel insights regarding culture, money attitude, and intrinsic motivation and provides critical and practical implications to the field of business ethics.", "ex:volume": "137", "ex:title": "Theory of Justice, OCB, and Individualism: Kyrgyz Citizens", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2553-0", "ex:pages": "365-382", "ex:keywords": ["Organizational justice", "Organizational citizenship behavior", "Individualism", "Social exchange", "Money", "Intrinsic motivation", "Ethics", "Former soviet union country", "Contextualization"], "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Mehmet Ferhat Özbek", "ex:email": "mfozbek@gumushane.edu.tr"}, {"ex:name": "Mohammad Asif Yoldash", "ex:email": "asif.yoldas@avrasya.edu.tr"}, {"ex:name": "Thomas Li-Ping Tang", "ex:email": "Thomas.Tang@mtsu.edu"}]}]
