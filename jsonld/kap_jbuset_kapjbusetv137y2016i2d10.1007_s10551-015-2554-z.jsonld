[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Porter and Kramer (Harv Bus Rev 84(12):78–92, 2006; Harv Bus Rev 89(1/2), 62–77, 2011) introduced ‘shared value’ as a ‘new conception of capitalism,’ claiming it is a powerful driver of economic growth and reconciliation between business and society. The idea has generated strong interest in business and academia; however, its theoretical precepts have not been rigorously assessed. In this paper, we provide a systematic and thorough analysis of shared value, focusing on its ontological and epistemological properties. Our review highlights that ‘shared value’ has spread into the language of multiple disciplines, but that its current conceptualization is vague, and it presents important discrepancies in the way it is defined and operationalized, such that it is more of a buzzword than a substantive concept. It also overlaps with many other (related) concepts and lacks empirical grounding. We offer recommendations for defining and measuring the concept, take a step toward disentangling it from related concepts, and identify relevant theories and research methods that would facilitate extending the knowledge frontier on shared value.", "ex:volume": "137", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Literature Review of Shared Value: A Theoretical Concept or a Management Buzzword?", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2554-z", "ex:pages": "231-267", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Bottom of the pyramid", "Business and society", "Epistemology", "Literature review", "Ontology", "Shared value", "Theoretical concept"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Krzysztof Dembek", "ex:email": "krzysztof.dembek@unimelb.edu.au"}, {"ex:name": "Prakash Singh", "ex:email": "pjsingh@unimelb.edu.au"}, {"ex:name": "Vikram Bhakoo", "ex:email": "vbhakoo@unimelb.edu.au"}]}]
