[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract How can we improve business ethics education for the twenty first century? This study evaluates the effectiveness of a visual case exercise in the form of a 3D immersive game given to undergraduate students at two UK Universities as part of a mandatory business ethics module. We propose that due to evolving learning styles, the immersive nature of interactive games lends itself as a vehicle to make the learning of ethics more ‘concrete’ and ‘personal’ and therefore more engaging. To achieve this, we designed and built an immersive 3D simulation game in the style of a visual case. The effectiveness of the game was evaluated using a mixed methods approach measuring recognised and adapted constructs from the technology acceptance model. Results demonstrate that students found the game beneficial to their learning of ethics with the development of knowledge and skills applicable to the real world and that they engaged with the process due to game elements. Findings demonstrate the potential for the development of simulated games to teach ethics at all levels and modes of delivery and the contribution of this type of visual case model as a pedagogic method.", "ex:volume": "137", "ex:title": "It's All in the Game: A 3D Learning Model for Business Ethics", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2557-9", "ex:pages": "383-403", "ex:keywords": ["Teaching business ethics", "Business simulation game", "serious games", "Interactive learning", "Experiential learning", "Business ethics education", "Mixed methods"], "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Suzy Jagger", "ex:email": "s.jagger@roehampton.ac.uk"}, {"ex:name": "Haytham Siala", "ex:email": "h.siala@roehampton.ac.uk"}, {"ex:name": "Diane Sloan", "ex:email": "diane.sloan@northumbria.ac.uk"}]}]
