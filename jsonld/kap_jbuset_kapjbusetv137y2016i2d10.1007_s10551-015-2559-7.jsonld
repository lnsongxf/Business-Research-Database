[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract This study examined how servant leadership influences employees in terms of work-to-family conflict (WFC) and work-to-family positive spillover (WFPS). These effects were explored through a focus on the mediating roles of emotional exhaustion and personal learning. The results, which were based on time-lagged data collection in China, indicated that employee perceptions of servant leadership related negatively to WFC and positively to WFPS. Moreover, reduced emotional exhaustion and enhanced personal learning mediated the relationship between servant leadership and WFPS. Furthermore, reduced emotional exhaustion (but not enhanced personal learning) mediated the relationship between servant leadership and WFC. Our study’s results provide insightful theoretical and managerial implications and offer new directions for research on leadership and work–family relations.", "ex:volume": "137", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Work–Family Effects of Servant Leadership: The Roles of Emotional Exhaustion and Personal Learning", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2559-7", "ex:pages": "285-297", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Emotional exhaustion", "Personal learning", "Servant leadership", "Work–family conflict", "Work–family positive spillover"], "ex:creator": ["Guiyao Tang", "Ho Kwong Kwan", "Deyuan Zhang", "Zhou Zhu"]}]
