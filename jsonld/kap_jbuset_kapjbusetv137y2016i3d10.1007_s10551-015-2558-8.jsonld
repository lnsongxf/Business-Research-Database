[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Following on theoretical work and studies that assert a relationship between unethical activities and diminished well-being, and a common belief that those more ethically inclined experience greater well-being, the present study examined whether individual differences in ethical orientation may be associated with the experience of well-being. This paper reports the findings of two separate studies showing that individual differences in moral attentiveness, moral identity, idealism, relativism, and integrity were associated with differences in a wide range of well-being measures. Of particular significance is not all ethical orientations were found to contribute to well-being. In fact, some negatively impacted individual levels of well-being. Implications for integrating these new findings into existing ethical theory and considerations for future research are explored.", "ex:volume": "137", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Ethics and Well-Being: The Paradoxical Implications of Individual Differences in Ethical Orientation", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2558-8", "ex:pages": "491-506", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Ethical individual differences", "Psychological well-being", "Physical well-being"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Robert A.
