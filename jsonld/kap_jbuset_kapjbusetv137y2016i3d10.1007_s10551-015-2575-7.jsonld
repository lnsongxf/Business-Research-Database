[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Abstract As the interest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) within advertising industry is growing, this paper explores the discourse on CSR among employees in advertising agencies. Different sensemaking dimensions are taken into account to examine how employees, as one of the key stakeholders involved in the joint meaning construction, make sense of CSR. In addition, this paper studies the legitimation approaches that employees use to address CSR of advertising agencies. The empirical evidence of discursive examples also indicates that there is a linkage between sensemaking and legitimation perspective in CSR discourse analysis and supports the idea that both may be a potential route toward institutionalization of CSR inside organizations or sectors.", "ex:volume": "137", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "On the Discursive Construction of Corporate Social Responsibility in Advertising Agencies", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2575-7", "ex:pages": "521-536", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "﻿Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Csr", "Advertising agencies", "Sensemaking", "Legitimation", "Institutionalization"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Neva Štumberger", "ex:email": "nstumber@purdue.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Urša Golob", "ex:email": "ursa.golob@fdv.uni-lj.si"}]}]
