[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Although managing fairness is a critical concern for organizations, not all managers are predisposed to enact high levels of fairness. Emerging empirical evidence suggests that personality characteristics can be an important antecedent of managers’ fair behavior. However, relatively little attention has been devoted to understand how to promote fairness among managers who are naturally predisposed to engage in lower levels of fairness. Building upon self-awareness theory, we argue that increasing managers’ self-awareness can motivate managers with low trait empathy to engage in greater levels of justice. We test the interactive effects of trait empathy and state self-awareness using an experimental study (N = 76) in which individuals were asked to communicate negative news. In support of our hypothesis, our results indicate that increasing self-awareness through self-focusing situations can help promote interactional justice when communicating negative news for individuals with low trait empathy. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.", "ex:volume": "137", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "The Face of Fairness: Self-Awareness as a Means to Promote Fairness among Managers with Low Empathy", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-014-2357-7", "ex:pages": "721-730", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Fairness", "Justice", "Empathy", "Self-awareness"], "ex:creator": ["David B.
