[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Pulling from theories of social exchange, deonance, and fairness heuristics, this study focuses on the relationship between overall justice climate and both the prosocial and deviant behaviors of groups. Specifically, it considers two contextual boundary conditions on this effectâ€”corporate social responsibility (CSR) and group moral identity. Results from a laboratory experiment are presented, which show a significant effect for overall justice climate and a two-way interaction between overall justice climate and CSR on group-level prosocial and deviant behaviors, and a marginally significant interaction of group moral identity with overall justice climate on group deviance. The implications of contextual influences on workplace ethics and justice are discussed.", "ex:volume": "137", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "The Joint Effects of Justice Climate, Group Moral Identity, and Corporate Social Responsibility on the Prosocial and Deviant Behaviors of Groups", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2748-4", "ex:pages": "677-697", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Organizational justice", "Justice climate", "Moral identity", "Corporate social responsibility", "Fairness", "Justice"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Meghan A.
