[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Online education lacks the moral and ethical engagement as well as the empathic interactions that are essential and integral to true liberal education, including business. While the online venue can provide useful information and put libraries at the hands of the student or employee, there is an implicit lack of focus on the sacredness and centrality of the person, his or her values, attitudes, needs, and expectations. The focus of online education is on the delivery of data, not the studentâ€™s engagement with the material or the process. Critically absent from online education is the ability to explore the transformation of data as it changes, first to information, then to knowledge, and finally to wisdom, within each person. Finally, absent is the ability to raise the level of abstraction. Since all needs to be measurable in concrete terms in online education, we are left with the language of metrics, such as deliverables, outcomes, inputs, and outputs. Where is the person in all of this? Where is the focus on the moral compass that is so necessary in any type of education?", "ex:volume": "138", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Online Education: Values Dilemma in Business and the Search for Empathic Engagement", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2566-8", "ex:pages": "175-184", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Business outcome", " Community bonding", " Empathic engagement", " Moral and ethical dilemmas", " Online education", " Social network"], "ex:creator": ["S.
