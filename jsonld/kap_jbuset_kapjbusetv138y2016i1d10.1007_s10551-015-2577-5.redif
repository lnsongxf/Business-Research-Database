[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Marketing research on adolescentsâ€™ ethical predispositions (EP) and risky behaviors (RB) has focused primarily on individual difference variables. The present study, in contrast, examines the social network positions that an adolescent occupies within a group. A survey of 984 adolescents demonstrates that EP and RB stem from a balance between assimilation (i.e., centralities within the peer network) and individuation (i.e., need for uniqueness). In particular, we show that adolescents with close first-degree relationships within a specific peer group (measured by high degree centrality) and/or high need for uniqueness have lower EP and engage in more RB, while adolescents that are more central to the entire network (measured by high closeness centrality) have higher EP. The theoretic and practical implications of these findings are discussed.", "ex:volume": "138", "ex:title": "Ethics During Adolescence: A Social Networks Perspective", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2577-5", "ex:pages": "185-197", "ex:keywords": ["Ethics", "Adolescent consumers", "Social network", "Consumer need for uniqueness"], "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Elodie Gentina", "ex:email": "elodie.gentina@skema.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Gregory M.
