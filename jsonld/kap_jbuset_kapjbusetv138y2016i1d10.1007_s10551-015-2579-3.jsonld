[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Abstract This paper aims to contribute to a greater understanding of the theory of virtue ethics and its applications in the business arena. In contrast to other prominent approaches to ethics, virtue ethics provides a useful perspective in making sense of various business ethics issues with an emphasis on the moral character of the individuals and its transformational influences in driving ethical business conduct. Building on Geoff Moore’s (Bus Ethics Q 12(1):19–32, 2002; Bus Ethics Q 15(2):237–255, 2005; Bus Ethics Q 18(4):483–511, 2008) treatment of Alasdair MacIntyre’s practice–institution schema, the paper discusses how individuals, as moral agents, can serve to promote virtuous business conduct and help foster a moral and ethical climate in the organization and in society at large. Using interview data from a broader study of the New Zealand wine industry as explanatory examples, the paper argues that while many companies’ sustainable practices are still largely market based, such excellent business practices are often driven by individuals’ moral and ethical pursuits.", "ex:volume": "138", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Virtue Ethics and the Practice–Institution Schema: An Ethical Case of Excellent Business Practices", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2579-3", "ex:pages": "67-77", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Business ethics", " Virtue ethics", " Practice–institution schema", " Corporate social responsibility", " Social entrepreneurship", " Sustainability", " Sustainable enterprise", " Transformational leadership", " New Zealand wine industry"], "ex:creator": ["Ying Wang", "George Cheney", "Juliet Roper"]}]
