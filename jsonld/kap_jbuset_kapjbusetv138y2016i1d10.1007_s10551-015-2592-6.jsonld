[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Abstract The paper discusses the role that ethics theory might play in business ethics teaching. It is noted that little attention is devoted to the explanation and application of ethics theory in business ethics textbooks, which suggests that ethics theory is held in low esteem by business ethics educators. This relative disregard has been justified by some critics on the basis of the limited usefulness of ethics theory to business ethics pedagogy. Notwithstanding these criticisms, the paper argues that ethics theory can play an important role in business ethics teaching which conforms to a speculative agenda. A speculative agenda is described, and a contribution that ethics theory can make to it is explained. This constitutes a form of immanent critique, which enables putative statements of business ethicality to be subjected to critique against the cultural values upon which their credibility rests. Ethics theory is offered as a mediating resource to facilitate such critique. Some criteria that the presentation of ethics theory needs to meet if it is to fulfill this speculative agenda are also outlined.", "ex:volume": "138", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "A Role for Ethics Theory in Speculative Business Ethics Teaching", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2592-6", "ex:pages": "79-90", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Business ethics teaching", " Ethics theory", " Speculative method", " Immanent critique"], "ex:creator": ["Mick Fryer"]}]
