[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Abstract In behavioral ethics today, there is debate as to which theory of moral development is the best for understanding ethical decision making, thereby facilitating ethical behavior. This debate between behavioral ethicists has been profoundly influenced by the field of moral psychology. Unfortunately, in the course of this marriage between moral psychology and business ethics and subsequent internal debate, a simple but critical understanding of human being in the field of management has been obscured; i.e., that morality is not a secondary phenomenon arising out of something else. Therefore, in this paper, we will argue that there is a need in behavioral ethics to shift our understanding away from the influence of contemporary moral psychology and back to management theorist Ghoshal’s (Acad Manag Learn Educ 4(1):75–91, 2005) view of what it means to be human in which the moral is fundamental. To assist in this labor, we will build on the philosophical work of Emmanuel Levinas who sees ethics, regardless of the setting, as a metaphysical concern. What this means is that Levinas sees the essential moral character of human life and the reality of human agency as ontologically fundamental, or constitutive of human nature itself. In other words, the ethical is the “first cause” in regard to understanding the nature and action of the individual, including within organizations. Thus, morality in any sphere of human endeavor, including in business, is not merely epiphenomenal to some more fundamental reality.", "ex:volume": "138", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Behavioral Ethics: A Critique and a Proposal", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2628-y", "ex:pages": "145-159", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Behavioral ethics", " Moral development", " Moral judgment–moral action gap"], "ex:creator": ["Carol Frogley Ellertson", "Marc-Charles Ingerson", "Richard N.
