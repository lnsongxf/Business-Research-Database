[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Prior research has found attributions to mediate the relationship between the elements of corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities and consumer responses to firms; however, the question of what variables determine consumer attributions of CSR remains partially unaddressed. This article analyzes why consumers make attributions of CSR that are either positive (values-driven or strategic motives), or negative (stakeholder-driven or egoistic motives). The results obtained from two empirical studies (n = 197, n = 222) indicate that company–cause fit, corporate ability, and interpersonal trust have a positive influence on the motives that consumers attribute to CSR, whereas corporate hypocrisy has a negative effect. This research contributes to our understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying impactful consumer judgments and provides guidance for organizations in responding to such evaluations.", "ex:volume": "138", "ex:title": "Determinants of Consumer Attributions of Corporate Social Responsibility", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2578-4", "ex:pages": "247-260", "ex:keywords": ["CSR", "Consumer behavior", "Attributions", "Ethics"], "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Longinos Marín", "ex:email": "longinos@um.es"}, {"ex:name": "Pedro J.
