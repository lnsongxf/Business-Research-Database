[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract The increasing visibility and elevated status of musicians has become prominent in contemporary society as a consequence of technological advances and the development of both mass and specialized targeted audiences. Consequently, the actions of musicians are under greater levels of scrutiny and fans demand more from musicians than ‘just’ music. If the industry demands corporate social responsibility practices in a similar vein to how corporations promote themselves; a further question then remains regarding how the increasing prominence of such activities by musicians influences music consumers and fans of individual bands and artists. The current research provides a foundation upon which to better understand the role that social responsibility plays for consumers of music. Consequently, the research has practical implications for promoting socially responsible consumption practices. The various public spaces (concerts, festivals, retail outlets, social events, and social media) that music consumption encompasses represent great opportunities in which ethical consumption practices can be promoted. We identify a number of factors (level of expectations, authenticity and escapism) that ultimately determine when socially responsible engagement in the music industry is supported, ignored, or even becomes the focus of consumer backlash.", "ex:volume": "138", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Do they Know it’s CSR at all?
