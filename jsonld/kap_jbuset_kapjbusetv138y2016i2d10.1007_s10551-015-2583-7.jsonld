[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract We provide a comprehensive analysis of differences between socially responsible investment (SRI) and conventional funds in terms of manager characteristics, performance and fund styles. We use holdings-based analysis to evaluate fund performance and style, which allows us to perform a more in-depth analysis than the extant literature. We find that SRI managers have longer tenure and are more likely to be a female. However, these differences do not result in any significant difference in the performance of SRI and conventional funds. Further, it is possible to find an SRI fund of any style, although these funds are under-represented in value styles.", "ex:volume": "138", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "What is Different about Socially Responsible Funds?
