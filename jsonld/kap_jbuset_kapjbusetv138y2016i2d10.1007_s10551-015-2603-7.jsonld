[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract The new features of the business environment have expanded the concept of organizational learning capability (OLC). In today’s competitive business environment, OLC has been recognized as an essential means to gain a sustainable competitive advantage. However, the effective development of that capability has not been sufficiently analyzed in the organizational learning literature. Prompted by a recent paradigm shift in the organizational sciences, this research explores the link between altruism and OLC testing a wider picture that includes two intermediate steps: Relationship Conflict and Organizational Trust. To check our hypotheses, we used structural equations to analyze data from a survey of Spanish firms with recognized excellence in human resource management. Results indicate that organizational trust mediates on the altruism—OLC relationship; however, such linkage is not mediated by relationship conflict. Findings suggest that altruism and trust should be promoted in organizations in order to boost OLC.", "ex:volume": "138", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Linking Altruism and Organizational Learning Capability: A Study from Excellent Human Resources Management Organizations in Spain", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2603-7", "ex:pages": "349-364", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "﻿Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Altruism", "Organizational learning", "Organizational learning capability", "Organizational trust", "Relationship conflict"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Jacob Guinot", "ex:email": "guinotj@uji.es"}, {"ex:name": "Ricardo Chiva", "ex:email": "rchiva@uji.es"}, {"ex:name": "Fermín Mallén", "ex:email": "fmallen@uji.es"}]}]
