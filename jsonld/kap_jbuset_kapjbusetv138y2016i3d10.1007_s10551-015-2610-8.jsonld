[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Abstract We investigate how conventional asset managers account for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in their investment process. We do so on the basis of an international survey among fund managers. We find that many conventional managers integrate responsible investing in their investment process. Furthermore, we find that ESG information in particular is being used for red flagging and to manage risk. We find that many conventional fund managers have already adopted features of responsible investing in the investment process. Furthermore, we argue and show that ESG investing is highly similar to fundamental investing. We also reveal that there is a substantial difference in the ways in which U.S. and European asset managers view ESG.", "ex:volume": "138", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "ESG Integration and the Investment Management Process: Fundamental Investing Reinvented", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2610-8", "ex:pages": "525-533", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "﻿Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Esg investing", "Asset management", "Survey", "Fundamental investing"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Emiel Duuren"}, {"ex:name": "Auke Plantinga"}, {"ex:name": "Bert Scholtens", "ex:email": "l.j.r.scholtens@rug.nl"}]}]
