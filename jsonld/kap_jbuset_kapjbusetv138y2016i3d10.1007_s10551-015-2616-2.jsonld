[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Abstract This study empirically examines whether firms’ environmental capital expenditures impact institutional investors’ investment decisions in the Chinese market. We particularly examine the impact of ownership type on the relationship of environmental capital expenditures and the behavior of different types of institutional investors by classifying institutional investors into two categories, short-term and long-term investors. In addition, this study further investigates whether environmental capital expenditures related to ownership type increase firm value. We find that long-term institutional investors tend to invest in state-owned firms (SOEs) making environmental capital expenditures. Results also indicate that, with governmental backing and encouragement, the market value of SOEs making more environmental capital expenditures is likely to increase. However, no similar results are found for non-SOEs.", "ex:volume": "138", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Institutional Interest, Ownership Type, and Environmental Capital Expenditures: Evidence from the Most Polluting Chinese Listed Firms", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2616-2", "ex:pages": "459-476", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Institutional investors", "Investment behavior", "Environmental capital expenditure", "State-owned firms"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Wenjing Li", "ex:email": "tliwenjing@jnu.edu.cn"}, {"ex:name": "Xiaoyan Lu", "ex:email": "luxy@mail.sysu.edu.cn"}]}]
