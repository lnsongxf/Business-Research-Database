[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Consumers often intend to create a socially responsible identity by consuming ethically. Observers, however, do not limit their inferences to the specific identity consumers intend to project. To illustrate, we examine how observers make inferences about consumers on the basis of their ethical consumption. Across four studies we find that, in addition to being viewed as ethical, consumers are viewed as less masculine and more feminine when they consume ethical products. We also identify two boundary conditions to this effect, including the use of self-benefit/other-benefit advertising appeals and the use of descriptive norms to establish gender appropriate behavior. We finally examine how consumers resolve the conflict of creating ethical and gender-congruent identities. We find that when male (female) consumers are in the presence of observers of the opposite (same) sex, they are more (less) likely to prioritize ethical identity even when it threatens their gender orientation.", "ex:volume": "139", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Can “Real” Men Consume Ethically?
