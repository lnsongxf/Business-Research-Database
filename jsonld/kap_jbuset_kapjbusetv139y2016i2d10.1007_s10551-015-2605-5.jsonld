[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Few studies have examined the influence of the food environment on obesity rates among very young, low-income consumers. This research contributes to this growing literature by examining the relationship between modifications to the retail environment and obesity rates for low-income, preschool-aged children. Based on data combined from various secondary sources, this study finds that changes in the retail environment are significantly related to obesity rates. More specifically, the authors find a positive relationship between the number of convenience stores in the retail environment and obesity rates among low-income, preschool-aged children. Results also show that the percent change in grocery stores and supercenters and club stores in the retail environment is negatively related to the obesity rates of low-income, preschool-aged children [i.e., as grocery stores and supercenters/club stores increase (decrease), obesity decreases (increases)].Further, the percent change in supercenters and club stores mediates the positive relationship between participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and obesity rates.", "ex:volume": "139", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "From Food Desert to Food Oasis: The Potential Influence of Food Retailers on Childhood Obesity Rates", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2605-5", "ex:pages": "215-224", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "ï»¿Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Food environment", "Social responsibility", "Childhood obesity", "Low-income", "Food deserts"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Elizabeth Howlett", "ex:email": "bhowlett@walton.uark.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Cassandra Davis", "ex:email": "cdavis@walton.uark.edu"}, {"ex:name": "Scot Burton", "ex:email": "sburton@walton.uark.edu"}]}]
