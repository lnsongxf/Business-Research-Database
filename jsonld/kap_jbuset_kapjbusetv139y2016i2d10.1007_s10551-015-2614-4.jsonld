[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Social commerce as a subset of e-commerce has been emerged in part due to the popularity of social networking sites. Social commerce brings new challenges to marketing activities. And social commerce transactions like e-commerce transactions can be dangerous and cause harmful losses to personal finances, time, and information privacy. This article examines ethical issues and consumer assessments of the risks of using an e-service and how risk affects consumer evaluations and usage of Internet-based services and self-service technologies. Results from two surveys totaling 1024 consumers indicated that as usage risk concerns increased, the perceived usefulness (PU) of an e-service and intention to use it decreased. Additionally as usage risk concerns increased the effect of subjective norm on PU and intention to use an e-service strengthened, and the effect of perceived ease of use on PU and intention to use an e-service weakened. These findings advance theory and contribute to the foundation for future research aimed at improving our understanding of how consumers evaluate new e-services, new commerce systems and settings, and self-service technologies in the social commerce era.", "ex:volume": "139", "ex:title": "Self-Service Technologies and e-Services Risks in Social Commerce Era", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2614-4", "ex:pages": "251-269", "ex:keywords": ["Social commerce era", "Risk assessments", "Electronic commerce", "Self-service technologies", "E-services"], "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Mauricio S.
