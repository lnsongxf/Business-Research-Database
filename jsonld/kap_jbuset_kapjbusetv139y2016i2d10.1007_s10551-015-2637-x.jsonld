[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract The aim of this study is to explore the influence of religious beliefs on social or work-related ties of managers who are member of organizational networks representing two different ideologies (religious and secular) in Turkey. In this research, the emergence of secular and devout entrepreneurs is considered as a phenomenon, and special attention is paid to religious transformation and secularism in Turkey. Social network analysis method is used to define the nature of communication links among 80 chairmen who are the members of two conflicting and dominant groups in Turkish business system. The findings show that Protestant work ethic suggested by Weber with regard to Christianity have attained a similar place over the past decade in Islamic organizational networks. The concern of political power in religion leads to organizational networks being nourished by religious norms and creeds in many developing countries. Especially in societies like Turkey where the state is dominant in the business life, organizations and managers prefer to be included in religious networks to make close contacts with the state. Another significant finding is that efforts of the members of religious networks—in spite of their relatively closed characteristics—in terms of being at the center of a network and taking the brokerage role, are highly developed on the contrary to the literature.", "ex:volume": "139", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Transformation of Islamic Work Ethic and Social Networks: The Role of Religious Social Embeddedness in Organizational Networks", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2637-x", "ex:pages": "313-331", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Work ethic", " Organizational networks", " Social capital", " Islam"], "ex:creator": ["Erdem Kirkbesoglu", "Ali Selami Sargut"]}]
