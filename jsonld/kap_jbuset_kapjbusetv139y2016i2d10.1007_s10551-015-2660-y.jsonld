[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract We examine the association between gender-diverse compensation committees and CEO pay and find that CEO compensation levels are negatively associated with gender-diversity of the compensation committee, but not gender-diversity of the board. Furthermore, we find that excess CEO compensation is negatively related to subsequent return on assets for firms with an all-male compensation committee but not for firms with a gender-diverse compensation committee. These results suggest that CEOs do receive some level of excess compensation which can be mitigated by having one or more females on the compensation committee.", "ex:volume": "139", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "The Association Between Gender-Diverse Compensation Committees and CEO Compensation", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2660-y", "ex:pages": "375-390", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "ï»¿Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Gender-diversity", "Compensation committee", "Ceo compensation"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Martin Bugeja", "ex:email": "martin.bugeja@uts.edu.au"}, {"ex:name": "Zoltan Matolcsy", "ex:email": "zoltan.matolcsy@uts.edu.au"}, {"ex:name": "Helen Spiropoulos", "ex:email": "helen.spiropoulos@uts.edu.au"}]}]
