[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Abstract We develop and test a trickle-down model of how authentic leadership at the department level flows down the organizational hierarchy to encourage team leader authentic leadership and consequently, promotes team and individual-level supervisor-directed helping behavior. Analyses of multi-level and multi-source data collected from a total of 487 employees comprising 122 teams, 47 departments, and 4 different working areas of a major public sector organization in Taiwan show that team leaders’ authentic leadership mediates the relationship between departmental authentic leadership and individual-level leader–member exchange (LMX). We also found that intra-team trust completely mediates the influence of team authentic leadership on both team helping behavior and individual-level supervisor-directed helping behavior. Finally, the results reveal that self-concordance mediates the influence of team authentic leadership on individual-level supervisor helping behavior as well as the influence of individual-level LMX on individual-level supervisor-directed helping behavior. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.", "ex:volume": "139", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "A Multi-level Investigation of Authentic Leadership as an Antecedent of Helping Behavior", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2580-x", "ex:pages": "485-499", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Authentic leadership", "Leader–member exchange", "Self-concordance", "Helping behavior", "Multi-level"], "ex:creator": ["Giles Hirst", "Fred Walumbwa", "Samuel Aryee", "Ivan Butarbutar", "Chin Jeffery Hui Chen"]}]
