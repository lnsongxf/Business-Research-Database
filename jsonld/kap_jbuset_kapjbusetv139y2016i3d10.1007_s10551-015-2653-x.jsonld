[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Abstract There has been increased interest in the “dark side” of organizational behavior in recent decades. Workplace bullying, in particular, has received growing attention in the social sciences literature. However, this literature has lacked an integrated approach. More specifically, few studies have investigated causes at levels beyond the individual, such as the group or organization. Extending victim precipitation theory, we present a conceptual model of workplace bullying incorporating factors at the individual-, dyadic-, group-, and organizational-levels. Based on our theoretical model, a number of propositions are offered which emphasize an interactionist, multi-level approach. This approach provides a valuable stepping stone and framework to guide future empirical research. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.", "ex:volume": "139", "ex:title": "Workplace Bullying: Considering the Interaction Between Individual and Work Environment", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2653-x", "ex:pages": "537-549", "ex:keywords": ["Workplace bullying", "Bullying antecedents", "Dark side of organizations"], "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Al-Karim Samnani", "ex:email": "asamnani@uwindsor.ca"}, {"ex:name": "Parbudyal Singh", "ex:email": "singhp@yorku.ca"}]}]
