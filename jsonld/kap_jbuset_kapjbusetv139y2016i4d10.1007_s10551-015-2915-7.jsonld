[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Abstract While the coexistence of trust and distrust has been acknowledged in previous literature, the understanding of their connection with organisational culture is limited. This study examines how trust and distrust construct the unity and fragmentation of organisational culture. Productive working relationships can be characterised by high trust, but strong ties and high trust may also account for false organisational unity. This study shows that trust and distrust can co-exist and distrust may even increase trust in particular situations. Moreover, we describe how the cognitive and affective components of trust and distrust relate to the unity and fragmentation of organisational culture. We present an empirical case study of a company where tension and distrust between top management, middle management and shop stewards affected the organisational culture. The study contributes to earlier research by discussing trust as a multidimensional and dynamic phenomenon. The study shows how the affective and cognitive components of trust and distrust constitute the unity and fragmentation of organisational culture. We propose that if an organisation is willing to improve its ethics, it should rely on fragmentation rather than unity.", "ex:volume": "139", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Trust and Distrust Constructing Unity and Fragmentation of Organisational Culture", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2915-7", "ex:pages": "701-716", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "﻿Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Case study", "Distrust", "Fragmentation", "International organisations", "Organisational culture", "Organisational ethics", "Trust", "Unity"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Johanna Kujala", "ex:email": "johanna.kujala@uta.fi"}, {"ex:name": "Hanna Lehtimäki", "ex:email": "hanna.lehtimaki@uef.fi"}, {"ex:name": "Raminta Pučėtaitė", "ex:email": "raminta.pucetaite@khf.vu.lt"}]}]
