[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Asian workplaces are often characterized by cultures that require more overtime than other cultures. Although predictors for overtime work have been rigorously studied, it is still meaningful to investigate specific aspects of Eastern cultural values that stem from Confucian ethics and may influence overtime work among Asian employees. We suggest that four major Confucian orientations are positively associated with employeesâ€™ affective and normative motives, which in turn affect working overtime. This article extends management literature on the subjects of cultural ethics and workaholism. It also suggests how Eastern cultural values lead to working overtime. We hope that our research effort on Confucian cultural value and its associations with other managerial outcomes and theories is a small cornerstone that allows management researchers to explore interesting and meaningful ways to apply Confucian culture and orientations in the workplace.", "ex:volume": "140", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Affective and Normative Motives to Work Overtime in Asian Organizations: Four Cultural Orientations from Confucian Ethics", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2683-4", "ex:pages": "115-130", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2017", "ex:keyword": ["Confucian culture", " Motives", " Values", " Overtime"], "ex:creator": ["Jae Hyeung Kang", "James G.
