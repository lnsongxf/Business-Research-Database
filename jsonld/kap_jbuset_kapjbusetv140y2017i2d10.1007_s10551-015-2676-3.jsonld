[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Analyzing a sample of 13,917 US firm–years from 1991 to 2006, we find that more innovative firms demonstrate high corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance subsequent to a successful innovation. These high-CSR innovative firms enjoy significantly higher valuation post-innovation. These findings imply that firms with demonstrated potential growth opportunities, as evident from the number of registered patents and their citations, benefit by strategically investing more in CSR activities; that is, CSR investment entails ‘doing well by [strategically] doing good.’", "ex:volume": "140", "ex:title": "Post-innovation CSR Performance and Firm Value", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2676-3", "ex:pages": "285-306", "ex:keywords": ["Patents", "Citations", "Innovation", "Corporate social responsibility", "Tobin’s Q"], "ex:date": "2017", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Dev R.
