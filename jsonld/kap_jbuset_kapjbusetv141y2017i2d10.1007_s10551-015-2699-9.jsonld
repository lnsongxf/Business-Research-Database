[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Although non-profit organisations typically have high representation of females on their boards, relatively little is known about the effects of gender diversity in these organisations particularly in relation to financial management. In this archival study, resource dependency theory and agency analysis are combined to provide theoretical insight and empirical analysis of gender diversity on effective financial management in member-governed, community financial institutions. The investigation is possible due to the unique characteristics of the organisational form and region being examinedâ€”credit unions in Northern Ireland. The sector has not been subject to external regulation on board gender, yet a wide array of gender mix on boards ranging from 100 % male to 100 % female are in existence. In addition, effective financial management is crucial to their survival and their ability to meet member objectives. Boards with higher female representation exhibit superior financial management first, in respect of loan book quality in the period of austerity following the financial crisis and second when measured against return on assets.", "ex:volume": "141", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Financial Management Effectiveness and Board Gender Diversity in Member-Governed, Community Financial Institutions", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2699-9", "ex:pages": "351-366", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2017", "ex:keyword": ["Agency", "Credit unions", "Financial management", "Gender diversity", "Governance", "Non-profits", "Resource dependence theory"], "ex:creator": ["Anne Marie Ward", "John Forker"]}]
