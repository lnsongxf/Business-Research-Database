[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Abstract Taking advantage of economic opportunities has led to numerous conflicts between society and business in various geographies of the world. Companies have developed social responsibility programs to prevent and manage these types of problems. However, some authors comment that these programs lack a strategic vision. Starting with the Working with People model, created for the field of rural development planning, this paper proposes a methodology to prevent the generation of social conflicts from business strategy: the territorial dimension. The proposal emphasizes that local development support prevents the generation of social conflicts. Finally, an experience in Peru, a country that has been characterized in recent years by high economic growth and also by the presence of social conflicts that have stopped entrepreneurship is analyzed.", "ex:volume": "141", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "The Territorial Dimension: The Component of Business Strategy that Prevents the Generation of Social Conflicts", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-015-2712-3", "ex:pages": "367-380", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2017", "ex:keyword": ["Social conflicts", "Business strategy", "Local development", "Social responsibility", "Territory"], "ex:creator": ["Alejandro Fontana", "Susana Sastre-Merino", "Maritza Baca"]}]
