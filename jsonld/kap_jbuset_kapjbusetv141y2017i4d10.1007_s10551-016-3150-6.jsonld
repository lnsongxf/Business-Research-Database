[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this article is to introduce a multidimensional framework based on the concept of moral imagination for analysing and capturing diverse virtues in contemporary Turkish organizations. Based on qualitative interviews with 58 managers in Turkey, this article develops an inventory of Turkish organizational virtues each of which can be associated with a different form of virtuous organizing. The inventory consists of nine forms of moral imagination, which map the multitude of virtues and moral emotions in organizations. Nine emergent forms of moral imagination are based on: integrity, affection, diligence, inspiration, wisdom, trust, gratefulness, justice, and harmony. The findings have made a contribution to the expanding literature on how Islamic organizations develop their business ethics through a repertoire of virtues. An empirical account of the range of virtues in organizational contexts that have emerged as a result of the hybridization of Islamic virtue/aesthetics and neoliberal capitalism in contemporary Turkey is provided. A theoretical contribution is made to business ethics literature through a phenomenology of virtues that provides unique insights on diverse forms of moral imagination in contemporary Turkey where Islam and neoliberal capitalism dynamically co-exist.", "ex:volume": "141", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Exploring the Diversity of Virtues Through the Lens of Moral Imagination: A Qualitative Inquiry into Organizational Virtues in the Turkish Context", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-016-3150-6", "ex:pages": "731-744", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "ï»¿Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2017", "ex:keyword": ["Moral imagination", "Organizational virtues", "Virtuous organizing", "Qualitative research", "Moral emotions"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Fahri Karakas", "ex:email": "fahrikarakas@gmail.com"}, {"ex:name": "Emine Sarigollu", "ex:email": "emine.sarigollu@mcgill.ca"}, {"ex:name": "Selcuk Uygur", "ex:email": "Selcuk.Uygur@brunel.ac.uk"}]}]
