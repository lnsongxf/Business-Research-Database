[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Abstract By engaging with multiple narratives of a police killing involving questionable legal procedures, known as a police encounter in India, we attempt to narrate stories of what happens to those who resist organizational wrongdoing by displaying moral anger against unethical actions. The State enables police encounters to occur by arguing that exceptional and alternate methods are required to engage with the crisis of terror and crime that the nation faces. Thus, police encounters are executed in the name of the collective morality of the greater common good. Those who resist police encounters argue from the standpoint of a democratic morality by suggesting that the very efficacy of democratic institutions will be eroded if encounters are normalized. We explore questions of organizational ethics from a temporal perspective while navigating between contending moral positions regarding police encounters.", "ex:volume": "141", "ex:source": "Journal of Business Ethics", "ex:title": "Organizational Wrongs, Moral Anger and the Temporality of Crisis", "ex:url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-016-3153-3", "ex:pages": "709-730", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2017", "ex:keyword": ["Crisis", "Ethics", "Moral anger", "Police encounters", "State", "Temporality", "Wrongdoing"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Srinath Jagannathan", "ex:email": "srinath.jayanti@gmail.com"}, {"ex:name": "Rajnish Rai", "ex:email": "rajnishrai@gmail.com"}]}]
