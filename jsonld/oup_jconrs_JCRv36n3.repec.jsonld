At low-level construals, individuals rely on resource accessibility cues (e.g., feelings of tiredness) to determine self-control. Hence, they exert less self-control only when they assess themselves as depleted, manifesting the depletion effect. High-level construals reduce the resource focus and enhance a goal focus, which diminishes and even reverses the depletion effect.", "ex:volume": "36", "ex:source": "Journal of Consumer Research", "ex:title": "Regulating Risk or Risking Regulation?
