The common assumption is that a household's tastes would not change as a function of economic conditions and therefore any adjustments in expenditure patterns during economic contractions/expansions would simply be due to changes in the consumption budget. Standard economic models translate these budgetary effects into lateral movements along a set of fixed Engel curves, which relate category expenditure shares to total expenditures. We propose and test a conceptual framework based on the notion of relative consumption, which prescribes that, for any given total consumption budget, expenditure shares for positional goods/services will decrease during a recession, while shares for nonpositional goods/services will increase (i.e., shifting the entire Engel curve upward or downward, depending on the nature of the expenditure category and the economic conditions).", "ex:volume": "39", "ex:source": "Journal of Consumer Research", "ex:title": "How Economic Contractions and Expansions Affect Expenditure Patterns", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/662611", "ex:pages": "229 - 247", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Wagner A.
