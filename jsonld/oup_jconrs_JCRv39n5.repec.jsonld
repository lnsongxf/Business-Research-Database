In addition, the selling mechanism--auction or negotiation--alters the effect of color by focusing individuals on primarily competing against other bidders (in auctions) or against the seller (in negotiations).

This question was studied by examining emerging preferences in choices involving two products that were means to conflicting goals.

This influence was manifest in a tendency for consumers to revert to the product aligned with the initially active goal upon seeing information that objectively favored neither product. The prevalence of the reversion (i.e., flip-flop) preference pattern suggests that activation of a set-aside goal escalates when it is set aside, much as if its pursuit had been impeded by an external force.
