[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Consumers from cultures that read from left to right possess a spatial representation of time whereby the past is visualized on the left and the future is visualized on the right. Across four studies, the current research investigates whether and how this past-left, future-right conceptualization of time affects attitudes toward time-related products. Specifically, when consumers view advertisements in which product images are positioned congruently (incongruently) with their spatial representation of time, they have more (less) favorable attitudes toward the product. This effect occurs for both products that naturally involve the progression of time (e.g., self-improvement products) and also products for which a time component is a desired attribute (e.g., antiques). The effect of horizontal position reverses among consumers who read from right to left. The mediating role of processing fluency is highlighted as an underlying mechanism, and the moderating role of need for structure is identified.", "ex:volume": "40", "ex:source": "Journal of Consumer Research", "ex:title": "The Future Looks \"Right\": Effects of the Horizontal Location of Advertising Images on Product Attitude", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/669476", "ex:pages": "223 - 238", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Boyoun (Grace) Chae", "JoAndrea Hoegg"]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Individuals possess social identities that contain unique, identity-relevant attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs providing \"what-to-do\" information when enacting that identity.

However, competition among consumers is a ubiquitous part of Western culture. Across five experiments in competitive contexts (either a dictator game or an online auction), interpersonal ambiguity leads to an inference of dissimilarity, rather than similarity. As a result, consumers compete as aggressively against ambiguous others as they do against dissimilar others. This effect occurs regardless of brand quality, seller reputation, or number of other competitors in the auction. A final study demonstrates that aggressiveness may be directed toward the seller rather than other bidders when sellers are ambiguous or dissimilar.

Seven experiments designed to address this question revealed that people with a more interdependent (vs. independent) cultural self-construal--operationalized by ethnicity, nationality, measured self-construal, or manipulated salient self-construal--have a greater tendency to use price information to judge quality. This difference arises because interdependents tend to be holistic (vs. analytic) thinkers who are more likely to perceive interrelations between the elements of a product. These effects were observed regardless of whether the price-quality relation was assessed with a standard self-report scale or via actual product judgments, and whether thinking style was measured or manipulated.

Consistent with this proposition, people's preferences for mood-congruent music strongly correlate with their preferences for an empathic friend (experiment 1).
