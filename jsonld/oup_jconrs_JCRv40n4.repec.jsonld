[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Myths have come of age in consumer research. In the 22 years since Levy's inaugural article, the literature has grown at an impressive rate. Yet important questions remain unanswered: What makes some myths especially meaningful to consumers? Why are certain consumer myths more prevalent and less perishable than others? This article argues that ambiguity is an influential factor. Using the RMS Titanic as an empirical exemplar, it unpacks the principal forms of myth-informed ambiguity surrounding \"the unsinkable brand.\" Predicated on William Empson's hitherto unsung principles of literary criticism, the article posits that ambiguity in its multifaceted forms is integral to outstanding branding and consumer meaning making, as well as myth appeal more generally.", "ex:volume": "40", "ex:source": "Journal of Consumer Research", "ex:title": "Titanic: Consuming the Myths and Meanings of an Ambiguous Brand", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/671474", "ex:pages": "595 - 614", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Stephen Brown", "Pierre McDonagh", "Clifford J.

Results from a field study and four laboratory studies demonstrate that a consumer's decision to recycle a product or throw it in the trash can be determined by the extent to which the product has been distorted during the consumption process. Specifically, if the consumption process distorts a product sufficiently from its original form (i.e., changes in size or form), consumers perceive it as less useful and in turn are more likely to throw it in the garbage (as opposed to recycle it). These findings point to important outcomes of the consumption process that have largely been ignored and provide initial insight into the psychological processes influencing recycling behavior.", "ex:volume": "40", "ex:source": "Journal of Consumer Research", "ex:title": "The Effect of Product Size and Form Distortion on Consumer Recycling Behavior", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/671475", "ex:pages": "632 - 643", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Remi Trudel", "Jennifer J.

It provides evidence that materialism and loneliness are engaged in bidirectional relationships over time. Importantly, it finds that loneliness contributes more to materialism than the other way around. Moreover, it finds that materialism's contribution to loneliness is not uniformly vicious but critically differs between specific subtypes of materialism. That is, valuing possessions as a happiness medicine or as a success measure increased loneliness, and these subtypes also increased most due to loneliness. Yet seeking possessions for material mirth decreased loneliness and was unaffected by it. These findings are based on longitudinal data from over 2,500 consumers across 6 years and a new latent growth model. They reveal how materialism and loneliness form a self-perpetuating vicious and virtuous cycle depending on the materialism subtype.", "ex:volume": "40", "ex:source": "Journal of Consumer Research", "ex:title": "Bidirectional Dynamics of Materialism and Loneliness: Not Just a Vicious Cycle", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/671564", "ex:pages": "615 - 631", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Rik Pieters"]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Many consumer price promotions (including new product launches) offer a product for free or for a low, discounted price along with a required purchase. This research demonstrates that consumers' willingness to pay for the product after the promotion is retracted is higher when it was offered for free than when it was offered at a low, discounted price. The underlying reasoning is that the price of the product on promotion is used as a natural anchor for value estimation. However, when the product is offered for free (i.e., zero price), consumers are less likely to consider the value of the product and are influenced by anchors such as the price of the focal purchase. In contrast to some prior findings, a free offer does not devalue the product at all and, at a minimum, devalues the product less than if it were offered for a low, discounted price.", "ex:volume": "40", "ex:source": "Journal of Consumer Research", "ex:title": "Free Offer &#x02260; Cheap Product: A Selective Accessibility Account on the Valuation of Free Offers", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/671565", "ex:pages": "644 - 656", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Mauricio M.

The current research demonstrates that nonembarrassing additional purchases do not necessarily attenuate anticipated embarrassment but may, paradoxically, exacerbate it instead. Results further show that when additional purchases do attenuate anticipated embarrassment, they can do so independently of their effect on the salience of the embarrassing product. Five experiments provide converging evidence that additional purchases attenuate (vs. exacerbate) anticipated embarrassment to the extent that they are perceived to counterbalance (vs. complement) the undesired identity communicated during purchase. These results contrast with the traditional explanation for this strategy, which holds that additional purchases mitigate embarrassment because they compete with the embarrassing product for observers' attention.

Four experiments demonstrated that although the requirement to complete all goal-related actions following a fixed sequence discourages consumers from adopting the goal, this rigidity turns out to be more effective in inducing actual goal completion.

Horizontal brands offer differentiation through the expression of personality, taste, traits, and so forth, whereas vertical brands offer differentiation by conferring status or demonstrating one's superiority to others in a group. The results reveal that under social exclusion (inclusion), low self-esteem consumers increase perceptions of group heterogeneity (seek to protect their future belongingness) and subsequently increase their attachment to horizontal (vertical) brands.

Study 2 reveals that reading a review containing figurative language increases choice of hedonic over utilitarian options. Finally, via analysis of online consumer reviews and a lab experiment, studies 3 and 4 indicate that consumers use figurative language more when sharing experiences about hedonic than utilitarian consumption, and that review extremity influences figurative language use only in reviews of hedonic consumption.

Prior work suggests that to the extent the compliment is perceived to be genuine, observers will not judge the source negatively.

Specifically, while observers' deliberative attitudes toward apparently sincere flattery may be positive, a spontaneous process of comparing oneself with the target will produce an implicit negative reaction rooted in the unpleasant sensation of envy. This conceptualization yields a host of related implications, successfully predicting observers' reactions toward insincere as well as sincere flattery and toward the flattery target as well its source, and also explaining how their envy-based negative reaction may ironically induce observers to behave in a manner consistent with the flatterer's interests.

Because frames exist on the sociocultural and individual level, our research takes a multimethod approach to this question. On the sociocultural level, we conduct a content analysis of operant media frames for discussing online gambling and perform an event analysis, finding that a shift in consumer judgments follows an abrupt shift in frame. Then, on the individual level, the causal mechanism for these shifts is investigated in an experimental setting using the Implicit Association Test (IAT). These experiments show that framing affects normative legitimacy judgments by changing implicit associations. Further, users and nonusers respond differently to frame elements, with users favoring an established frame and nonusers favoring a novel, legitimating frame. This suggests that media frames play a critical role in establishing legitimacy at the sociocultural level and that framing potentially bridges cognitive and normative legitimacy.", "ex:volume": "40", "ex:source": "Journal of Consumer Research", "ex:title": "Framing the Game: Assessing the Impact of Cultural Representations on Consumer Perceptions of Legitimacy", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/672358", "ex:pages": "773 - 795", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Ashlee Humphreys", "Kathryn A.
