Further, this preference appears to be independent from inferences about the quality of the item, salience of the number, or beliefs about market value.

Our approach is based on the role of materiality (as well as meanings) and multi-temporality in heirloom consumption. The data generated through interviews, visual sources, and media documents reveal three rejuvenation processes that, given particular boundary conditions, renew heirlooms: uncovering, refreshing, and reconciliation. Our study also distinguishes three types of heirloom essence that can survive the heirloom’s material and compositional transformations. Rejuvenation reintegrates the heirloom into the heir’s life trajectory by imbuing it with a zeitgeist value and the heir’s presence, helping the heir to better navigate her imaginaries of the past, present, and future. Beyond the ritualistic consumption or curation of heirlooms, our findings reveal a creative, playful, and proactive relation with heirlooms, evocative of craftwork. Moreover, the market, within particular boundaries, can help authenticate heirloom objects and facilitate their inalienability rather than necessarily destroying their authenticity. Our study has implications for the role of heirloom consumption in consumers’ negotiations of continuity and change, the interaction of the symbolic and the material in heirlooms, and the inalienability–market relation.", "ex:volume": "43", "ex:source": "Journal of Consumer Research", "ex:title": "Continuity Through Change: Navigating Temporalities Through Heirloom Rejuvenation", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/jcr/ucw011", "ex:pages": "1-25", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Meltem Türe", "Güliz Ger"]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Although self-enhancement has recently been established as a central motive for sharing word-of-mouth information, little is known about the impact of self-enhancing assertions (e.g., boasting) on persuasion. We theorize, and demonstrate in three studies, that although boasting is perceived negatively, such immodest self-presentations can either impede or enhance social perceptions and persuasion. The valence of the persuasion outcome depends heavily on trust cues that change the meaning of boasting to the word-of-mouth recipient. Boasting in the presence of low trust cues activates heightened vigilance (e.g., valenced thoughts) about the source’s motives, leading to decreased persuasion. However, when given reason to trust the source specifically or people generally, boasting is readily accepted as a signal of source expertise, leading to increased persuasion.

This occurs because consumers intuitively view disconfirmation as more authentic of an exciting personality. Similarly, despite the wealth of literature linking positive disconfirmation to positive posttrial evaluations, the authors find that sensory confirmation is more preferred for sincere brands because consumers intuitively view confirmation as more authentic of a sincere personality.

An agentic-communal model of power is presented that proposes power affects both the messages generated by communicators and the messages that persuade audiences. Compared to low-power states, high-power states produce a greater emphasis on information that conveys competence. As a consequence, high-power communicators generate messages with greater competence information, and high-power audiences are persuaded more by competence information. In contrast to high-power states, low-power states produce a greater emphasis on information that conveys warmth. As a result, low-power communicators generate messages with greater warmth information, and low-power audiences are persuaded more by warmth information. Because of these two outcomes, a power-matching effect occurs between communicator and audience power: high-power communicators are more effective in persuading high-power audience members, whereas low-power communicators are more effective in persuading low-power audience members. Four experiments find support for these effects in oral and written contexts with three distinct manipulations of power. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that the persuasiveness of messages can be affected by the alignment between the psychological sense of power of the communicator and the audience.", "ex:volume": "43", "ex:source": "Journal of Consumer Research", "ex:title": "Dynamics of Communicator and Audience Power: The Persuasiveness of Competence versus Warmth", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/jcr/ucw006", "ex:pages": "68-85", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["David Dubois", "Derek D.

But the content (e.g., stories, news, information) that people transmit can be acquired in different ways. Sometimes people find content themselves, and other times people receive content from others (e.g., via email or conversation). Might these different acquisition methods impact subsequent sharing, and if so, how? Six studies demonstrate that acquisition method can impact transmission through changing how content is processed. Compared to received content, people are more likely to associate found content with themselves, which decreases processing. Reduced processing, in turn, lowers sensitivity to diagnostic content characteristics (e.g., whether content is interesting or well written), which reduces these characteristics’ impact on sharing. Thus while receivers are more likely to share interesting (than boring) content, the difference is attenuated (and in some cases, disappeared) among finders. These findings deepen insights into the psychological drivers of word of mouth and shed light on how contextual factors, content characteristics, and the self interact to drive social transmission.", "ex:volume": "43", "ex:source": "Journal of Consumer Research", "ex:title": "How Content Acquisition Method Affects Word of Mouth", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/jcr/ucw001", "ex:pages": "86-102", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Zoey Chen", "Jonah Berger"]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Would laterally displaying a healthy item to the left versus right of an unhealthy item influence choice and consumption? The results of seven studies demonstrate that displaying healthy items to the left (vs. right) of unhealthy items enhances preference for the healthy options. In addition, consumption volume of a healthy item (vis-à-vis an unhealthy item) is higher when it is placed to the left (vs. right) of the unhealthy item. We propose that a \"healthy-left, unhealthy-right\" (vs. healthy-right, unhealthy-left) lateral display pattern is congruent with consumers’ mental organization of food items varying in healthfulness, which enhances ease of processing and in turn enhances self-control, thereby leading to a relatively higher likelihood of choosing healthy options.

It is demonstrated that decision comfort responds to affect-relevant cues and tends to rely less on comparisons between the chosen and foregone options (i.e., it tends to be a less comparative evaluation).
