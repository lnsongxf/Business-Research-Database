On the basis of a formal model, testable hypotheses of bank attitude toward risk and the qualitative behavior of the index of relative risk aversion for commercial banks are developed. Through the use of data on the member banks of the Tenth Federal Reserve District, the empirical tests that were conducted indicated that banks are strongly risk-averse and that their index of relative risk aversion is increasing in profits.
