With an upstream monopolist we first show that resale price maintenance is equivalent to forward integration and that both increase profits. Then we demonstrate that forward integration by an upstream monopolist will reduce welfare for the industry. Prices fall with forward integration, but the integrating firm contracts the number of downstream subsidiaries so drastically that the reduced diversity more than offsets the gains from lower prices.", "ex:volume": "100", "ex:source": "Quarterly Journal of Economics", "ex:title": "Resale Price Maintenance and Forward Integration into a Monopolistically Competitive Industry", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/1885684", "ex:pages": "1293-1311", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "1985", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Martin K.

We derive a strong version of the factor price equalization theorem that shows free trade tends to equalize sector-specific unemployment rates and sector-specific factor prices across countries.
