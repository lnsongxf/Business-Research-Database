It proves that such Smithian growth exhibits generic threshold behavior. Below a critical density of transport linkages, the economy is split into isolated local markets with limited specialization. Above the critical density, these markets begin to fuse into a large, economywide market causing growth to accelerate. This allows an explicit test of the consensus among historians of Sung dynasty China that the economic revolution during that period was a result of commercialization caused by the creation of a national waterway network.", "ex:volume": "112", "ex:source": "Quarterly Journal of Economics", "ex:title": "The Dynamics of Smithian Growth", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1162/003355397555398", "ex:pages": "939-964", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "1997", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Morgan Kelly"]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Generating government revenue is a common objective in privatization. This paper asks what determines privatization prices using firm-level data for all 236 Mexican companies privatized between 1983 and 1992. There are three main reasons why net pricesâauction prices net of the cost of prior restructuring measuresâare low, averaging 54 cents per dollar of assets. First, privatization prices are very sensitive to the level of competition in the auction and restrictions often limited participation. Second, the privatization process took too long, and lengthier privatizations are associated with lower premiums. Third, firm prior restructuring measures absorbed an average of 33 percent of the auction price. Most restructuring measures do not increase price and delay privatization further. Net prices would have increased by 71 cents per dollar of assets if the government had emphasized speed, succeeding in divesting assets in one year less than the average, and firing the CEO were the only restructuring step taken.", "ex:volume": "112", "ex:source": "Quarterly Journal of Economics", "ex:title": "Determinants of Privatization Prices", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1162/003355300555402", "ex:pages": "965-1025", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "1997", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Florencio LÃ³pez-de-Silanes"]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "This paper studies the equilibrium determination of the number of countries in different political regimes, and in different economic environments, with more or less economic integration.
