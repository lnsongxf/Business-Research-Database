Segments of the economy that are freed from centralized control respond to the rent-seeking opportunities implicit in the remaining distortions of the economy.

In this paper I illustrate this idea with a study of the People's Republic of China. Under the plan, prices were skewed so as to concentrate profits, and hence revenue, in industry. As control over factor allocations was loosened, local governments throughout the economy sought to capture these rents by developing high margin industries. Continued reform, and growing interregional competition between duplicative industries, threatened the profitability of these industrial structures, leading local governments to impose a variety of interregional barriers to trade. Thus, the reform process led to the fragmentation of the domestic market and the distortion of regional production away from patterns of comparative advantage.", "ex:volume": "115", "ex:source": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "ex:title": "The Razor's Edge: Distortions and Incremental Reform in the People's Republic of China", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1162/003355300555024", "ex:pages": "1091-1135", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2000", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Alwyn Young"]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "What is the current account response to transitory income shocks such as temporary changes in the terms of trade, transfers from abroad, or fluctuations in production?
