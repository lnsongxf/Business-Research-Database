We develop a new model of addictive behavior that takes as its starting point the standard \"rational addiction\" model, but incorporates time-inconsistent preferences. This model also exhibits forward-looking behavior, but it has strikingly different normative implications; in this case optimal government policy should depend not only on the externalities that smokers impose on others but also on the \"internalities\" imposed by smokers on themselves.
