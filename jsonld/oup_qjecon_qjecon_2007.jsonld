I present some evidence of these types of effects.

Debate on health policy often focuses on limiting the growth of health spending. We investigate an issue central to this debate: Is the growth of health spending a rational response to changing economic conditions—notably the growth of income per person? We develop a model based on standard economic assumptions and argue that this is indeed the case. Standard preferences—of the kind used widely in economics to study consumption, asset pricing, and labor supply—imply that health spending is a superior good with an income elasticity well above one. As people get richer and consumption rises, the marginal utility of consumption falls rapidly. Spending on health to extend life allows individuals to purchase additional periods of utility. The marginal utility of life extension does not decline. As a result, the optimal composition of total spending shifts toward health, and the health share grows along with income. In projections based on the quantitative analysis of our model, the optimal health share of spending seems likely to exceed 30 percent by the middle of the century.", "ex:volume": "122", "ex:source": "Quarterly Journal of Economics", "ex:title": "The Value of Life and the Rise in Health Spending", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1162/qjec.122.1.39", "ex:pages": "39-72", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2007", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Robert E.
