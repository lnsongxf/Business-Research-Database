Since system characteristics are the prime concern of economy-wide models, it might be the case that the validity of every individual component is not essential to adequate overall performance. While this viewpoint is debatable it does draw attention to the need for system evaluation procedures, at which point data limitations pose serious constraints on formal tests.
