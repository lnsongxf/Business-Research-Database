In the model there is both imperfect information and imperfect competition. When vertical integration by the monopolist is allowed, the regulator's task is made harder insofar as the monopolist has anticompetitive incentives to raise rivals' costs. On the other hand, integration may lead to there being fewer firms in the deregulated sector and hence less duplication of fixed costs.

The paper characterizes the structure of optimal, renegotiation-proof contracts for unmonitored and monitored finance. Monitoring by investors, although itself subject to distorting incentive constraints, is shown to be able to overcome the short-term bias of investment and thus to lengthen the firms' planning horizon.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Review of Economic Studies", "ex:volume": "62", "ex:title": "Long-Term Contracts, Short-Term Investment and Monitoring", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2298077", "ex:pages": "557-575", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1995", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Ernst-Ludwig von Thadden"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "This paper studies a dynamic insurance problem with bilateral asymmetric information and balanced budgets. There are two infinitely-lived agents in our model, both risk averse, and each has an i.i.d. random endowment stream which is unobservable to the other. In each period, each agent must have a non-negative consumption and together they must consume the entire aggregate endowment. Dynamic incentive compatibility in the Nash sense is defined. We give sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of a constrained efficient contract. We show that a constrained efficient contract can be characterized in a Bellman equation. We demonstrate that the long-run distribution of expected utilities of each agent is not degenerate. We also develop an algorithm for computing the efficient contract and, in a numerical example, we find that the consumption processes of the agents form stationary Markov chains.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Review of Economic Studies", "ex:volume": "62", "ex:title": "Dynamic Insurance with Private Information and Balanced Budgets", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2298078", "ex:pages": "577-595", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1995", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Cheng Wang"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "This paper considers a representative agent model of asset prices based on a recursive utility specification.
