We find that the lack of persistence in policies per se need not be welfare reducing and that it is likely to decrease growth. Higher variability implies more frequent changes in consumption and investment. But, by creating a stronger intertemporal link across regimes, variability reduces the fluctuation in investment rates, thus decreasing the magnitude of changes in consumption and increasing welfare.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Review of Economic Studies", "ex:volume": "63", "ex:title": "Policy Variability and Economic Growth", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2297796", "ex:pages": "611-625", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1996", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Hugo A.

It is shown that fiat money can be valuable even though it yields a lower rate of return than the coexisting credit. The competition between money and credit increases efficiency. The monetary equilibrium with credit Pareto dominates the monetary equilibrium without credit whenever the two coexist. When a credit is repaid with money, the competition also bounds the purchasing power of money from below by that of credit and so eliminates the weak inefficient monetary equilibrium found in previous search models. With numerical examples, three different monetary equilibria are ranked and the properties of the interest rate are examined.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Review of Economic Studies", "ex:volume": "63", "ex:title": "Credit and Money in a Search Model with Divisible Commodities", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2297797", "ex:pages": "627-652", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1996", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Shouyong Shi"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Convergence to a full-information equilibrium (FIE) in the presence of persistent shocks and asymmetric information about an unknown payoff-relevant parameter θ is established in a classical infinite-horizon partial equilibrium linear model. It is found that, under the usual stability assumptions on the autoregressive process of shocks, convergence occurs at the rate n−1/2, where n is the number of rounds of trade, and that the asymptotic variance of the discrepancy of the full-information price and the market price is independent of the degree of autocorrelation of the shocks. This is so even though the speed of learning θ from prices becomes arbitrarily slow as autocorrelation approaches a unit root level. It follows then that learning the unknown parameter θ and convergence of the equilibrium process to the FIE are not equivalent. Moreover, allowing for non-stationary processes of shocks, the distinction takes a more stark form. Learning θ is neither necessary nor sufficient for convergence to the FIE. When the process of shocks has a unit root, convergence to the FIE occurs but θ can not be learned. When the process is sufficiently explosive and there is a positive mass of perfectly informed agents, θ is learned quickly but convergence to the FIE does not occur.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Review of Economic Studies", "ex:volume": "63", "ex:title": "Learning and Convergence to a Full-Information Equilibrium are not Equivalent", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2297798", "ex:pages": "653-674", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1996", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Byoung Jun"}, {"ex:name": "Xavier Vives"}]}]
