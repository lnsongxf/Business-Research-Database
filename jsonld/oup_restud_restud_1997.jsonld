We illustrate these points by presenting an analysis of the returns to a high school education using quarter of birth as an instrument. We show that the standard instrumental variables estimates implicitly estimate the outcome distributions to be negative over a substantial range, and that the estimates of the local average treatment effect change considerably when we impose nonnegativity in any of a variety of ways.", "ex:volume": "64", "ex:source": "Review of Economic Studies", "ex:title": "Estimating Outcome Distributions for Compliers in Instrumental Variables Models", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2971731", "ex:pages": "555-574", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1997", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Guido W.

In particular, we consider what inferences can be made about the causal effect of teenage childbearing on a teen mother's subsequent outcomes when we use the natural experiment of miscarriages to form an instrumental variable for teen births. Miscarriages might not meet all of the conditions required for an instrumental variable to identify such causal effects for all of the observations in our sample. However, it is an appropriate instrumental variable for some women, namely those pregnant women who experience a random miscarriage. Although information from typical data sources does not allow one to identify these women, we show that one can adapt results from Horowitz and Manski (1995) on identification with data from contaminated samples to construct informative bounds on the causal effect of teenage childbearing. We use these bounds to re-examine the effects of early chilbearing on the teen mother's subsequent educational and labour market attainment as considered in Hotz, McElroy and Sanders (1995a, 1995b). Consistent with their study, these bounds indicate that women who have births as teens have higher labour market earnings and hours worked compared to what they would have attained if their childbearing had been delayed.", "ex:volume": "64", "ex:source": "Review of Economic Studies", "ex:title": "Bounding Causal Effects Using Data from a Contaminated Natural Experiment: Analysing the Effects of Teenage Childbearing", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2971732", "ex:pages": "575-603", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1997", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "V.

Using rich nonexperimental data, we examine the performance of a two-stage evaluation methodology that (a) estimates the probability that a person participates in a programme and (b) uses the estimated probability in extensions of the classical method of matching. We decompose the conventional measure of programme evaluation bias into several components and find that bias due to selection on unobservables, commonly called selection bias in econometrics, is empirically less important than other components, although it is still a sizeable fraction of the estimated programme impact. Matching methods applied to comparison groups located in the same labour markets as participants and administered the same questionnaire eliminate much of the bias as conventionally measured, but the remaining bias is a considerable fraction of experimentally-determined programme impact estimates. We test and reject the identifying assumptions that justify the classical method of matching. We present a nonparametric conditional difference-in-differences extension of the method of matching that is consistent with the classical index-sufficient sample selection model and is not rejected by our tests of identifying assumptions. This estimator is effective in eliminating bias, especially when it is due to temporally-invariant omitted variables.", "ex:volume": "64", "ex:source": "Review of Economic Studies", "ex:title": "Matching As An Econometric Evaluation Estimator: Evidence from Evaluating a Job Training Programme", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2971733", "ex:pages": "605-654", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1997", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "James J.

The evaluation implemented in this paper is restricted to the impact of such public measures on durations and outcomes of subsequent spells of unemployment and employment. The econometric study is conducted with non-experimental longitudinal microdata recording individual labour market histories. A particular attention is paid to the differential effects of various types of measures, according to the educational level of recipients. Programmes involving a higher level of on-the-job training, such as alternating work/training programmes in private firms, are principally beneficial to the less educated young workers. In contrast, for more educated young workers, \"work fare\" programmes in the public sector decrease the intensity of transition from the subsequent unemployment spell to regular jobs; for that subgroup, \"work fare\" programmes may act as a signal of low employment performance.", "ex:volume": "64", "ex:source": "Review of Economic Studies", "ex:title": "Evaluating the Impact of French Employment Policies on Individual Labour Market Histories", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2971735", "ex:pages": "683-713", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1997", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Liliane Bonnal"}, {"ex:name": "Denis Fougère"}, {"ex:name": "Anne Sérandon"}]}]
