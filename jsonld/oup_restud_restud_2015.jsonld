If “inheritance” is important for economic outcomes, then rare surnames should predict economic outcomes in the cross-section. This is because rare surnames are indicative of familial linkages. If the number of rare surnames is small this approach will not work. However, rare surnames are abundant in the highly skewed nature of surname distributions from most Western societies. We develop a model that articulates this idea and shows that the more important is inheritance, the more informative will be surnames. This result is robust to a variety of different assumptions about fertility and mating. We apply our method using the 2001 census from Catalonia, a large region of Spain. We use educational attainment as a proxy for overall economic well-being. A calibration exercise results in an estimate of the intergenerational correlation of educational attainment of 0.60. We also find evidence suggesting that mobility has decreased among the different generations of the 20th century. A complementary analysis based on sibling correlations confirms our results and provides a robustness check on our method. Our model and our data allow us to examine one possible explanation for the observed decrease in mobility. We find that the degree of assortative mating has increased over time.

My solution approach does not rely on the typical \"conjecture and verify\" method, and I exhibit a number of non-normal examples in which asset prices can be characterized explicitly and in a closed form. The results presented here open up a broad class of models for applied work. To illustrate the usefulness of generalizing the standard model, I show that in settings with non-normally distributed pay-offs, shocks to fundamentals may be amplified purely due to learning effects, price drifts can arise naturally, and the disagreement–return relation depends in a novel way on return skewness.", "ex:volume": "82", "ex:source": "Review of Economic Studies", "ex:title": "On Existence and Uniqueness of Equilibrium in a Class of Noisy Rational Expectations Models", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/restud/rdv012", "ex:pages": "868-921", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Bradyn Breon-Drish"]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "This article analyses how outsiders, such as bidders or activist investors, overcome the lack of coordination and information among dispersed shareholders. We identify the two basic means to achieve this goal. First, the outsider must relinquish private benefits in a manner that is informative about security benefits. We show under which conditions this is feasible and which acquisition strategies used in practice meet these conditions. Second, the outsider can alternatively use derivatives to drive a wedge between her voting power and her economic interest in the firm. Such unbundling of ownership and control, while typically considered a source of corporate governance problems, is an efficient response to the frictions dispersed ownership causes for control contestability. We also show that unbundling comes with costs and benefits for the bidder's incentives to improve firm value.", "ex:volume": "82", "ex:source": "Review of Economic Studies", "ex:title": "Signalling to Dispersed Shareholders and Corporate Control", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/restud/rdv005", "ex:pages": "922-962", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Mike Burkart", "Samuel Lee"]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "A dynamic model with credit under limited commitment is constructed, in which limited memory can weaken the effects of punishment for default.

We develop a quantitative dynamic general equilibrium model with endogenous fertility and female labour force participation decisions.

For the war generation of women, the high demand for female labour brought about by mobilization leads to an increase in labour supply that persists after the war. As a result, younger women who reach adulthood in the 1950s face increased labour market competition, which impels them to exit the labour market and start having children earlier. The effect is amplified by the rise in taxes necessary to pay down wartime government debt.

The PMH model has hidden actions, while the HMH model has hidden information in addition to hidden actions. In both models, agents are risk averse and principals are risk neutral. The article derives the equilibrium restrictions from the optimal contract and uses the restrictions to show that the models have empirical content. For any given risk-aversion parameter, the models' other parameters are non-parametrically point identified. The risk-aversion parameter—and hence the model—are, however, only partially identified. Management's ability to manipulate accounting reports arises endogenously within HMH models, but not in all versions of PMH models. We use our framework to investigate whether shareholders contract with management recognizing that accounting reports are susceptible to manipulation and, therefore, endogenous to the incentives offered to management. The data reject all models in which accounting reports are verifiable. Furthermore, the version of the PMH in which accounting reports can be manipulated is rejected if expected compensation is restricted to be positive.", "ex:volume": "82", "ex:source": "Review of Economic Studies", "ex:title": "Identifying and Testing Models of Managerial Compensation", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/restud/rdv004", "ex:pages": "1074-1118", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["George-Levi Gayle", "Robert A.

We provide both necessary and sufficient conditions for equilibria to be Pareto efficient and show that when collateral is scarce equilibria are not only Pareto inefficient but also often constrained inefficient, in the sense that imposing tighter borrowing restrictions can make everybody in the economy better off.

The model embeds a static mechanism of balance-of-payments crisis which produces multiple equilibria within a single time period when the non-tradable sector is large enough compared to the tradable sector. The article studies the dynamics induced by an increase in financial openness. It shows that the relative size of the non-tradable sector overshoots, which makes the economy more likely to be financially fragile during the transitory dynamics.
