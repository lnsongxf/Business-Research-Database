Under these conditions alone, and given rich enough support of the data, potential outcome distributions, the average structural function, and quantile structural functions are point identified. If the support of the continuous instrument is not large enough, potential outcome distributions are partially identified. If the instrument is discrete, identification fails completely.

In a liquidity trap caused by a self-fulfilling state of low confidence, higher government spending has deflationary effects that reduce the spending multiplier when the zero lower bound is binding. Instead, cuts in marginal labour tax rates are inflationary and become more expansionary when the zero lower bound is binding. These findings contradict a popular view, based on a liquidity trap caused by a fundamental shock such as a taste shock, that higher government spending is inflationary and can therefore be associated with large multipliers at the zero lower bound, while lower marginal tax rates are deflationary and therefore counterproductive.", "ex:volume": "81", "ex:source": "Review of Economic Studies", "ex:title": "Fiscal Policy in an Expectations-Driven Liquidity Trap", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/restud/rdu016", "ex:pages": "1637-1667", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Karel R.

The principal's private information creates signaling considerations that may distort the implemented allocation. We show that there is no distortion: all principal types implement an allocation that is optimal for the principal ex ante, before he/she learns his/her type. As an application, we consider settings with linear utility. For bilateral exchange in which the principal is one of the traders, the solution is a combination of a participation fee, a buy-out option for the principal, and a resale stage with posted prices.", "ex:volume": "81", "ex:source": "Review of Economic Studies", "ex:title": "Mechanism Design by an Informed Principal: Private Values with Transferable Utility", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/restud/rdu019", "ex:pages": "1668-1707", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Tymofiy Mylovanov"}, {"ex:name": "Thomas Tröger"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "I extend multi-unit auction estimation techniques to a setting in which firms can express cost complementarities over time. In the context of electricity markets, I show how the auction structure and bidding data can be used to estimate these complementarities, which in these markets arise due to startup costs. I find that startup costs are substantial and that taking them into account helps better explain firm bidding strategies and production patterns. As in other dynamic settings, I find that startup costs limit the ability of firms to change production over time, exacerbating fluctuations in market prices. These fluctuations can induce estimates of market power that ignore dynamic costs to overstate markup volatility, with predicted markups that can be even negative in periods of low demand. I show how accounting for startup costs can provide a natural correction for these markup biases.", "ex:volume": "81", "ex:source": "Review of Economic Studies", "ex:title": "Complementary Bidding Mechanisms and Startup Costs in Electricity Markets", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/restud/rdu022", "ex:pages": "1708-1742", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Mar Reguant"}]}]
