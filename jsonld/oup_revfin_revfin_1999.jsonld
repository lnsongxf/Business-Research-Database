[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "This paper argues that in the fundamental subject of financial risk analysis, some valuable lessons may be drawn from insurance. The probability of ruin, defined as a first passage time, carries a dynamic element whose absence in Value at Risk is one liability, among others. Extreme value theory, which has been successfully applied to insurance shortly after it was introduced in probability, may offer a coherent framework for analyzing the extreme moves such as the ones observed in recent foreign exchange and financial crises. Lastly, we show that the genuine hazards generated by global capital markets and illustrated by the events of summer 1998, generate a market incompleteness that existing models of defaultable bonds do not fully address.

Our model formalizes the conflict between bank objectives and regulatory goals. Banks' decisions represent a tension between their desire to exploit the deposit-insurance put option and their desire to preserve franchise value. Regulators seek to balance the social value of deposits in mediating transactions against the deadweight costs of failure resolution. Our social welfare criterion is standard: a weighted average agents' utilities. We demonstrate that banks do not incrementally alter their portfolio risk as the economic environment changes. Rather, banks either choose the minimal feasible risk or the maximal feasible risk. This pattern, in turn, drives regulatory decisions: The first goal of the regulator is to induce banks to choose the minimal risk level. For all nontrivial cases, unregulated banks fail to choose the first-best allocations. Traditional ex-ante capital requirements can induce banks to choose the socially-optimal level of portfolio risk, but the required capital is often inefficiently high. In contrast, variants of the Federal Reserve Board's precommitment proposal imply far smaller efficiency losses, and achieve allocations at or nearthe first-best for most reasonable model specifications. The ex-post penalties required for the optimal implementation of precommitment are not excessively large. The welfare gains from precommitment are even higher when the precommitment penalty function is precluded from sending banks into default. We conclude that state-contingent regulatory mechanisms, of which the precommitment approach is an example, offer the possibility of substantial gains in regulatory efficiency, relative to traditional state non-contingent regulation.", "ex:volume": "2", "ex:source": "Review of Finance", "ex:title": "Bank Capital Standards for Market Risk: A Welfare Analysis", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1023/A:1009705608627", "ex:pages": "125-157", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "1999", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "David Marshall"}, {"ex:name": "Subu Venkataraman"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "", "ex:volume": "2", "ex:source": "Review of Finance", "ex:title": "Comment on ‘Bank Capital Standards for Market Risk: A Welfare Analysis’", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1023/A:1009720227906", "ex:pages": "159-160", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "1999", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Pierre Mella-Barral"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Value-at-risk methods which employ a linear (\"delta only\") approximation to the relation between instrument values and the underlying risk factors are unlikely to be robust when applied to portfolios containing non-linear contracts such as options.

On the one hand, the variance of the expected outcomes declines during this process, but on the other hand, the participants could obtain superior outcomes using public information, while some, who had access to private information, may performed even better. Thus, wondering whether the process in the Czech Republic served as an efficient price discovery mechanism, additional potential distortions should be investigated: (i) the specific rules of the process through which the public exchanged bidding points for shares, or (ii) the role that funds' managers played, in lieu of the potential conflict between their objective functions and those of the shareholders of these funds, and (iii) lack of uniformity in information reporting standards.

We compute option prices using both reprojected underlying historical volatilities and the implied risk premium of stochastic volatility to gauge each model's performance through direct comparison with observed market option prices on the index. Our major empirical findings are summarized as follows. First, while allowing for stochastic volatilitycan reduce the pricing errors and allowing for asymmetric volatility or \"leverage effect\" does help to explain the skewness of the volatility \"smile\", allowing for stochastic interest rates has minimal impact on option prices in our case. Second, similar to Melino and Turnbull (1990), our empirical findings strongly suggest the existence of a non-zero risk premium for stochastic volatility of asset returns. Based on the implied volatility risk premium, the SV models can largely reduce the option pricing errors, suggesting the importance of incorporating the information from the options market in pricing options. Finally, both the model diagnostics and option pricing errors in our study suggest that the Gaussian SV model is not sufficient in modeling short-term kurtosis of asset returns, an SV model with fatter-tailed noise or jump component may have better explanatory power.

To prevent from numerical deficiencies, the space axis is discretized first, and not the time axis. In a Black–Scholes setup, models with improved convergence properties are constructed: a trinomial model and a randomized trinomial model where price changes occur at the jump times of a Poisson process. These lattice models are sufficiently general to handle options with multiple barriers: the numerical difficulties are resolved and extrapolation yields even more accurate results. In a last step, we extend the Black–Scholes setup and incorporate unpredictable discontinuous price movements. The randomized trinomial model can easily be extended to this case, inheriting its superior convergence properties.

Earlier studies have demonstrated that when there are constraints onthe hedge portfolio, a no-arbitrage price interval for any contingent claim exists. I consider the more realistic case where the constraints are imposed on the total portfolio of each investor and define reservation buying and selling prices for contingent claims. I derive properties of these prices, show how they can be computed numerically, and study two simple examples in which the reservation prices and the corresponding hedging strategies are compared to the Black–Scholes setting.
