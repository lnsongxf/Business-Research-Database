[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "This paper analyzes how an investor who is convinced that he can \"beat the market\" should behave when the equilibrium price process is endogenous. The investor's optimal portfolio is shown to consist of three components: (1) a tangency portfolio, (2) a hedge portfolio against changes in the market's valuation of securities, and (3) a hedging position against changes in the divergence between the investor's and the market's beliefs. The sign and magnitude of this third component will depend on investor preferences and on the divergence in the investor's and the market's quality of information. A numerical example illustrates that the effect of heterogeneous beliefs on optimal portfolio allocations can be significant.

Based on a univariate GARCH (1,1) specification of the stock index variance and a time-varying unitary risk premium representation, we can reject the hypothesis that stock and stock index derivatives listings do not affect the total risk premium. Contrarily to previous empirical evidence, we find that derivatives listings affect both the conditional market returns’ variance and the unitary risk premium through structural shocks. The gradual market completion hypothesis is further corroborated in that, cumulatively, the three stock and stock index options futures derivatives listings reduced the unitary risk premium while the marginal impact of each successive listing decayed.

The wealth processes of the agents, however, are adapted to the finer filtration generated by aggregate consumption and the conditional distribution of future aggregate consumption. Therefore, in order to achieve pareto optimal consumption allocations, a sufficiently varied set of assets must exist such that any wealth process adapted to this finer filtration can be implemented by dynamically trading in that set of assets. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of such a set of assets based on dynamically trading contingent claims on aggregate consumption. In addition, we give sufficient conditions for the existence of equilibria in a dynamically effectively complete market in which agents are only able to trade in contingent claims on aggregate consumption, the market portfolio of firms, and a (numeraire) zero-coupon bond. We demonstrate the role of short- and long-term contingent claims on aggregate consumption for the implementation of Pareto optimal allocations inthe presence of short- and long-term risks. In addition, in the presence of personal risks, we demonstrate the role of insurance contracts.

However, this effect depends intricately on stock market exposure, the location of control rights, and the time horizon (short-run vs. long-run). We conclude from our results that (1) the presence of large shareholders does not necessarily enhance profitability,(2) ownership concentration seems to be sub-optimal for many German corporations, and, finally, (3) having financial institutions as largest shareholders of traded corporations improves corporate performance.

We first derive the private valuation which the investor assigns to the nontraded asset in order to determine his optimal investment in the traded assets. We thereby show that, as part of this portfolio, the investor hedges the private valuation process of the nontraded asset, rather than its market price process. We also study the price at which the investor would be willing to sell the nontraded asset if he were subsequently prohibited from trading in it, as well as the amount the investor would be willing to pay to remove the trading restriction. All three values are shown to depend in an intuitive manner on the investor’s risk aversion, the residual risk of the nontraded asset unhedged by the traded assets, the difference between the constrained holding and optimal unconstrained holding of the asset and the length of the time horizon over which the asset cannot be traded.
