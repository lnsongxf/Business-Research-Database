A somewhat counterintuitive result is that, in some circumstances, increases in agency problems result in increased willingness of the CEO to delegate the decision. We also characterize situations in which the CEO prefers to commit to an allocation of authority ex ante, instead of deciding based on her private information.Finally, even though the division manager is biased toward larger investments, we show that under certainconditions, the average investment will be smaller when the decision is delegated.
