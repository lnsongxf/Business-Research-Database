A model of shareholders, debtholders, depositors, and an executive demonstrates that (i) excess risk taking can be addressed by basing compensation on both stock price and the credit default swaps (CDS) spread, (ii) shareholders may not be able to commit to design such contracts, and (iii) they may not want to due to distortions from deposit insurance or unobservable tail risk. The advantage of using the CDS spread rather than deferred compensation or debt is due to the fact that it is a market price and reduces agency costs.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Review of Finance", "ex:volume": "19", "ex:title": "Executive Compensation and Risk Taking", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rof/rfu049", "ex:pages": "2139-2181", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Patrick Bolton"}, {"ex:name": "Hamid Mehran"}, {"ex:name": "Joel Shapiro"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "We show how to reverse-engineer banks’ risk disclosures, such as value-at-risk, to obtain an implied measure of their exposures to equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity risks.

Studying the South Korean syndicated loan market, we find that during the 90s the safety net protecting business groups (chaebols)—especially the government’s bailout policy—affected the structure and pricing of loans to chaebol firms. However, after the chaebol reform of the late 90s dismantled the chaebol safety net, the differences in loan contracts between chaebol and non-chaebol firms narrowed or disappeared. The results suggest that the reform restored lenders’ incentives to monitor chaebol firms and properly assess their risk.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Review of Finance", "ex:volume": "19", "ex:title": "Institutions, Bailout Policies, and Bank Loan Contracting: Evidence from Korean Chaebols", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rof/rfu053", "ex:pages": "2223-2275", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Raoul Minetti"}, {"ex:name": "Sung-Guan Yun"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "Although growth opportunities fade and profitability declines as firms mature, older firms are no more likely to be acquired than young firms are.
