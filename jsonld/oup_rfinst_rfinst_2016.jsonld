For an individual institution, a higher interbank rate — meaning a higher funding cost — results in more severe coordination problems among creditors in debt rollover decisions. Creditors thus behave more conservatively and run more often. Facing an increased chance of creditor runs, institutions demand more and supply less liquidity, tightening the interbank market.

We model the choice of restructuring process and derive implications for the corporate mix of bank and bond financing. Empirical patterns match the model: inefficient bankruptcy in a country is associated with less bond issuance by risky, but not by safe, borrowers. This pattern holds for both levels of and changes in bankruptcy recovery. Our results establish a link between bankruptcy reform and corporate bond markets, especially high-yield markets.Received September 29, 2014; accepted February 1, 2016 by Editor David Denis.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Review of Financial Studies", "ex:volume": "29", "ex:title": "Insolvency Resolution and the Missing High-Yield Bond Markets", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhw014", "ex:pages": "2814-2849", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Bo Becker"}, {"ex:name": "Jens Josephson"}]}, {"ex:issue": "10", "ex:abstract": "The Home Affordable Modification Program’s (HAMP’s) Principal Reduction Alternative (PRA) is a government-sponsored program to reduce the principal balances and monthly mortgage payments of troubled borrowers.
