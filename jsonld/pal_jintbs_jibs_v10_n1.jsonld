[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "The sourcing policy of a multinational firm is the result of the firm&apos;s decisions as to which of its production facilities shall service its various final markets. There is an international network linking production to markets. Critical determinants of this policy are the firm&apos;s size, industry characteristics, and influences deriving from firm&apos;s natioanality of ownership. We suggest that the research intensity is an important influence on sourcing policy, particularly through its effect on the firm&apos;s internal exports.&copy; 1979 JIBS.

In contrast the corporate managers are continuously involved in the working capital decision-making process, but their perspective is limited to the practice of their firm. In order to fill this gap in the working capital literature, a study of management perceptions of the working capital process was undertaken. A survey was used to collect the information from the sample of marketing, production, and financial executives in large corporations in Belgium, France, India and United States. The study intercepts management ranking of working capital objectives and indicates the need to improve finacial planning models to include explicitly short&ndash;run objectives; further, predictability of cash inflows and outflows is examined and the potential factors affecting the predictability are evaluated. Finally, this study examines the management perceptions of long-range objectives in order to provide a proper perspective to the short-run financial planning.&copy; 1979 JIBS.
