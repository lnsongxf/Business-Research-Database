[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Share analysis was Performed for the periods of 1967-1972 and 1972-1977 to determine the source of the slow rate of growth of American exports vis-a-vis exports of all members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Although share analysis is subject to several theoretical and practical limitations, the conclusions indicated clearly that, during these periods assessed, the relatively slow rate of increase for American exports was attributable mainly to a loss of market share rather than to export structure or mix. So it may be concluded that if a faster rate of growth for America exports is to be realized, the united States should continue efforts to raise the competitiveness of American goods in international market and&mdash;perhaps more importantly&mdash;to provide special incentives to firms that increase export sales in performance to alternative forms of business expansion.&copy; 1979 JIBS.

The considerable importance and complexity of bundle mix and bundle pricing decisions on the transportation, sightseeing, and resort level of Tourism are discussed. The authors develop the basic theoretical structure and framework underlying bundling decisions and define key elements of required decision information. The complexity of the determination of optimal bundling mixes in a multiservice environment is demonstrated, and an algorithm which greatly facilitates such determination under certain assumptions is outlined and discussed. Finally, the problem of allocating joint bundle profits among associated profit or cost centers is reviewed in detail. A number of alternative allocation criteria based on commonly acceptable notions of bargaining power and fairness are proposed. Their relevance and applicability to international tourism and tourist enterprises are discussed.&copy; 1979 JIBS.

A sample of 23 serious&ndash;problem firms is compared with a slightly larger control sample of healthy firms. A four&ndash;variable model successfully classified 88 percent of the firms one year prior to serious problems and as much as 78 percent three years prior. The importance of models that highlight financial problems early enough to suggest remedial changes is apparent in Brazil. For example an equilibrium situation between the domestic private sector, multinationals and public&ndash;owned firms is more likely to continue if weaker domestic firms can be helped and preserved. The application of such models by financial institutions and for financial market analysis is comparable to that in the United States and other developed countries. Finally, the paper explores the application of such models in developing countries.&copy; 1979 JIBS.
