A mailed survey of 455 firms was followed up by personal interviews with approximately 113 managers in 37 firms selected via a stratified quota sample of respondents. Findings support a conclusion that assessment and evaluation of nonmarket environments is emerging as a new managerial function in relatively large international firms. Over half of the respondents indicated that they have a group or groups which have been assigned formal assessment responsibility, both the survey results and interview data suggest a number of problems with current practice. Assessments appear to be reactive rather than active; the most important sources of information about environments are internal to the firm; assessments are typically not conducted independently of an investment or planning proposal; and resulting evaluations serve as a context in which decisions are taken rather than as input to a decision-making process.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

The importance of this question was recognized by Secretary of Treasury Michael Blumenthal who included an earlier version of this study in the April 1979 Treasury Report titled &ldquo;The Operation and Effect of the Domestic International Sales Corporation (DISC).&rdquo; As such the study has received recognition at the highest level of policy making. This study is unique in two respects: 1) it examines the impact of the tax incentive on the firm&apos;s total marketing and promotional efforts. Other studies have examined only the relationship between the tax incentive and change in export prices, and 2) this study expands the investigation of sample firms to include small businesses as well as multinationals. The conclusions of this study (surveying 125 multinationals and 125 small exporting firms) suggest that DISC stimulated some marketing activities for small companies and was used as a tax shelter for large multinationals. The main policy implication is that as a tax incentive DISC is helpful in attracting small firms into export marketing.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

While U.S.-based multinational companies continue to expand overseas, this paper addresses the question: Do investor-owners recognize the advantages of international diversification of real assets provided by their investment in the shares of a multinational company as opposed to international portfolio diversification directly by these investors?This paper concludes that there seems to be a substantial body of evidence to indicate that an increasing proportion of internationality is associated with decreasing dependence on the domestic capital markets, decreasing systematic risk, and an increasing price/earnings ratio. Thus, U.S. investors are found to like and reward international operations of U.S. companies possibly because of the advantages of international diversification of real assets, the higher profitability and growth rates of foreign operations, or some other advantages enjoyed by multinational companies. These results imply that the risk-return characteristics of each foreign investment be used to determine an appropriate hurdle rate which may even be lower than the hurdle rate of a comparable domestic project.&copy; 1980 JIBS.
