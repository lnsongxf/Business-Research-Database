It then analyzes the effects of corporate experience on location decisions. Prior experience in a host country is found to increase the firm&apos;s priority for projects in that country relative to other investment options. In addition, the experience level of the firm influences the relative importance of different country characteristics in determining location patterns. Inexperienced firms exhibit greater preference for near, similar markets than firms with broader international operating experience.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Compensation levels are influenced by the extent of services rendered to the licensee and by his scale of production.

The study reported in this article investigates this question with regard to three U.S. industries. The export/import patterns of these industries are examined for the period 1963 to 1974 in order to determine the extent to which export losses were associated with import gains. Japanese export/import performance is examined for the three industries during the same period to provide a point of reference. The findings indicate that for two of the industries U.S. export market losses are not associated with comparable gains in imports, as might be expected if export market losses indicate a shift in competitive advantage. It may thus be necessary to consider other factors when attempting to explain the long-term contraction of the U.S. share of world export markets which has been occurring in some industries.&copy; 1980 JIBS.
