Cluster analysis is used to show the hierarchical structure of the international centers, over time. Stepwise multiple discriminant analysis is then used to verify the cluster analysis groupings, determine what factors caused the particular groupings, and rank the centers. The findings show clearly that Tokyo became Asia&apos;s preeminent &ldquo;banking&rdquo; center in 1960 and the preeminent &ldquo;financial&rdquo; center in 1965, but these results are at odds with the commonly held view that Singapore and Hong Kong are the region&apos;s top centers; in fact, Asia&apos;s second most prominent center is Osaka. The future implication and significance of Tokyo&apos;s (and Osaka&apos;s) financial leadership in Asia is discussed.&copy; 1980 JIBS.
