These episodes are defined by the number of actors relevant to corporation decision making. The immediate postwar decade is characterized as a two-actor era &ndash; the firm itself and its overseas commercial associates. During the so-called growth years, of 1955 to 1970, increasingly the political impact of, and the political response to, corporate strategy entered the decision-making calculus. During the 1970s, the &ldquo;time of trouble,&rdquo; the parent governments became increasingly active. The new international order which began appearing around 1980 introduced the multi-actor era in which a wide variety of international organizations and interest groups became relevant to corporate decision making, thereby introducing a new degree of uncertainty. Generally, academic research and teaching have lagged the reality. Even now, much attention is focused on the multinational corporation, a special form of international business organization which appeared during the 1950s and 60s and which now may be giving way to the international service and trading companies. The conclusion is that little research is being done on the internal dynamics of international business.&copy; 1981 JIBS.

Thus, the United States must use its energy more efficiently in order to achieve its goal of maintaining satisfactory economic growth while reducing oil imports. But regardless of the U.S. picture, international trade in energy will continue to dominate the international business picture. Over the past 10 years, energy trade and resulting indirect trade effects have grown to account for about half of world trade; in turn, world trade has passed foreign direct investment in value. In the future, energy trade will be even more heavily influenced by government involvement. These trends have significance for the direction of international business research.&copy; 1981 JIBS.

These forces being uncoordinated are seen as shaping an international industrial order that is not consonant with the objectives of the New International Economic Order (NIEO); consequently, what is expected for the near term is a nationally oriented disintegration of the international economy resulting from struggles over the location of specific industries around the world that will not be resolved cooperatively. The most likely moves toward international industrial integration will occur within key sectors among members of a regional association. At present, it appears unlikely that significant moves will be made toward a new international industrial order in line with the objectives of the NIEO; yet, the TNCs would be effective means of achieving this goal if greater cooperation could be achieved between them and governments.&copy; 1981 JIBS.

A normative (rather than a market) view of Foreign Exchange Risk Management is taken and accordingly the author reviews first the two key informational inputs necessary for any Foreign Exchange Risk Management program: forecasting exchange rates and measuring exposure to exchange risk. Available decision models for handling transaction and translation exposures are reviewed next. A concluding section identifies gaps in the existing literature and suggests directions for future research.&copy; 1981 JIBS.
