[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Foreign investment in the United States has been expanding at a rapid rate during recent years. For a variety of reasons it is probable that such investment will play an increasingly important role in the U.S. economy in the future. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of such foreign ownership on an important aspect of labor relations &ndash; specifically, NLRB representation elections. Tests of whether foreign majority ownership is associated with decreased union success are conducted through multiple discriminant and regression analysis of election results. Both analyses control for foreign ownership, right-to-work legislation, industry effects, and size of election unit. The results indicate a moderately inverse associate between foreign majority ownership and union success in elections.&copy; 1981 JIBS.

Although the size of the U.S. market and the attractiveness of a new market or the desire to preserve the existing U.S. market were the most frequently cited reasons for new investment in the U.S., factor analysis reveals that these reasons merely reinforce the primary motive: namely, the desire to benefit from a higher level of U.S. technology and innovation.&copy; 1981 JIBS.
