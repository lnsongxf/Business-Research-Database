The study concentrates especially on the effects of increased uncertainly and increased risk aversion on the part of the multinational firm. It is shown that the presence of the forward market allows the firm to respond to changes in uncertainly and risk aversion by adjusting its transactions in the forward market while leaving its production and sales decisions unchanged. The forward market, thus, promotes stability with respect to the operational as opposed to the financial variables; and its also makes it possible to adopt decentralized decision making.&copy; 1982 JIBS.

The findings suggest that forward rates are unbiased estimators of future interest rates but are not optimal predictors of future interest rates. Further evidence does not provide support for the presence of a systematic risk premium on forward rates. The findings of this study suggest also that the Eurocurrency market is efficient in incorporating information contained in the history of interest rates into the forward rate. In addition, this paper shows that, in conformity with the efficient market hypothesis, errors of prediction based on forward rates are not related to past changes of interest rates.&copy; 1982 JIBS.
