Thirty-one participants (44.2 percent) changed to the temporal method of translating financial information for internal reporting purposes. Twenty-seven (38.6 percent) began using an income figure that had been adjusted for translation gains and losses to evaluate foreign subsidiary managers. Forty-six (65.7 percent) stated that financial statements presented in local currency provide better information that U.S. dollar statements for the internal evaluation of foreign operations.
