[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "This paper examines the effect of political events on the manufacturing direct foreign investment (MDFI) decisions of U.S. multinational corporations. The relationship between political events (and nonpolitical factors) and MDFI is investigated through regression analysis of pooled time-series (21 years) and cross-sectional (24 countries) data and through various tests of the homogeneity of the relationship across groups of countries. The study finds that the relationship between political events in MDFI is different for less developed countries as opposed to developed countries. For the less developed countries, both inter-nation and intra-nation conflict and cooperation affect MDFI. In contrast, U.S. MDFI in developed countries appears to be affected only by inter-nation conflict and cooperation.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

This paper, which is based on a field study of 50 U.S. banks, identifies 4 common organizational types of country-risk assessment, probes their strengths and weakness, examines their determinants, and analyzes the importance of organizational and technical development to various dimensions of system performance.The findings of the study suggest that banks move to more organizationally sophisticated country-risk assessment systems 1) with time as they accumulate experience in the assessment function, 2) with the increasing absolute size of their foreign loan portfolio, and 3) with the growth in relative importance of their international activities to the activities of the firm as a whole. Systems with an independent staff pre-investment audit were found to have a better performance than those where only the line country-manager made the assessment. It is important, however, that the independent staff assessment unit be integrated with the organization.&copy; 1985 JIBS.
