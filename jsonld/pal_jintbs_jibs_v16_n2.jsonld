However, a growing number of overseas ventures are being formed as a mix of the 3 methods, where a joint venture partner may be compensated by a package involving some return on equity investment, plus royalties, plus margins on components or finished product traded with the joint venture corporation. This paper presents an algebraic model for the negotiations position of each partner in a prospective venture. The trade-offs between the 3 compensation types are complex as they involve non-zero-sum games. The methodology is extended to enable a host government to calculate for each alternative arrangement, the foreign exchange cost, tax revenues, or other national costs and benefits. The model makes some unconventional recommendations for corporate strategy and government policy.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

Alternatively, a share of cash flows denominated in reference currency which are affected by future exchange rates can also generate sensitivity.The model integrates a general corporate valuation framework with a theory of expectations and a general model of corporate macro-economic relationships. Its contribution is in generalizing previous models of these relationships. It also provides a link between empirical work, theoretical descriptions of the exchange rate/relative price relationship, and corporate valuation theory.The model implies a fairly rich description of the corporate and economic characteristics which determine exposure.
