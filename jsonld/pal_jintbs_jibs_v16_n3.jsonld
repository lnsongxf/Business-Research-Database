[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "This paper examines the reaction of the foreign exchange market to the announcement of changes in the business environment of a country. Our results suggest that sampled political risk news conveys important information about a country&apos;s investment climate and causes its currency&apos;s exchange rate to vary. It appears, however, that the reaction of the foreign exchange market is more dramatic for unfavorable events than for favorable events. The evidence presented is also consisted with the hypothesis that the foreign exchange market is efficient in interpreting the type of event considered in this study.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

This paper argues that may of the same considerations that go into the positioning strategy in the home country are directly relevant for international markets. There is an added elements of complexity in that the country-of-origin of the imported product will often be a salient factor in the buyer evaluation process. The effect of country stereotype will be to shift the position of the product in the perceptual space and alter the overall evaluation of its merits. The competitive strength of the product will thus be affected by country biases.

Much of this research is of the case study approach documenting actual practices for a small group of firms, or a distillation from numerous observations but using anecdotal evidence to support various conjectures.The study uses a survey of attitudes toward various aspects of budgeting and control systems to gain insight into the existence of differences for a large sample of Japanese and United States controllers and line managers. Respondents were drawn from the 500 largest industrial firms in these two countries. The major findings suggest that the Japanese controllers and managers 1) prefer less participation, 2) have a more long-term planning horizon, 3) view budgets as more of a communication device, and 4) prefer more budget slack than their American counterparts.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

The traditional and widely used ratios of debt servicing capacity, such as the ratio of the balance on current account of debt service payment, and the ratio of external debt to exports among others, primarily measure a country&rsquo;s current capacity to handle its international obligations. However, they fail to test the vulnerability to debtor countries to oncoming debt servicing problems, or to signal in advance an imminent situation of payments interruption.The proposed index combines a number of variables which have preceded payments interruption by a number of countries in recent years. These situations have been preceded with a varying time lead by all or most of the following developments:1. A significant erosion in the international liquidity position.2. A sharply faster growth rate of external debt than the rate of growth in export earnings.3. An acceleration in the inflation rate experienced by the country.4. A shortfall in exports or a deterioration in export performance.5. Adverse internal political developments.The complied index is a weighted average of sub-indices or ratios which measure recent changes in the variables listed above. The index was applied to 20 developing countries (LDCs) accounting for about 80 percent of total external debt. Depending on their score, these countries were grouped in five categories ranging from those signaling significant improvement in their debt servicing capacity to those signaling an imminent payments interruption.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

Case studies were done on two North American and two European MNEs in the chemical and electronics industries. World-wide transfers and consequent career opportunities were found in all cases for managers from headquarters countries. Regional transfers and careers were possible for host and third-country managers in regio-centric MNEs, but only national careers were possible in a poly-centric MNE. Temporary transfers to world or regional headquarters for management development were found for host and third-country managers, but transfers for organization development were for headquarters nationals.
