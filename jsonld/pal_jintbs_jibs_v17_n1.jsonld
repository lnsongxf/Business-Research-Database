[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "There has been a growing interest in how follower firms can compete with industry leaders. This article documents the use of international strategies by some non-dominant firms to avoid direct competition with industry leaders. Twenty-five cases of international strategies used by non-dominant firms in a variety of industries were cluster analyzed to identify common strategies. Seven different strategies were identified together with their attendant firm characteristics, stage of industry internationalization, and underlying competitive logic.&copy; 1986 JIBS.

The model is derived from a production function specified in three functional forms which is expanded to include management and quality-adjustment factors for the capital and labor inputs. The management variable is a performance ranking of the plants in terms of meeting output, quality, and cost goals. Data on approximately 30 plants form a dozen countries over the period 1975 thorough 1982 was used for the analysis. All of the plants are of a single multinational firm and produce similar products.Results indicate that for this firm the most important determinants of labor productivity differences among the plants are the management and worker-related factors. Managers who consistency met their output, quality, and cost targets also had high labor productivity plants. Worker skill levels were also found to be positively related to productivity and strong learning-by-doing effects were apparent in the plants. Additionally, the Latin American plants were found to have significantly lower labor productivity which none of the included variables was able to fully account for. Varying returns to scale, first increasing and then decreasing, were noted in this industry.&copy; 1986 JIBS.

These studies have generally found consistent and significant relationships between the yield differential and macroeconomic variables, with the yield differential being a positive function of the level of interest rates and the inflation rate and a negative function of the change in economic activity.This study extends the analysis of yield differentials to major western countries. In general there appeared to be little consistent relationship in the structure of yield differentials across countries, except that the differential does appear to be a positive function of the level of interest rates. While the conclusions that can be drawn from the study are limited, due to data problems, it does appear that there is no consistent structure of bond yield differentials across countries. Consequently, our results indicate that we know little about the structure of yield differentials beyond the U.S. and that extrapolation of U.S. research to the bond markets of other countries must be executed with extreme care.&copy; 1986 JIBS.

This is the result of a lack of adequate information about what the major issues will be, and a lack of adequate communication between the academic, business and policymaking communities. This article presents the findings of a Delphi study conducted with academicians, business executives, and policymakers involved in international trade. The most crucial issue identified by that research is the current challenge to the multilateral trade frame work. This challenge emanates from such new factors as trade in services, subsidization, high technology transfer, countertrade, and orderly marketing agreements. After discussing these and other newly emerging issues in international business and trade, recommendations are made to encourage a better focus for future research and teaching in the international business and trade arena.&copy; 1986 JIBS.
