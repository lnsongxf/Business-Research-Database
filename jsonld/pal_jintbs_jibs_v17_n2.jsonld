[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Rationalization of global production and operations by multinational corporations have created a large volume of international company funds flows. By a process of netting interaffiliate payments, significant savings in cost can be realized. Shapiro formulated the multinational payment netting problem using linear programming. This paper presents a network optimization approach that is both computationally efficient and intuitively appealing. Further, the proposed approach recognizes the need to integrate the netting system with the MNC&apos;s overall cash management systems as well as by explicitly accounting for cash outflows on account of transfer costs. Additionally, the paper provides insight into actual corporate netting practices.&copy; 1986 JIBS.

It them empirically tests the hypothesis that no yield differentials exist between similar securities in these two markets. A matched pair sample of these bonds is obtained on the basis of five criteria: (a) same parent; (b) same rating; (c) similar coupon rates; (d) similar time to maturity; and (e) yield observations from the same month. Empirical results obtained during 1975 to 1983 shows that dollar Eurobond yields do not differ from domestic bond yields for comparable securities. This implies that these two markets are either devoid of systematic and material imperfections or if any such imperfection do exist, their pricing influence is similar in both markets. It is also observed that issue size, issuer&apos;s rating and the market&apos;s familiarity with the issuer do not uniquely influence Eurobond pricing any differently than domestic U.S. bond pricing.&copy; 1986 JIBS.

Because of the new indicators and more recent data, the models captured the effects of the changes that have occurred in the world economy since the oil price shocks and the period of rapid debt accumulation by the developing countries.
