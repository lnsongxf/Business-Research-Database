Harry Johnson has disputed the significance of foreign exchange as a separate factor in development. See Economic Politics Toward Less Developed Countries (Washington: Brooking Institution, 1967). pp. 52-64. In response to such a shortage, many countries interfere with the market allocations of foreign exchange to assure that &ldquo;priority&rdquo; demands for exchange will be met. The service of private foreign capital usually does not have a priority. Consequently, dividends on private foreign direct investment are often limited in one way or another by LDC's.&copy; 1970 JIBS.
