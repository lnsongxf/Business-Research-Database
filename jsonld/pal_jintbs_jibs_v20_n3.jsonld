[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "International business is characterized by high uncertainty, making accurate forecasting both important and difficult. Development in forecasting methodology are examined in the prediction of international debt reschedulings. Three basic forecasting approaches are evaluated: single method forecasts, raw data combination forecasts, and forecast-combinations. All three approaches exhibited significant improvement in prediction accuracy over a naive forecasting approach, but only the odds-matrix forecast-combination approach outperformed another non-native approach. The odds-matrix forecast-combination method is less sensitive to data sparsity and unreliability and has the potential to synthesize, effectively and in a theoretically based way, diverse perspectives in the international context.&copy; 1989 JIBS.

Using a negotiation simulation and a sample of 462 Japanese, American, and Canadian businesspeople, behaviors in cross-cultural negotiations were found to differ in some important ways from those in intra-cultural negotiations.&copy; 1989 JIBS.

That could be explained by changes in the international competitive environment, which force firms to adjust their strategies, requiring ever more multidimensional coordination.&copy; 1989 JIBS.
