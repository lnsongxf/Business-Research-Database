[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Two approaches may explain how multinational enterprises (MNEs) select ownership structures for subsidiaries. The first argues that MNEs prefer structures that minimize that transaction costs of doing business abroad. The second argues that ownership structures are determined by negotiations with host governments, whose outcomes depend on the bargaining power of the firm. This paper presents a framework integrating these two approaches and uses statistical methods to separate their effects empirically.The statistical analysis supports an important hypothesis of bargaining school&mdash;that attractive domestic markets increase the relative power of host governments. But it finds no support for other hypotheses of this school, such as those predicting that firms in marketing- and R&amp;D-intensive industries have more bargaining power than others. These latter factors were apparently more important in determining firm ownership preferences. Furthermore, the paper measures when government ownership restrictions deter firm entry, concluding that relatively large firms, and those with high intra-system sales are deterred more than others.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Results of this study indicate that foreign firms operating in the U.S. are less profitable than randomly selected U.S. firms, that they spend more in research and development but less in advertising, and that they have higher debt levels combined with higher liquidity. In addition, the findings also demonstrate that the determinants of excess market value, as measured by Tobin&rsquo;s q, differ between foreign-owned firms and American-owned firms, and that the performance of foreign multinational differ by country of origin. This suggests that foreign-owned firms may have different reasons for investing in the U.S. and that foreign multinationals present investment opportunities to the U.S. investors distinct from American firms.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

These ratings serve as indicators of perceived sovereign risk associated with such offerings. A review of the ratings process followed by the major rating agencies (in particular, the Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s Corporation) reveals that ratings are assigned with considerable reliance on informal judgment. Informal judgmental systems, however, can induce serious inconsistencies in the relative importance assigned to criteria used in assigning rating and lead to biased ratings.This paper presents a formal judgmental model for assigning sovereign debt ratings that avoids the potential inconsistencies of informal systems. Model use is illustrated by relying on descriptions of the rating process published by Standard and Poor&rsquo;s Corporation. While the model proposed in this paper provides a framework for the rating agencies to ensure consistency in their ratings process, we suggest a complementary relationship between multivariate statistical classification models typically used to assess economic and political risk and the proposed model which assigns country risk ratings.&copy; 1990 JIBS.
