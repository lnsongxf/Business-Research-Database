It is shown that exposure is the sum of a base case exposure identified in other studies and two other components: terms associated with exchange rate-induced demand shifts and terms associated with competitors&rsquo;s reoptimization following the exchange rate shock. In general, the magnitudes of these additional terms are significant, especially in the presence of asymmetries across markets and firms. Numerical examples are provided that incorporate asymmetries corresponding to stylized facts about some U.S. markets and U.S. manufacturers.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Further, the study investigated if locational strategies of both domestic and foreign manufacturers changed with time.Of the many findings, the most notable ones are: market size, as defined by the number of manufacturing establishments in a state, is strongly associated with the locational decisions of foreign manufacturers in the U.S., and secondly, with time, foreign manufactures tend to become more like their domestic counterparts.&copy; 1990 JIBS.
