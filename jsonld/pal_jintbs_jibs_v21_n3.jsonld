[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "In increasingly complex global competition, multinational firms, U.S. and foreign alike, have stepped up international sourcing of components and finished products to serve various markets. Since an increasing portion of global competition is shaped by European and Japanese multinational firms with due emphasis on product quality and manufacturing, it is an opportune time to examine the like among their product development, manufacturing, and sourcing activities. Those European and Japanese multinational firms marketing products in the United States are chosen as subjects of this study.The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, a taxonomy of sourcing strategies is developed to systematically identify a variety of sourcing patterns. This taxonomy helps resolve some of the conceptual ambiguities and paves the way for further empirical investigation. Second, based on a few variables identified in the taxonomy, performance implications of various sourcing strategies are explored.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Results indicate that while Finnish consumer perceptions of U.S. products and marketing efforts have improved over time, the corresponding perceptions of the Japanese alternative have improved substantially more. Similarly, in areas where U.S. competitors has initial advantages, the study results indicate that by 1985 Japanese firms were able to overcome such advantages and were perceived as superior in all categories.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

The overall purpose of the study is to provide guidance for export promotion activities.

A model is formulated where firm and product attributes, as well as perceived barriers/opportunities are proposed as determinants of attitudes towards future exports. Previous export experience in the relevant market is also introduced as an additional variable in explaining attitude towards future exports. The model is tested in a two-step procedure with multiple discriminant and regression analysis. The data used to test the model is taken from a survey of Norwegian exporters of fishery products.&copy; 1990 JIBS.
