[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "This paper analyses the usage and contents of corporate codes of ethics. The results from a sample of 600 large European companies are contrasted with findings reported for similar U.S. firms. The comparison reveals that significantly fewer European than U.S. firms adopted codes of ethics. In Europe, the large majority of codes have been introduced only very recently and there are indications that codes made their way into Europe via subsidiaries of U.S. firms. However, there are striking differences in content between U.S. and European codes of ethics pointing to the existence of a distinctly European approach to codifying ethics.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Beyond providing additional insight into the nature of competition in global industries, several broad extensions to the integration-responsiveness framework are suggested.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

The study examines the perceived net costs or benefits of disclosing information voluntarily, the types of costs involved and the significance of cost constraints in respect of specific items of disclosure. The results suggest that while there is substantial agreement on the major cost constraints involved and the individual items giving rise to major net costs, there are significantly different perceptions by U.K. and U.S. financial executives in terms of the overall emphasis of responses to the issue of cost constraints on voluntary information disclosures.&copy; 1990 JIBS.
