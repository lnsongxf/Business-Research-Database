Our results show that foreign-controlled firms fail less often than domestically owned firms. The patterns of foreign-controlled business failures and the impacts of entry modes, ownership types, and national culture on the failures of foreign-controlled firms are also examined.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

Companies were classified into a domestic or multinational type for this research following the criteria established by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 14 for required disclosure of foreign operations. The empirical results indicate that the accuracy of earnings forecasts is significantly lower for purely domestic firms than for U.S.-based multinationals.
