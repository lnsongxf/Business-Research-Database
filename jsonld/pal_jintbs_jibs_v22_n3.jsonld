Hypotheses covered both the positive and negative effects of adaptation on the adjudged interpersonal attractiveness of the adaptor. These hypotheses were tested in two experimental studies using scenario-based manipulations. The first study looked at American subjects&apos; responses to adaptive behaviors of &ldquo;Japanese business people&rdquo;. To test the generalizability of these findings to a less familiar culture, a replication looking at American subjects&apos; responses to adaptive behaviors of &ldquo;Korean business people&rdquo; was also conducted. The findings partially support the notion that moderate adaptation may be the optimal strategy in intercultural negotiations. Moderate adaptation was found to improve the adjudged attraction of the &ldquo;Japanese business people&rdquo; relative to no adaptation and substantial adaptation.

Data on Japanese auto companies&apos; sales in six different export markets (Europe, North America, Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa) are examined for the period 1959-1987. The sales over the period are decomposed into three multiplicative components: a generic market growth factor, a synergy factor depicting the combined growth for the Japanese cars, and a rivalry factor representing competition within the Japanese strategic group. The data are used to estimate the magnitude of the growth elasticities for each of the three components.The results show that for most markets the synergy component was the dominant determinant of the Japanese growth pattern.&copy; 1991 JIBS.
