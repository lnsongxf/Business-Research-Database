[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Multinational enterprises (MNEs) have responded to the open-door policies of socialist countries in recent years by investing in their economies through joint ventures. MNEs must formulate their investment strategies to control and manage the environmental risks peculiar to a traditional centrally planned economy (CPE) in which contextual and transactional environments are blurred. Joint venture sharing arrangements may be structured to control exposures to uncertainties and to align the interests of transactional parties, mostly state-owned enterprises, to those of the venture. The study tests the hypothesis that a foreign investor&apos;s share in a joint venture in a CPE is inversely correlated with (1) the amount of uncertainties and risks and (2) the external dependency of the venture on the contextual and transactional relationships of the host country. The hypothesis is supported by empirical evidence from data on American joint ventures in China.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

The study estimates the relationship between changes in exchange rates and redistributions of value within the world automobile and steel industries during the period 1978-87. The data generally do not support the notion that firms benefit competitively from a depreciation of the home currency. On the contrary, for large fractions of both industries, a depreciation of the home currency is associated with a significant decline in their share of industry value.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

Many of the empirical studies have focused on ethical situations confronting marketing and sales practitioners.
