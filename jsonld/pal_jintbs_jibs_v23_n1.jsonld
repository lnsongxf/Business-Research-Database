[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Firms interested in servicing foreign markets face a difficult decision with regards to the choice of an entry mode. The options available to a firm include exporting, licensing, joint venture and sole venture. Several factors that determine the choice of a specific foreign market entry mode have been identified in previous literature. These factors can be classified into three categories: ownership advantages of a firm, location advantages of a market, and internalization advantages of integrating transactions. This study examines the independent and joint influences of these factors on the choice of an entry mode. Multinomial logistic regression model is employed to test the hypothesized effects.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Specifically, it is our contention that beyond the environmental and transaction-specific factors well established in the literature to affect the entry mode decision, we should also consider the strategic relationship a multinational envisages between its operations across borders in reaching this decision. After incorporating various global strategic variables into an electric framework of the factors influencing the entry mode choice, this paper tests both the validity of the overall framework and the importance of each entry mode determinant in differentiating among entry modes. This is done based on ninety-six multinational managers&apos; responses to a survey questionnaire concerning their entry mode decision experiences. The results suggest that an express incorporation of global strategic variables into an analysis of the entry mode decision is warranted.&copy; 1992 JIBS.
