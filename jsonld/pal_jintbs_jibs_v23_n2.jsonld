[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "This study examines the valuation consequences of domestic and foreign divestments by comparing the stock price reaction to announcements of domestic plant closings and foreign plant closings. A domestic plant closing could indicate firm-wide problems and impending firm deterioration. A foreign plant may serve to exploit arbitrage opportunities specific to that plant location. Closing a foreign plant need not signify firm-wide problems. Our comparison of stated reasons for closings supports these propositions. Therefore, foreign plant closing announcements should produce a smaller stock price decline that domestic plant closing announcements. Empirical results indicate a significant negative stock price reaction for domestic plant closings and an insignificant negative stock price reaction for foreign plant closings. Differences in stock price reaction remain after controlling for firm-specific factors.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Univariate and multivariate analysis indicate that privatization was more likely to be pursued by countries with high budget deficits, high foreign debt, and high dependence on international agencies like the World Bank and the IMF. In regions such as Latin America and Asia, the trend was also more likely in countries. (a) that seemed to have &ldquo;overused&rdquo; state enterprises in the past, and (b) those in which the private sector had grown faster than average and was thus more ready to assume tasks once assigned to state enterprises. In Africa, however, the policy may have been imposed by external agencies on countries that were not necessarily ripe for privatization. For multinational firms, the international opportunities created by privatization are likely to be greater in the 1990s than in the 1980s.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Similar innovation orientation types were identified in both markets using a sample of consumer businesses from the PIMS database. A number of similarities and differences in associated environments and performance levels were also identified. A major finding was that a high degree of product innovativeness leads to generally poor financial and market share performance in both markets but high rates of market share growth. Another major finding was that having pioneered in a market leads to effective performance. Results for the associated environments were more mixed in the sense that there was not a perfect correlation in the environments associated with the types in both markets.&copy; 1992 JIBS.
