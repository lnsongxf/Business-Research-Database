[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Fifty-six Soviet businesspeople and 160 American businesspeople participated in simulated intracultural, one-on-one, buyer-seller negotiations. All participants completed questionnaires after the negotiation sessions, and six negotiators from each cultural group were videotaped during the interactions. Analysis of the questionnaire data indicated that Soviet negotiators achieved higher individual profits when using a competitive approach in negotiations. This result is in contrast to a more cooperative approach associated with higher profits for the American participants. Analysis of the videotapes suggests both similarities and differences in observed bargaining behaviors across the two cultural groups.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

The absence of clear differences in attitudes among all U.K.-based managers suggest that the differential in PCA adoption stems primarily from ownership factors, e.g., exportation of parental control techniques rather than from the influence of local environmental factors.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Economic theory does not, however, predict a general expansion pattern of FDIs across industries. On the other hand, the theory associated with the &ldquo;internationalization process&rdquo; approach highlights the importance of cultural distance, and predicts a movement from &ldquo;close&rdquo; to more &ldquo;distant&rdquo; markets as more experience is acquired by the firm. The internationalization process approach is rooted in a behavioral theory of the firm.In this article two hypotheses are developed from the internationalization process approach regarding the location of FDIs. The database used for testing the hypotheses includes in principle all FDIs undertaken by Norwegian manufacturing companies up to the midyear 1982. Cultural distance is measured by an index developed by Kogut and Singh [1988]. No support is found for the notion that the first FDI in general takes place in culturally closer countries than later FDIs. Furthermore, for given companies, an expansion into more distant countries is not found as the number of investments increases.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

The first two trends bode well for the relevance of international management research to practicing managers. The third trend delineates the domain in which the majority of rigorous and relevant research is published and therefore the domain in which knowledge is advancing most rapidly.&copy; 1992 JIBS.
