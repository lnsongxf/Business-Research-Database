[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Despite the growing involvement of multinational firms in foreign-based R&amp;D during the past fifteen years, little research has been done on why and how firms internationalize their R&amp;D and what effects it might have on firm competitiveness. The present paper calls attention to this neglect and seeks to advance the management of multinational R&amp;D as an area of study for international business scholars. To this end, the paper first examines the key contributing factors to increased foreign R&amp;D investments among multinationals. It then reviews the research literature to find out what we presently know about the management of multinational R&amp;D. Finally, a research agenda is proposed to provide a foundation and stimulus for future investigations. Seven research directions are recommended, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary inquiry and a focus on issues that have both theoretical and practical significance.&copy; 1993 JIBS.

This paper reexamines the effects of government policies on market imperfections and foreign direct investment (FDI). It broadens and refines the analysis of the impact of government policies by developing the following arguments: (1) There is a wide range of government policies that affect firms&prime; FDI decisions via their effects on market imperfections. (2) There are numerous dimensions of variability in government policies that need to be identified in order to understand fully the effects of government policies on market imperfections and hence FDI flows. (3) Some of the effects of government policies on market imperfections and FDI are the opposite of those previously noted in the FDI literature. (4) The effects of government policies vary across the several individual components of FDI flows. The paper thus examines the following variables and relationships more extensively and precisely than has the previous literature: government policy variables as causal factors affecting FDI; market imperfection variables as intervening factors in the causal connections between government policies and FDI; and the multiple indicators of the various dimensions of FDI as dependent variables.&copy; 1993 JIBS.

The probability of country selection was estimated with a conditional logit model. The estimates were then used to predict the location of Caribbean Basin investments made in 1988 and 1989. Twelve independent variables were tested. Six variables had a statistically significant, positive relationship with plant location: per capita GNP, exchange rate devaluation, the length of income tax holidays, the size of free trade zones, political stability, and manufacturing concentration. Negative relationships were found for the wage rate, inflation rate, transportation cost, and profit repatriation restrictions.&copy; 1993 JIBS.
