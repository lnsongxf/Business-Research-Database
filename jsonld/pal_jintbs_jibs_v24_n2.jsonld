Role, nationality, age, seniority, and rank are tested as correlates of the organizational commitment construct among three groups of managers: Headquarters (HQ) officials, expatriate managers, and host-country managers in foreign subsidiaries.No support was found to the widespread belief that expatriate managers are more loyal to the company than host-country nationals. Age predicted organizational commitment more accurately than did nationality or role. Further analysis of the organizational commitment construct found evidence for a two-factor model: Loyalty/identification and involvement. Age was then found to be predictive of organizational loyalty/identification and nationality predicted organizational involvement. Managers&prime; nationality could therefore be used to compare and differentiate their organizational involvement.&copy; 1993 JIBS.

The eclectic theory of international production posits that the pattern of foreign investments should vary by country of origin.

The data used in this research cover 1,665 Sino-foreign joint ventures (JVs) from 1979 to 1985, allowing a more reliable test of this aspect of the theory.

Furthermore, exporters considered import duty concessions to be more desirable than did investors oriented toward the local markets.

Forecasting models were developed for both segmental and consolidated income series. To test the predictive ability of each set of data, earnings forecasts were made. Both the enterprise&apos;s segmental and consolidated models were used for these predictions. The result indicate that, although consolidated income series provide a reasonably adequate forecast of income, geographically segmented earnings improve the accuracy of predictions.

Do they believe that the business graduates they hire should have some education in the international aspects of business? In this study, unlike most studies of this nature, the respondents were asked about the importance of international business education for all business graduates, not just for those destined to work in the international operations of the firm.Nearly 80% of the respondents agreed that the employees will learn the international aspects of business on the job. This contrasts markedly with the results of the 1977 Nehrt report (30%), but is very close to the results of the 1984 Kobrin report (73%). The respondents who believe that international courses are relevant to their businesses (80% of all respondents) gave individual courses about the same importance as did those who participated in the 1984 Kohers study, which was also concerned with all business graduates hired by firms in the Southeast. Two other studies had similar results for business graduates destined for international operations only.&copy; 1993 JIBS.
