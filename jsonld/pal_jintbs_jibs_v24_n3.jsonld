[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "This study addresses one of the most compelling questions in the field of international management: How can a multinational simultaneously pursue the double-ended objective of effectively conceiving and executing its worldwide strategy? Here we examine the ways in which the dynamics of the strategy-making process between head office and subsidiary units influence the multinational&apos;s ability to achieve these two objectives. Specifically, we introduce the concept of procedural justice, the intellectual root of which is grounded in social psychology and law, into the international management and explore the impact of process fairness on multinationals&prime; ability to conceive and execute effective worldwide strategies. The results of this research are based on a two-phase longitudinal study of the decision making dynamics of nineteen multinationals. They provide support that the exercise of procedural justice is indeed a powerful way to organize the multinationals&prime; strategy-making process. Procedural justice was found to significantly augment multinationals&prime; ability to achieve this double-ended objective.&copy; 1993 JIBS.

This article provides a formal investigation of the correlates of product and promotion adaptation in export ventures. A conceptual framework of product and promotion adaptation in export ventures is proposed to integrate the diverse perspectives on the issue of standardization versus adaptation. The conceptual framework is further specified in a testable form and tested via data collected by a series of in-depth personal interviews with export marketing managers. The results support the contingency perspective recently emerging in the standardization literature, and suggest that the degree of the various aspects of product adaptation (i.e., upon and after entry) and promotion adaptation (i.e., positioning, packaging/labeling, and promotional approach) are significantly influenced by company, product/industry, and export market characteristics. However, the profile of the correlates varies across the various aspects of product and promotion adaptation.&copy; 1993 JIBS.
