[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Firms are social communities that specialize in the creation and internal transfer of knowledge. The multinational corporation arises not out of the failure of markets for the buying and selling of knowledge, but out of its superior efficiency as an organizational vehicle by which to transfer this knowledge across borders. We test the claim that firms specialize in the internal transfer of tacit knowledge by empirically examining the decision to transfer the capability to manufacture new products to wholly owned subsidiaries or to other parties. The empirical results show that the less codifiable and the harder to teach is the technology, the more likely the transfer will be to wholly owned operations. This result implies that the choice of transfer mode is determined by the efficiency of the multinational corporation in transferring knowledge relative to other firms, not relative to an abstract market transaction. The notion of the firm as specializing in the transfer and recombination of knowledge is the foundation to an evolutionary theory of the multinational corporation.&copy; 1993 JIBS.

International expansion was necessary for survival when foreign firms began to enter a domestic market, but only firms with substantial market share and international experiences, gained prior to the industry transition, could expand successfully. Operating only in the home market may permit a firm to survive in a primarily domestic industry, but moderate international expansion often brings current benefits and provides a base for future success should the industry become more global. However, expansion carries the risk of failure: firms that retrench after expanding internationally disappear.&copy; 1993 JIBS.

This study knits several evolving trends in the area of import sourcing into a theoretical framework in order to facilitate research in this under-researched topic and expose to practitioners the increasing strategic value of import sourcing.The suggested framework views the extent of import sourcing in a firm as a function of three factors: cost factor, strategy factor and the international trade infrastructure (ITI) factor. In the past decade, changes in ITI have facilitated international trade through developments in communication, transportation and other structural elements of international trade. The view of import sourcing presented here suggests a Principle of Import Sourcing Dynamics, which explains the progressively increasing strategic value of import sourcing to individual firms. Implications of the principle for practice and research are discussed.&copy; 1993 JIBS.

During the 100 days before the week of interlisting in the U.S., (risk-adjusted) stock prices of Canadian firms rise (on average) by over 9.4%, rise by an additional 2% around the interlisting date, but follow with a corresponding drop of 9.7% in the 100 days after interlisting. We interpret this evidence to be consistent with the financial market segmentation between Canada and the U.S. However, a subsample of Canadian resource firms does not exhibit these stock price effects, suggesting industry-related factors may also be an important determinant of integration. We also find average trading volume in interlisted stocks more than doubles in the months following interlisting.&copy; 1993 JIBS.
