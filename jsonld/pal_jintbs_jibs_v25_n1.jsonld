That framework describes four necessary and sufficient elements for the existence of international new ventures: (1) organizational formation through internalization of some transactions, (2) strong reliance on alternative governance structures to access resources, (3) establishment of foreign location advantages, and (4) control over unique resources.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Hypotheses were tested in a path analytic framework. Despite increased competition at home and abroad causing their global market share positions to weaken in recent years, U.S. multinationals have maintained, and even may have improved, their global consolidated profitability levels by skillfully exploiting their technological prowess through technology transfer and off-shore sourcing. Rapidly changing roles of U.S. parent firms and their foreign affiliates in technology development and global sourcing relationships portend a maturing, yet arduous, shift toward a global rationalization.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

This paper explores the extent to which the risk attitudes, political convictions, and country-of-origin associations of individuals affect the buying decision of a product from a controversial source country. On a theoretical level, it is investigated where in the decision-making process political convictions and country-of-origin effects emerge most forcefully. Hypotheses are tested empirically against survey data on farmers&apos; evaluations of tractors from several countries, including the Russian-made Belarus. The data analysis involves the specification of a recursive system encompassing the steps the buyer goes through from product evaluation of purchase. The effects of political convictions, risk attitudes, and the country-of-origin connection are evaluated at each stage in the process.

Many developing countries now protect foreign direct investors from expropriation.
