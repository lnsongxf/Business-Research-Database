In addition, sharp differences are revealed among affiliates of Canadian, Japanese and European MNCs, suggesting strong country effects. Together, these findings support the view of MNCs as composed of differentiated practices, which in turn are shaped by forces for local isomorphism and for internal consistency.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

The ownership entry modes examined are the wholly owned modes of acquisition and new venture entry, and the non-wholly owned mode of joint venture entry. A theoretical relationship is developed for international entry modes that is based on the contingency characteristics of resource requirements and organizational control factors. This model suggests that different entry modes have different performance outcomes based upon their resource and organizational control demands. The theoretical model, although developed using the eclectic theoretical approach, is based largely on concepts and relationships previously delineated in contingency theory. Our hypotheses suggest that new ventures should outperform joint ventures, and joint ventures should outperform acquisitions.

However, fewer U.S. managers receive management control information to support these zero-defect strategies.Tests linking quality strategies to management control information provide limited evidence that those U.S. managers who have adopted zero-defect strategies are more likely to receive modified management control information than U.S. managers who have not adopted zero-defect strategies. In contrast, the data suggest that Japanese managers are provided with goal-setting and feedback information about quality performance regardless of their adherence to a zero-defect versus a traditional quality management strategy, thus focusing workers&apos; attention on continuous quality improvement.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

The study concludes that there is no significant difference between the nine Latin American nations in terms of TDF vitality, functional activity and regulatory climate. A major implication of the research note is that preliminary results from the Latin American region tend to parallel global and headquarters-related studies in corporate TDF.&copy; 1994 JIBS.
