Relationships are tested using data from a survey of senior corporate international HRM managers of large, U.S.-based, manufacturing multinationals. An index of a geocentric mind-set is found to correlated with geographic scope and various aspects of IHRM policy and practice; however, no relationship is found with measures of multinational strategy or organizational structure. The paper concludes with a speculative hypothesis: development of a geocentric mind-set may relate to the information or knowledge intensity of the firm rather than its position on the strategic continuum.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

The results confirm previous evidence that exchange rate uncertainty has a negative effect on capacity expansions by domestic corporations and no effect on investment by multinational corporations.
