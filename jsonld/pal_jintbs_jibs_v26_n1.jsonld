[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "The concept of human resources management (HRM) has been much debated in the literature. The concept developed initially from work in the U.S.A. in the 1960s and 1970s and since then has been adopted increasingly around the world. This paper argues that in Europe there is only limited acceptance of the organizational autonomy upon which the concept in based, and that, therefore, different approaches to the notion of human resource management are required. External constraints are analysed and a new model of the concept that would encompass EuroHRM is proposed.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Particular emphasis is given to the interplay between &lsquo;industrial organization&rsquo; and &lsquo;policy&rsquo; factors in determining these shares. Most of the industrial organization factors were found to be significantly correlated with ownership shares, although the two variables capturing intangible assets were not. Two of the three policy variables were found to be significant. Since the policy regime in developing countries is typically more interventionist than that in OECD economies, this suggests that studies of the former ignore the policy context at their peril. It is also demonstrated that the results of these types of studies are sensitive to the precise definition of &lsquo;foreign ownership&rsquo;.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

It demonstrates that the obsolescing bargain took effect in India over a fifteen-year period following restrictive legislation. Unlike previous research, this study measures the effect of benefits received by multinationals from the host government in exchange for equity dilution. American companies are found to retain a smaller share of their foreign ownership over time than British and other European multinationals. Some explanatory variables that have previously been found to influence level of foreign ownership (static bargaining success) are found to be less important, or have a different effect, in explaining proportion of foreign ownership retained (dynamic bargaining success).&copy; 1995 JIBS.
