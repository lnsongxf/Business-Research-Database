[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "This paper examines the response to the creation of the European Union by firms located outside the European Community that seek to serve its markets. Analysis of some of the major steps taken by the European Community to complete the internal market shows that the relative competitive position of outsiders is expected to deteriorate, even if the concept of &ldquo;Fortress Europe&rdquo; is rejected by the Community.Outsider firms can neutralize some of the disadvantages they encounter by engaging in foreign direct investment in the European Community which transforms them, in some sense, into insiders. This paper outlines a model that distinguishes between the expected investment behavior of producers of different kinds of goods. Distinction is made between Heckscher-Ohlin goods (H-goods), characterized by publicly available technologies, and Schumpeter goods (S-goods), based on firm-specific knowledge. Analysis of recent foreign direct investment by Israeli firms in the European Community and in other parts of the world shows that patterns of actual flows by sector, by geographic region and over time, correspond to predictions derived from the model.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

It is based on a survey of 812 UK manufacturing PLCs and case studies in forty-six companies with a total of sixty-nine joint ventures. The results highlight the importance of transnational JVs in the EU and suggest that they are unlikely to have significantly reduced the level of competition in the Union. The motivations which underlie these ventures can be broken into two groups. Large firms under JVs in response to competitive pressures within an increasingly unified single market. Small and medium-sized firms undertake JVs in order to penetrate discrete national markets.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

We use monthly data on political risk ratings and stock returns for a sample of thirty-six countries from April 1982 to December 1991. Ex-post and ex-ante portfolio selection strategies are developed to assess the gains from international diversification. Efficient sets are derived using a quadratic programming technique. We use four ex-ante portfolio strategies whose optimal portfolio weights are those of the equally weighted portfolio, the minimum-variance portfolio the certainty-equivalence tangency portfolio and the Bayes-Stein portfolio. The empirical findings, based on the performance tests of Jobson and Korkie [1981], suggest that diversification among politically risky countries improves the risk-return characteristics of optimal portfolios. However, the most striking benefit of the inclusion of politically risk countries in an international portfolio is the reduction in overall portfolio risk.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

The evidence shows that foreign companies that write off goodwill against a reserve account transfer more wealth to the target shareholders than those that amortize goodwill against income. Further analysis reveals that foreign acquires that deduct goodwill for tax purposes transfer more wealth to the target stockholders at the acquisition announcement than other acquires. Such wealth transfers are precipitated by the competition for corporate control. Thus, the more advantageous international accounting and tax treatments for goodwill may leave U.S. bidders at a disadvantage as they compete with foreign acquirers for corporate control.Furthermore, contrary to the multinational network hypothesis, the study shows that for the firms in the sample, the acquirers with previous experience in the U.S. market transfer more wealth to target shareholders than those entering the U.S. market for the first time. On the other hand, the results for the relationship between industrial relatedness of merger partners and abnormal returns to target shareholders is mixed.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Kogut and Zander are correct to argue that opportunism is unnecessary to explain the existence of the multinational, but wrong to infer that this indicates an absence of market failure. They have identified an important class of transaction costs and market failure which arises in the absence of opportunism, but do not cat doubt on the market failure approach to the theory of the multinational. Their argument that they have identified an important source of &lsquo;ownership&rsquo; advantage is unconvincing and is not supported by the empirical evidence. However, Kogut and Zander&apos;s work is of considerable significance, but in areas different from those that they highlight.&copy; 1995 JIBS.
