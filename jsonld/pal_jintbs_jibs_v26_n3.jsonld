[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "This article discusses the implications of the advent of alliance capitalism for our theorizing about the determinants of MNE activity. In particular, it argues that, due to the increasing porosity of the boundaries of firms, countries and markets, the eclectic, or OLI, paradigm of international production needs to consider more explicitly the competitive advantages arising from the way firms organize their inter-firm transactions, the growing interdependencies of may intermediate product markets, and the widening of the portfolio of the assets of districts, regions and countries to embrace the external economies of interdependent activities.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Then, the relationships between the two dimensions of IHR strategy that emerged, global integration and local responsiveness, and a set of interorganizational interdependency variables were explored. Several new and informative associations between the interorganizational interdependency variables (subsidiaries&apos; dependence on parent&apos;s resources, local resources, and hot institutions) and IHR strategy were observed in a sample of one hundred subsidiaries of Japanese, U.S. and European MNCs operating in Taiwan.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Three aspects of measurement equivalence, translation, metric, and calibration equivalence, are necessary to establish the cross-national reliability and validity of items used to measure theoretical constructs. This paper discusses these issues and proposes two recently developed empirical techniques, Multiple Group LISREL and Optimal Scaling, for use in diagnosing cross-national measurement equivalence. These techniques are illustrated by reanalysis of a pioneering U.S. and Japanese study. The two techniques yield convergent results, indicating measurement equivalence for some, but not all, ordinal-level items under consideration. The findings demonstrate that the proposed methods are useful diagnostic tools for exploring measurement equivalence. Several suggestions for reducing the likelihood of problems with measurement equivalence and a number of methods for dealing with items where lack of equivalence persists are also discussed.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

However, few empirical studies attend to measurement issues involved in cross-national research, and still fewer recognize the risk of inferential errors that are likely to occur by overlooking measurement issues. We discuss four measurement issues, namely (1) standardized versus unstandardized coefficients, (2) the impact of measurement error and unequal reliability, (3) the overall error rate and simultaneous analysis and (4) construct equivalence. Using illustrate examples we demonstrate the nature of each of these problems, the likely impact they can have on substantive conclusions, and approaches for tackling these problems. Additionally, we reanalyze a recently published three-nation study by Dubinsky, Michaels, Kotabe, Lim and Moon [1992] to clarify these measurement concerns, highlight a methodological approach, and delineate the extent and severity of inferential errors. Our reanalysis shows that the interactive effects of these measurement issues are pervasive, complex and unpredictable.
