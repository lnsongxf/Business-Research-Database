Adopting a configurational approach, we then explored the ways in which subsidiary &lsquo;structural context&rsquo; varies across subsidiary role types. Structural context characteristics were determined through a discussion of the underlying principles of the &lsquo;hierarchy&rsquo; and &lsquo;heterarchy&rsquo; models of multinational organization. The key findings were: (a) higher strategic autonomy in world mandates than in local implementers; (b) a more internationally configured value-chain in world mandates and specialized contributors than local implementers; (c) lower levels of internal product flows in world mandates than the other two types; and (d) a significantly lower performance in specialized contributors. Implications for a configurational model of subsidiary management, and for heterarchy as a higher level conceptualization, are discussed.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

The paper argues that the driving factors of these location choices have differing influences on indigenous and foreign investors. Specifically, foreign investors suffer from a condition of adverse asymmetry in information costs compared to insiders. Thus, foreign investors&apos; decisions on the location of their activities within a host country mainly reflect a rational responses to the existence of information costs.In this paper, a cross-region multiple regression model is developed, with reference to a database containing detailed information on cross-border takeovers involving Italian industrial firms in the period 1986&ndash;91. Empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of inward FDIs is mainly governed by information costs.

Based on fifty-two articles or papers containing sixty-nine independent studies and 1,520 effect sizes, an analysis of fifteen study characteristics revealed that country-of-origin effects are only somewhat generalizable. Using omega-squared as the measure of effect size, verbal product descriptions produced larger COO effect sizes than did the presence of an actual product. Likewise, single-cue studies produced larger COO effect sizes than did multiple-cue studies, and larger samples produced effect sizes that on average were greater than those produced by smaller samples. The size of an observed COO effect was a function of whether the dependent variables was a quality/reliability perception or a purchase intention; the average effect size of quality/reliability perceptions was .30, whereas the average effect size for purchase intentions was .19. Purchase intentions were most susceptible to methodological artifacts than were quality/reliability perceptions. Study findings selectively confirm and refute common beliefs regarding the impact of a country-of-origin cue on product perceptions and purchase intentions.&copy; 1995 JIBS.
