[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "This study examines the determinants of foreign equity ownership in joint ventures in China. Drawing upon Duning&apos;s ownership, locational and internalization paradigm and the literature on bargaining power, eleven variables that impact foreign ownership preferences and concessions are examined. These variables are advertising intensity, foreign capital input, country risk of China, EJV investment amount, EJV contractual duration, cultural distance, competitive intensity, local partner state ownership, local partner alignment, foreign partner alignment, and EJV location. The empirical findings are largely consistent with the hypotheses. The empirical findings are largely consistent with the hypotheses. Further, interesting differences were found among U.S., European and Japanese firms with respect to the impact of these determinants.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Whereas there has been substantial research on various MNC models, there has been little longitudinal research on the movement toward projected network-based models. This paper develops an evolutionary perspective of this transition, distinguishing adjustments altering how the MNC defines its &ldquo;global&rdquo; strategy, where it locates key resources, and how it structures and manages operations. It argues that rather then being a planned process, each phase represents a viable strategic response to then-existing challenges and opportunities. The paper also argues that the focus of the process shifts over time, initially focusing on building organizational linkages and adjusting the quantity and nature of resources within dispersed units, and later shifting toward reallocating resources and roles across units.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Based on Dunning&apos;s eclectic theory of foreign direct investment and resource dependence theory, hypotheses were generated to explain the determinants of foreign investment of Japanese suppliers. It was hypothesized that mutual dependencies between the major Japanese automobile firms and their suppliers, firm-specific ownership advantages, profitability, and keiretsu affiliation influenced the foreign direct investment of the first-tier automobile ancillary firms into the United States. Data on the entire population of 446 Japanese automobile ancillary manufacturers were obtained from archival sources. Logistical regression analyses indicated that keiretsu affiliation, previous international experience, small size, lower dependence of supplier firms on the automobile assembly firm, and higher dependence of core firms on affiliate firms all contributed to this foreign direct investment.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

We find positive valuation effects associated with cross-listing for both country-benchmarked and industry-benchmarked price ratios. Variables that proxy for home country characteristics such as governance styles, disclosure quality, market liquidity, and so forth are unable to explain the cross-sectional variation in the data.
