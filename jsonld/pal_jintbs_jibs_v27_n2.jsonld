[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "This paper examines the notion that the multinational&apos;s nationality influences its foreign subsidiary ownership decisions. It identifies theoretically meaningful constructs to represent nationality and examines, under carefully controlled conditions, their influence on subsidiary ownership preferences in American and European multinationals. The paper concludes that there are indeed significant differences in ownership preferences among various nationalities that can be explained using cultural as well as economic variables, but that these differences may become weaker in larger multinationals.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Researchers describe the sequence of entry that firms follow and the mode of entry they choose. They suggest that psychically close countries are more easily understood than distant ones; and offer more familiar operating environments. Although not prescriptive, an unstated conclusion can be drawn linking sequence of entry to performance. Evidence from thirty-two Canadian retail companies shows that only seven (22%) were functioning successfully in the United States. The psychic distance paradox is that operations in psychically close countries are not necessarily easy to manage, because assumptions of similarity can prevent executives from learning about critical differences. Moreover, empirical evidence from 271 CEOs confirms greater cultural differences between Canada and the U.S. than assumed previously. Modifications are suggested to improve the psychic distance concept.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

These dissimilar principal motives manifest themselves in aggregate impacts on national trade balances. Using market imperfections theory and borrowing from Root [1977], we suggest that firms generally tend to use FDI in AINs for market access and penetration, increasing host-country import levels. Firms tend to use FDI in DCs in order to gain resource advantages that can be exploited in export markets leading to increased exports and hence, trade surpluses. A contingency framework which outlines the conditions under which FDI inflows will be related to national trade surpluses and/or deficits, based on the dominant strategic motives of the investing firms, is presented and tested. Our findings suggest that the relationship between FDI inflow and trade balance is moderated by whether a country is an Advanced Industrial Nation or a Developing Country.
