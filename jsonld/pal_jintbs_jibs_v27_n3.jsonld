[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Research conducted primarily in the United States has shown that interpersonal influence arising from opinion exchange behavior is an important factor in consumers&apos; product adoption and brand choice decisions. An important managerial question in the international arena is whether information-giving and seeking behaviors depend on culture. In a study representing eleven nationalities, we explore the role of culture in moderating consumers&apos; opinion exchange behavior. Results indicate that the cultural characteristics of power distance and uncertainty avoidance [Hofstede 1980] influence the focus of consumers&apos; product information search activities, but not their tendencies to share product-related opinions with others. Following earlier opinion leadership studies, we find that individual characteristics such as product category interest and involvement are most indicative of active opinion leadership behavior.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Miller [1992, 1993] developed and tested the most comprehensive framework to date. Miller [1993] showed high inter-rater reliability in his measure of Perceived Environmental Uncertainty (PEU). In this paper we test the dimensionality of the scales from a statistical viewpoint and find that the statistical determination is reasonably consistent with Miller&apos;s measure by comparing scales, conceptualized by Miller, with ones determined by factor analysis. We test the reliability of these scales and find that the conceptualized scales have generally high internal consistency in samples of both manufacturing and service firms. However, the findings also suggest that several changes in the PEU measure are warranted, resulting in a refinement of Miller&apos;s measure, which we have labeled PEU 2.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Theories of inter-group behavior and cultural differences were used to predict the influence strategies used by Japanese managers with subordinates from their own and another culture. There were significant differences in their strategies, which were associated with the national culture of their subordinates. Japanese managers used significantly more influence with Canadian than with Japanese subordinates, including strategies of assertiveness, reason, sanctions, upward appeal, and reciprocity. The structure of Japanese influence differed from that found in prior research. We discuss the implications of these differences for managers influencing subordinates across cultures.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

This research studied thirty-one mandates in six Canadian subsidiaries of U.S.-owned multinational corporations. A life-cycle framework was proposed, and used to explore the factors associated with the gain, development and loss of mandates by subsidiaries. Two key findings emerged. First, it was shown that there is a risk in having a full-scope world product mandate, because it is possible to become marginal to the corporate strategy. Second, it was observed that the engine of subsidiary growth is its distinctive capabilities, and that for a mandate to be effective it must be built on those capabilities. Implications for mandate sustainability are proposed on the basis of these two insights.&copy; 1996 JIBS.
