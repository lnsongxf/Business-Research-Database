[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "The returns to multinationality are estimated as the value of &ldquo;operating flexibility.&rdquo; Empirical measures of the return of multinationality require a precise specification of the extensiveness of the MNC&apos;s transnational network to measure the degree of multinationality. This precise, empirically grounded definition of multinationality has been absent from the academic literature to date. We address this omission and we find that two characteristics of the transnational network, its BREADTH (number of foreign countries in which the MNC has operations) and DEPTH (the concentration of foreign subsidiaries in a few countries) are significant in explaining the value of operating flexibility. In particular, we find that the returns to multinationality are maximized for firms with networks that have BREADTH, but not DEPTH. The role of market intangibles such as R&amp;D and advertising on MNC market valuation is shown to depend on the flexibility regime.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

It is argued that a useful way to model foreign direct investment (FDI) decisions is to recognize explicitly the uncertainties involved in them. A probabilistic model of FDI is specified. The following hypotheses are incorporated in the model: 1) the higher the risk-adjusted expected net benefits from foreign direct investment, ceteris paribus, the higher the probability of making an investment at any particular moment and thus the probability of investing earlier; 2) risk-adjusted expected net benefits from FDI by a firm are a function of its possession of certain types of intangible, transportable assets; 3) the uncertainties involved with FDI may be reduced with the passage of time and with increased experience with foreign operations; 4) parent company attributes that facilitate market intelligence capabilities permit early recognition of investment opportunities; and 5) timing of entry may reflect strategic considerations such as responding to growing foreign market opportunities, the need to ensure market access and the presence of opportunities to obtain abnormal profits due to market concentration. The models are estimated using Cox&apos;s proportional hazards regression model. Results generally confirm the hypotheses that size and financial capabilities, as well as possession of some knowledge-based, firm-specific strategic assets, are significantly related to early FDI. They also confirm that timing of entry is affected by market opportunities and in some cases by the need to ensure market access. We did not find evidence in this sector that differences in market concentration significantly affected the timing of FDI. Analyses are also provided of inter-period changes in the importance of different types of intangible assets in explaining earlier FDI as well as changes that reflect differences in host country environments.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

The empirical analysis shows that key technologies were generally knowledge of/experience in the industry and methodology for producing the service. Transfer of the technology was mainly done through the training and transfer of experts: and organizational forms were wholly owned subsidiaries and international partnerships. More technology transfer occurred when firms were more international, when affiliates were more recently-established, and when parent ownership was lower in the affiliate.
