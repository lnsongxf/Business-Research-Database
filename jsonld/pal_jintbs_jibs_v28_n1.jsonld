[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "This paper examines the international pervasiveness and importance of the previously uncovered four-year U.S. election cycle whereby U.S. stock returns are significantly lower, and negative, in year 2 following U.S. presidential election relative to years 1, 3 and 4. All eighteen countries examined over the 1957 to 1996 time period possess lower local currency stock market capital gains returns in year 2 (-0.66%) relative to the average capital gains of years 1, 3 and 4 (11.68%). These predominately lower year 2 returns are shown to be robust in conditional expected return regressions which include both local macroeconomic variables as well as U.S. macroeconomic, fiscal and monetary policy variables. In addition, we find that the U.S. dollar trends to depreciate more in year 2 of the election cycle. We conclude that the U.S. election cycle variable is either proxying for information variables not included in our model, or the U.S. election cycle variable is capturing some form of U.S. and international market sentiment. That is, the U.S. election cycle may be an important nondiversifiable political factor in the determination of international conditional expected stock returns.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

Existing studies of market segmentation have been conducted within a framework in which exchange risk is not explicitly recognized. This paper performs a joint test of market segmentation and exchange risk pricing based on individual stock data from seven major countries, outside of the U.S., for the period January 1981 to December 1989. The theoretical framework used is a multifactor model with domestic and world market factors and an exchange risk factor. The maximum likelihood method is used to estimate risk premia, and factor analysis is used to provide additional evidence on the pricing of risk factors. The results indicate that (a) the factor structure of asset returns is internationally heterogeneous, (b) many national capital markets can be described as partially segmented, rather than the polar cases of complete segmentation or integration, and (c) exchange risk is a significant factor affecting asset returns in addition to the domestic and world market risk factors.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

The willingness of North American and Asian managers to escalate commitment to losing projects was measured using four go/no-go decision cases. We hypothesized that Asian managers would be less willing to act in their self-interest (a lower agency effect), and would be more willing to escalate a decision in the face of negative framing (a stronger framing effect). We found that agency theory had strong explanatory power for project in our Asian sample. Framing effects were significant in both, but they were not significantly different.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

First, the eclectic approach to foreign entry mode, proposed by Hill, Hwang and Kim [1990] and Kim and Hwang [1992], is used to examine transaction-specific, organizational capability and strategic factors that influence channel choices in foreign markets. Empirical results based on survey of U.S. firms support the combined relevance of these factors in predicting the degree of channel integration. Second, the study empirically examines the performance consequences of channel integration. The results suggest that, although the degree of channel integration does not have a direct influence on channel performance, a contingency model based on the fit between the contextual factors and the actual channel choice is significantly related to performance in foreign markets.&copy; 1997 JIBS.
