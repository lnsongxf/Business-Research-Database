[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "This paper explores the relationship between national institutional context and the development of biotechnology in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan and Germany. National patterns in biotechnology R&amp;D are linked to the configuration of county-specific institutional features into a system of innovation which supports (or impedes) the accumulation and diffusion of knowledge between the scientific and industrial communities. Building on this comparative analysis, it is argued that the particular characteristics of national systems of biotechnology innovation form the basis for complex interdependence within the global system, through international technological cooperation and the cross-border adoption and adaptation of institutional forms and practices. Implications for national technological advantage and the stability of national institutional systems are discussed.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

This paper explores the role of central and eastern European transitional governments as key stakeholders, and how they influence international joint venture negotiations. This role is described and analyzed by examining eight dyads of western European and central/eastern European enterprises that have recently negotiated agreements. The findings suggest that transitional governments as key stakeholders intervene at different stages of the negotiation process, have both direct and indirect influences on the process, and that they can change the balance of power in the negotiations, sometimes to the detriment of their own state-owned enterprise.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

Three hypotheses are developed and tested.

With the help of a LISREL-based structural model, the three hypotheses are tested on a sample of 362 service firms. The analysis shows that lack of internationalization knowledge has a strong impact on the lack of both business and institutionalization.

The results of our empirical analysis show that a competitive analysis without the recognition of country image would be misleading. We found that country-specific intangible assets exist and that they significantly interact with marketing variables differently for U.S. and Japanese brands in the subcompact car market in the USA. Brand popularity and advertising were found to be key factors for intangible assets for both the U.S. and the Japanese brands. Brand popularity was the most significant factor for market share in both the short run and the long run. Japanese firms&apos; direct investment (FDI) in the target country directly influenced market share only in the short run.

Awareness levels about export schemes among managers of companies at exporting or pre-exporting stages of internationalization are often quite low, and the perceived usefulness of schemes may decline as companies internationalize and their needs become more specific. One solution may be to develop a better understanding of the needs of managers who make export market development decisions, and to target segments of managers (rather than companies) who share similar strengths and weaknesses. This study attempts to address these concerns by devising a typology of senior international marketing managers. The most senior marketing decisionmakers in a broad, multi-industry sample of New Zealand exporting firms were surveyed. The results of the cluster analysis suggest that groups of managers who share similar characteristics can be identified and profiled, based on shared international business attitudes and similar levels of knowledge and skills. This appears to be a useful method of segmenting international marketing managers to determine what sort of educational and export assistance particular groups may require.&copy; 1997 JIBS.
