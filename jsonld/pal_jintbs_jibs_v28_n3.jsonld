[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Studies on foreign direct investment (FDI) have concentrated on sectoral effects, but rarely on country patterns, In this paper, we use U.S. Department of Commerce data to identify the largest country shares of new FDI entries into the U.S. and the technological motivations for their investments. Based on the technological intensities of major investing countries in manufacturing industries, we conclude that technological industries attract a disproportionate share of FDI entries. However, the acquisition of U.S. technology is not a major motivation. The findings indicate that industry rivalry is an important dimension to understanding FDI.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

However, a systematic search of the academic literature reveals a striking imbalance: while exporter behavior has been extensively studied, importer behavior remains a largely neglected area of study, even though importers are playing an even more important (often dominant) role in consummating trade transactions. In this article, we assert that this neglect stems from two critical &ndash; but flawed &ndash; assumptions. The first is that exporters are the driving force behind international trade transactions, and the second is that importers follow the neoclassical economics theory of &ldquo;rational choice&rdquo; in international sourcing.We offer an integrated exporter/importer decision framework, a critical review and synthesis of extant studies of importer behavior, and suggestions for future research directions. Evidence shows that much international exchange is better conceptualized as buyer-coordinated importing rather than producer-initiated exporting. Furthermore, the revealed behavior of importers is different from what can be expected of them from the rational choice paradigm, and is messier than what is commonly assumed of them in the export management literature. From a cognitive perspective, our study also suggests that there may exist a fundamental behavioral difference between domestic and IB decisionmaking.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

Prior studies have examined factors that affect the debt ratio for both multinational corporations (MNCs) and domestic corporations (DCs); however, the incremental explanatory power and the direct effect of the extent of international activities on capital structure have not been tested. This paper uses multiple regression analyses to add measures of international activities after controlling for measures pertinent to both MNCs and DCs. Using a sample of 18,495 observations from the Compustat Tape, we find 1) consistent with results reported by prior studies, the debt-equity ratio is negatively related to both bankruptcy costs and growth options; 2) after controlling for bankruptcy costs and growth options, MNCs have lower debt-equity rations than DCs; 3) within the MNCs, the debt-equity ratio is positively related to the degree of internationalization, and this calls for further investigation.&copy; 1997 JIBS.
