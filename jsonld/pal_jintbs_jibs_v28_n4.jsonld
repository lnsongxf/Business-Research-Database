[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "This paper presents an objective measurement of industry globalization. Although crucial in understanding firm strategies, industry globalization has been largely subjectively measured, consisting of mostly case studies. This research develops a two-pronged measure of industry globalization based on (a) the extent of an industry&apos;s international linkages (LIT) and (b) the integration of value-added activities within the industry (IIT). In addition of providing a quantitative equivalent to Porter [1986] and Bartlett and Ghoshal&apos;s [1989] conceptual industry categorizations, this measure permits the examination of important but previously untested notions regarding globalization. Using data for chemical and manufacturing industries for five major trading nations, we find that (1) chemical industries are less global than manufacturing industries, despite high levels of FDI found in chemical industries; (2) U.S. globalization, frequently assumed to be representative of worldwide globalization of industries, is less than that of other major industrial countries; and (3) industries in both sectors are globalizing over time, consistent with the literature.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

We measure the frequency that managers are involved with forty-four skill activities, and then test the universalist hypothesis against two competing hypotheses, situational and convergence. While we find some evidence that refutes the universalist hypothesis, overall we find surprisingly strong support for it, in that the relative frequency with which managers from one stratum of one nation are involved in various skill activities reflects the relative frequency with which managers from other strata within the same nation, and from nations of different cultural-industrialized standing, are involved in the same activities.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

Research has found that U.S. firms derive ownership advantages from their size, experience, and technological and marketing superiority. Perhaps having operated in the most-developed and sophisticated home market, many U.S. firms generate unique skills that give them absolute advantages over firms in almost all foreign host locations. Developing-country MNCs do not have absolute ownership advantages similar to those of the U.S. firms. The relevance of a particular firm-specific characteristic for a developing-country MNC may be contingent not only upon the home-country characteristics, as in the case of U.S. MNCs, but also upon host-country characteristics. This study investigates the subsidiary ownership preferences among Korean MNCS and finds that the influence of three firm-specific advantages&mdash;technological intensity, product differentiation and capital intensity&mdash;on subsidiary ownership levels is contingent upon whether the subsidiary is located in a relatively less-developed or a more-developed country as compared to the home country. Although some authors have suggested that the influence of firm-specific advantages may be contingent upon the characteristics of both home- and host-country locations, empirical investigations to this effect have been nonexistent.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

The model also describes how operation-related factors, i.e., the location and the level of local government, affect these decisions. Seven major hypotheses were tested using a longitudinal sample of 2,998 foreign business activities in China between 1979 and 1993. Our sample consists of foreign investing firms from the U.S., Europe, Japan, and other Asian countries.

We examine the role of the management team&apos;s international experience as such a mechanism, for the internationalization of Canadian software product firms.
