The focus on flexibility is a response to the rationalization and restructuring of international business, which has occurred since the end of the &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; of Western economic growth. Flexibility has been south in factor markets, intermediate product markets and markets for final products. It has been sought by both governments and firms. Flexible firms are attracted to locations with flexible host governments. This article contrasts the modern research agenda based on flexibility with the more traditional research agenda which predominates in the literature reviewed by Caves (1996).&copy; 1998 JIBS.

The dominant &ldquo;transactions-cost&rdquo; theory of multinational enterprises does not wholly account for why this is so. The reductio ad absurdum of this theory would predict imperfect markets to be sure, but they would be monopolistic rather than oligopolistic. In this article, a simple model based on noncooperative game theory shows how oligopolistic markets can evolve from monopolistic ones. Also shown is that it is neither necessary nor sufficient that a firm have lower costs than its rivals in order to have an incentive to become multinational.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

Research has been severely hampered by data gaps and suggestions are made with respect to improvements in the information base.
