[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Do multinational enterprises operate flexibly, i.e., do they shift production in response to currency changes? Three theoretical perspectives are developed. Flexibility optimism, premised on information and sunk cost advantages, takes a macro efficiency perspective and predicts sizable responses. Flexibility pessimism, premised on inertia and internal opportunism, takes an organizational perspective and predicts sticky responses. Flexibility realism, premised on the view that to be flexible in the current period multinational enterprises need to have planned and invested accordingly in previous periods, predicts positive, but relatively modest, responses. Empirical analysis spanning the period 1977-1993 finds that multinational enterprises systematically exploit currency shifts, but even in the face of large exchange rate changes, their operational responses are relatively modest. The results appear most consistent with flexibility realism, and this hypothesis is selected over the alternatives considered.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

It has been suggested that investment may be motivated by experience of a particular location represented by tenure of operations. In contrast, portfolio considerations suggest that increased investment in a given location increases risk exposure. In this paper, the question of whether a multinational with a longer duration of operations at a particular location is more likely to invest further is addressed after taking portfolio risk into account. A conceptual model of multinational investment strategy is developed and empirically tested using data from a survey of multinational enterprises operating in the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom. Two innovative non-parametric tests for duration dependence are applied. After normalising for portfolio considerations, it is found that multinational investment is significantly duration dependent, i.e., firms with a longer tenure of operations are significantly more likely to invest in any given period. This finding has important implications for the strategy of inward investment agencies. In particular, an investment agency is short-sighted if it seeks to attract new investors if that is at the expense of neglecting multinationals with current operations in its jurisdiction.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

Evidence of a significant positive relationship between the level of systematic risk in a firm and the degree of that firm&apos;s internationalization is presented.

Theoretically grounded in international cooperation, transaction cost theory and economic anthropology, reciprocity is operationalized and explored in this study. Specifically, the effects of cultural distance, economic nearness, country-level risk and governance mechanisms are analyzed in relationship to three distinct measures of reciprocity. The international long distance industry provides the research setting. During the 1980s and 1990s, as this industry has become more competitive within the United States, foreign partners have been slow to reciprocate regarding the sharing of revenues derived from increased overseas calling. To study reciprocity between U.S. international long distance carriers and their partnering foreign entities, a pooled time-series/cross-sectional technique is used. 11 years of contractual arrangements between the U.S. firms and the telecom administrations of 109 countries are analyzed. Governance mechanisms test as highly significant with all measures of reciprocity, while the other independent variables exhibit varying degrees of significance with the respective dependent measures.&copy; 1998 JIBS.
