[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "This paper shows that network linkage is an important determinant of location choice in foreign direct investment (FDI). Network linkages are divided into internal (intra-firm) and external (inter-firm) linkages. External linkages are further separated into strategic and relational linkages. We found that Taiwanese firms are keen on making external linkages, but are indifferent to, or incapable of, making internal linkages through FDI. Strategic linkages motivate Taiwanese FDI in the United States, while relational linkages facilitate Taiwanese FDI in Southeast Asia and China. Small firms are more sensitive to relational linkages than large firms in their choice of FDI location.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

This paper addresses these conflicting views by comparing the location of all manufacturing establishments in the United States held by the U.S. and by foreign firms. The empirical evidence indicates that the location patterns of foreign-owned and U.S.-owned establishments differ. Moreover, the most influential factor in explaining the location pattern difference is that foreign-owned establishments, compared to U.S.-owned establishments, favor coastal states. I also find evidence to suggest that foreign firms favor states with low unionization rates, low wage rates, and right to work legislation. These results are consistent with arguments that foreign establishments differ from their domestic counterparts and value location attributes differently.&copy; 1998 JIBS.
