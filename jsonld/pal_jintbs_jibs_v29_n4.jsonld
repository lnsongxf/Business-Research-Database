This paper proposes a model of negotiations that examines how national culture, organization specific factors, and individual characteristics of the negotiators impact the multilateral negotiation process in a cross-national context. Specifically, social network theory and tools are utilized to examine how coalitions form and roles emerge among participants. The model also posits the effect of social network activity on negotiation outcomes. Research propositions are forwarded in hopes of setting an agenda for the research stream implied by the model. Methods for testing the model and implications for academics and managers are also discussed.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

These selected negotiation strategies become normative. Results from a negotiation simulation in the United States and Hong Kong indicate that U.S. negotiators are more likely to subscribe to self-interest and joint problems solving norms, and Hong Kong Chinese negotiators are more likely to subscribe to an equality norm. Further, U.S. negotiators report more satisfaction when they maximize joint gain and Hong Kong Chinese negotiators are happier when they achieve outcome parity. The reported norms and outcome evaluations are consistent with the value profiles of the two cultures. The implications of these cultural differences are discussed in terms of expanding U.S. based negotiation theory.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

Three categories of determinants of negotiator affect are proposed: Individual differences, cross-cultural differences, and contextual factors. The ways in which negotiator affect influences information processing during negotiations are then described. It is suggested that the influence of affect, through substantive information processing, may lead to either positive or negative spirals in negotiations, influencing the ability of negotiators to reach an integrative solution. Finally, the ways in which negotiators can break out of destructive negative spirals by engaging in motivated rather than substantive information processing are discussed.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

Our analysis of 737 Japanese JVs in Asia demonstrates that the conventionally assumed form of JV represented only 30 percent of the total. Further, each of the four JV forms significantly differed in terms of incidence, performance, and survival likelihood.&copy; 1998 JIBS.
