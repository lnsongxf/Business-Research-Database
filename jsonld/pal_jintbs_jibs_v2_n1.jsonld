[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "The voluntary and mandatory direct investment control programs instituted since 1965 were directed at new outflows of funds from the U.S. and reinvested earnings abroad. It was not their aim to curb plant and equipment expenditures as such.11Anthony M. Solomon, &ldquo;Foreign Investment Controls: Policy and Response.&rdquo; Law and Contemporary Problems, XXXIV (Winter, 1969), P. 119. But by shifting the financing of U.S. overseas investment away from U.S.-owned to foreign sources of funds, the U.S. government hoped to reduce the balance of payments deficit according to the liquidity definition. To evaluate the record two kinds of questions require answers. First, to what extent can one say that the substantial shifts which occurred in the observed patterns of U.S. foreign affiliates&apos; plant and equipment expenditures and financing were actually caused by the impact of the controls? The problem is whether changing economic conditions at home and abroad could have produced similar patterns in the absence of the programs. Second, in what sense can the regulations then be said to have eased the U.S. balance of payments pressures? The answer here depends upon a complex of factors including, inter alia,, the extent to which capital outflows led to export surplus and whether putative savings on direct investment were squandered elsewhere.&copy; 1971 JIBS.

In addition to the normal business issues faced by its domestic counterpart, the multinational firm faces many added opportunities and problems simply because it operates in more than one country. Many of these complicating factors which are unique to multinational firms have been examined and researched in great detail. However, one set of factors which is very important to the success of multinational firms has received relatively little attention from researchers: those factors relating to the unique human and behavioral problems encountered by a firm operating in several cultural and national environments. One of these behavioral issues which is particularly vital to the multinational firm is the performance of persons of one nationality who are assigned to positions in another cultural environment.&copy; 1971 JIBS.

First, much of the managerial technology being transmitted in schools of administration has been developed by these companies.

Second, Brazilian higher education has been in the classical tradition with little focus on the transmission of scientific knowledge and technical skills. Brazilian business schools are having a revolutionary impact on the educational system through their adoption of relatively pragmatic curricula, and close business-academic collaboration would help insure a continuing dynamism in approach. Third, it is among the graduates of schools of business that the international companies can find personnel to staff their rapidly expanding Brazilian operations. The purpose of this research has been to develop an appreciation of the extent to which international corporations&mdash;through the transmission of technology and administrative know-how&mdash;and Brazilian schools of management&mdash;through the training of managers and the adaptation of modern administrative methods to local situations&mdash;are mutually reinforcing in their contributions to development.&copy; 1971 JIBS.
