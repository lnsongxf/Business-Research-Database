[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "This paper examines the determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI) in research and development laboratories by 32 multinational enterprises in the pharmaceutical and electronics industries. The paper applies a dichotomous set of motives for FDI. Results from an econometric analysis of 136 laboratory investments show that relative market size and relative strength of a country&apos;s science base determine whether FDI in research and development is carried out in order to exploit existing firm-specific advantages, or in order to build up new firm-specific advantages. This holds true in similar form for Japanese, European and U.S. firms and across the two industries.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Past research has stated that exporters of manufactured goods can hardly afford to ignore the possibility of this phenomenon due to the often severe effects on their sales volume, margins, and relationships with distributors and end-users. Through a survey of export managers of manufacturing firms, coupled with a series of qualitative interviews, this study investigates how organizational specific, control specific, and market specific factors drive gray market activity, and in turn explores the effects of unauthorized distribution on export performance. Several factors are shown to evaluate the potential of unauthorized distribution in their export markets, namely the centralization of decision making, the degree to which the product is standardized, channel integration, and channel control. International experience, market volatility, and the number of markets served were found to have no effect on gray market activity, this contrary to traditional thinking. Furthermore, the effects of gray market activity on strategic versus economic performance is shown to be significantly different. Each of these issues is discussed in detail, along with the implications for export managers.&copy; 1999 JIBS.
