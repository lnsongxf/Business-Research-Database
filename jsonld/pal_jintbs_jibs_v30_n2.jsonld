In this paper we first evaluate guanxi from an ethical perspective, and then attempt to shed light on the sources of its economic advantages and disadvantages through the use of a simple mathematical model. Finally, we point out how eastern and western business practices may already be converging toward systems based on more complete models of trust to deal with the conditions of progress coupled with uncertainty that form our new economic reality.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

If so, does such a relationship between experience and performance hold over time? How do the environmental forces in the host country affect such a relationship? Focusing on organizational learning by multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in a transition economy, this study answers these three critical questions by exploring the relationships among experience, environment, and performance at the subsidiary level. Based on a recent survey of 108 MNE subunits operating in China, we find that the intensity and diversity of host country experience is an important predictor of subunit performance. While the positive effect of the intensity of experience on performance diminishes over time, the impact of the diversity of experience on performance remains unchanged. Moreover, for MNEs experiencing greater environmental dynamism, complexity, and hostility, there is a stronger positive relationship between experience and performance.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Using this game-theoretic conceptualization as a complement to the transactions cost analysis notion of credible commitments, we argue that such investments serve as assurances of commitment to the international buyer. The hypotheses are tested using data collected in a survey of U.S. purchasing managers regarding their relationships with their Pacific Rim suppliers. Consistent with our hypotheses, our primary results indicate that suppliers&apos; relationship-specific investments are greater when technological uncertainty is high and buyers value supplier responsiveness. Further, our results suggest that relationship stability and buyer information sharing are greater when supplier relationship-specific investments are greater. These results provide some support for our argument that in the face of technological uncertainty, overseas suppliers may unilaterally commit to their buyers in attempts to obtain reciprocal benefits that help them manage external uncertainty.&copy; 1999 JIBS.
