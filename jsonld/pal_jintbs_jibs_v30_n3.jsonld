[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "This paper reports on a multi-method study of knowledge transfer in international acquisitions. Using questionnaire data we show that the transfer of technological know-how is facilitated by communication, visits &amp; meetings, and by time elapsed since acquisition, while the transfer of patents is associated with the articulability of the knowledge, the size of the acquired unit, and the recency of the acquisition. Using case study data, we show that the immediate post-acquisition period is characterized by imposed one-way transfers of knowledge from the acquirer to the acquired, but over time this gives way to high-quality reciprocal knowledge transfer.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

By focusing on one type of competency - marketing know-how - this research examines the role of knowledge ambiguity pertaining to the process of knowledge transfer in international strategic alliances. Based on a cross-sectional sample of 151 multinationals and a structural equation methodology, this study empirically investigates the antecedents of knowledge ambiguity: tacitness, asset specificity, complexity, experience, partner protectiveness, cultural distance, and organizational distance. Further, the strength of the relationships between these theoretical constructs and ambiguity is examined in light of the possible moderating effects of collaborative experience, firm size, and the duration of the alliance entered. Consistently, tacitness emerges as the most significant determinant of knowledge transferability. Moreover, the effects of cultural distance, asset specificity, and prior experience are moderated respectively by the firm&apos;s level of collaborative experience, the duration of the alliance, and the firm&apos;s size.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Recent work in growth theory has measured the extent to which growth in total factor productivity in a country depends not only on domestic R&amp;D capital stocks but also on foreign R&amp;D capital stocks. This paper extends such work by adding foreign direct investment stocks to foreign trade as a channel linking total factor productivity levels between countries. This is done by considering the role of trade and FDI as diffusion channels for G6 R&amp;D to the OECD countries. There are three main results: the coefficient estimates for FDI are higher than those for trade in the standard model; the importance of the trade channel is much reduced once FDI is included; and the overall spillovers increase significantly with the inclusion of FDI.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

The paper adds to the literature concerned with how public policies targeted specifically at FDI have altered capital inflows, and uniquely links such policies to outward direct investment (ODI). We examine specifically the effects of major policy changes toward FDI implemented by the Canadian government over the period 1950-1995. In Canada&apos;s case, free-trade agreements (FTA and NAFTA) appear to have significantly increased levels of inward and outward foreign direct investment; however, Canada&apos;s attempt to screen FDI via the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA) had no significant effects on either FDI or ODI.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Current theory does not address the more global view of the TNC where subsidiaries act in concert to maximize profits, and therefore can be evaluated in a similar fashion.

The multi-dimensionality of adjustment was investigated and confirmed. Support for the expanded Black et al. (1991) model was found.
