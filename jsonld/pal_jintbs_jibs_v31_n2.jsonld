[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "In this era of globalization how do we explain the &ldquo;home bias,&rdquo; unexpectedly large distance effects, and lagged adjustment patterns visible in international exchange? In this paper, I argue that in the real world, the identity and reliability of potential exchange partners are seldom the data that most economists take them to be. In fact, firms confront formidable problems of search and deliberation. In these circumstances, firms&apos; social networks can provide a key recourse. Yet, for historical reasons, most firms&apos; social networks still tend to be local or national. And, absent institutional solutions, even in the face of apparent cross-border economic opportunities, firms&apos; responses appear overly sticky and lagged. I explore these arguments in an empirical study that contrasts multinational and domestic firms&apos; trade responses to changes in real exchange rates.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

The results indicated that SBUs using wholly-owned entry-modes demonstrated high levels of internal (parent) isomorphism; those using exporting, joint ventures, or licensing agreements demonstrated external isomorphism; and those using multiple or mixed entry-mode demonstrated low levels of isomorphic pressures.&copy; 2000 JIBS.
