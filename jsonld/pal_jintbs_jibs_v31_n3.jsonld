[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "This paper attempts to examine theoretically and empirically the explanatory power of concepts drawn from economic geography for the explanation of the location of TNCs. It combines concepts from economic geography and international business theories in a model that seeks to explain the location of Transnational Corporations (TNCs), and tests the model on financial and professional service FDI to the US. The findings suggest a need to extend the conventional location model of international business by acknowledging the processes taking place among firms located in geographic proximity.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

We show that the synergy hypothesis is the predominant explanation for our sample of foreign acquisitions of U.S. firms. However, the hubris hypothesis coexists with the synergy hypothesis in explaining the acquisitions in our sample that are characterized by positive total gains. The evidence is also consistent with the managerialism hypothesis for the acquisitions in our sample with negative total gains. We show that the incidence of competition is associated with higher total gains, as well as higher gains to targets.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

The empirical analysis uses panel data for 48 UK industries over the period 1991 &ndash; 1995. A major contribution is empirical evidence on spillover effects in situations where the host country is developed. The results indicate that the very presence of FDI has a positive spillover impact on the productivity of UK-owned firms. The analysis also shows that the extent to which local firms benefit from the introduction of advanced technology depends largely on their own technological capabilities.&copy; 2000 JIBS.
