Today, those relations are better understood as the result of a two-tier, multi-party bargaining process. Tier-1 bargaining, between the governments of host and home countries, occurs bilaterally or through multilateral institutions. It produces macro rules on FDI that affect micro negotiations in Tier-2 (per the traditional bargaining model). The extent of FDI liberalization resulting from Tier-1 bargaining varies predictably across home-host country pairs and industries. Suggestions for testing the two-tier bargaining model are also presented.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Under goal incongruity, Chinese parent control is associated with foreign parent dissatisfaction with venture performance, but not vice-versa. Having a majority stake improves performance from a foreign parent perspective, but not from that of the Chinese parent.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

We test competing hypotheses derived from the cultural and institutional/isomorphic perspectives. Data from firms operating in Hong Kong show that Western firms (U.S. and European) are more receptive to OD interventions than Asian firms (local and Japanese), which supports the cultural explanation. However, the local isomorphism explanation is valid in predicting organizational outcomes that OD interventions have similar effects regardless of a firm&apos;s country origins. Hence, neither perspective alone is sufficient to explain both usage and outcomes. This implies that local adaptation of OD interventions is a complex issue for managing multinational firms.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

The results indicate that MNCs with presence in countries with developing economies have significantly higher market values than MNCs that operate only in countries with advanced economies. Furthermore, the market value impact of intangible assets increases with the degree of an MNC&apos;s expansion into developing locations only; this result is consistent with the notion that internalizing markets for the cross-border transfer of intangibles leads to competitive advantages.&copy; 2001 JIBS.
