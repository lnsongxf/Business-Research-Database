[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Firms have different motives for investing abroad, most notably to exercise existing capabilities, but also to build new capabilities by accessing knowledge located abroad. Recognizing this heterogeneity helps determine whether foreign investments transfer technology to their host industries. Using host industries&apos; initial level of competition to differentiate when each of these dichotomous motives is more likely, I examine change in productivity resulting from inward FDI in US manufacturing industries for 1987 through 1991. While controlling for change in industry competition, I find that relatively uncompetitive industries experience productivity growth while competitive industries experience productivity stagnation from FDI. This differential outcome is consistent with heterogeneous investment motives.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Using data on 106 global accounts in 16 MNCs, we find support for both perspectives individually. Furthermore, evidence is presented for an interaction effect in which the effectiveness of structures for increasing information processing is conditional upon the presence of high customer dependence.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

In this model, the mediation effect of the MNC&apos;s degree of control over the subsidiary is tested and validated.
