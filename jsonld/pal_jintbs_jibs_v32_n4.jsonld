Preliminary results from an exploratory analysis of the spatial distribution of firms in financial services suggest that the introduction of a business-to-business (B2B) trading network increases the global market participation of firms from peripheral countries, but does not appear to reduce the importance of locational clusters. A set of propositions is derived that provide guidance for more detailed research on the impact of ICTs on the strategy and structure of global industries.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

This paper is based on four assumptions: (1) the Internet and e-commerce cannot exist apart from the social order; (2) attempts to regulate and tax activities on the Internet through existing territorial jurisdiction will be problematic; (3) cyberspace and e-commerce are inherently international, thus any successful governance regime will involve significant and substantial international cooperation; and (4) effective governance of cyberspace will require public-private sector cooperation, i.e., hybrid or integrative schemes combining self-regulation with government oversight and enforcement capabilities. The paper discusses the first three of these assumptions, then explores taxation in more detail as a case study that typifies the issues raised by e-commerce in a global context. Next, I develop a framework for understanding the governance of cyberspace as an evolving process involving growing formalization and an increase in the number of actors involved over time. The paper concludes with a discussion of several issues that require further research.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

In this paper we examine what firm-specific factors are associated with the propensity of pure U.S.-based Internet firms to enhance their international presence on the Internet by developing country-specific websites. Despite the assertion that all Internet firms are born global, our findings show that the pursuit of internationalization by Internet firms is related to the levels of their intangible assets and strategic activity. Two types of intangible assets&mdash;reputation and website traffic&mdash;are positively related to the degree of internationalization; so are the levels of competitive and cooperative activity, and the interaction effects between reputation and competitive and cooperative activity. These findings suggest that ideas from both resource-based theory and research on competitive dynamics can contribute to understanding the internationalization of Internet firms.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

We argue that the Internet will produce more of the same: certain forces for deagglomeration, but offsetting and possibly stronger tendencies toward agglomeration. Increasingly the economy is dependent on the transmission of complex uncodifiable messages, which require understating and trust that historically have come from face-to-face contact.
