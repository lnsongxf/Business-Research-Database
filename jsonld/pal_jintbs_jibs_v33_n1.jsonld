In the study, we compile a vector of variables that distinguish between industry-specific barriers and firm-specific capabilities to analyze Japanese investors&apos; ownership decisions in the US. Our results in general support the hypothesis that Japanese investors facing high market barriers in the target industry are more likely to choose joint ventures, while those possessing strong competitive capabilities are more likely to set up wholly-owned subsidiaries. Specifically, marketing variables are more influential than technological factors in determining the choice of partial versus full ownership. These findings, however, vary across sub samples that represent low- versus high-tech industries and consumer versus industrial products.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Isomorphic behavior was also present within a firm, as firms exhibited consistency in entry mode choices across time.

A comparison of the fit statistics between the two scaling formats on each entity (country) indicates that the attribute based format estimates a higher attitude response consistency and predictive validity by giving better predictors of global country image (evaluation) and buying frequency of products from the different countries investigated.
