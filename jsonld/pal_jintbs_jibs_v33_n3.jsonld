Using a sample of 328 Taiwanese firms in the analysis, this study found that the firms&apos; motivations had a significant impact on the choice of their investment location (developed countries vs. less developed countries), yet this impact was moderated by the capabilities that the firms possessed. The results suggest that both asset-exploitation and asset-seeking aspects of investments are predictive of the NIE firms&apos; location choice of investment.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

This question is especially timely in the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe, where cooperative activity with Western multinationals is growing rapidly, and where decades-old legacies of communism abound. In this exploratory study, we used a multiple case study methodology to examine 17 Hungarian-Western ICVs. Results show that a majority of the ICVs adopted the VPSs of the Western partner.
