In addressing these learning opportunities, we draw attention to the important distinction between relation-specific and re-deployable knowledge and the complementary relationship between them. Our analysis of 125 Japanese suppliers supports the key argument that less exclusive ties may be a superior strategy. The argument has important implications for vertical integration and the structure of buyer-supplier relations.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

An essential feature of risk-related decisions is substantial uncertainty, or inadequate information, as well as significant consequences regarding future outcomes. We argue that differences in information flows and consequences across national institutional environments affect the perceived uncertainty of decision situations. For this reason, the institutional environment in which managers reside should play a fundamental and systematic role in influencing their perceptions of risk. We test our model on managers from two environments that contrast in terms of information and consequences related to risk, a free-market economy (the U.S.) and a centrally planned economy (the Czech Republic in 1992). Our results indicate that the institutional environment does indeed play a strong and systematic role in explaining managers&apos; risk-related decisions. Thus, national environment appears to be an important contextual condition to which the propensity to take risks is sensitive.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Somewhat surprisingly, limited attention has been devoted to the role that commitment plays in international buyer-seller associations. Merging findings from the international business and transaction cost economics literature, we propose and test a model that explains how commitment develops and its impact on performance in cross-cultural interorganizational relations. A sample of 216 overseas distributor&ndash;manufacturer relationships provides the empirical setting for this research. The findings suggest that transaction specific investments by the importer and exporter opportunism affect importer commitment, and that environmental volatility and cultural sensitivity are indirectly associated with commitment through opportunism. Most important, the study reveals that an importer&apos;s commitment has a positive impact on its performance in the relationship. However, no relationship is established between environmental volatility and commitment.
