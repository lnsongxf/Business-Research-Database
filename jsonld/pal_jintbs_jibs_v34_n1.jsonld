[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Sampling in the international environment needs to satisfy the same requirements as sampling in the domestic environment, but there are additional issues to consider, such as the need to balance within-country representativeness with cross-national comparability. However, most international marketing research studies fail to provide theoretical justification for their choice of sampling approach. This is because research design theory and sampling theory have not been well integrated in the context of international research. This paper seeks to fill the gap by developing a framework for determining a sampling approach in international studies. The framework is based on an assessment of the way in which sampling affects the validity of research results, and shows how different research objectives impact upon (a) the desired sampling method and (b) the desired sample characteristics. The aim is to provide researchers with operational guidance in choosing a sampling approach that is theoretically appropriate to their particular research aims.

In broad terms, governance infrastructure represents attributes of legislation, regulation, and legal systems that condition freedom of transacting, security of property rights, and transparency of government and legal processes. Our econometric analysis uses a two-stage estimation procedure. In the first stage, the probability that a country is an FDI recipient is estimated. The results indicate that countries that fail to achieve a minimum threshold of effective governance are unlikely to receive any US FDI. Countries that receive no US FDI are typically countries that do not promote free and transparent markets, that have ineffective governments, and that often have legal systems that are not rooted in English common law. In the second stage, the analysis is restricted to those countries that did receive FDI flows. The estimated equations focus on the determinants of the amount of FDI received. Given that a country is a recipient of US FDI, governance infrastructure &ndash; including the nature of the legal system &ndash; is an important determinant of the amount received.

We delineate three pathways through which perceived brand globalness (PBG) influences the likelihood of brand purchase. Using consumer data from the U.S.A. and Korea, we find that PBG is positively related to both perceived brand quality and prestige and, through them, to purchase likelihood. The effect through perceived quality is strongest. PBG effects are weaker for more ethnocentric consumers.

Empirical results show that the fulfilment of strategic goals, and other organizational effectiveness measures of SA performance &ndash; such as overall performance satisfaction and net spillover effects &ndash; capture different underlying factors. The latter two measures display convergent validity. The results also support the discriminant validity of these two measures with respect to contractual changes and survival, but not with respect to longevity. Building on our findings, we propose an expanded definition of SA performance that considers both outcome and process performance.

This research note reports the results of a statistical power analysis of international business research published in the Journal of International Business Studies, Management International Review, the Academy of Management Journal, and the Strategic Management Journal from 1990 to 1999. The results show that, although average statistical power is high compared with other disciplines, it is sufficient only for large effect sizes (ESs). Only studies published in the Journal of International Business Studies and the Academy of Management Journal achieve average statistical power levels that are sufficient for both medium and large ESs. Still the observed likelihood of committing type II errors in international business research is very high for small ESs (92&percnt;) and high for medium ESs (45&percnt;). In addition, statistical power is not explicitly mentioned or used by international business researchers, a weakness that this note is designed to change.
