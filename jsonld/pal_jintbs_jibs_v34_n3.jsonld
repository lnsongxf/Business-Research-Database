We propose that two dimensions, the role of human resource management (RHR) and followers&apos; perception of the leader (TOP), are important contributors to firm performance as are the influences of the regional economy and firm ownership. We tested our hypotheses with a survey of 180 firms from nine cities in China. We found that both role of HRM (RHR) and follower&apos;s perception of top-level management (TOP) are important to firm performance. The study confirms that while social institutions remain powerful in a transitional economy, effective HRM is important to firm performance.

We suggest that parent&ndash;subsidiary links help to mitigate emerging market threats by reducing external dependence, and help to capitalize on emerging market opportunities by enhancing local responsiveness.We identify four dimensions (resource commitment, information flow, local responsiveness and control flexibility) to parent&ndash;subsidiary links, and examine environmental effects in moderating the contribution of these dimensions. The analysis of 196 Multi National Enterprise (MNE) subsidiaries in China shows that a parent firm&apos;s control flexibility, resource commitment and local responsiveness exert a strong and positive influences on subsidiary performance. These influences are weaker when regulatory interference is higher, but stronger when industrial opportunity is richer.

For example, it is often thought that increased inward FDI contributes to domestic capital formation, whereas increased outward FDI reduces it. We demonstrate that such generalizations are inappropriate. We develop hypotheses linking the impact of FDI to the underlying motivation for investment. These hypotheses are tested using available Canadian industry-level data. The implication of our results is that rapid growth in outward FDI, relative to inward growth, should not be considered as a negative development, and may reflect success.

Using a sample of 6465 international expansions of 665 Japanese manufacturing firms in 49 countries, we develop arguments from internationalization and bargaining power perspectives to show how Japanese firms manage policy uncertainty in host country environments through the within-country sequencing of investments. Although a distribution to manufacturing entry sequence tends to prevail in countries with low levels of policy uncertainty, as uncertainty in the policy environment increases, initial entry by distribution is increasingly likely to be eschewed in favor of an initial entry by a joint venture manufacturing plant. We suggest that this change in investment sequence occurs as firms shift from an emphasis on developing knowledge about local markets and consumers in low-hazards markets to an international expansion strategy in uncertain policy environments that places knowledge development of the policy environment at the forefront of a firm&apos;s strategy.

Using the Rokeach Value Survey, data from 1015 owner-managers of small businesses indicated convergence among values relating to group interests, but significant variation among values serving individual interests. In addition, several groups of countries were identified as culturally similar, whereas Brazil and Mexico remained culturally discrete. The results suggest that common perceptions of Latin America as a culturally homogeneous region are stereotypical and incorrect, and that divergence in the importance of values can explain differences in business phenomena across the region.

The frameworks tested are: the natural selection approach, focused on the influence of the environment; the strategic choice approach, focused on managerial action; and the contingency approach, which emphasises the &lsquo;fit&rsquo; between environmental contingencies and internal organisation. The results show that natural selection and strategic choice have a role to play, even when controlling for each other. They also support a simple approach to contingency, but not a more complex version involving interactions. Although the business and institutional environments do have a significant influence on the performance of cross-border affiliates in a transition economy, performance can be improved through strategic managerial action. In particular, leveraging local resources by developing trust between parent and affiliate, and maintaining close control and integration with the parent, are associated with enhanced performance.
