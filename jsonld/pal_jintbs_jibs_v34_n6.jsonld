[{"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "Research on international marketing channels accentuates the importance of relational norms and trust-building activities between buyers and sellers. Indeed, cultural and country differences may limit the use and effectiveness of traditional tools (such as market incentives and authoritative control) that govern the relationship between an exporting manufacturer and its foreign distributor. Consequently, exporting manufacturers need to emphasize relationships with their foreign distributors. This research finds evidence that supports both direct and indirect effects between the manufacturer&apos;s use of governance via relational norms and its competitiveness in the export market. The indirect effect results from the mediating role of trust, a finding that makes a key contribution to the understanding of the role of relational governance in cross-border relationships.

Second, we suggest that absorptive capacity should be conceptualized as being comprised of both employees&apos; ability and motivation.

The multinational corporation arises not out of the failure of markets for the buying and selling of knowledge, but out of its superior efficiency as an organizational vehicle by which to transfer this knowledge across borders. We test the claim that firms specialize in the internal transfer of tacit knowledge by empirically examining the decision to transfer the capability to manufacture new products to wholly owned subsidiaries or to other parties. The empirical results show that the less codifiable and the harder to teach is the technology, the more likely the transfer will be to wholly owned operations. This result implies that the choice of transfer mode is determined by the efficiency of the multinational corporation in transferring knowledge relative to other firms, not relative to an abstract market transaction. The notion of the firm as specializing in the transfer and recombination of knowledge is the foundation to an evolutionary theory of the multinational corporationJournal of International Business Studies (2003), 34, 516&ndash;529. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400058", "ex:volume": "34", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Knowledge of the firm and the evolutionary theory of the multinational corporation", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v34/n6/full/8400058a.html", "ex:pages": "516-529", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2003", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "B Kogut"}, {"ex:name": "U Zander"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:volume": "34", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "The significance of Bruce Kogut&apos;s and Udo Zander&apos;s article, &lsquo;Knowledge of the firm and the evolutionary theory of the multinational corporation&rsquo;", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v34/n6/full/8400061a.html", "ex:pages": "495-497", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2003", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "S Tallman"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "Kogut and Zander&apos;s 1993 JIBS article, which developed an evolutionary perspective on the multinational enterprise (MNE), has had three critical impacts on MNE research. First, it has stimulated scholars to conduct more eclectic, empirical analyses, which should include both transaction cost related parameters, and broader learning/competence related variables. Second, it has usefully argued that the rigorous study of MNE behavior does not need to reply upon the Williamsonian, behavioral assumption of opportunism. Third, it has (implicitly) suggested a new path to be followed by internalization theory scholars, in order to remain relevant to the field of international business. The transaction cost economics lens adopted in internalization theory clearly remains critical to any analysis of MNE strategy with impacts on the boundaries of the firm. In addition, the co-evolution of the MNE&apos;s governance structure and its technological competences determines present and future strategy choices. Here, both transaction cost considerations and learning effects influence strategy selection.

Understanding is difficult, however, because HRM strategies help to determine firms&apos; performance, but are in turn influenced by corporate governance, particularly insider ownership. This paper employs a structural equation modeling methodology to examine the relations between governance, HRM strategies and performance in the context of a novel dataset of Ukrainian industrial firms. It is found that insider ownership is positively associated with high-commitment HRM strategies and negatively with low-commitment, cost-cutting HRM strategies. Cost-cutting HRM strategies are in turn associated with weaker firm performance. These outcomes correspond broadly with theoretical expectations.
