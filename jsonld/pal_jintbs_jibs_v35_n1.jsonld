[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Previous internationalization studies have focused on the entry modes employed by multinational firms but have not considered the contractual heterogeneity that underlies each mode. It is important to examine these contractual details, as the firm may be able to obtain some of the benefits typically associated with one entry mode while selecting another. In the case of international mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As), a key contractual variable is whether the parties agree to a performance-contingent payout structure, which can mitigate the risk of adverse selection. In this paper, we examine the antecedents of contingent payouts in the form of earnouts and stock payments. The results indicate that firms lacking international and domestic acquisition experience turn to contingent payouts when purchasing targets in high-tech and service industries. Firms tend to avoid contingent payouts in host countries with problems with investor protection and legal enforceability.

This approach envisages the world as a grid of potential locations for value-adding activities, connected by flows of information and products. The simplified model provides a basis for testing new hypotheses on the number of firms that will exist in the global system, their locations, and their organisational boundaries. The paper provides a rigorous and formal exposition of the theories of internationalisation and the multinational enterprise.

Study 1 investigated whether Hofstede&apos;s power distance scores moderated the effect of job autonomy on job satisfaction using World Values Survey data on 33 nations. Study 2 surveyed frontline hotel employees from Canada and PRC to investigate the moderating role of power distance at the individual level. In Study 3, hotel management students from Canada and PRC were asked to play the role of a frontline employee, who had to handle a special customer request, in a scenario experiment. These studies show consistently that the cultural value of power distance moderates the effect of empowerment on job satisfaction. Moreover, willingness to accept and exercise the discretionary power allowed by management and desire to satisfy customer needs and wants are two employee conditions that are essential for the successful implementation of the empowerment approach.

How do multinational enterprises (MNEs) affect the validity of IPIs? We review the earlier debate over methods for calculating IPIs, which concluded that unit values were inferior to specification prices, although most governments produce only unit value indexes. We explore three ways in which MNEs can affect the validity of IPIs: determining the &lsquo;representative&rsquo; transfer price, excluding intrafirm transactions from the index, and choosing the &lsquo;right&rsquo; transfer price along the transportation chain. We argue that MNE activities strengthen the case for specification prices; although still uncommon, they are the stronger signal of international markets. Our empirical analysis supports this hypothesis, finding that a 10&percnt; increase in the intrafirm trade share of US imports widens the gap between specification price and unit value by 1.3&percnt;, with transfer price manipulation further increasing the gap.

The ultimate test to assess whether these MNEs are global themselves is their actual penetration level of markets across the globe, especially in the broad &lsquo;triad&rsquo; markets of NAFTA, the European Union and Asia. Yet, data on the activities of the 500 largest MNEs reveal that very few are successful globally. For 320 of the 380 firms for which geographic sales data are available, an average of 80.3&percnt; of total sales are in their home region of the triad. This means that many of the world&apos;s largest firms are not global but regionally based, in terms of breadth and depth of market coverage. Globalization, in terms of a balanced geographic distribution of sales across the triad, thus reflects a special, and rather unusual, outcome of doing international business (IB). The regional concentration of sales has important implications for various strands of mainstream IB research, as well as for the broader managerial debate on the design of optimal strategies and governance structures for MNEs.
