[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Drawing on subsidiary evolution and dynamic capabilities research, I test how development and growth of subsidiaries recently acquired in transition economies are affected by multinational enterprise (MNE) and target capabilities. These subsidiaries often lack important resources; their cross-border transfer, enhancement, and exploitation are problematic, however. Data on 170 acquisitions in Central and Eastern Europe confirmed the importance of the pre-acquisition experiences of both target and MNE for subsidiary growth, although cultural differences moderated the predicted effects notably.

Our explication highlights the critical role of innovative culture, as well as knowledge and capabilities, in this unique breed of international, entrepreneurial firm. Case studies are analyzed to better understand the early internationalization phenomenon and reveal key orientations and strategies that engender international success among these innovative firms. Case findings are then validated in a survey-based study. Despite the scarce resources typical of young firms, our findings reveal that born-global firms leverage a distinctive mix of orientations and strategies that allow them to succeed in diverse international markets. Findings have important implications for the internationalization of contemporary firms.

This study revisits the issue at multiple levels, and considers vertical and horizontal cooperation among the foreign partners, the local partner, and the venture management team. The study also examines how goal incongruence between partners and market uncertainty affect the tripartite relationships between cooperation and performance. The test results show a strong positive impact of cooperation between partners on performance as perceived both by the partners and by the venture management team. One partner&apos;s cooperation with the venture management team is perceived favorably by that party but not necessarily by the other party unless both partners share the same goal. Market uncertainty requires stronger cooperation at all levels to improve performance in EJVs.

This paper examines globalisation in terms of conflicts between markets and economic management, and suggests that the differential pace of globalisation across markets presents a number of challenges to policy makers in local, national and regional governments, and in international institutions. In examining the changing location and ownership strategies of MNEs, it shows that the increasingly sophisticated decision making of managers in MNEs is slicing the activities of firms more finely and in finding optimum locations for each closely defined activity, they are deepening the international division of labour. Ownership strategies, too, are becoming increasingly complex, leading to a control matrix that runs from wholly owned units via FDI through market relationships such as subcontracting, including joint ventures as options on subsequent decisions in a dynamic pattern. The input of lessons from economic geography is thus becoming more important in understanding the key developments in international business. The consequences of the globalisation of production and consumption represent political challenges, and reaction against these changes has led to a questioning of the effects of global capitalism as well as to its moral basis. These four issues are closely intertwined and present a formidable research agenda to which the international business research community is uniquely fitted to respond.

Buckley also asks whether the field needs a big question, and if so challenges IB scholars to discover it. Buckley and Ghauri (2004) elaborate on the third question of globalization discussed in Buckley (2002) as a possible candidate for the big question. In response, this article is written to take up Buckley&apos;s challenge and also to comment on Buckley and Ghauri&apos;s more recent work. I agree that IB needs a big question, the pursuit of which can serve to unite and energize scholars, make scientific progress, and enhance the status and prestige of the field. Toward that end, I argue that &lsquo;What determines the international success and failure of firms?&rsquo; has always served as a fundamental research question, which has permeated IB research in the past and present and is likely to propel its progress in the future. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the IB research agenda is not likely to run out of steam, because focusing on this question will leverage IB&apos;s comparative advantage and keep the field engaged in generating exciting and disciplined theories and findings in the 21st century.
