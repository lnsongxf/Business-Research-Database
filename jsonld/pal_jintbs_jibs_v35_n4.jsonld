[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Multinational enterprises (MNEs) play a pivotal role in the development of many emerging economies. In consequence, they became the focus of scholarly research by economists and policy analysts. In contrast, international business scholars have been comparatively uninterested in analysing this role of MNEs. Yet they could make important contributions to these debates. First, studies taking the individual firms as starting point would enhance understanding of the interaction between MNEs and the local environment. Second, theories and research methodologies developed in international business research could provide new insights into the dynamics of MNEs in emerging economies. The objective of this paper is to motivate more international business scholars to engage in research on positive and negative spillovers from foreign direct investment (FDI) in emerging economy societies. To advance this research agenda, scholars need to analyse the specific activities and capabilities of the firms involved, and the impact of FDI on the broader social and environmental context. For management, this agenda raises the ethical question: To what extent ought businesses to care about their local stakeholders?Journal of International Business Studies (2004) 35, 259&ndash;276. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400084", "ex:volume": "35", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Perspectives on multinational enterprises in emerging economies", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v35/n4/full/8400084a.html", "ex:pages": "259-276", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2004", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Klaus E Meyer"]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "This paper analyses the pattern of local linkages in foreign direct investment (FDI), treating such local linkages as an investment in local relationships. Using Taiwanese manufacturing firms investing abroad as the sample for our case study, we find that the local linkage intensity of a foreign subsidiary differs by FDI location, entry mode, firm size and the nature of the production network in which an investor is embedded. More local linkages will be pursued by an investor if it is in search of distinctive and inimitable resources as opposed to homogeneous and reproducible resources. Investment in local linkages always begins with the linkage that carries the lowest risk to the original business network. For manufacturing firms, the sequence of such linkages is: workers, components and parts, subcontracting and, finally, sources of R&amp;D.

Meyer (this issue) underlines the need for international business (IB) scholars to understand the impact of these investments on host developing countries. He offers a useful assessment of the literature and proposes a rich set of questions for further research. However, his research agenda can be extended and enriched in two ways. First, IB scholars must study, as they always have, causation in the opposite direction&mdash;namely, the impact of developing country context on MNE behavior and the co&ndash;evolution of these two variables over time. In doing so, they must incorporate into their models contemporary issues, such as the continued inadequacy of rules for FDI in infrastructure sectors, or the clever means by which MNEs are rewriting the global rules under which they operate in developing countries (e.g., on intellectual property rights). Second, IB scholars must pay more attention to topics that are not mainstream within the field but are of great importance to developing countries. Examples include the behavior and performance of a new generation of home-grown MNEs, the role of diaspora in homeland FDI (in countries like China and India), and the implications of global outsourcing of services.

Building on research on national, organizational, and professional cultures, we argue that the closer the domain of a social group is to the value-creating activities of an alliance, the more disruptive cultural differences between the partners&rsquo; members of that social group will be. Organizational culture differences will tend to be more disruptive than national culture differences, and differences in the professional culture most relevant to alliance value creation typically will be the most disruptive.

The relationships between three types of broad influence strategy (persuasive, assertive, and relationship based) and four dimensions of individual beliefs (cynicism, fate control, reward for application, and religiosity) were examined. Three of Project GLOBE&apos;s cultural values (in-group collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and future orientation) were selected to investigate their direct effects on the rated effectiveness of influence strategies, and their possible interaction with dimensions of individual beliefs. Results showed that different dimensions of individual social beliefs predict the perceived effectiveness of the three types of influence strategy, and that cultural values can moderate the strength of the relationship between these dimensions of individual social beliefs and the perceived effectiveness of influence strategies.
