[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Contrasting systems of corporate governance persist internationally but are subject to regulatory and firm-level institutional change. Such changes may be viewed as organisational innovations, often imported from the USA in the face of different national cultures. This paper analyses the implications of national culture for the translation of innovations, and provides case study illustrations of regulatory and firm-level governance changes experienced in Germany. These illustrations demonstrate that the diffusion of both kinds of change has been subject to substantial translation that is consistent with German national culture.

Observation of the absolute difference between target and acquirer R&amp;D intensity suggests there is no difference between foreign and domestic technology-sourcing patterns. However, a firm-level estimation of the acquirers&apos; choice of targets reveals that foreign and domestic acquirers differ with respect to the relationship between target and acquirer R&amp;D intensity. Foreign acquirers with low R&amp;D intensity choose targets with high R&amp;D intensities, which suggests technology sourcing as a motivation. Domestic acquirers prefer targets with high R&amp;D intensities the higher their own R&amp;D intensity, which suggests a synergy story.

We respond with development and testing of a framework using partisan and opportunistic political business cycle (PBC) theory to predict the investment risk perceived by investors holding sovereign bonds during 19 presidential elections in 12 developing countries from 1994 to 2000. Consistent with our framework, we find that bondholders perceive higher (lower) investment risk in the form of higher (lower) credit spreads on their sovereign bonds as right-wing (left-wing) political incumbents appear more likely to be replaced by left-wing (right-wing) challengers. For international business research, our findings illustrate the promise of PBC theory in explaining the election-period behavior of sovereign bondholders and, perhaps, other investors who also &lsquo;vote&rsquo; in developing country elections and can substantially influence the price and availability of capital there. For developing country investors and states, our findings highlight the financial effects of democracy in action, and underscore the importance of state communication with investors during election periods.

The article also laid an important theoretical foundation for research into international entrepreneurship (IE), where younger and well-established companies use their entrepreneurial activities to create value as they internationalize their operations.
