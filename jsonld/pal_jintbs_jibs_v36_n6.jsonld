[{"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "This paper examines the impact of political risk in Canada on the volatility of stock returns. Our results suggest that political news associated with the possible separation of Quebec from Canada plays an important role in the volatility of stock returns. However, our evidence indicates that investors do not require a risk premium, supporting the idea that political risk is diversifiable. We also show that stock return volatility varies with the degree of a firm&apos;s exposure to political risk, namely, the structure of assets and the extent of foreign involvement, which indicates that firms most exposed to political risk bear the burden of diversification.

More specifically, it proposes hypotheses putting into evidence the stock market valuation of different reasons for JV sell-offs (refocusing of a business, debt reduction, and JV failure). Abnormal returns (ARs) from JV sell-offs are estimated for a sample of 151 European selling partners. First, the results show that stock market reactions observed around the date of announcement are significant and positive. This finding is consistent with that of finance research literature on stock market reactions to ordinary asset sales. This leads us to discount the idea that stock markets place a specific valuation on JV sell-offs. Second, the results indicate that the reasons for JV sell-offs are a determinant of ARs of selling partners.

The present research seeks to understand the organizational paths leading to such desirable outcomes as greater learning, increased innovation and improved performance. Using a model tested with data collected through a survey of managers in subsidiaries of multinational firms, we find dual, independent paths to improved performance &ndash; one through networking and inter-unit learning and the other through subsidiary autonomy and innovation. A particular feature of these findings is that they can be shown to be robust after controlling for a wide range of environmental pressures and firm and industry factors. However, in the absence of environmental controls the dual path finding is rejected. These conflicting findings support the imperative to test models that include a diverse range of environmental pressures so that the true effects of organizational factors on learning, innovation and performance can be identified.

This responsiveness is expected to occur in part as the result of upward influence from local subsidiary managers, who represent the local culture and shift relevant priorities accordingly. Issue-selling &ndash; defined as directing top management&apos;s attention to particular issues and helping them understand such issues &ndash; is one important way in which subsidiary managers pursue upward influence. The purpose of this paper is to help multinational organizations better facilitate and exploit potentially valuable input from local subsidiary managers. To do so, we propose an acculturated view of issue-selling. More specifically, we argue that subsidiary managers socialized by different national cultures vary: (1) in the extent to which their intention to sell issues is influenced by various contextual cues; and (2) in their choice of selling strategies. These theoretical differences suggest that local subsidiary managers from different cultures will differ in the way they approach issue-selling and, in turn, in the way they influence the strategy-making process. The discussion traces the implications of this line of reasoning for future research on the influence of local subsidiary managers and, more generally, for research on the cultural embeddedness of the strategy process.

Specifically, three lines of theorising have been advanced: (1) organisational economics theories; (2) resource-based theories; and (3) institutional theories. For each of these theories, we discuss how they contribute to the understanding of key issues, such as entry strategies of foreign investors, restructuring strategies of local incumbents, and entry and growth strategies of entrepreneurs. On this basis, we assess how CEE research has influenced the overall trajectories of theory development. CEE research has in particular highlighted the importance of contextual influences such as institutions. Thus, scholars have aimed at incorporating institutions into theories (such as organisational economics theories and resource based theories) and advancing an institution-based view of business strategy as a complementary perspective. We outline how future research in CEE and other emerging economies may advance this research agenda further.

We focus on a specific organizational mechanism, R&amp;D co-practice, which we believe is an important facilitator of knowledge integration in multinationals with global innovation strategies. In our formulation, R&amp;D co-practice (joint technical activities between units) increases levels of absorptive capacity and social capital among participating units, thus increasing the likelihood that they will share knowledge at future time periods. We find strong support for this hypothesis through an empirical analysis of &lsquo;reverse&rsquo; (subsidiary to headquarters) knowledge integration in two sectors &ndash; automotive and pharmaceuticals &ndash; over a 21-year period.

We also predicted that Chinese would be less cooperative with foreigners than with fellow Chinese when they were in a foreign territory, whereas Australians would be equally cooperative with members of both groups. Data from two cross-national experiments provided general support for these predictions. Moreover, the results of Study 2 showed that the nation effects on cooperative decision-making were mediated by individual cultural orientation on vertical and horizontal individualism.
