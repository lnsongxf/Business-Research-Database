[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "In spite of the increasing popularity of international joint ventures, managers express a high level of dissatisfaction with them. This paper argues that overemphasis on the outcome has resulted in a neglect of the social processes underlying the outcome. The paper elaborates upon the rationale for a cooperative approach towards interorganizational collaborative relationships based on trust, and discusses it in the context of joint ventures. This is then applied towards understanding multinational ownership preferences and tolerance for joint ventures. It is argued that trust-centered logic is largely consistent with approaches that emphasize the issue of ownership, and deepens and enriches the insights provided by the latter. A shift in focus from ownership to relational dynamics is encouraged.

Our results show that a higher Chinese tendency to avoid conflict is explained by higher Chinese expectations that direct conflict will hurt the relationship with the other party, and by greater concern for the other party among Chinese. It is not, however, explained by differences in the expected career costs/benefits of good/bad relations with others. Also, Chinese are more sensitive to hierarchy than Americans, so that avoiding is heightened more for Chinese than for Americans when the other party is of higher status. Qualitative results suggest that Chinese&ndash;American differences in time frames may also explain differences in avoiding. Implications for businesses and management are suggested.

We contrast our one-stage model of career progress, in which early career experiences can predict long-term career progress, with the well-accepted two-stage model of career progress, in which performance at the end of the first stage determines long-term career progress. In addition, we compare the predictions of our early screening model with those of the tournament model. Our early screening model is as good as or better than the other models in isolation or combination. Overall, we provide preliminary evidence that career progress in Japanese organizations during the high growth period of the 1970s and 1980s was perhaps more complex than shown by the two-stage career progress model that has enjoyed widespread acceptance.

The conceptualization focuses on the decentralization of control, ownership restructuring, and industrial policy as the primary institutional changes to implement market liberalization in China.

Using a large-scale data set including 23,577 firms between 1992 and 1996, the study examines how market liberalization affects the profitability and productivity of Chinese firms and the relationship between ownership change and the performance of state-owned enterprises.
