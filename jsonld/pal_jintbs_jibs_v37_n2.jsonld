[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "We investigate the effects of trade liberalization on profitability and financial leverage using Canadian data arising from implementation of the Canada&ndash;US Free Trade Agreement. We find that falling domestic tariffs are associated with declining profits, especially for import-competing firms, while falling foreign tariffs are associated with increasing profits, especially for export-oriented firms. Also, import tariff reductions tend to increase leverage while export tariff reductions tend to decrease leverage.

This study uses a structural equation modeling approach to investigate relationships among leader&ndash;member exchange (LMX), delegation, paternalism, and job satisfaction in Turkish business organizations. Results from a survey study of N&equals;185 full-time employees from Turkish companies support the relationship of LMX to delegation and job satisfaction. However, the effect of LMX on job satisfaction is mediated by paternalism, an emic cultural dimension. Results suggest that delegation might not be an effective management tool in the Middle Eastern context.

The authors study the drivers and consequences of organizational changes in an emerging economy, China. The results of a firm-level survey show that organizational changes in technical vs administrative areas are differentially driven by firms&apos; motivation to change (past performance), opportunity to change (firm location and market orientation), and capability to change (firm ownership, managers&apos; change attitude, and leader charisma). Furthermore, technical and administrative changes affect firm performance through distinct paths. Technical changes have a direct, positive impact on performance, whereas administrative changes enhance firm performance indirectly through technical changes, and the effect of administrative changes on performance is strengthened by the presence of a participative culture.

On average, expansion in transition economies is associated with significant positive wealth effects. Results show that value creation is most significantly associated with expansion through less risky entry modes into host countries that are in the more advanced stages of market liberalization and structural reform. Sample firms with lower profitability also experience significantly higher abnormal returns, while significant value creation documented for firms entering transition economies in 1989, 1990, and 1992 suggests first-mover advantages.
