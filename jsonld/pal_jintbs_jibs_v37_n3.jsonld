[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Ireland has been very successful in attracting foreign MNEs in high-technology sectors. Although these sectors exhibit faster growth than the traditional low-technology sectors populated primarily by indigenous firms, the high-technology sectors are also more volatile. We use portfolio theory to show that Ireland&apos;s FDI strategy has led to a more diversified manufacturing sector that exhibits higher growth without a commensurate increase in volatility and risk.

Results show that both groups of managers prefer stocks with high return on equity, large turnover, and low return variability, and that they also exhibit differential investment behavior. Domestic managers also favor firms that pay large dividends, have low financial distress and high growth potential, whereas foreign managers prefer to invest in corporations that are globally well known. The demand for globally visible stocks by foreign managers is especially strong when their fund mandate is to diversify globally or across regions, and is weakened when their stock holdings are concentrated mainly in a specific local market. The results also show no difference in the stock preferences of American-, European- and Asian-based funds. In general, our overall evidence suggests that the differential mandates of fund managers and hence the geographic allocations of their fund investments influence their stock preferences, but not the geographic location of the managers.

Different types of ownership affect firms, and this in turn will influence the internationalisation strategy adopted. Using a sample of Spanish SMEs, our results show that internationalisation is negatively related to family ownership and positively related to corporate ownership. We have also observed that the presence of a corporate blockholder in family firms encourages internationalisation. These results support the idea that ownership type influences the decision to internationalise.

To the extent that language design is the product of deliberate choice, we suggest that headquarters functional language is determined by the MNC&apos;s international strategy, organizational structure, and transnationality, while subunit functional language is designed in accordance with organizational form, strategic role, and expatriate deployment. Aligning language systems with organizational strategy and dynamics improves MNC communication, coordination, and knowledge-sharing.

In this paper, we examine the sources behind the global diversification shareholder value loss in a contingent claims framework. This postulates that the risk-reduction effects of global diversification should decrease the value of shareholder equity (call option), whereas they should increase bondholder value. Consequently, near-all equity globally diversified firms should not experience a shareholder value loss. Consistent with the risk-reduction effects of global diversification, using cross-border acquisitions data we find three major results. First, shareholder value loss to global diversification is directly related to firms&apos; leverage. Second, near-all equity firms do not trade at a discount. Third, the use of book value debt in estimating excess value produces a downward bias in globally diversified firms. Our findings confirm that increased foreign involvement increases bondholder value while it decreases shareholder value. This is consistent with the contingent claims view predicting that global diversification has a positive impact on bondholders&apos; wealth while it has a negative influence on shareholder value (i.e., global diversification discount). Overall, our results reveal that global diversification does not destroy firm value.

We conduct empirical tests using cross-sectional data at the market, portfolio and firm level from nine emerging markets (EMs) to determine whether exchange risk is priced under alternative model specifications and exchange rate measures. Our results support the hypothesis of a significant unconditional exchange risk premium in emerging stock markets, differently from most unconditional tests for major developed markets. However, there is indication that at the aggregate market level the significance of the exchange risk factor is subsumed by local market risk. With firm-level data, although the importance of local market is confirmed for most countries, some measure of exchange rate risk remains significant for most countries. This suggests that a careful model specification is necessary for EMs when testing for the pricing of exchange risk in order to avoid a potential spurious significance of such factor because of a missing local risk or vice versa.
