[{"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "Wealthy families, as opposed to small public shareholders, characterize ownership of the large corporate sectors of many countries around the world. This paper shows that greater oligarchic family control over large corporations is associated with worse social economic outcomes. It also correlates with more bureaucratic and more interventionist governments, and less developed financial markets. Further tests show that red tape, price controls, and the lack of shareholder rights protection are the paramount factors relating to the extent of family control of large firms. These results are broadly consistent with Olson and others who argue that economically entrenched wealthy insiders pursue rent-seeking activities to preserve the status quo, and that this increases corruption, and impedes growth.

The three types of firm experiences are international, country and ongoing business. The results show that firm experience within the ongoing business, and the experience from multiple past business deals in various countries, develop institutional knowledge, whereas experience from multiple past business deals in a specific country does not. The theoretical contribution of this paper is that it establishes a link between different kinds of experience and managerial cognition in terms of institutional knowledge. In addition, it emphasises that firms develop institutional knowledge from multiple diverse country experiences, and experience in the specific ongoing business rather than experiences at the level of the country.

A total of 176 American and Chinese executives participated in simulated international business (buyer&ndash;seller) negotiations. The negotiations were videotaped, and the participants completed questionnaires. Each participant was also asked to review his/her videotaped negotiation, rate the tension felt on a videotape review form, and briefly describe the antecedents of the tension felt. The data collected were then analyzed using first a structural equations approach and then a more exploratory content analysis. Both Chinese and American executives felt tension during the negotiations. For the Chinese, greater levels of tension led to an increased likelihood of agreement, but also led to lower levels of interpersonal attraction and in turn lower trust for their American counterparts. For the Americans, tension felt decreased marginally the likelihood of an agreement, did not affect interpersonal attraction, but did have a direct negative effect on trust. A series of other cultural differences are also reported. The measure of tension felt developed in the study appears to be useful methodologically, theoretically, and practically.

Based on the argument that legitimacy and competition are two important forces in foreign market entry decisions, we hypothesize that an MNC&apos;s market entry decisions are influenced by its own prior entry and prior exit decisions and those of other MNCs. We examine this general proposition at four levels of analysis: the host country, global industry (an industry that spans host countries), local industry (an industry that is separately defined within each host country), and parent firm level. Our analysis of a panel data of over 4000 market entry decisions that were made by Japanese MNCs shows that an MNC&apos;s market entry decision has a stronger inverted U-shaped relationship with the prior entry and exit decisions of other MNCs at the local industry level than the prior entry and exit decisions of other MNCs at the host country and global industry levels. We also find that both the prior entry and prior exit decisions of an MNC have a marginal influence on its own subsequent market entry decisions at the parent firm level.

The variables under study for both models are cointegrated, and long-run relationships exist between the variables.
