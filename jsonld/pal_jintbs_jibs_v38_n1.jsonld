[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "This paper critiques an earlier contribution by Rugman and Verbeke (2004); and it does so by considering the global distribution of foreign direct investment (FDI). It also adds several new dimensions to the regionalisation/globalisation debate, noticeably by (i) the incorporation of inward multinational enterprise (MNE) activity, (ii) evaluating changes in the geography of FDI between 1990 and 2003, and (iii) the introduction of the concept of revealed investment comparative advantage (RICA) of countries and regions. While broadly supporting the findings of Rugman and Verbeke, our paper shows that much of the explanation for the regional concentration of FDI and MNE activity reflects that of the gross domestic product (GDP) and trade of the countries concerned, rather than any distinctive strategy on the part of investing firms.

The data come from a survey of IJVs in the Hungarian context, where learning and knowledge acquisition from the foreign parent is thought to be particularly critical. Adaptation mechanisms, such as capacity to learn, articulated goals, and structural mechanisms, such as the provision of training, technology and managerial assistance by foreign parents, all were positively associated with the degree to which IJVs reported acquiring knowledge from their foreign parents. We also found limited support for the belief that cultural conflicts can impede knowledge acquisition, but only for two-party joint ventures with 50/50 equity arrangements. We also looked at the relationship between knowledge acquisition and different dimensions for evaluating IJV performance. The relationship between knowledge acquisition and performance was significant for all indicators of performance, through knowledge acquisition from the foreign parent and the organizational characteristics hypothesized to enhance IJV knowledge acquisition affected assessments of some dimensions of performance more than others. Our findings contribute to advancing knowledge about the relationship between organizational characteristics and organizational knowledge acquisition in IJVs, as well as the relationships between knowledge acquisition and different dimensions of IJV performance.

Process models of internationalization propose that firms start with low commitment activities and gradually increase their commitments to international markets. However, recent empirical evidence has shown that many firms make high international commitments from the start. Our findings suggest that domestic resources and competitive action propensity affect early international commitments indirectly through domestic mindsets. A domestic mindset refers to the knowledge structures of the top management team prior to starting international activities, based on their managerial experience and learning in domestic markets. Our results suggest that knowledge and learning gained in domestic markets through diverse resource and competitive activities may be crucial in early international commitments.

R&amp;D decentralisation avoids having to adapt centrally developed innovations to local markets, being able to use the specific know-how of the subsidiary. In addition R&amp;D subsidiaries can be used to source locally available external know-how. At the same time, however, R&amp;D internationalisation intensifies the spillover of valuable know-how to competitors located in the foreign markets. The analysis demonstrates the importance of the intensity of competition in the local market in determining the size of both the benefits and costs of R&amp;D decentralisation. It shows that when R&amp;D is undertaken abroad in association with production, the local knowledge base is not unequivocally a pulling factor attracting R&amp;D investments by foreign MNEs, depending on the level of local competition. The paper also shows that efficiency in reverse intra-company technology transfers is a critical factor in benefiting from technology sourcing. The results thus illustrate the complementarity of efficient internal and external knowledge management systems. In addition the model suggests that, with a fall in the cost of intra-company technology transfers, relative market size loses importance as a locational factor for R&amp;D decentralisation.

This commentary reviews the contribution by Lyles and Salk, as reflected in the subsequent literature. The setting of the study in Hungary 1993 raises the challenging question of how this particular context may have influenced the research outcomes. I argue that the national context of radical environmental change and the organisational context of joint ventures incorporating privatised state firms crucially influence processes of organisational learning. The importance of context suggests modifying future research agendas in international business, and in organisational learning in particular. I thus suggest that future research should incorporate context more explicitly to establish boundary conditions for theory, and to develop managerially relevant insights.
