We advocate careful data collection and develop solid theory based on the rich empirical information. The difficulty in the process is the deciphering of causality, and that is where historical studies play a significant role. Historical documents shed light on motivations and exogenous incidents. Historical studies and large-scale data analyses can complement each other in revealing causality. While path dependence constraints causal inferences using cross-sectional data, historical studies can identify differences and similarities in the paths of events across geography and time. This advantage is particularly attractive in understanding the relationship between institutions and business behaviour, which lies inside the proper domain of IB studies.

To answer this question, we use contingency theory and examine how the effects of customer and competitor orientations on performance are moderated by different environmental conditions. Our results from the global hotel industry indicate that a customer orientation works better in economically developed markets, as well as in markets with good local business conditions, greater resource availability, and demanding customers. In contrast, a competitor orientation is more effective in markets that are economically developing, have poor local business conditions, and face resource scarcity.

Our investigation builds on the idea from real options theory that international operations offer switching options to multinational corporations, yet we also emphasize different sources of coordination costs that can mitigate the benefits of operational flexibility. The findings from Tobit models accounting for self-selection underscore the importance of unobserved heterogeneity in the relationships between international investments and risk levels. Consistent with the coordination costs surrounding international operations, we find that the relationship between multinationality and downside risk is curvilinear: risk first declines and then increases as a firm&apos;s portfolio of international investments becomes extensive. In addition, downside risk is an increasing function of the average cultural distance between a firm&apos;s home base and the host countries in which its foreign subsidiaries operate.

From a resource-based perspective, it evaluates the impact of cross-national knowledge transfer on firm innovative performance.

As hypothesized, it was found that at (1) low and moderate levels of international knowledge content, a firm&apos;s strategy to transfer international knowledge improves its innovative performance, and at (2) higher levels of international knowledge content, there are diminishing marginal returns to transferring knowledge from overseas.

Drawing from the resource-based view, we propose that manufacturers need to develop stronger local market competence while simultaneously minimizing the costs of distributor opportunism in order to compete successfully in the export market. Cultural distance and other barriers, however, may hinder the development of local market competence for the manufacturer while contributing to the occurrence of distributor opportunism. In order to overcome these barriers, we examine the impact of three alternative forms of manufacturer governance &ndash; trust, knowledge sharing, and contract-based relationship &ndash; in export channels. Findings suggest that all three governance mechanisms contribute to enhancing the manufacturer&apos;s competence to exploit local market opportunity. However, of the three, trust seems to be the only effective way to curtail distributor opportunism.

Data from 275 British firms show that INVs have lower unconditional survival probabilities than other modes of foreign market entry. Our analyses also show that differences in survival probabilities disappear when the firms&rsquo; competitive strategies are considered.

This paper reviews the literature on global mindset and clarifies some of the conceptual confusion surrounding the construct. We identify common themes across writers, suggesting that the majority of studies fall into one of three research perspectives: cultural, strategic, and multidimensional. We also identify two constructs from the social sciences &ndash; cosmopolitanism and cognitive complexity &ndash; that underlie the perspectives found in the literature. We then use these two constructs to develop an integrative theoretical framework of global mindset. We then provide a critical assessment of the field of global mindset and suggest directions for future theoretical and empirical research.
