[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "In this article, we present a springboard perspective to describe the internationalization of emerging market multinational corporations (EM MNEs). EM MNEs use international expansion as a springboard to acquire strategic resources and reduce their institutional and market constraints at home. In so doing, they overcome their latecomer disadvantage in the global stage via a series of aggressive, risk-taking measures by aggressively acquiring or buying critical assets from mature MNEs to compensate for their competitive weaknesses. We discuss unique traits that characterize the international expansion of EM MNEs, and the unique motivations that steer them toward internationalization. We further delineate peculiar strategies and activities undertaken by these firms in pursuit of international expansion, as well as internal and external forces that might compel or facilitate their propulsion into the global scene. We finally explain the risks and remedies associated with this international &lsquo;springboarding&rsquo; strategy and highlight major issues meriting further investigation.

However, in emerging economies, with their institutional environment context characterized by low resource munificence and continuous economic liberalization, a theoretical extension of the current perspective is needed. This paper introduces new parameters by focusing on specific ownership advantages and strategic actions that firms have to develop in response to the institutional characteristics of the emerging economies when they decide to pursue outward FDI. The focus here is on international venturing that requires a firm to engage in activities for new business creation in a foreign country rather than simply seek to distribute a product in another nation. It is shown empirically that the relationship between firm-specific ownership advantages and international venturing is moderated by the degree of home industry competition and export intensity. In addition, such a relationship is mediated by the intensity of corporate entrepreneurial transformation in the form of innovation, new business creation, and strategic renewal.

It has also been shown that NIE firms are often controlled by founding families who make key strategic decisions, and that they rely heavily on network linkages when developing their FDI strategies. What is less clear, however, is how the corporate governance factors in NIEs, the risk preferences of the main shareholder constituencies, and the network-based business culture affect the decision to undertake FDI in emerging markets. This paper explores the entry mode and location choices of firms from an Asian NIE (Taiwan) in an emerging market (the People&apos;s Republic of China). It shows that the choice of equity stake in an affiliate depends upon the extent of family and institutional share ownerships in the parent company. High-commitment entry is found to be positively associated with the affiliate being located in areas with strong economic, cultural and historic links with the parent company. Furthermore, the entry mode and location decisions appear to be interrelated, with the parent&apos;s equity stake in the affiliate depending inter alia upon the location within China, and the favoured location depending inter alia upon the equity stake.

The building of these capabilities is of particular interest, as firms from emerging markets may not necessarily possess the monopolistic advantages commonly referred to in IB literature, which allow a firm to succeed in international markets. Using lagged cross-sectional regression models on a sample of 794 Indian firms, we found that firms draw on the international experience of their parental and foreign networks to build such capabilities. Findings also indicate that network scope is beneficial for increasing exposure to international markets only in the case of networks that are either small or medium sized. Additionally, we found that firms lacking market power in their home market benefit through foreign partnerships when internationalizing operations.

We argue that home-based social networks play a mediating role in the relationship between inward and outward internationalization and firm performance. The mediating mechanism is attributed to three information benefits of social networks: (1) knowledge of foreign market opportunities; (2) advice and experiential learning; and (3) referral trust and solidarity. Using survey data from SMEs in the largest emerging economy of China, we found some support for this mediating role of social networks in the form of guanxi. The results imply that international business managers should consider social networks as an efficient means of helping internationally oriented SMEs to go international more rapidly and profitably.

We also suggest that MNCs are likely to take a higher ownership stake in response to strong internal pressure to sustain their internal legitimacy at the corporate level of their institutional environment. We also propose that MNCs are more likely to exchange ownership for legitimacy in local industries than in host countries, and in local markets with a high level of political instability than in those with a low level of political instability. These propositions are generally supported by our analysis of 4451 subsidiaries established by 898 Japanese MNCs that operated in 39 countries across 52 industries (two-digit SIC) between 1988 and 1999.

These measures incorporate the structure and function of the network, and may provide a more meaningful approach to globalization than current measures based on trade volumes. We find that, in terms of participation and influence in the network, global trade is hierarchical, with a core&ndash;periphery structure at higher levels of trade, though integration of smaller countries into the network increased considerably over the 1990s. The network is strongly &lsquo;balkanized&rsquo; according to geography of trading partners, but not as strongly by income or legal origin. Using these new measures we find that a country&apos;s position in the network has substantial implications for economic growth.
