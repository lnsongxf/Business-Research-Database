[{"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "In this study, we bridge two streams of foreign direct investment literature, specifically studies on establishment mode choice (i.e., the choice between an acquisition and a greenfield establishment) and studies on entry mode choice (i.e., the choice between a wholly owned outlet and a subsidiary with shared ownership). We arrive at a conceptual synthesis for an examination of the effects of the same predictors on the dual entry-establishment mode choice made in the context of a single foreign investment. We demonstrate that a parent firm&apos;s technological intensity, international strategy and experience determine both establishment and entry mode choices. Moreover, we apply Williamson&apos;s new institutional economics to investigate the influence of institution building on multinational enterprises&apos; dual investment choice. In the context of transition economies, we test empirically the possible moderating effect of a host country&apos;s institutional environment. We conclude that the degree of the host country&apos;s institutional advancement moderates the effect of both technological intensity and international strategy on the establishment and entry mode choice.

Using a sample of 192 IJVs in an emerging market, this study finds general support for our theoretical model. Our research validates that countering opportunism involves a system-wide effort that integrates economic and social mandates, unifies ex ante and ex post mechanisms, controls both egoistic and non-egoistic motivations, and combines organizational-level and individual-level forces. For partners from individualist cultures, economic ordering forces (contractual and structural) are stronger than social ordering forces (relational and justice) in relation to opportunism resistance, whereas for partners from a collectivistic culture, social ordering forces are relatively stronger than economic ordering forces for this end.

We argue that a positive relationship between R&amp;D intensity and IJV performance is more likely to occur if these appropriability hazard can be mitigated. Results using a sample of manufacturing IJVs in China provide support for these arguments. We find that R&amp;D intensity is positively related to performance in export market-focused IJVs but not in local market-focused IJVs. In addition, using a configuration approach, we find that R&amp;D intensity is positively related to performance in IJVs that have an export market focus and in which the multinational companies (MNCs) have a majority ownership, but not in other market focus-ownership structure configurations. These findings contribute to our knowledge of R&amp;D activities of MNCs&rsquo; overseas subsidiaries.

It is assumed under the standardization approach that the globalization process will absorb different national cultures into a global commercial culture, such that standardized advertising should be preferred. The current research argues that the dichotomization approach may have oversimplified the way consumers read and interpret ad images. We postulate that consumers in a transitional economy apply a variety of reading approaches, including different cultural interpretive strategies and self-referencing, to absorb global images into their cultural and consumption schemas. This is commonly referred to as glocalization. We developed a typology of modern women images in Chinese magazine advertising, potential interpretive strategies, and self-referencing responses in this research. Results of a content analysis and a reader response study support our postulations. Implications are discussed.

We carry out different kinds of analysis on a sample of 103 firms belonging to a medium-sized country that has recently achieved the status of developed country. The results reveal that the importance that home country firm managers give to diverse location factors depends to a certain extent on the stage that each group of host countries has reached in the IDP. In line with prior research, we find that firm managers consider mainly the group of factors associated with strategic asset-seeking when deciding to locate their investments in the group of more developed countries (European Union). In contrast, our results show that when these firm managers choose the group of less developed countries (Latin America), social and cultural factors play a more determinant role, thus suggesting the importance of historical and cultural ties between the home and host countries.

Building on the resource-based view of the firm, we propose a framework that consists of resource determinants in two categories: knowledge-based and property-based resources. Empirical results obtained from a sample of publicly held US manufacturing companies show that knowledge-based resources generate faster and longer-lasting influences on international growth than property-based resources. Specifically, resources related to technological and marketing knowledge, and property-based resources related to organizational slack and internally generated profits, are found to be significant driving forces behind growth in multinationality. This study not only advances our understanding of the antecedents of multinational expansion, but also provides implications and avenues for future research.

Despite the heated policy debates and theoretical controversies, empirical studies of the consequences for innovative activity are scant. This paper contributes to the debate by providing an empirical analysis of the effects of patent strength on different aspects of innovative activity, namely firm-level research and development (R&amp;D), domestic patenting, and foreign patenting. The analysis employs an updated index of patent rights. The results show the complexity of evaluating the effects of patent reform on innovative activity, since the effects vary nonlinearly (depending on the initial level of patent strength) and vary by a country&apos;s level of economic development. Overall, for developing economies, patent strength negatively affects domestic patent filings and insignificantly affects R&amp;D and foreign patent filings. For developed economies, patent strength positively affects R&amp;D and domestic patent filings, and negatively affects foreign patent filings, after some critical level of patent protection is reached.
