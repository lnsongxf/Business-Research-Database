[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "We use an interdisciplinary approach to investigate multinational banks&rsquo; foreign activities. We bridge core concepts from the stages theory of internationalization to internalization theory, to extend the literature on the defensive expansion hypothesis. Unlike the primarily aggregate levels of analysis employed in previous research on multinational banking, we utilize a firm-level analysis of the internationalization experiences of 21 Japanese banks in the period 1980&ndash;1998. We find that banks undertake foreign direct investment to secure internalization benefits by following their existing clients, and to achieve economies of scale in the application of their intangible assets in international markets. The magnitude of these relationships, however, is contingent upon the level of a bank&apos;s experience in the host countries. Consistent with predictions from internationalization theory, we find that the motivations for international expansion can change over time.

However, there is scant research on the impact of firm-specific factors on the likelihood, timing, and mode-of-entry decisions in these economies. We provide evidence on three aspects of the strategic decisions by US firms to invest in transition economies. First, we find that firms entering the region have greater advertising intensity and sales growth than industry peers that did not enter the region, suggesting that market-seeking considerations motivate expansion. Second, we find that earlier entry is undertaken by firms with fewer industry competitors and higher sales growth, suggesting that the desire to secure market share ahead of competitors motivates entry timing. Finally, we investigate the choice of entry mode into the region, and find that firms from concentrated industries are more likely to enter the region with high-equity commitment, consistent with market-seeking motives. We also find that firms incorporate the degree of progress with market-oriented reforms in making decisions concerning entry timing and mode.

Results from a survey of over 500 export managers indicate that current-period performance improvement (in terms of performance achievement, export intensity, and performance satisfaction in the current year) is influenced by the firm&apos;s commitment to exporting. Further, the authors found that while performance satisfaction feeds performance improvement in the following year, both the previous year&apos;s export intensity and export performance achievement produce a negative impact on current-period performance improvement. More importantly, the level of development in the export market facilitates marketing strategy adaptation in the short term, as does export intensity in the previous year. However, satisfaction with previous-year performance negatively influences the degree of distribution adaptation. Implications for international business researchers and practitioners are also discussed.

Results confirm that location influences new venture internationalization, and firm characteristics impact the nature of the relationship.

When retesting the data using different schema we find that the original results are far from robust, with a significant share of firms attaining bi-regional or global status. Further longitudinal analysis shows that large firms increasingly are extending their sales beyond the home region.
