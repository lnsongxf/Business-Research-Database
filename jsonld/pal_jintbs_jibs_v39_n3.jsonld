[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Although international joint ventures (IJVs) may mature over time and develop competitive viability, they maintain some risk of instability owing to their shared ownership. Such instability can ultimately lead to their internalization by one of the partners. In this study, we consider factors that influence (1) whether IJVs evolve toward becoming a wholly owned subsidiary, and (2) which parent (foreign or local) gains ownership of the venture. We use a sample of Hungarian joint ventures, and find that only when there is both a power imbalance between the parents and high levels of conflict is the likelihood that the joint venture converts to a wholly owned subsidiary enhanced. The extent to which the joint venture has learned from the foreign parent indirectly determines which parent gains full ownership. Extensive knowledge transfer to a joint venture in a transitioning economy combined with high levels of conflict increases the likelihood of the foreign parent gaining full ownership. In contrast, when there is extensive knowledge transfer and low conflict between the parents, the local parent is more likely to internalize the venture. Our results suggest that the relationship between partner power and outcomes in ventures is more complex than originally believed, and is contingent upon the level of conflict between the parents of the IJV.

This argument contains two hidden assumptions: (1) the additional costs of acquisitions in culturally distant countries are the same for all MNEs; and (2) such acquisitions have no benefits over their greenfield counterparts. In this paper we relax these two assumptions by arguing that an MNE&apos;s preference for greenfields in culturally distant countries depends on its international and host-country experience, and on the level of autonomy it plans to grant the focal subsidiary. Analyzing 171 wholly owned greenfield investments and full acquisitions made by Dutch MNEs in 35 countries, we find that these MNEs prefer to enter culturally distant countries through greenfields, but that this preference is lower when they have little international experience, or plan to grant the focal subsidiary considerable autonomy in marketing.

Regardless of the choice of greenfield investment vs acquisition, they can control full equity (i.e., wholly owned subsidiaries) or share ownership with local partners (i.e., joint ventures). Depending on the stake taken in the targets, therefore, international acquisitions can be classified into two major categories &ndash; full or partial &ndash; although this distinction is missing in most previous studies. In this paper, I propose that the motives for acquisitions (vs greenfield investments) are specific to whether entries are made through full or partial ownership, in that full acquisitions are driven mostly by capability procurements, whereas partial acquisitions are motivated by other strategic considerations. By splitting a sample of Japanese investments in the US into two sub-regimes, the study has found that the decision on joint ventures vs wholly owned subsidiaries dictates the determinants that shape the choice between greenfield and acquisitive entries. There is also evidence that Japanese investors self-select the decision on full or partial ownership to justify the strategy that they have chosen to enter the US. These findings offer new insights into the role of ownership structures in shaping the choice of entry strategies.

We also find some support that impersonal institutions govern market transactions: as uncertainty increases, managers craft more customized contracts. Surprisingly, there is no association between contracts and asset specificity. These results hold for both local and foreign firms.
