[{"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "As competition for human capital intensifies, understanding how employees perceive their fit in a company can assist companies in harnessing the knowledge and skills needed to achieve competitive advantage. Building on the person&ndash;organization fit theoretical framework, we suggest that individual employee perceptions of globalization-related career opportunities represent a fit between individual and company capabilities and values. We find both similarities and differences between the relationships of individual- and company-level globalization capabilities and attitudes towards women (an important capability source) and globalization-related career perceptions within samples of 96 Iranian and 210 US employees.

We examined the cultural effects with composite measures taken from the work of Hofstede and Schwartz. The effects of the existence of anti-age and anti-gender discrimination employment legislation in an MNC home country were also assessed to control for institutional factors. Logit analysis shows that MNC home-country culture and institutional environment can have a strong impact on the use of discriminatory criteria by MNCs in host countries, at least those lacking protective legislation. Specifically, MNCs based in countries that have existing and effective age and gender discrimination laws, and have more individualist and less masculine cultures, are less likely to engage in at least overt gender-based and age-based discrimination.

We then review four diverse areas of substantive research: (1) antidumping as entry barriers; (2) competing in and out of India; (3) growing the firm in China; and (4) governing the corporation in emerging economies.

Drawing on prior research in international business and strategy, we identify two sets of factors that influence the absorption and utilization of knowledge in multinational corporation subsidiaries: (a) the range of external and internal knowledge sources available; and (b) the subsidiary capabilities associated with knowledge absorption and utilization. We find that knowledge absorbed from the host country is useful to subsidiary innovation. We also find support for the role of subsidiary capabilities: both sourcing capability and combinative capability have a significant influence on the scale and quality of innovation.

Our cross-level analyses, using hierarchical linear modeling, control for a number of individual characteristics (i.e., age, education, gender, and social class). Results support our hypotheses that managers&apos; traditional gender role attitudes relate positively to nation-level uncertainty avoidance and power distance. Moreover, the results support our predictions that gender egalitarian normative institutions, degree of regulation, and degree of educational development are negatively related to managers&apos; traditional gender role attitudes. However, results reject our hypotheses regarding nation-level religiosity, assertiveness, and masculinity, not showing the proposed relationship with managers&apos; traditional gender role attitudes.

Thus far there have been no empirically tested export performance models that have reflected the core tenets of the relational, or behavioral, paradigm. Drawing from relational exchange theory, a model that includes reciprocal perceptions that relate to both past and future exchanges is developed. This model is tested with dyadic data from 125 West&ndash;East (Australia&ndash;Thailand) exporter&ndash;importer partnerships, reflecting the increasing importance of West&ndash;East exchange relationships. Results support the theory&apos;s contention that commitment (to future exchanges) is associated with export performance, and is itself driven by a reciprocal cycle of each partner&apos;s perception of the other&apos;s commitment, relationship-specific investments and dependence. This cycle of commitment is in turn influenced by each partner&apos;s trust in the other (from past exchanges), with different types of trust linked to different types of commitment. Trust and commitment are then found to be related both to interpersonal factors (i.e., effective communication, cultural sensitivity and likeability of partner) and to firm factors (reputation and competencies of partner).
