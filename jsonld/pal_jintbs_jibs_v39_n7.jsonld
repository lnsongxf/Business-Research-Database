[{"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "Do global marketing efforts, for example, those using television as a medium, impact on the values and life satisfaction of people, and, if so, is the process similar or different in various regions of the world? We empirically examine the relationship between television viewing, core values (i.e., religiosity and materialism), and perceived well-being factors (e.g., perceived socioeconomic status and relative life satisfaction). Data collected from the Western developed nations (e.g., United States and New Zealand) and several culturally homogeneous regions, including New Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and the Far and Southeast, support the prevalence of diverse consumptionscapes with multiple global consumer cultures, rather than a single global culture. Globalization and advances in technology have not created global norms and homogenized our identities, but behavioral patterns and regional identities that are surprisingly durable. Specifically, materialism was shown to influence perceived socioeconomic status both positively (for two regions) and negatively (for two regions), and relative life satisfaction (except in New Europe), while perceived socioeconomic status had a positive influence on relative life satisfaction (except in New Europe and Latin America). The quantity of television viewing was positively shown to influence materialism, directly in some cases, as well as through perceived realism in others, providing limited support for the cultivation theory effect. Finally, religiosity was shown to play a countervailing role in negatively influencing materialism only in Latin American and Middle Eastern countries, and a positive influence on relative life satisfaction only in Latin America. The rationale behind the differences across regions was also explored. The overall results can perhaps be best explained by &ldquo;postmodern&rdquo; epistemologies, in which people worldwide are increasingly implicated, and in which new traditions are constantly being invented.

The present study extends this literature by investigating the effect of other forms of corporate ownership on a firm&rsquo;s equity risk (measured as the volatility of a company&rsquo;s stock returns) and stock returns in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC) &ndash; an important emerging economy that is rich in various forms of corporate ownership. We find that the various types of corporate ownership appear to have important but different impacts on equity risk and returns. In particular, companies with more state ownership tend to have higher stock volatility and lower stock returns; in contrast, companies with more legal-person ownership tend to have lower stock volatility and higher stock returns. Foreign and managerial ownership are found to have little effect on firms&rsquo; equity risk and returns. These findings support the predictions of agency theory &ndash; for example, that state ownership increases agency conflicts in companies because bureaucrats and state agencies do not have the same economic incentives to maximize the value of firms. We believe that our study contributes to the international business literature on investment strategy and risk assessment in developing markets such as China, and as a result our findings could have important implications for international investors.

Risk-adjusted return is shown to exert greater effect on flows into international equity funds than raw return. International equity funds from fund families offering a greater number of investment objectives also receive higher flows. On the other hand, international equity fund investors do not appear to be sensitive to expenses or exchange rates.

This study explores whether knowledge gaps tend to increase or decrease with time when operating in the foreign market, and it discusses which learning components narrow &ndash; or widen &ndash; the perceived knowledge gap. A theoretical model is developed based on the internationalization process view and the more recent organizational learning perspective, including such concepts as overconfidence and absorptive capacity. The theoretical model is tested on a set of primary data covering Danish and Swedish firms and their foreign market operations. The results suggest a more subtle relationship between experience and perceived knowledge gaps than the &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; relationship portrayed by the internationalization process view &ndash; a relationship in which absorptive capacity and, in particular, overconfidence play important roles.

Consistent with theories of financial intermediation, I find that firms located in a country with a bank-oriented financial system are perceived as posing a lower credit risk and correspondingly are assigned higher credit ratings than otherwise similar firms in a market-oriented setting. Even after considering elements of a country&apos;s legal infrastructure that relate to creditor protection and insolvency proceedings, the financial system remains an important determinant of credit-rating assignment. The results are robust to the inclusion of several firm-level controls, including financial performance, industry, ownership concentration, political connections, and the ease with which the firm&apos;s assets can be monitored.

Next, a Delphi study of the most prolific authors in these journals over the same time period was conducted to delineate a future research agenda in international business.

Empirically, we analyzed a longitudinal dataset consisting of 3555 IJVs in China from 1999 to 2003, and found strong support for both sets of hypotheses. Product innovation in IJVs is positively associated with initial conditions such as balanced ownership structure, state partnership, and project size; IJVs are more innovative when they operate in an industry with a faster pace of innovation or a higher level of foreign direct investment legitimization, and where they are located in a region with greater agglomerated innovative activities.
