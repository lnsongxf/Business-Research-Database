[{"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "Although knowledge flows create value, the market often does not price them accordingly. We examine &ldquo;unintended&rdquo; knowledge flows that result from the cross-border movement of inventors (i.e., flows that result from the move, but do not go to the hiring firm). We find that the inventor&apos;s new country gains from her arrival above and beyond the knowledge flow benefits enjoyed by the firm that recruited her (National Learning by Immigration). Furthermore, the firm that lost the inventor also gains by receiving increased knowledge flows from that individual&apos;s new country and firm (Firm Learning from the Diaspora). Surprisingly, the latter effect is only twice as strong when the mover moves within the same multinational firm, suggesting that knowledge flows between inventors do not necessarily follow organizational boundaries, thus creating opportunities for public policy and firm strategy.

Imports from low-wage countries are found to exert a strong competitive effect, which raises the likelihood of exit of firms in industries where intra-industry trade is relatively low. Similar to import competition, growing penetration by multinational firms in the industry has an equally strong competitive impact on the likelihood of exit of domestic firms. However, Belgian firms that offshore activities to non-European Union countries are able to substantially improve their chances of survival. This also holds for subsidiaries of multinational enterprises operating in Belgium. Unlike domestic firms, the likelihood of exit of subsidiaries of multinational enterprises is found to be less sensitive to domestic market conditions in the host country.

Given the centrality of management capability for corporate and national competitive performance, this represents an important area of enquiry. Utilising telephone interview data from the human resource development manager and a line manager in 482 domestic and multinational organisations in four European countries, patterns of management development (MD) are found to differ according to country and, to a lesser extent, by international strategy. However, a significantly greater amount of organisational performance is explained by internal MD strategies adopted by the organisations concerned and the credence accorded these by line managers.

We found that having a host-country mentor had a significant positive effect on the expatriate&apos;s organizational knowledge, organizational knowledge-sharing, job performance, promotability, and perceptions of teamwork. Having a home-country mentor had a significant positive effect only on organizational knowledge, job performance, and promotability. Surprisingly, our results revealed that having a home-country mentor had a significant but negative effect on the expatriate&apos;s organization identification and job satisfaction. Contrary to the literature, neither type of mentoring had a significant effect on job tension. Implications for practice as well as future research are detailed.

Remarkably, flexible teams composed of fallible evaluators can outperform what is usually thought of as an &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; decision. Our main result supports the claims advanced in recent empirical studies. Structural flexibility can help MNEs achieve high levels of performance, even in conditions of turbulence.
