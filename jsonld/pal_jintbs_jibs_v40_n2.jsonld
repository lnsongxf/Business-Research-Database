[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "The trend of increasing internationalization of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is noteworthy, because such firms typically have far fewer financial and tangible resources than large multinational enterprises. As a result, international business is often more challenging for smaller firms. In this study we investigate the widespread internationalization of SMEs, and specific factors that support their superior performance abroad. We uncover a collection of intangible capabilities that are especially salient to these firms and their growing international involvement. We identify international business competence (IBC) as an intangible, overarching firm resource that engenders superior international performance in the international SME. Through case studies and a comprehensive literature review, we identify four dimensions of IBC. We devise and assess a model that links IBC to SME international performance. Results suggest that international orientation, international marketing skills, international innovativeness, and international market orientation are all significant dimensions of IBC, and that IBC is instrumental in SME international performance. We discuss resultant findings and offer managerial implications.

Further, we examine the effects of key moderators (e.g., country-of-origin (COO), firm&apos;s international experience, client&apos;s buying experience) on client-perceived performance and value. The results generally support the hypotheses that client-perceived performance is impacted by a firm&apos;s internal resources (e.g., technical skills, customer orientation, innovation). In addition, this relationship is contingent upon the COO effect, while client-perceived value is moderated by the client&apos;s buying experience. The findings can guide practitioners as to the key drivers of client-perceived value, and under what conditions this value is maximized.

This paper, by commenting on and critiquing their approach, seeks to shift the theoretical center of gravity from a NC-centric paradigm to a culture-centric, constructivist one, and from a top-down, bottom-up view to a flatter, glocalized one. Implications are provided which suggest that research should address cultural processes of patterning and production, as well as cultural forms, such as global communities and global culture (GC), which share with or even capture the spotlight from NC as a focus for studying and developing IB cultural theory.

We use mainly the Hofstede measure of cultural dimensions to measure cultural distance, but also examine alternative proxies. The positive relationship of performance to cultural distance persists after controlling for several deal-specific variables and country-level fixed effects, and is robust to alternative specifications of long-term performance. Cash and friendly acquisitions tend to perform better in the long run. There is also some evidence of synergies when acquirers are from stronger economies relative to the targets.

An event history analysis of 792 international marketing alliance formations initiated by 317 firms in the US pharmaceutical industry is employed to test the hypotheses. The findings of two different hazard rate models reveal significant complex effects of density and cross-border alliance experience on the propensity to engage in new international marketing alliances.

In addition, our results suggest that CEOs with a greater proportion of pay tied to firm long-term performance are more inclined to choose full-control entry modes over shared-control modes.

Alternatively, should foreign firms follow conventional wisdom and actively build managerial ties with government officials and business community to enhance their performance? This study develops and tests an interactive perspective that highlights the moderating effects of managerial ties on competitive position&ndash;performance relationships. The results indicate that though both differentiation and low-cost positions foster foreign firm profitability, the benefit of a differentiation position is conditional on political and business ties in different directions: political ties impede and business ties strengthen the positive effect of a differentiation position on foreign firms&apos; profitability. Moreover, foreign firms benefit from their use of business ties, but their profitability suffers when they rely increasingly on the heavy use of political ties.
