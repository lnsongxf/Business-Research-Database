[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "This research investigates hypotheses about differences between Chinese and American managers in the configuration of trusting relationships within their professional networks. Consistent with hypotheses about Chinese familial collectivism, an egocentric network survey found that affect- and cognition-based trust were more intertwined for Chinese than for American managers. In addition, the effect of economic exchange on affect-based trust was more positive for Chinese than for Americans, whereas the effect of friendship was more positive for Americans than for Chinese. Finally, the extent to which a given relationship was highly embedded in ties to third parties increased cognition-based trust for Chinese but not for Americans. Implications for cultural research and international business practices are discussed.

Using transaction cost economics and institutional theory we identify a number of factors that may help to explain the likelihood of foreign firms&rsquo; converting their joint venture with a local firm into a wholly owned subsidiary. We formulate a number of hypotheses and test them against data collected through a questionnaire survey of managers representing foreign subsidiaries in the People&apos;s Republic of China (PRC) that are run either as international joint ventures (IJVs) or as wholly owned foreign subsidiaries (WFOEs) that have recently been converted from IJVs into a WFOE. The paper contributes to research by showing that transaction-cost-based thinking is useful for explaining not only the initial choice of ownership mode when entering a new market, but also the potential subsequent changes of this ownership mode. By combining transaction cost theory with arguments from institutional theory, the study identifies a number of factors that contribute to explaining post-entry changes of foreign firms&rsquo; ownership forms in the PRC, and provides empirical evidence of this phenomenon.

We develop a combined real options and game-theoretic model of modal choice by incorporating a range of factors drawn from the dynamic capabilities theory and transaction cost or organizational economics. The factors scrutinized in the model include the parties&apos; absorptive capacities, frictions in knowledge and asset markets and associated incentive problems, cost of switching from one mode to another and cost associated with power jockeying. The model uses simulation to examine how these factors interact to influence the choice of mode. The results identify a number of conditions for one factor to dominate another, and help to reconcile different theories that have made contradicting predictions with regard to the effects of such factors as uncertainty and capability divergence on the optimal choice of mode.

We investigate whether the market&apos;s valuation of foreign earnings is a function of the firm&apos;s geographic segment disclosures. Specifically, we examine the effects of an increase in the number of geographic segments disclosed and the inclusion of earnings measures in geographic segment disclosures following the adoption of SFAS 131. We find strong evidence that our proxies for increased disclosure are positively associated with the valuation of foreign earnings. Our results are robust to a number of sensitivity analyses.

To assess this issue, prior studies have tended to focus primarily on exchange rate volatility. Although multinational firms face other types of uncertainty as well, including those stemming from their domestic operating environment, the role of such uncertainty for firms&apos; flexibility needs has not been previously considered. In this study we compare the influence of both domestic economic uncertainty and exchange rate uncertainty on the real option value of international investments of Korean firms over 16 years of varying uncertainty. We find evidence that an international investment network characterized by greater breadth and lower depth is associated with higher firm value under domestic economic uncertainty. Exchange rate uncertainty, however, was not found to play a role in firms&apos; need for flexibility. The results suggest that firms are able to hedge exchange rate uncertainty by using mechanisms such as forward contracts or derivatives, thus potentially reducing the impact of this type of uncertainty on their operations.
