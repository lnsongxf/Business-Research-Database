[{"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "This paper investigates the link between privatization and emerging market sovereign bond spreads. We conjecture that the way privatization is implemented may help to build a favorable market sentiment by gradually building investor confidence, which should then lead to a lower required compensation for policy risk. Controlling for other determinants of sovereign bond spreads, we find that privatization proceeds do not affect spreads, while privatization progress and share issues reduce spreads.

Face-to-face social interactions form a communication channel particularly conducive to the transfer of tacit, non-codified knowledge. But intensive social interaction also provides opportunities for social construction of knowledge in a learning dialogue. The first explanation (sender&ndash;receiver) makes us expect social interaction to moderate positively the effects of the factors giving rise to knowledge flows in the first place, such as differences in capabilities between MNE subsidiaries. The second perspective (social learning) also grants an independent effect to social interaction as a main factor stimulating intra-MNE knowledge flows. We formulate hypotheses based on both perspectives, and test these on data from 169 MNE subsidiaries. Our findings show a considerable main effect of social interaction on all intra-MNE knowledge flows, confirming the expectations based on the social learning model. Interaction effects, based on the predictions of the sender&ndash;receiver model, are only partly confirmed. These findings suggest that future research should devote more attention to the social constitution of MNE knowledge.

Yet conceptualization and operationalization of dynamic capabilities in marketing function have not been attempted, and empirical evidence substantiating the effect of dynamic capabilities is scarce. This research develops a conceptualization of marketing dynamic capabilities (MDCs), investigates their development in international joint ventures (IJVs), and explores their effect on IJVs&apos; performance and competitive advantage. Using a dyadic dataset collected from top managers of IJVs in China, as well as objective performance data collected separately, the study found empirical support for the effect of MDCs on IJVs&apos; competitive advantage and performance. In addition, MDCs are found to be influenced by IJV resource magnitude, resource complementarity, organizational culture, and organizational structure. The theoretical implications of our findings and future research directions are also discussed.

They are also claimed to develop deeper, more extensive &ldquo;connections&rdquo; or relationships with outside stakeholders. Both behaviors may increase the viability of a business intended to support an owning family and its later generations. Such social linkages, we believe, may compensate for the lack of capital, product and labor institutional infrastructures in dynamic emerging economies. This survey study of a most challenging emerging-market sector, namely Korean high-technology businesses, argues three major points. (1) Relationships of community and connection will be more common in FBs than in non-FBs. (2) These relationships will enhance performance in emerging-market high-technology sectors, which, because of their competitive, complex, and ever-changing nature, rely on significant expert knowledge and social capital within and outside the organizational community. (3) The performance of FBs will benefit more from these community and connection relationships than the performance of non-FBs, because in these personally intimate settings employees and external partners will be especially likely to return the generosity of a visibly active owning family, or to penalize its selfishness. Significant empirical support was found for most of these hypotheses.

The focus on venture capital offers researchers the opportunity to view an industry that comes from a common root, with strong and consistent traditions, in which to examine how the differing institutional settings impact on behaviors in different markets, and how the institutions themselves may change in these settings. We also focus on emerging economies, since such economies offer a natural laboratory to study the impact of institutional change. Specifically, this paper employs an institutional theory perspective to examine venture capital in two regions of the world that form institutional clusters of countries &ndash; Latin America and Asia. It is found that the venture capital industry exhibits a strong consistency across many dimensions; yet institutions in these two distinct settings result in significant differences in industry practice. Therefore this research is able to contribute to both empirical and theoretical understanding of emerging economies, institutions in those environments, and venture capital.
