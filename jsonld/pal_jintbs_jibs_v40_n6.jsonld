[{"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "Combining international business research with the knowledge-based view, this paper examines factors affecting the export orientation and export performance of high-technology Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in an emerging economy. Using a unique, hand-collected dataset of 711 SMEs from Zhongguancun Science Park in China, it argues that export orientation and performance depend not only on the development of capabilities through R&#38;D and technology transfer, but also on entrepreneurial characteristics, such as the founder&apos;s international background and global networks. It is also shown that both export orientation and performance are positively associated with the presence of a &ldquo;returnee&rdquo; entrepreneur.

Thus our findings provide evidence that developing a global model of subordinate ethics is possible, and should be based upon multiple criteria and multilevel variables.

We draw on research related to the unique characteristics of services in trade and commerce, and more recent analyses of the transnational unbundling and spatial dispersion of business processes. We move beyond a simple assessment of the cost sensitivity or relative sophistication of offshoring services and develop a typology emphasizing the degree to which offshoring services activities are interactive, repetitive, or innovative. We suggest that the location of offshoring projects will depend on the particular mix of these attributes, and test this assertion using a data set of 595 export-oriented offshore services projects initiated from 2002 to 2005 by US and UK company parents in 45 developed and developing countries. We find that offshore location choices greatly depend on these services characteristics, and in sometimes surprising ways, and draw implications from our findings for international business theory, policy, and practice.

It uses survey data from the international Offshoring Research Network project to estimate the impact of managerial intentionality, past experience, and environmental factors on the probability of offshoring innovation projects. The results show that the emerging shortage of highly skilled science and engineering talent in the US and, more generally, the need to access qualified personnel are important explanatory factors for offshoring innovation decisions. Moreover, contrary to drivers of many other functions, labor arbitrage is less important than other forms of cost savings. The paper concludes with a discussion of the changing dynamics underlying offshoring of innovation activities, suggesting that companies are entering a global race for talent.

It is alleged that high and increasing corporate debt ratios were partly to blame. This claim is overstated: only South Korea and arguably Thailand had leverage ratios significantly above the G7 range, and only South Korea had an income-gearing ratio higher than the G7. Although the reliance on short-term debt was high, there was no drastic change in the maturity structure of debt before the crash. However, conventional factors are relatively more successful in explaining leverage for firms that were less closely connected to the relationship-based financing system. Our paper links to ongoing research on investor protection, cronyism, connections between business and government, and business groups. It ends by commenting on the 2008 financial crisis, currently engulfing the world, and highlights some similarities and paradoxes.

In doing so, we have attempted to locate the topic within the international business research tradition, as well as suggest challenges and opportunities that the phenomenon offers to theoretical and empirical research in the field. We examine the interplay of costs, knowledge, and innovation in the evolution of ATS offshoring from modest beginnings to its current stature as an accepted business practice. We suggest that understanding the continuing evolution of ATS offshoring requires researchers to take into account not only the business imperative of cost-saving, but also a more complex set of underlying factors and potential outcomes. We argue that the rapid growth of ATS offshoring has brought about an accumulation of resources, including financial flows, knowledge, infrastructure and human capital to create new platforms for knowledge creation and innovation. Low costs may characterize the initial conditions for offshoring, but they also provide the basis for up-market moves as firms increasingly pursue innovation-based strategies. We introduce the papers in the Special Issue as integral elements in our discussion, contributing new ideas that stimulated our thinking and, hopefully, will do the same for others seeking to understand this emerging area of globalization and international managerial practice.
