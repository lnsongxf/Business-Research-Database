[{"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "The extent of ownership in foreign market entry is an important topic in the entry mode literature. Yet the determinants of the share of ownership sought in cross-border acquisitions (CBAs) have not received much research attention. Drawing on multiple theoretical explanations, we develop and test hypotheses on factors influencing the share of equity sought by foreign firms in CBAs. Findings based on a sample of CBAs by US firms show that the share of equity sought is influenced by many factors, including the cost of valuing local firm assets, difficulty in integrating local firm managers in culturally distant countries, the cost of separating desired assets from the rest of the local firm, and the cost of resource commitment under exogenous uncertainty.", "ex:volume": "40", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Determinants of the share of equity sought in cross-border acquisitions", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v40/n8/full/jibs2008103a.html", "ex:pages": "1277-1297", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2009", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Murali DR Chari", "Kiyoung Chang"]}, {"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "Do headquarters influence the subsidiaries&apos; arrangements of vocational training in foreign countries?

First, using three-level hierarchical linear modeling, differences in mean levels of commitment were investigated. We examined the effects of individualism&ndash;collectivism and power distance values and practices (Hofstede, GLOBE) while controlling for study and industry effects. The findings showed that affective commitment (across 48 countries), continuance commitment (31 countries) and normative commitment (30 countries) were influenced by country-level individualism and power distance. Greater collectivism was associated with higher normative commitment, and greater power distance was associated with higher continuance and normative commitment. Economic variables were found to exert a strong influence on affective and normative commitment means. Second, relationships between affective commitment and turnover intentions (across 26 countries) were found to be somewhat stronger in individualistic settings, whereas the normative commitment&ndash;turnover intentions relationships (across 10 countries) were stronger in collectivistic settings. Overall, absolute cross-cultural differences in all analyses were relatively small compared with differences due to study and industry effects, but country-level predictors accounted for substantive proportions of the variance between countries.

The mergers and acquisitions announcements data come from the Thomson SDC Platinum database. We employ event study methodology to explore the impact of the announcements on the value of acquiring firms. The results show that, on average, cross-border expansions of EMMs through acquisitions do not create value, but point to value destruction for more than half of the transactions analyzed. To explore the factors influencing the direction and magnitude of market reaction, we analyze a cross-sectional sample of firms. While we find that target size, ownership structure of the target (private vs public), and structure of the bidder (diversified vs non-diversified) positively affect the bidder value, high-tech nature of the bidder and pursuit of targets in related industries negatively affect the bidder value.

For innovative firms eager to capitalize on their technological advances, an IPO represents a springboard for a rapid international expansion of sales.

We build on international entrepreneurship and dynamic capabilities perspectives and examine interrelationships between R&#38;D, exporting and growth of newly listed firms in the UK, Germany, Italy and France. Using panel data for 1110 IPOs during the period 1985&ndash;2004, we found that R&#38;D intensity is an important antecedent factor for internationalization of sales. Both R&#38;D and export intensities have a positive effect on the sales growth of newly listed firms. However, R&#38;D intensity is path dependent, and is determined by levels of accumulated intangible assets and debt. In terms of time dynamics, the growth of IPO firms is at its highest level just after the float, whereas export intensity increases as IPO firms mature.

We offer a model that postulates that cultural distance relates negatively to international acquisition performance because it taxes integration capabilities during international acquisitions, but that cultural distance also elevates the positive association of integration capabilities and international acquisition performance because it provides more learning opportunities that can only be exploited with strong integration capabilities. Empirical tests with a sample of international acquisitions by 118 US multinational companies provide support for the proposed model. On one hand, we find that cultural distance impedes understandability of key capabilities that need to be transferred, and constrains communication between acquirers and their acquired units, bringing about a negative indirect effect on acquisition performance. On the other hand, we find that cultural distance enriches acquisitions by enhancing the positive effects of understandability and communication on acquisition performance. Acquirers that can overcome the impeding effects of cultural distance on understanding key capabilities and effective communication appear to reap significant performance gains. Our study provides initial support for a double-edged sword effect of cultural differences on acquisition performance, and illustrates the importance of integration capabilities.", "ex:volume": "40", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "The double-edged sword of cultural distance in international acquisitions", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v40/n8/full/jibs200925a.html", "ex:pages": "1298-1316", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2009", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Taco H Reus", "Bruce T Lamont"]}, {"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "Localization in the corporate setting is the extent to which expatriate managers are replaced by local employees originally held by expatriate managers.
