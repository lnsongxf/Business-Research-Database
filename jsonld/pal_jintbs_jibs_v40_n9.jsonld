OLI and internalization models do recognize that foreign market entry requires the bundling of MNE and complementary local assets, which they call location or country-specific advantages, but implicitly assume that those assets are freely accessible to MNEs. In contrast to both of these MNE-centric views, I explicitly consider the transactional characteristics of complementary local assets and model foreign market entry as the optimal assignment of equity between their owners and MNEs. By looking at the relative efficiency of the different markets in which MNE and complementary local assets are traded, and at how these two categories of assets match, I am able to predict whether equity will be held by MNEs or by local firms, or shared between them, and whether MNEs will enter through greenfields, brownfields, or acquisitions. The bundling model I propose has interesting implications for the evolution of the MNE footprint in host countries, and for the reasons behind the emergence of Dragon MNEs.", "ex:volume": "40", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Down with MNE-centric theories!

In this paper we assess both the opportunism concept and existing alternatives such as trust within the context of IB research, especially work on multinational enterprise (MNE) governance. Case analyses of nine global MNEs illustrate an alternative to the opportunism assumption that captures more fully the mechanisms underlying failed commitments inside the MNE. As a substitute for the often-criticized assumption of opportunism, we propose the envelope concept of bounded reliability (BRel), an assumption that represents more accurately and more completely the reasons for failed commitments, without invalidating the other critical assumption in conventional TCE (and internalization theory) thinking, namely the widely accepted envelope concept of bounded rationality (BRat). Bounded reliability as an envelope concept includes two main components, within the context of global MNE management: opportunism as intentional deceit, and benevolent preference reversal. The implications for IB research of adopting the bounded reliability concept are far reaching, as this concept may increase the legitimacy of comparative institutional analysis in the social sciences.", "ex:volume": "40", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "The end of the opportunism vs trust debate: Bounded reliability as a new envelope concept in research on MNE governance", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v40/n9/full/jibs200944a.html", "ex:pages": "1471-1495", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2009", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Alain Verbeke", "Nathan S Greidanus"]}, {"ex:issue": "9", "ex:abstract": "This paper reviews the progress of the research agenda initiated by The Future of the Multinational Enterprise (1976).

This centrality notwithstanding, the fact is that internalization coheres with lower-powered incentives and carries an implicit drawback, namely, higher realized production costs. With the emergence and deployment of information and communication technology (ICT), modern MNEs are reshaping their transnational governance to address this cost. The modern MNE uses ICT to mitigate transaction costs, and evolves more to arm&apos;s length exchange to incentivize lower production costs. A testable prediction is that MNEs in industries more susceptible to and employing more ICT will exhibit a reduced propensity for transnational integration. We examine this hypothesis using available data from 1982 to 1997 for US MNEs across all manufacturing sectors. Regression results and robustness tests are strongly congruent with the prediction. This study, a first to explore empirically the role of ICT in the evolution of transnational exchange, suggests that MNE theory, until now founded primarily on transaction cost economics and a cross-border control theory of value capture, is more likely to keep pace with developments in MNE practice by opening up to incentive theories of exchange governance and a cross-border coordination theory of value creation.", "ex:volume": "40", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Information technology and transnational integration: Theory and evidence on the evolution of the modern multinational enterprise", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v40/n9/full/jibs200955a.html", "ex:pages": "1496-1514", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2009", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Subramanian Rangan", "Metin Sengul"]}, {"ex:issue": "9", "ex:abstract": "In countries with secure property rights, corporate transparency improves investment efficiency and increases growth by alleviating information asymmetry.

In contrast, we find no such evidence for industrial diversification. We find evidence of both financial and real effects driving such a value enhancement from global diversification. Furthermore, we find that the valuation benefits from global diversification are higher if the firm diversifies into countries with creditor rights that are stronger than those of the United States. Our results are also robust to controlling for the firm&apos;s endogenous choice to diversify across countries or across industries.
