One strategy is to complete the acquisition sequentially rather than as a one-time deal. In contrast to firms in developed economies that enjoy relatively easy access to information, emerging-market firms face differential access to information on target firms, owing to institutional weaknesses and constraints in those markets. Sequential acquisitions are conceptualized as a real-option-based strategy, whereby the sequential acquirer resolves valuation uncertainty through information gathering and learning after making a toehold purchase. The value of a sequential acquisition strategy increases for firms that are at an information disadvantage. Statistical analysis, based on 272 completed acquisitions of Chinese listed firms between 1995 and 2003, shows that the sequential method is more likely to be chosen over a single-transaction mode when the acquirer is a private firm, or when the acquirer is diversifying into a new business area. Thus we offer a new way of viewing real option strategies in emerging economies, by treating sequential acquisitions as information and learning mechanisms as opposed to tools for hedging.", "ex:volume": "41", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "A real options perspective on sequential acquisitions in China", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v41/n1/full/jibs200916a.html", "ex:pages": "166-174", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2010", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Dean Xu", "Changhui Zhou", "Phillip H Phan"]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "This paper examines the boundaries of real options logic, with an application to joint ventures (JVs).

We theorize that macroeconomic and institutional variables generate exogenous uncertainty whereas, by contrast, cultural distance and choices pertaining to corporate scope and product or process development activities involve endogenous sources of uncertainty that investors can both assess and act upon without having to &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo;.

At the firm level trade is the principal source of exposure to exchange rate movements, and exchange exposure can be moderated by a range of hedging techniques. In this paper we ask two questions. First, do firms in open economies bear higher levels of exchange exposure than those in more closed economies? Second, is a strong corporate governance environment &ndash; one in which managers are incentivised to maximise shareholder value by hedging &ndash; associated with reduced firm-level exchange exposure? Using a sample of 3788 firms from 23 developed countries for the period 1984&ndash;2003, we show that the more open the economy, the more exposed are its firms to exchange rate movements, and this relation holds after controlling for firm size, industry and several financial variables. We also find a strong inverse relation between a firm&apos;s exchange exposure and the extent of creditor protection in the country in which it is based. This is consistent with managers acting to reduce the likelihood of financial distress in countries where bankruptcy costs are high, and it underlines the importance of institutional incentives in encouraging value-enhancing risk management activities.", "ex:volume": "41", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Openness, hedging incentives and foreign exchange exposure: A firm-level multi-country study", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v41/n1/full/jibs200932a.html", "ex:pages": "105-122", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2010", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Elaine Hutson", "Simon Stevenson"]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Among firms listed in Western Europe and East Asia, when creditor protection is strong, the controlling shareholder trades off retaining control in bad states through pyramiding against retaining the upside in good states via leverage.

The findings demonstrate that home-country and industry effects are more important to domestic firms than to multinationals. However, home-country influences are important even for firms with high degrees of multinationality. The evidence suggests that multinationals profit from industry-grounded opportunities to distribute activities across the countries in which they operate, but there are tradeoffs associated with internationalization. Multinationals may suffer from less protection afforded by the home-country environment and greater industry-level competition, but gain a broader scope for deploying idiosyncratic, firm-specific advantages through mechanisms enhanced by home-country experience.
