Additionally, we study how past experience with completed acquisition deals moderates the effects of institutional differences. We focus on a relatively new context &ndash; the pre-completion stage of acquisition processes. We test our hypotheses using data from 2389 announced cross-border acquisition deals in the international business service industry (1981&ndash;2001). We find that differences in national formal and informal institutions explain part of the variation in the likelihood that an announced cross-border acquisition deal will be completed, as well as the duration of the deal-making. In addition, organizational learning moderates the effects of institutional distance: past experience with completed cross-border acquisition deals increases the likelihood of a subsequent deal completion in institutionally closer environments, but shortens the deal duration in institutionally distant environments.", "ex:volume": "41", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Cross-border acquisition abandonment and completion: The effect of institutional differences and organizational learning in the international business service industry, 1981&ndash;2001", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v41/n2/full/jibs200910a.html", "ex:pages": "223-245", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2010", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Desislava Dikova"}, {"ex:name": "Padma Rao Sahib"}, {"ex:name": "Arjen van Witteloostuijn"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "In recent years, venture capital firms have increasingly turned to foreign countries in search of investment opportunities. The cross-border expansion of venture capital firms presents an interesting case of internationalization, because they are at variance with both conventional portfolio and direct investment models. Given the specific nature of venture capital investing, a new theoretical perspective is needed to understand foreign venture capital investments. This paper contributes to international business research by examining the features of the institutional environment that influence venture capital firms&rsquo; foreign market entry decisions, and how their effect changes as firms acquire experience. We report results on 216 American venture capital firms potentially investing in 95 countries during the 1990&ndash;2002 period. We find that venture capital firms invest in host countries characterized by technological, legal, financial, and political institutions that create innovative opportunities, protect investors&rsquo; rights, facilitate exit, and guarantee regulatory stability, respectively. We also find that as firms gain more international experience, they are more likely to overcome constraints related to these institutions.", "ex:volume": "41", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Institutions and the internationalization of US venture capital firms", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v41/n2/full/jibs200935a.html", "ex:pages": "185-205", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2010", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Isin Guler"}, {"ex:name": "Mauro F Guill&eacute;n"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "We examine how institutional configurations, not single institutions, provide companies with institutional capital. Building on the varieties-of-capitalism approach, it is argued that competitive advantage in high-tech industries with radical innovation may be supported by combinations of certain institutional conditions: lax employment protection, weak collective bargaining coverage, extensive university training, little occupational training, and a large stock market. Furthermore, multinational enterprises engage in &ldquo;institutional arbitrage&rdquo;: they allocate their activities so as to benefit from available institutional capital. These hypotheses are tested on country-level data for 19 OECD economies in the period 1990 to 2003. A fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis yields several interesting findings. A high share of university graduates and a large stock market are complementary institutions leading to strong export performance in high-tech. Employment protection is neither conducive nor harmful to export performance in high-tech. A high volume of cross-border mergers and acquisitions, as a form of institutional arbitrage leading to knowledge flows, acts as a functional equivalent to institutions that support knowledge production in the home economy.

We study how differences in country-level governance affect the underpricing of initial public offerings (IPOs). Examining 4462 IPOs across 29 countries from 2000 to 2004, we find the surprising result that underpricing is higher in countries with corporate governance that strengthens the position of investors relative to insiders. We conjecture that when countries give outsiders more influence, IPO issuers underprice more to generate excess demand for the offer, which in turn leads to greater ownership dispersion and reduces outsiders&rsquo; incentives to monitor the behavior of corporate insiders. In other words, underpricing is a cost that insiders pay to maintain control in countries with legal systems designed to empower outsiders. Consistent with this control motivation for underpricing, we find that underpricing has a negative association with post-IPO outside blockholdings and a positive association with private control benefits. In addition, firms whose insiders are entrenched either by majority ownership or by dual-class structures do not underprice more in countries with better governance. In these firms the ownership structure protects managers from outside influence, eliminating the incentive to increase outside ownership dispersion through underpricing.", "ex:volume": "41", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "IPO underpricing and international corporate governance", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v41/n2/full/jibs200938a.html", "ex:pages": "206-222", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2010", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Thomas J Boulton"}, {"ex:name": "Scott B Smart"}, {"ex:name": "Chad J Zutter"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Varying institutional environments provide the foundation for a great deal of international business research, yet relatively little empirical work has examined the determinants of small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) growth during institutional upheaval, although the importance of SME development for economic transition and growth is widely acknowledged. Our paper addresses this gap in the literature by examining how the competitive strategies of SMEs evolve during institutional transitions, and assessing the implications for firm growth. Using data collected from 135 SMEs in 1993, and 200 SMEs in 2001, we find that managerial networking intensity (i.e., developing and maintaining relationships that may be used for business purposes) declines markedly over time, whereas the importance of market-based strategies increases. Managerial networking intensity is strongly associated with firm growth early in the institutional transition process, but not later. Market-based strategies are not associated with firm growth in either time period. Drawing on convergent insights from multiple theoretical perspectives, we argue that changes in strategy are concurrently driven by socially constructed norms that legitimize new ways of competing and delegitimize old ones, and by knowledge acquisition and learning, which provide managers with a more diverse set of tools with which to exercise their strategic choices.", "ex:volume": "41", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "The impact of managerial networking intensity and market-based strategies on firm growth during institutional upheaval: A study of small and medium-sized enterprises in a transition economy", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v41/n2/full/jibs200945a.html", "ex:pages": "287-307", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2010", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Wade M Danis"}, {"ex:name": "Dan S Chiaburu"}, {"ex:name": "Marjorie A Lyles"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "This paper examines the determinants of technology transfer between parent firms and their international affiliates, and of knowledge spillovers from those affiliates to host-country firms.
