The world is changing before our eyes &ndash; within the memories of many readers of this journal, these economies were known for little other than abject poverty. Today they are the largest of the &ldquo;emerging market economies.&rdquo; Yet to apply this term to China and India is to fail to recognize the cycles of history. These countries have been the prime generators of wealth in the world for millennia, dwarfing even the Roman Empire at its height. As recently as 1820, China and India together accounted for almost half of world output (Maddison, 2001). For China and India, their current appearance on the world economic stage is better understood as re-emergence rather than emergence.While they are currently witnessing accelerating &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; processes with advanced market economies in many sectors (Mudambi, 2008), China and India are almost unique in having organized economies and a thriving tradition of entrepreneurship dating back to antiquity. These historical roots underpin the mainsprings of economic activity in these economies to this day, ranging from the wealthy and widespread Chinese diaspora (Yeung, 2004) to the dynamic Indian business communities (Khanna, 2007).It is important for managers in advanced economy multinational enterprises (MNEs) to recognize these institutional foundations, because as Gupta and Wang point out, in this compelling book, they pass up doing business in and with these two countries at their peril. With the growth of their markets and the increasing sophistication of their enormous workforces, ceding these economies to local or MNE competitors is not an option. In his incisive review of this timely book, Ramamurti highlights the book&apos;s critical message for practicing managers in advanced economy MNEs, while also pointing to significant implied research questions for international business (IB) scholars.Ram MudambiTemple University; JIBS Book Review EditorREFERENCESKhanna, T. 2007.

Insights from organizational ecology are used to explain how institutional forces constrain ecological processes, together driving the evolution of the population size of foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs), privately held domestic firms, and state-owned domestic organizations. We argue that the variation in the relative forces of ecological processes and institutional constraints across FIEs and their domestic rivals accounts for the expansion of FIEs in China. On the one hand, in many transition economies, institutional constraints are imposed on foreign enterprises by regulation that limits FDI opportunities. On the other hand, after entry, foreign enterprises can benefit from their competitive advantages in their ecological struggle against domestic rivals. This logic produces different sets of hypotheses as to foreign enterprises&rsquo; density and sales growth, in interaction with domestic organizations.

Employing a large sample of Chinese entrepreneurial firms, our investigation demonstrates that while the resources of institutional capital and managerial ties are important in the internationalization effort, their effects on international performance are channeled through each firm&apos;s adaptive capability. This adaptive capability is the firm&apos;s ability to coordinate, recombine, and allocate resources to meet the different requirements of foreign markets.

Using the high-profile Asian financial crisis of 1997&ndash;1998 and a sample of 566 firms from eight East Asian countries over 1996&ndash;1999, we examine the link between family control and agency costs evident in the cost of equity financing for firms. We find that, before the crisis, family control is unrelated to firms&apos; equity financing costs, whereas, following the crisis, family control is related to a higher cost of equity. This suggests that the crisis made investors aware of the potential entrenchment of controlling families, prompting them to require a higher-equity premium from family firms. Our results are robust to various models of the cost of equity capital, additional firm- and country-level governance traits, and additional alternative explanations, including the presence of other types of large shareholders and potential survivorship bias.
