[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "As firms increasingly use licensing to exploit knowledge-based assets in global technology markets, appropriate structuring of these agreements has become an important line of research inquiry. One area that has received less attention is the nature of rights granted in inter-firm licensing relationships, although it is an important clause that has implications for profit generation from licensing of proprietary assets. Conceptualizing licensing rights in terms of number of licenses granted and exclusivity rights given to a licensee in a foreign market, this paper examines the determinants of these rights based on monopoly rents and transaction costs associated with different types of licensing contracts. Hypotheses are empirically tested through two studies, one based on large US manufacturing firms and the other on a cross-national sample of medium-sized firms actively involved in international technology licensing. Results from both studies show a greater propensity to use non-exclusive/multiple licensing when the licensed technology has greater potential to produce differentiated products, or when there is greater threat of substitutive technologies entering the market. On the other hand, innovative technologies and a higher degree of asset-specific investments required of the licensee for the technology are related to the use of single/exclusive licensing agreements.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "41", "ex:title": "International technology licensing: Monopoly rents, transaction costs and exclusive rights", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v41/n4/full/jibs200919a.html", "ex:pages": "587-605", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2010", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Preet S Aulakh"}, {"ex:name": "Marshall S Jiang"}, {"ex:name": "Yigang Pan"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Global account management (GAM) has become a vital part of many multinational enterprises&rsquo; global marketing.

In this paper we extend the consumer animosity literature to a firm&apos;s global integration activities for hybrid products. We posit that consumers&rsquo; willingness to purchase (WTP) a complex hybrid product is negatively affected by partial production shifts to an animosity-evoking country, and that self-reported animosity toward the country predicts lower WTP above and beyond consumer ethnocentrism and perceived product quality. In addition, we hypothesize a negative relationship between conservation values and WTP hybrid foreign products, and a positive relationship between openness values and WTP hybrid foreign products.

The author assesses the predictions of interdisciplinary research on firm behavior in different contexts, which have emphasized that product innovation is affected by three sets of factors: the extent of global engagement, information spillovers, and market structure. The empirical model of the probability of observing a product innovation, a probit model, by a firm considers three levels of analysis: firm characteristics, industry characteristics, and the national context. The econometric evidence supports the global engagement and information spillovers hypotheses, but the evidence on the role of market structure is mixed. Regarding global engagement, the evidence suggests that product innovation by incumbent firms is positively correlated with the act of investing in R&#38;D and licensing of foreign technologies, and country-level average import tariffs reduce the probability of product innovation. Regarding information spillovers, the evidence also shows that a country&apos;s patent density is positively correlated with product innovation. In contrast, concerning the market structure hypotheses, country-level indicators of business density and of policy-induced costs of entry are not robustly correlated with product innovation.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "41", "ex:title": "An international multilevel analysis of product innovation", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v41/n4/full/jibs200930a.html", "ex:pages": "606-619", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2010", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Daniel Lederman"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Extending earlier literature on diffusion of codes of good governance (CGGs) by integrating the effect of national culture, this study offers a novel perspective on cross-national diversity in the worldwide diffusion of corporate governance best practices. We argue that particular cultural dimensions affect the indicators (i.e., total number of codes per country and identity of issuing organizations) of such diffusion. For a sample of 67 countries our analysis reveals that individualist cultures have a stronger tendency to develop CGGs. In cultures with a high receptivity to power differences there is a higher probability that the first issuers are the government, directors&rsquo; or professional associations; whereas with low receptivity, the stock exchange and investors&rsquo; groups of issuers are more likely to initiate the first code. The effects of culture remain significant even after accounting for differences in legal systems and economic institutions, indicating that national culture may serve as a comprehensive indicator of the regulatory stance with respect to good governance.

In contrast, PFP was negatively related to employees&rsquo; organizational commitment and interpersonal helping at the organization level. This study suggests that the impact of &ldquo;culture distance&rdquo; associated with Western HR practices may be more likely to manifest itself in the collective entity than at the individual level. Employees of domestic firms reported significantly higher levels of performance appraisal satisfaction and justice perceptions than employees of foreign firms, which might explain why PFP was more widely implemented in domestic firms in China. The present results demonstrated that, in addition to the culture distance, the &ldquo;context distance&rdquo; between domestic and foreign firms may play a critical role in accruing benefits from PFP, indicating that PFP can be more beneficial to domestic firms than to foreign firms.

First, we pan-culturally tested the model across our seven-society sample. Next, we split these societies into high and low gross national income categories. Likewise, we split the respondents in our sample, regardless of their country, into high and low idiocentrism/individualism and allocentrism/collectivism categories and tested at these group levels. Our findings showed that personal resources &ndash; mastery, optimistic orientation, and self-esteem &ndash; generally served to buffer the experienced strain due to work role ambiguity and conflict.

We examine whether the level (surface-level vs deep-level) and type (cross-national vs intra-national) of cultural diversity affect these processes differently. We hypothesize that task complexity and structural aspects of the team, such as team size, team tenure, and team dispersion, moderate the effects of cultural diversity on teams. We test the hypotheses with a meta-analysis of 108 empirical studies on processes and performance in 10,632 teams. Results suggest that cultural diversity leads to process losses through task conflict and decreased social integration, but to process gains through increased creativity and satisfaction.

We link historical changes in the character of MNE activities to changes in the institutional environment, and highlight the scope for firm-level creativity and institutional entrepreneurship that may lead to co-evolution with the environment. We argue that the main drivers for institutional entrepreneurship are now found in the increasing autonomy of MNE subsidiaries. Thus MNE agency derives from more decentralized forms of experimentation in international corporate networks, which competence-creating nodes of new initiatives can co-evolve with local institutions.
