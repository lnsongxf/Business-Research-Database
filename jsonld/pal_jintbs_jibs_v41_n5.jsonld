[{"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "The objective of this study is to advance a theoretical framework pertaining to how interpartner learning in international joint ventures (IJV) may affect IJV instability in emerging economies. The proposed framework expands the interpartner learning theory of IJV instability in the current literature, which is focused on absorptive learning of IJV partners, by incorporating IJV partners&rsquo; joint learning. Using longitudinal dyadic data from IJVs in China, we found that local and foreign IJV parties&rsquo; absorptive learning capacity decreases one party&apos;s dependence on the other, while joint learning capacity in IJV increases both parties&rsquo; dependence on each other. In addition, an IJV partner&apos;s absorptive learning capacity positively moderates the effect of joint learning capacity on its dependence on another partner. These findings lend support to the expanded interpartner learning perspective of IJV instability, and have important theoretical and managerial implications for IJVs in emerging economies. The results underscore the importance of the IJV actively developing organizational rules, procedures, and structures to create and embed new knowledge in order to maintain the stability of the IJV. Finally, we found that IJV partners&rsquo; dependence asymmetry increases IJV instability, whereas their total dependence decreases IJV instability.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "41", "ex:title": "The effects of absorptive and joint learning on the instability of international joint ventures in emerging economies", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v41/n5/full/jibs2009100a.html", "ex:pages": "906-924", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2010", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Eric Fang"}, {"ex:name": "Shaoming Zou"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "We examine articles published in the Journal of International Business Studies (JIBS) and introduce a typology to support the relevance of intra-country variation in international business (IB).

The results indicate that three current research clusters (multinational enterprise knowledge development, foreign entry and cultural effects, and the internationalization process and national culture) are based on established IB theory. Then we respond to calls in the literature to improve research concerning intra-country variation, and propose a typology of three dimensions (social, demographic, and geographic) to study the diversity of individual, firm, and economic activity in a country. The social dimension evaluates the importance of modernist and traditionalist values, the demographic dimension proposes differences between urban and rural settings, and the geographic dimension discusses the relevance of border and interior locations.

Implicit in this literature is the idea that there must be a positive relationship between DOI and performance. This paper argues that if the research design does not address the issue of causality, a positive relationship cannot necessarily be interpreted as meaning that DOI has improved performance. Furthermore, the research design should consider risk exposure. For example, if the riskiness of a firm fell as a result of a move abroad, then one can envision a negative relationship and also conclude that the move abroad paid off. Using detailed quarterly data over the period 1994&ndash;2004 on the distribution of Canadian banks&apos; assets across countries, and broken down by risk category, the analysis simultaneously accounts for endogeneity and risk exposure. The results establish a causal relationship between DOI and performance, but find that the nature of this relationship varies by bank, and also depends upon the riskiness associated with each bank&apos;s foreign asset exposures. These causal relationships are robust to the introduction of two formal risk measures: credit ratings and share price volatility.

The paper contributes to both the international business literature and practitioner approaches to political risk analysis in demonstrating use of publicly available market data from real-asset transactions to measure the cost of political risk.

Despite the impressive accumulation of knowledge in international business and international relations, the two intellectual communities have largely ignored the insights from each other. In this article, we seek to bridge this gap. We argue that interstate military conflict and security alliances, as two central features of interstate security relations, often change both government policies toward international business and investor expectations of political risk. From the perspectives of both states and investors, military conflict should reduce bilateral investment whereas security alliances increase it. Our empirical analysis applies the system GMM estimator to a gravity model of bilateral investment flows for 1117 directed dyads among 58 countries from 1980 to 2000. Among 18 countries whose per capita real incomes remain consistently above 12,000 constant dollars, the security factors do not affect bilateral investment; in the high-income/low-income dyads, interstate military conflict and security alliances significantly influence bilateral investment as expected.
