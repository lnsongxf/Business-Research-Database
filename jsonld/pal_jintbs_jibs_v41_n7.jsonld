[{"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "This paper examines the impact of globalisation, by means of growing international trade, on firm entry and exit at the industry level. The analysis is carried on the manufacturing industries of eight European countries, over the period 1997&ndash;2003. Our main findings suggest important entry-discouraging effects in the short run, following increased trade exposure. Using panel estimation techniques, the empirical evidence points to less creative replacement entry in industries characterised by substantial import intensity, and strong selection and higher entry barriers in industries characterised by higher openness through the export channel. The negative effects of trade openness are milder if the increasing trade exposure concerns intra-industry trade, coupled mainly with international sourcing of intermediates within the industry. The latter effects also show up in the model explaining the exit of firms, which we estimate jointly with entry.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "41", "ex:title": "International trade, exit and entry: A cross-country and industry analysis", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v41/n7/full/jibs2009105a.html", "ex:pages": "1240-1257", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2010", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Italo Colantone"}, {"ex:name": "Leo Sleuwaegen"}]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "Using panel data analysis, this paper investigates the impact of returnee entrepreneurs, foreign direct investment (FDI) intensity and inter-firm employee mobility on innovation in Chinese high-tech firms.

Building on resource dependence theory and self-determination theory we argue that two basic goals subsidiary managers pursue are to achieve autonomy vis-&agrave;-vis corporate headquarters, and influence over other units. We investigate how a subsidiary&apos;s past initiatives contribute to its bargaining power, and how headquarters&rsquo; response &ndash; through granting attention or monitoring &ndash; affects the realization of the subsidiary&apos;s goals. Using structural equation modeling, our hypotheses are tested by drawing on a sample of 257 subsidiaries located in three different countries (Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom). Our results show that subsidiaries are not able to increase their influence through initiatives unless they get headquarters&rsquo; attention. We also find that subsidiary initiatives have a direct effect on subsidiary autonomy, but the caveat is that initiatives also evoke headquarters monitoring, which in turn decreases the subsidiary&apos;s autonomy. In addition to providing insights into how subsidiaries can achieve their goals, the paper also sheds light on the critical role headquarters plays in leveraging initiatives, and the influence of individual subsidiaries in the multinational enterprise.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "41", "ex:title": "What are the consequences of initiative-taking in multinational subsidiaries&quest;", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v41/n7/full/jibs201019a.html", "ex:pages": "1099-1118", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2010", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Tina C Ambos"}, {"ex:name": "Ulf Andersson"}, {"ex:name": "Julian Birkinshaw"}]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "Extending the perspective of agency theory, this study incorporates both professional and local knowledge asymmetry into a model of relationship satisfaction between global professional service firms and their local clients. The model also includes learning orientation and adaptation that are theorized to regulate the impact of knowledge asymmetry on goal incongruence, which ultimately affects relationship satisfaction. China was selected as the setting of the study because it is the largest emerging market, has seen double-digit growth of advertising expenditures for the past two decades, and is home to many multinational advertising agencies that have increasingly pursued local clients as revenue sources. Multiple informants from 177 domestic Chinese firms and their multinational advertising agencies were personally interviewed, and the dyadic data were used to test the model. Results show that both types of knowledge asymmetry lead to goal incongruence, which causes client dissatisfaction. The role of learning orientation varies, as does the role of adaptation, in moderating the impact of knowledge asymmetry on goal incongruence and the impact of goal incongruence on relationship satisfaction.

We also find that business group affiliation affects the international diversification discount differently during the two periods of market-oriented institutional change, particularly when firm performance is measured by the market-to-book value (MBV). The moderating effect of business group affiliation on the relationship between international diversification and MBV is negative during the institutional frictions period, but becomes positive during the institutional convergence period in the later stage of institutional change.

Little has been written about how information technology (IT) systems may impact on international exchange relationships. In the present study, we report on how suppliers use IT as a strategic resource to govern their international exchange relationships with multinational enterprise customers. Taking the supplier&apos;s perspective, we propose that two types of IT resources &ndash; IT advancement and electronic integration &ndash; create value for suppliers with respect to innovativeness and market performance. We argue that this value creation process is mediated by three specific forms of governance: cooperativeness, output monitoring, and behavior monitoring. To test these arguments, primary data, obtained from 240 Taiwanese electronics suppliers, are used for hypothesis testing. The survey results provide evidence that suppliers&rsquo; IT resources enable them to work effectively with their international key customers. Importantly, of the three governance mechanisms, cooperativeness has the strongest impact on supplier performance, owing to supplier electronic integration.

Ultimately, these restrictions affect competitive intensity among firms, and firm performance persistence. Using data for over 10,000 firms from 33 countries over a 10-year time frame, we show that antitrust law strength, a product market institution designed to prevent collusion among firms, is associated with decreases in performance persistence. Unskilled labor market flexibility, a labor market institution that reduces legal constraints imposed on residual claimants (managers and owners) to take necessary actions to maintain or enhance profitability, is associated with increases in performance persistence. Product liability law effectiveness, another product market institution, and corporate control market development, a financial market institution, are positively associated with performance persistence only in the case of MNEs.
