We develop specific hypotheses concerning the nature of these effects, and test our hypotheses with data on international acquisitions carried out by Finnish corporations. The analyses performed show that national cultural differences provide great potential for knowledge transfer in international acquisitions. Furthermore, organizational cultural convergence and crossvergence have a significant positive impact on knowledge transfer.

The dividend puzzle is one of the most studied, yet unresolved, issues in financial economics. Prior theoretical and empirical research has suggested several explanations of the dividend puzzle that are rooted mainly in agency, asymmetric information, &ldquo;bird in hand&rdquo;, and pecking order theories. The main intuition behind our analysis is that dividend policy may be determined not only by an objective assessment of the severity of agency and asymmetric information problems within a firm, but also by management&apos;s and investors&rsquo; subjective perceptions of these problems, which hinge on their national culture. Using Schwartz&apos;s national culture dimensions, Conservatism and Mastery, we find that Conservatism is positively related and Mastery negatively related to dividend payouts for a sample of 27,462 firm-years from 21 countries between 1995 and 2007. These effects are robust to controls for a wide variety of other determinants of dividend policy &ndash; including investor protection, stock market performance, financial system configuration, tax advantage, economic development, and dividend catering premium &ndash; and to alternative culture proxies and sub-period windows.

The correlations between practices and values for societies, surprisingly, were found to be significantly negative for seven dimensions. Apparently, people&apos;s values are contrary to their practices. A note, which appeared in a recent issue of this journal, proposes that these anomalous correlations result from diminishing marginal utility. The note argues that marginal utility theory applies to cultural dimensions, and that the GLOBE values measure societies&rsquo; marginal preferences for most of the dimensions, rather than total preference weights. Through close analysis of the questionnaire items used by the GLOBE team, we show that this is not the case. We demonstrate that the GLOBE questions, as asked, do not elicit marginal preferences. In fact they elicit values, as claimed by GLOBE, but recognizing that values may well be shaped, in part, by existing practices.

We clarify the UA measurement in both Hofstede and GLOBE, and find that the two models are measuring different components of the UA construct. We propose a two-component model of UA, namely, UA-stress and UA-rule orientation, and confirm its validity with national culture data from the Hofstede and GLOBE studies, and economic data from the World Bank. We also explain the negative GLOBE UA practices&ndash;values relationship using motivational theories. A way forward in future UA-related research is suggested. The Hofstede UA index, the GLOBE UA practices scores and the GLOBE UA values scores should be used within the specific domains that they represent: that is, stress, rule orientation practices and rule orientation aspirations, respectively.

Using a large sample of foreign partial acquisitions in the US from 1981 to 1999, we examine the determinants of foreign acquirers&rsquo; governance activities in US targets. We focus on the information asymmetries that foreign acquirers face in the US as a key determinant of their governance activities in US targets, and hypothesize that such information asymmetries provide them with weak incentives to engage in governance activities. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that foreign acquirers whose countries share a common language and a common culture with the US are more likely to engage in post-acquisition governance activities than are other foreign acquirers. Moreover, the probability of foreign acquirers&rsquo; governance activities is positively related to their previous acquisition activities in the US, but negatively related to the physical distance from the targets and the difference in shareholder rights scores between the US and their home countries.

This commentary responds to their claim, and restates our original argument. We stress that the distinction between values and marginal preferences is a conceptual rather than a semantic issue. Conflation of the two is a problem of stated preferences methods in general, regardless of question formats. What is more, we argue that support for the marginal preferences interpretation of values survey data does not come from the specific wording of questions used in surveys, but from a growing number of paradoxical relations between values ratings and outcomes in values research. Implications are twofold. First, we argue that, in order to measure values, we need to look at alternatives to the stated preferences approach, such as revealed preferences and experienced preferences, of which the latter seems most promising.

To help interpret extant study findings, we provide formulas and graphs based on Bayesian analysis, and introduce a method of combining results from multiple international comparisons. We also describe methods for designing studies to give stronger evidence of relationships between variables. Our results suggest that a minimum of 7&ndash;10 countries may support credible international generalizations, but only when overall trends are very strong.
