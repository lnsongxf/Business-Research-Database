The empirical findings, consistent with our tax-induced regulatory arbitrage models and the round-tripping phenomenon in China (that is, moving funds across the Mainland Chinese border through trade, typically to Hong Kong or an offshore tax haven, before re-entering China as foreign direct investment), provide support for several conclusions. First, the spurious flows of funds to and from China, via the underreporting of exports and the overreporting of imports, closely follow the preferential tax incentives accorded to foreign investors. Second, the underreporting of exports is negatively related to export tax rebates. Third, the overreporting of imports is negatively related to import tariffs.

While previous work emphasizes effects operating at the level of the business network, I propose that the recognition of exchange opportunities is a highly subjective process, shaped by entrepreneurs&rsquo; existing ties with others. Based on interview data collected from 41 managers, I develop a comprehensive measure for classifying different methods of opportunity recognition. I then use this measure to classify 665 international exchange ventures set up by entrepreneurs in four Chinese cities. In contrast with past research I find virtually no role for blind luck. Although the majority of exchange opportunities were discovered rather than sought, these discoveries were intentional rather than accidental. I also find that entrepreneurs&rsquo; idiosyncratic connections with others both promote and inhibit international exchange. Tie-based opportunities lead to higher-quality and more valuable exchanges that are constrained in terms of geographic, psychic and linguistic distance. From this I conclude that entrepreneurial networks have distinct opportunity horizons that limit the reach of tie-based exchanges and potentially lead to sub-optimal internationalization trajectories.", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Social ties and international entrepreneurship: Opportunities and constraints affecting firm internationalization", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v42/n1/full/jibs201020a.html", "ex:pages": "99-127", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Paul D Ellis"]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "We investigate the process through which country-level corporate governance facilitates firm-level investment in research and development (R&#38;D).

Using data from nine European Union countries, Japan, and the United States, we show that R&#38;D at the firm level is less sensitive to internal cash flow in countries with effective investor protection, developed financial systems, and strong corporate control mechanisms. Specifically, our analysis suggests that the characteristics of the corporate governance system that facilitate R&#38;D are a common law legal environment, minority shareholder protection, strong law enforcement, a bank-based financial system, effective board control, and a strong market for corporate control.

Second, the paper briefly discusses relevant research on inter-firm trust since 2000, noting that research has shown the contingent value of trust, and notably that it is more important when asset specificity and uncertainty are high. Third, we discuss what has happened in the automotive industry over the past 15 years with regard to trust in supplier&ndash;buyer relationships. We show a correlation between automaker trustworthiness and automaker market-share performance and suggest a causal link, since some automakers (e.g., Hyundai, Kia) have been increasing trust with suppliers and then improving market performance.
