[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Consumers&rsquo; conceptions of a market&apos;s institutional logic affect mechanisms of firm&ndash;consumer relationships, but are generally neglected in comparative studies of international marketing. This study bridges institutional and relationship marketing theories to examine two questions: do consumers hold meaningful mental models of a market&apos;s institutional logics, and do these mental models explain differentiated patterns of market relationships across international contexts? Building on contract-relational duality, we develop a market-level construct for capturing consumers&rsquo; socially constructed mental models for the institutional logics of market action. We theorize that differences in consumers&rsquo; institutional logics will influence both their evaluation of a firm&apos;s capabilities (first-order effect) and the degree to which they reward a firm through their commitment (second-order effect). These bridging predictions are tested using data from the insurance industry across three international markets. Our results show that the German insurance market is located in the relatively high contracts&ndash;low relational quadrant, whereas the US and Dutch markets are both located in the relatively low contracts &ndash; high relational quadrant. Our results also suggest that consumer commitment conforms to a principle of alignment such that commitment accrues to providers who align their capabilities with consumers&rsquo; prevalent institutional logics of the market, and penalizes those who deviate from it.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:title": "First- and second-order effects of consumers&rsquo; institutional logics on firm&ndash;consumer relationships: A cross-market comparative analysis", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v42/n2/full/jibs2009101a.html", "ex:pages": "307-333", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Jagdip Singh"}, {"ex:name": "Patrick Lentz"}, {"ex:name": "Edwin J Nijssen"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "We identify inward investment as an important impetus to outward investment, supplemental to the impetuses depicted in conventional internationalization frameworks.

As more trade occurs globally, interest in cross-cultural prosocial values is growing. We therefore build on socialization theory and introduce national business ideology as a country-level determinant of employees&rsquo; prosocial values. We thus argue that transformational leadership and professional altruism are key elements of a national business ideology&apos;s stimulation of employees&rsquo; prosocial values, while corporate corruption is considered to be an impediment. Based on 19,026 individuals from 17 countries, our cross-level analyses point to the national business ideology explaining national-level variances above and beyond cultural aspects. Results support our hypothesis that national business ideology, including transformational leadership and professional altruism, is positively related to employees&rsquo; prosocial values. The hypothesis on corporate corruption, however, was not supported. Instead, results indicate that employees apply rationalization strategies to justify corruption.

We examine debt covenant information from foreign corporate bonds issued in the US from more than 50 countries between 1991 and 2007.

This finding suggests that creditor protection substitutes for covenants in reducing the agency cost of debt. In contrast, bonds of firms with stronger shareholder rights or firms with stronger firm-level corporate governance use more covenants. These findings support the notion that firms with stronger shareholder control may face an increase in the shareholder&ndash;bondholder conflict and therefore prefer to use more covenants.

However, the impact of offshore outsourcing depends on the resources and capabilities of firms to manage a network of foreign suppliers, and to absorb foreign knowledge.
