[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "In this paper, we advance and test the idea that innovation and export are complementary strategies for SMEs&rsquo; growth. We argue that innovation and export positively reinforce each other in a dynamic virtuous circle, and we identify and describe the process through which this complementarity relationship takes place. Participating in export markets can promote firms&rsquo; learning, and thus enhance innovation performance. At the same time, through innovation, firms can enter new geographical markets with novel and better products, therefore making exports more successful, and, by the same token, they can also improve the quality &ndash; and consequently increase the sales &ndash; of the products sold domestically. We test our theory using an unbalanced panel of Spanish manufacturing firms over the period 1990&ndash;1999. We find robust empirical support for our hypothesis: consistent with the presence of complementarity, we show that the positive effect of innovation activity on firms&rsquo; growth rate is higher for firms that also engage in exports, and vice versa. Furthermore, we show that, Ceteris paribus, firms&rsquo; adoption of one growth strategy (e.g., entering export markets) positively influences the adoption of the other (e.g., innovation).", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Exploring the complementarity between innovation and export for SMEs&rsquo; growth", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v42/n3/full/jibs20112a.html", "ex:pages": "362-380", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Elena Golovko"}, {"ex:name": "Giovanni Valentini"}]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "We conceptualize the MNE as a portfolio of interdependent sub-units, and examine its growth trajectory in relation to its existing portfolio.

We analyze a unique cross-country data set covering 74 countries from 1990 to 2007, and find that related lending, on average, does not have any effect on the growth of credit. We do find, however, that there are conditional relationships: related lending tends to retard the growth of banking systems when rule of law is weak, whereas it tends to promote the growth of banking systems when rule of law is strong. We also find that related lending appears to be associated with looting when banks are owned by non-financial firms, but that it does not do so when non-financial firms are owned by banks. Our results indicate that whether related lending is positive or pernicious depends critically on the institutional context in which it takes place; there is no single &ldquo;best policy&rdquo; regarding related lending.

This paper analyzes whether R&#38;D offshoring contributes to enhancing firms&rsquo; innovation capabilities. Specifically, the study distinguishes between two governance models of offshoring &ndash; captive offshoring and offshore outsourcing &ndash; and two types of innovation outcomes &ndash; product and process innovations. We suggest that R&#38;D offshoring has different impacts, depending on the innovation results and governance models considered. The study empirically tests these relationships using the Spanish Technological Innovation Panel. This survey contains information on a large sample of firms from diverse sectors for the period 2004&ndash;2007. The empirical findings allow us confirm our hypotheses, and highlight the strategic importance of R&#38;D offshoring. The empirical evidence reveals a positive relation between offshoring and innovation performance, with a greater effect on product than on process innovations. The results for different governance models show that captive offshoring has a greater effect on innovation outcomes than offshore outsourcing.

Difficulty in evaluating the merits of, let alone the need for, solutions offered to boost interdisciplinary relevance slows validation of the ontological principles and epistemic standards of IB research. This paper begins to fill this gap. It establishes a knowledge network composed of 39 high-impact journals that represent the domains of management, marketing, finance, economics, operations, IT, accounting, human resources, organizational behavior, and IB. We collected citation exchanges among these 39 journals from 2000 through 2007. A log-multiplicative model evaluated multiple dimensions of association to determine the sources and storers of knowledge within the network. The network from Pathfinder analysis was used to determine each journal&apos;s contribution to network entropy. These analyses indicate that IB journals functioned as storers, not sources, of ideas within the sampled knowledge network over the studied period.

Their knowledge-based view shifted the conceptualization of the firm from an institution arising from market failure and transaction costs economizing to a progeny of superior knowledge governance. We question these conclusions, arguing that firms are but one of the many types of &ldquo;epistemic communities&rdquo; possessing and nurturing procedural norms, identity, and the cognitive, linguistic and reflexive attributes conducive to efficient exchange and re-combination of knowledge among their members.
