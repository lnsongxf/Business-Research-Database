This study focuses on the historical ties between countries as an additional factor affecting such decisions. In particular, it examines three major historical factors that affect cross-country ties with Vietnam, namely, Chinese occupation and conflict, French colonization, and socialist ideology, and examines the ways in which these historical ties have influenced FDI. The database consists of 631 wholly owned subsidiaries and 1215 joint ventures formed in Vietnam by multinational enterprises from 35 countries and regions between 1989 and 1999. The results indicate that firms from Hong Kong, Taiwan, France, and former and current socialist countries tended to be early movers in Vietnam, whereas firms from Mainland China tended to be late movers. Using the example of Vietnam, this study clearly shows that historical ties can provide additional explanatory power regarding FDI decisions beyond the conventional distance variables.", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Historical ties and foreign direct investment: An exploratory study", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v42/n4/full/jibs201053a.html", "ex:pages": "545-557", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Shige Makino", "Eric W K Tsang"]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "We investigate the role of firms&rsquo; country of origin in financial leverage decisions. Foreign joint ventures in China face a common set of country-level formal institutional constraints, but vary in the cultural values they bring from their countries of origin. We hypothesize that national culture enters the joint optimization process, leading to foreign joint ventures&rsquo; leverage decisions, and that it affects leverage decisions both directly and indirectly. Employing a hierarchical linear model distinguishing firm-level from country-level variables, and a data set covering over 8000 foreign joint ventures in China from 32 different countries and regions in the year 2002, we find that mastery has negative and significant direct effects on foreign joint ventures&rsquo; leverage and short-term debt decisions, and a positive and significant direct effect on the likelihood of foreign joint ventures having long-term debt. The indirect effects of mastery on leverage decisions sometimes reinforce and sometimes offset the direct effects. Embeddedness has no significant direct effect on foreign joint ventures&rsquo; leverage decisions, but exerts its influence entirely through indirect effects. Finally, the economic significance analysis of the total effects suggests that national culture has significant explanatory power in the leverage decisions of foreign joint ventures in China.", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "National culture and capital structure decisions: Evidence from foreign joint ventures in China", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v42/n4/full/jibs20117a.html", "ex:pages": "477-503", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Kai Li", "Dale Griffin", "Heng Yue", "Longkai Zhao"]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Foreign investors access local knowledge by co-locating with other foreign direct investment (FDI) firms. However, different aspects of local knowledge can be obtained from different local businesses. Thus some foreign investors co-locate with FDI firms from the same country of origin, while others co-locate with foreign industry peers. We argue that, relative to industry FDI agglomeration, country-of-origin agglomeration provides an effective channel for the sharing of sensitive and tacit knowledge about local business environments. Therefore foreign investors in need of such local knowledge are more likely to locate in country-of-origin agglomerations. Empirical evidence based on FDI in Vietnam indicates that foreign investors who perceive local institutions as particularly weak, and those with a high degree of outsidership in the local environment, are more likely to seek country-of-origin agglomerations than industry FDI agglomerations.", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Country-of-origin and industry FDI agglomeration of foreign investors in an emerging economy", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v42/n4/full/jibs20114a.html", "ex:pages": "504-520", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Danchi Tan", "Klaus E Meyer"]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "We apply an organizational embeddedness perspective to examine international assignees&rsquo; retention with the organization. Specifically, we hypothesize that assignees&rsquo; social ties within and their perceived fit with the host unit positively relate to two sacrifices on leaving the organization: their firm-specific learning during the assignment, and their perceived career prospects in the organization. Perceived career prospects are expected to predict subsequent retention, moderated by firm-specific learning. These hypotheses are tested using a sample of 143 inpatriates in 10 German multinationals, with retention measured 2 and 4 years later. We show that inpatriates&rsquo; trusting ties with HQ staff and their fit with the HQ positively relate to their firm-specific learning and their perceived career prospects, and that the latter predicts their retention 2 and 4 years later. Perceived career prospects mediate the direct relationship between inpatriates&rsquo; fit with the HQ and inpatriate retention, and the indirect relationship between inpatriates&rsquo; trusting ties with HQ staff and their retention. Furthermore, inpatriates&rsquo; firm-specific learning mitigates the effect of perceived career prospects on retention decisions 2 years later.

However, production costs alone cannot explain the location determinants of offshore outsourcing of services. In this paper, we argue that minimizing transaction costs is also an important determinant of the location of offshore outsourcing of services. We empirically analyze characteristics of services and characteristics of foreign countries that may impact on transaction costs in an outsourcing relationship and hence determine where services will be outsourced offshore. We derive measures of service characteristics &ndash; routineness, complexity and interactiveness &ndash; based on the tasks required to provide them. Further, we posit that there are interaction effects between service and country characteristics. Using Bureau of Economic Analysis data on US service outsourcing across 11 types of services to 31 countries between 1992 and 2005, we find that: (1) services that are more routine, less complex or less interactive are outsourced more to foreign countries; (2) services are outsourced more to countries with higher institutional quality and greater cultural proximity; (3) non-routine, complex and interactive services are outsourced relatively more to countries with a better institutional quality.", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Why are different services outsourced to different countries&quest;", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v42/n4/full/jibs201061a.html", "ex:pages": "558-571", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Runjuan Liu", "Dorothee J Feils", "Barry Scholnick"]}]
