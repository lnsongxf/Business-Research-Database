[{"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "Multinational corporations (MNCs) rely heavily on local employees when conducting their international operations, yet the international business literature provides few instances of true focus on these employees. The commonly used label &ldquo;host-country nationals&rdquo; (HCNs) confers them an identity strongly related to the culture of their country, prompting both researchers and practitioners to &ldquo;know&rdquo; them through the knowledge about the local culture. This paper provides evidence that a more sophisticated view of the culture of HCNs is needed: through an ethnographic exploration of HCNs working in local subsidiaries of American MNCs in Romania, I reveal that HCNs are not always culturally interchangeable with the rest of the host-country population. HCNs can display a variety of cultural profiles more or less reflective of the national culture, depending on their enacted stance towards the native culture and the cultural landscape of the MNCs themselves. The findings call for further specification of theories relying on the assumed localness of HCNs, and should contribute to the ongoing conversation on the interplay between the cultures specific to the MNC and its host countries.", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Foreign locals: A cautionary tale on the culture of MNC local employees", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v42/n5/full/jibs20119a.html", "ex:pages": "608-628", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Dan V Caprar"]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "Qualitative research in international business has been rare, the main research streams of the field relying more on quantitative methods.

The findings show a common internationalisation activity cycle but four qualitatively different ways in which these owner-managers practise internationalisation. We reveal that this variation in owner-manager internationalisation practices is determined by their understandings of internationalisation, which produce differences in the ways activities within their internationalisation activity cycle are orchestrated. In particular, phenomenography has enabled new insights into the multiplicity of firm internationalisation practices not able to be captured through other qualitative methodologies such as ethnography or semiotics, as they are not designed to capture such variation. Based on our findings, we propose an understanding-based theory to explain the idiosyncratic nature of owner-managed small firm internationalisation. Furthermore, we suggest that phenomenography, used independently or in conjunction with other qualitative methodologies, also has potential to reveal the varying practices of internationalising large MNEs by enabling an investigation of the collective or shared understanding of firm internationalisation within MNEs.

By means of a qualitative content analysis of case studies published in Journal of International Business Studies, Academy of Management Journal and Journal of Management Studies, we construct a typology of theorising from case studies. Two dimensions of the case study, namely causal explanation and contextualisation, form the basis for our typology. We distinguish four methods of theorising &ndash; inductive theory-building, interpretive sensemaking, natural experiment and contextualised explanation &ndash; only the first of which has been widely used in JIBS in the period that we investigate.

Using a combination of induction and fuzzy-set analysis, I draw on documentary evidence and 298 interviews with managers and stakeholders to build theory about the conditions that shape subsidiaries&rsquo; stakeholder orientations. Two major findings emerge. First, although theory emphasizes external stakeholders&rsquo; control over resources, internal control through the corporate parent can crowd out the voices of local stakeholders. Second, although institutional theory proposes isomorphism with local norms and standards, some corporations are subject to scrutiny by global stakeholders, and their subsidiaries face higher requirements for social engagement than their peers.
