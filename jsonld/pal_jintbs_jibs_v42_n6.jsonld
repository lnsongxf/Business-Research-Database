[{"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "We examine the relation between four dimensions of national culture and earnings quality of banks using a sample of banks from 39 countries. Our main analysis, which focuses on the pre-financial crisis period 1993&ndash;2006, indicates that banks in high individualism, high masculinity, and low uncertainty avoidance societies manage earnings to just-meet-or-beat the prior year&apos;s earnings. In tests of income smoothing through loan loss provisions, we find that banks in high individualism, high power distance, and low uncertainty avoidance societies report smoother earnings. Our exploratory analysis of the effects of national culture on accounting outcomes during the financial crisis period 2007&ndash;2008 indicates that cultures that encourage higher risk-taking experienced more bank troubles in the form of larger losses or larger loan loss provisions.", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Effects of national culture on earnings quality of banks", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v42/n6/full/jibs201126a.html", "ex:pages": "853-874", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Kiridaran Kanagaretnam"}, {"ex:name": "Chee Yeow Lim"}, {"ex:name": "Gerald J Lobo"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "The objective of this article is to show how narrative methods provide useful tools for international business research. We do this by presenting a study of stories told about the collaboration between a Danish expatriate manager and his Chinese CEO in the Shanghai subsidiary of an MNE. First, we explain and exemplify how narrative interviews are designed and conducted. In this connection, we consider the interviewers&rsquo; interaction with the interviewees, and clarify our reasons for focusing on the two selected interviews. Second, we demonstrate how narrative concepts and models are able to elucidate intercultural collaboration processes by analyzing how each member of a dyad of interacting managers narrates the same chain of events. We show how the narratological concepts of peripeteia and anagnorisis are well suited to identifying focal points in their stories: situations where change follows their recognizing new dimensions of their conflicts, eventually furthering their collaboration. We explain how Greimas&apos;s actantial model is valuable when mapping differences between and changes in the narrators&rsquo; projects, alliances and oppositions in the course of their interaction. Thus, we make it clear how they overcome most of their differences and establish common ground through mutual learning.", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Intercultural collaboration stories: On narrative inquiry and analysis as tools for research in international business", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v42/n6/full/jibs201115a.html", "ex:pages": "787-804", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Martine Cardel Gertsen"}, {"ex:name": "Anne-Marie S&oslash;derberg"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "Organizational forms imbued with values of modernity &ndash; that is, rationality, efficiency and equity &ndash; diffuse rapidly around the world. Nonetheless, when sustained by beliefs, norms and regulations contrasting with those prevalent in the receiving country, their adoption may be delayed, and within-country legitimation may not proceed smoothly. We study the diffusion of multiplex cinemas &ndash; a form conceived in the US and attuned to the cinema-as-commerce logic &ndash; across Europe, where the cinema-as-art logic prevails. Our findings reveal that the cultural meanings embodied by multiplexes shaped the founding rates of this organizational form in three ways. First, countries with larger normative and regulative distance from the US retarded the adoption of the first multiplex. Second, camouflaged entries and, at increasing density, opposition from local interest groups were observed. Third, the embodiment of global cultural scripts of progress and modernity allowed multiplexes to overcome local opposition. The normative distance of the country from the US amplified the fluctuating dynamics of within-country legitimacy. A new specification of density-dependent legitimation is presented to model the cultural-cognitive legitimacy of rationalized but alien organizational forms.", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Breaking the wave: The contested legitimation of an alien organizational form", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v42/n6/full/jibs201122a.html", "ex:pages": "828-852", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Giuseppe Delmestri"}, {"ex:name": "Filippo Carlo Wezel"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "Building on the organizational capabilities literature and theories of the multinational enterprise, this paper develops and tests a framework that examines the relationship between intellectual capital configurations and organizational capabilities in human resource (HR) subunits.

In particular, while certain resources may help in the development of one capability, they may harm the development of another.

This paper adopts a critical discursive approach to enable an exploration of subtle dynamics in the way that both headquarters and subsidiaries subjectively reconstruct their independent-interdependent relationships with each other during change. We draw from a real-time qualitative study of a revealing case of charter change in an important European subsidiary of an MNE attempting to build closer integration across European country operations. Our results illustrate the role of three discourses &ndash; selling, resistance and reconciliation &ndash; in the reconstruction of the subsidiary&ndash;parent relationship. From this analysis we develop a process framework that elucidates the important role of these three discourses in the reconstruction of subsidiary roles, showing how resistance is not simply subversive but an important part of integration. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the micro-level political dynamics in subsidiary role evolution, and of how voice is exercised in MNEs. This study also provides a rare example of discourse-based analysis in an MNE context, advancing our knowledge of how discursive methods can help to advance international business research more generally.", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Selling, resistance and reconciliation: A critical discursive approach to subsidiary role evolution in MNEs", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v42/n6/full/jibs201113a.html", "ex:pages": "765-786", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Julia Balogun"}, {"ex:name": "Paula Jarzabkowski"}, {"ex:name": "Eero Vaara"}]}]
