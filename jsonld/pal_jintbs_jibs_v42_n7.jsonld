[{"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "This paper documents the case of the wireless telecom industry to bring new empirical evidence to the debate on the internationalization of research and development (R&#38;D) activities. US patent statistics on the four industry leaders &ndash; Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia and Qualcomm &ndash; illustrate the growing trend of the internationalization of R&#38;D over the 1990s, yet we show that the most critical R&#38;D projects related to the development of wireless standards remain homebound. The paper then leverages qualitative data collected through interviews with informed managers to provide a fresh interpretation for the homeboundedness of critical industrial R&#38;D: the stickiness of core R&#38;D projects to domestic locations is related not only to organizational inertia and the unripe maturation of subsidiaries, as suggested by prior literature, but particularly to the headquarters centralization of intellectual property (IP) management, which offers a high level of appropriability of R&#38;D results. The unequal distribution of appropriability across corporate R&#38;D networks is at the base of the formation of safe nests, domestic R&#38;D centers that are sheltered from the forces of globalization because they offer a desirable setting for the exploitation of technologies deriving from a stronger coordination of inventive activities with the management of IP.", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Safe nests in global nets: Internationalization and appropriability of R&#38;D in wireless telecom", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v42/n7/full/jibs201116a.html", "ex:pages": "910-934", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Alberto Di Minin", "Mattia Bianchi"]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "Innovation processes in multinational enterprises (MNE) are largely context specific, and carried out at the subsidiary level. Therefore, corporate headquarters (HQ) involvement in these processes becomes a major issue. A typical assumption in international business (IB) theory is that HQ, based on its own knowledge, makes rational choices about its own involvement. However, according to some studies, HQ involvement can be assumed to be less rational, in the sense that it reflects not HQ knowledge but the normative expectations associated with the role of HQ as top manager. The purpose of this paper is to contrast these two perspectives by exploring their implications regarding the relationship between HQ knowledge about and HQ involvement in innovation processes at the subsidiary level, and regarding the impact of this potential involvement on innovation processes performance. The analysis results in six propositions and an illustrative case. Our contribution to IB research is primarily theoretical: we bring to the scene an alternative approach &ndash; the sheer ignorance perspective &ndash; with the potential to explain the behavior of key actors in the MNE. We argue, however, that the theoretical conflict between the two perspectives should be addressed by empirical research. We conclude with suggestions for the directions such research might take.", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Rationality vs ignorance: The role of MNE headquarters in subsidiaries&rsquo; innovation processes", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v42/n7/full/jibs201124a.html", "ex:pages": "958-970", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Francesco Ciabuschi", "Mats Forsgren", "Oscar Mart&iacute;n Mart&iacute;n"]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "Recognizing the ongoing industrial revolution: The lessons of business historyOne of the first tenets of international business (IB) is that it spans multiple disciplines. Yet driven by the need to publish in specialist journals or by the disciplinary expertise of individual authors, most studies at best pay lip service to this aspect of the field. It is perfectly possible to do deep and meaningful IB research through a single disciplinary lens. However, using the analytical tools of multiple disciplines can make for richer analysis (Agrawal &#38; Hoetker, 2007). Frederick Guy&apos;s ambitious book is an attempt at such an inquiry.Guy begins with a survey of the historical roots of IB. The economic and business world that we see today is the result of actions, strategies and events accumulated over a long historical time span (Jones &#38; Khanna, 2006). Recognizing the historical roots of the current business environment greatly improves our understanding. Yet with few exceptions (Cantwell, 2000; Wilkins, 1974), IB scholars devote little attention to historical perspectives.The historical perspective enables us to see the deeper long-term processes that underpin current developments. For example, the technological revolution represented by the microprocessor and the internet resonates with the one brought about by electricity over a century ago. The strategic problems faced by Bill Gates and Microsoft have much in common with those faced by Thomas Edison and General Electric.The long-term perspective enables us to recognize the industrial revolution that is currently taking place. The first industrial revolution moved value creation from the direct application of human labor to tangible assets like industrial plants and machinery. At present the source of value is been shifting, at an accelerating pace, from tangible assets to intangible knowledge assets based on marketing (brands, logistics) and R&#38;D (patents, software, know-how) (Mudambi, 2008). As Guy points out, the localized contextualization of this knowledge creates &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; points in geographical space like Silicon Valley and the Italian industrial districts. These technology clusters are the hotbeds of innovation and new industries; studying their linkages with one another is the next frontier in IB research. Best&apos;s analytical review makes clear that this book is a valuable addition to the IB scholarly canon.Ram MudambiJIBS Book Review EditorREFERENCESAgrawal, R., &#38; Hoetker, G. 2007.

If so, which ones work? We draw inferences from the Japanese banking crisis of the 1990s using a hand-gathered database of bank loans gathered from original sources. Our results indicate that whereas risk-based capital infusions in Japan (similar to those following the 2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (stress tests) in the US) were successful in stimulating aggregate lending by Japanese banks, earlier blanket infusions (comparable to the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in the US) were not effective. Moreover, changes in accounting rules in Japan that revalued bank assets (similar to the relaxation of mark-to-market requirements for banks in the US) did not increase aggregate Japanese bank lending, but rather reallocated it. Capital constraints during the crisis also induced many Japanese banks to close their overseas branches and switch their charters from international to domestic. This endogenous charter switch reversed the process of foreign direct investment (FDI) for many Japanese banks. Therefore we use the Japanese banking crisis as a natural experiment to test FDI theories and find empirical support for the relative access hypothesis, but not for the industrial organization approach or for the relative wealth hypothesis.", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Foreign direct investment and regulatory remedies for banking crises: Lessons from Japan", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v42/n7/full/jibs201117a.html", "ex:pages": "875-893", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Linda Allen", "Suparna Chakraborty", "Wako Watanabe"]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "As shown in the international business literature, the ability of controlling owners to extract private benefits is greater in countries with weaker legal institutions. In these countries, providing credible financial information could play an especially important role in reducing information asymmetry between private firms and external providers of finance. For our sample of firms across 68 countries, we find that firms with greater financial reporting credibility (i.e., annual financial statements reviewed by an external auditor) experience significantly lower perceived problems in gaining access to external finance. Further, the impact of financial credibility in reducing financing constraints in the presence of a controlling owner is more pronounced in countries with weaker creditor rights.

The criticality of this trade-off appears in stark relief when the UN&apos;s Human Development Index is graphed against the earth&apos;s current bio-capacity. The earth&apos;s bio-capacity is characterized by the ecological footprint, the ratio of the demand for products divided by the availability of resources. In 1980, a few countries appeared in the rectangle marking the intersection of &ldquo;high human development&rdquo; and &ldquo;a sustainable ecological footprint&rdquo;; by 2006, there were none (Ewing et al., 2009). Countries with sustainable ecological footprints, primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa, have low levels of human development. Countries with high levels of human development, typified by the OECD, have unsustainable ecological footprints.While this represents a challenge for all international business (IB) scholars, it is particularly relevant for technology scholars and those who study international institutions. Technology scholars are concerned with the supply side of the trade-off. Improving technology guided by appropriate technology policy increases the bio-capacity of the earth by making possible high human development with fewer resources or the discovery or invention of new resources (Smith, Vo&szlig;, &#38; Grin, 2010). International institutions mainly work on the demand side, by addressing the problems of negative externalities that give rise to &ldquo;tragedies of the commons&rdquo; (Mudambi &#38; Navarra, 2002). Relatively poor, emerging economies are less willing to sacrifice economic growth on the altar of sustainability than are prosperous ones. Institutional rather than ad hoc solutions are necessary to resolve these understandably different ideological viewpoints.Lundan&apos;s review analyzes a very important attempt by IB scholars to come to grips with this crucial challenge. She reviews the literature, places the research in context and makes cogent arguments that suggest important directions for new research.Ram MudambiJIBS Book Review EditorREFERENCESEwing, B., Goldfinger, S., Oursler, A., Reed, A., Moore, D., &#38; Wackernagel, M. 2009.

However, as subsidiaries evolve, commitments may be decreased as well as increased, a phenomenon that has rarely been studied. Moreover, it remains an open question why strategic intentions at the outset of an investment project differ from the actual operations established. We address these questions by extending the model and combining it with Mintzberg and Waters&rsquo; framework of strategy formation. Specifically, we suggest that commitment decisions correspond to statements of intended strategy, while network positions correspond to realized strategies. The processes of learning, opportunity creation and trust building triggered by commitment decisions are, however, moderated by institutional influences that lead to divergences between realized and intended strategies. We test propositions derived from this framework on a survey data set of subsidiaries of multinational enterprises in Hungary, Lithuania and Poland, and find that institutional voids and institutional uncertainty affect subsidiary strategy implementation, but in opposing directions. Under high institutional uncertainty, investors prefer low commitment but flexible modes that enable later commitment increases, whereas institutional voids increase up-front information search and adaptation costs that reduce the likelihood of early post-entry adjustments.
