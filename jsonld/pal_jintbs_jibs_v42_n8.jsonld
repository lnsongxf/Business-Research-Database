[{"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "Today, more firms are expanding rapidly into foreign markets to reach global scale quickly, and to capture or nullify first-mover advantages. These trends run counter to the conventional theory of gradual internationalization, which suggests that firms maximize the benefits of learning from prior experience, thereby minimizing the hazard of failure. We argue that this conventional wisdom does not consider the risk of being a perennial late mover in the face of increased global competition. This study explores the circumstances under which rapid FDI expansion, a strategy of undertaking FDI expansion at an accelerated speed, can be a viable strategy. Using data on Korean firm expansion, we find that rapid FDI expansion enhances firm performance in industries where globalization pressures are high, and when it is done by firms with superior internal resources and capabilities.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:title": "Rapid FDI expansion and firm performance", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v42/n8/full/jibs201130a.html", "ex:pages": "979-994", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Sea-Jin Chang"}, {"ex:name": "Jay Hyuk Rhee"}]}, {"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "Do family firms benefit more from a regional or a global geographic scope? We suggest it depends on their family leadership type &ndash; family vs non-family leadership. We offer a nuanced view of agency and stewardship theories to hypothesize that family leaders are most beneficial when pursuing a regional strategy (i.e., high home-region focus (HRF)), whereas non-family leaders are more advantageous when pursing a global strategy (i.e., low HRF). Utilizing a sample of 202 Western European firms from 1996 to 2006, we find support for this central hypothesis.

Using data from close to 10,000 firms from more than 30 emerging markets, this paper investigates how, over time, leverage is determined by firms&rsquo; business models, and also by the overall country environment. I find significant changes over the last two decades. In the early 1990s, country characteristics dominated firm characteristics, and it was difficult for firms to overcome the limitations of their domestic environment. As emerging markets became better integrated with the world economy, the importance of firm characteristics has increased. At the end of the sample period, emerging-market capital structure determinants resemble those of developed markets, and country characteristics have become less important in explaining financing structures. I also show how, over the last two decades, the maturity structure of debt has changed, and that in recent years firms with more tangible assets are able to attract more debt financing. Overall, I conclude that financing choices in emerging markets are now being made in the same way as in developed markets. This means that emerging-market firms now rely much more on their own strengths when obtaining debt than on country characteristics.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:title": "Global convergence of financing policies: Evidence for emerging-market firms", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v42/n8/full/jibs201127a.html", "ex:pages": "1043-1059", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Nuno Fernandes"}]}, {"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "&ldquo;Born global&rdquo; firms are not actually &ldquo;born&rdquo; global, but rather internationalize rapidly from their inception by expanding their geographic scope and extent of foreign operations. However, it remains unclear whether such firms: (1) simultaneously expand along both dimensions; (2) focus on expanding along a single dimension at a given time, and switch interchangeably between expanding geographic scope and extent of foreign operations in subsequent periods; or (3) stick solely to a specific internationalization path over several subsequent periods. This study theorizes and empirically demonstrates that born global firms stick to a dominant internationalization path over subsequent periods. Arguably, this phenomenon reflects managerial efforts to reduce the perceived risk of internationalization, and their preference to develop and leverage capabilities that are specific to either of the internationalization paths until the economies of further expanding this path are exhausted.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:title": "Sequencing the expansion of geographic scope and foreign operations by &ldquo;born global&rdquo; firms", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v42/n8/full/jibs201131a.html", "ex:pages": "995-1015", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Niron Hashai"}]}, {"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "This paper investigates the effect of corporate globalization on bank loan contracts, as reflected in both price and non-price loan terms.
