Shenkar understands his target audience. Those in that target community of IB scholars studying cultural distance&apos;s (CD) associations with foreign direct investment (FDI) might read this paper as relatively radical. Culture scholars sometimes interpret the discussion of cultural friction (CF) as competing with, even slighting by omission, their corpus of work on contact and interaction. Both readings are false, and forced comparison with two later papers reveals retrospective bias at work. It further reveals CF as a metaphor, not theory; it is not a research agenda &ldquo;assigned to the field&rdquo;, even if it becomes a personal project for the author. Rhetorical theory is the basis to compare the reasoning of appeals and emotion. The discussion considers whether academic change agents might consider more use of emotion. Bringing Shenkar into focus enriches our appreciation for its impressive craftsmanship as well as its scholarship.

We draw upon recent advances in the entrepreneurship literature to propose that the relationship between start-up rates and innovation is not uniformly positive, as expected by the early scholars of entrepreneurship, but instead depends on the country&apos;s stage of development. The relationship is positive in the developed countries, but negative in countries in early development stages. On balance, there is a weak negative association between start-up rates and innovation. We test our hypotheses on a multi-source dataset that covers 35 countries over the period from 1996 to 2002. The relationships are robust to the choice of three moderators and two dependent variables, as well as a number of post-hoc tests. Our findings indicate that broad-strokes policy efforts that aim at promotion of entrepreneurship as a means to boost country innovativeness may be misguided, and instead suggest a contingency approach.", "ex:volume": "43", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Start-up rates and innovation: A cross-country examination", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v43/n1/full/jibs201147a.html", "ex:pages": "41-60", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Sergey Anokhin", "Joakim Wincent"]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "This study explores the effect of coordination needs on alliance governance.

We also study contextual factors, represented by the distance between the intellectual property protection regimes of the home countries of the participants, the focal firm&apos;s prior presence in the alliance country and its primary expertise in the industry.

The paper questioned the validity of the measure; the resultant findings obtained in such international business applications as foreign direct investment patterns, sequence, entry mode, and performance; and, ultimately, the wisdom of continuing the use of the measure and its underlying construct.

Foreign affiliates may be able to improve their social legitimacy and overcome LOF by demonstrating social commitment to host-country constituents through corporate social responsibility (CSR). If LOF is positively related to the distance between the home and host countries, and CSR activities confer social legitimacy benefits on foreign affiliates, we should expect CSR activities and distance to be positively related. However, we argue that, despite this potential motivation, foreign affiliates from more distant home countries are in fact less likely to engage in host-country CSR. Our argument focuses on the ways in which distance affects the MNE&apos;s willingness and ability to engage in CSR abroad. We also predict that host-country CSR reputation negatively moderates this relationship. Using Community Reinvestment Act data for foreign bank affiliates from 32 countries in the United States over 1990&ndash;2007, we find strong support for our hypotheses.

The idea of distance, however, has intrinsic value. Moreover, its considerable appeal and undeniable effectiveness have made it a well-entrenched construct. Therefore we see merit in redressing its weaknesses, and offer several suggestions for doing so. These include allowing for the influence of firm-level characteristics that either moderate the effects of distance or render distance &ndash; at least in part &ndash; subjective with varying consequences for different MNEs; maintaining directionality by distinguishing between distance and the tendency toward a particular characteristic and acknowledging asymmetry; and conceptualizing the effects of distance and the mechanisms through which it operates more carefully by drawing on concepts and measures from a variety of disciplines.
