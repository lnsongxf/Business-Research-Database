[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Do domestic firms benefit from the presence of foreign multinational firms? The FDI spillovers literature addresses this very issue, primarily examining whether the presence of foreign firms in a host market leads to technology spillovers and upgrading in domestic firms. A key finding is that spillovers depend on the absorptive capacity of the domestic firm. Yet, in conceptualizing absorptive capacity, scholars have largely overlooked how social structure shapes it. Integrating insights from social networks, technology upgrading, and innovation literatures, I emphasize that a domestic firm&apos;s ability to absorb spillovers depends on the social structure it is embedded in. I argue that ties with foreign firms reduce the constraints that domestic firms usually face in searching for and transferring in foreign technologies. However, while search benefits from sparse network structures, transfer is facilitated by cohesive ones. Also, while affect-based ties might motivate foreign firms sufficiently to share information with domestic firms at the search stage, reciprocal benefits and social monitoring conferred by common third-party ties are necessary in the transfer stage. Any effect of ties also depends on the routine repertoire of domestic firms. Put together, these arguments offer a more socialized account of the spillover process.", "ex:volume": "43", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Social structure and technology spillovers from foreign to domestic firms", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v43/n3/full/jibs20122a.html", "ex:pages": "244-263", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Alex Eapen"}]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "This study investigates the effect of state ownership on Chinese firms&rsquo; foreign direct investment (FDI) ownership decisions. It adopts a political perspective to extend the application of institutional theory in international business research. Specifically, it examines firms&rsquo; heterogeneous responses to external institutional processes during foreign market entry, while taking into consideration the political affiliation of firms with the external institutions. We argue that state ownership creates the political affiliation of a firm with its home-country government, which increases the firm&apos;s resource dependence on home-country institutions, while at the same time influencing its image as perceived by host-country institutional constituents. Such resource dependence and political perception increase firms&rsquo; tendency to conform to, rather than resist, isomorphic institutional pressures. We tested our hypotheses using primary data for 132 FDI entries made by Chinese firms during 2000&ndash;2006, and we found that the effects of home regulatory, host regulatory and host normative pressures on a firm to choose a joint ownership structure were stronger when the share of equity held by state entities in the firm was high.", "ex:volume": "43", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "State ownership effect on firms&apos; FDI ownership decisions under institutional pressure: a study of Chinese outward-investing firms", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v43/n3/full/jibs20121a.html", "ex:pages": "264-284", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Lin Cui"}, {"ex:name": "Fuming Jiang"}]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "For international companies, the literature recommends directing segmentation efforts at customer characteristics rather than country characteristics. Consumers&rsquo; degree of cosmopolitan orientation has been suggested as a powerful segmentation base, as this characteristic is expected to drive consumers&rsquo; tastes and preferences. To advance research on this segmentation base, this article offers a conceptualization of the consumer cosmopolitanism construct by: (1) delineating its conceptual domain; (2) highlighting its key dimensions, namely open-mindedness, diversity appreciation, and consumption transcending borders; and (3) examining its links with theoretically relevant variables, specifically consumer ethnocentrism and global consumption orientation. Based on the aforementioned conceptualization, a consumer-research-specific and psychometrically sound measurement instrument &ndash; the C-COSMO scale &ndash; is subsequently developed and tested in a series of complementary studies. Finally, empirically based insights into the characteristics of cosmopolitan consumers are offered, by: (1) profiling them on consumption-relevant variables (innovativeness, risk aversion, susceptibility to normative influence, consumer ethnocentrism, and demographic characteristics); (2) examining the link between consumer cosmopolitanism and willingness to buy foreign products; and (3) developing an empirically based typology of cosmopolitan/local consumers using a cluster analysis approach. From a managerial perspective, findings suggest that the identification and subsequent targeting of cosmopolitan consumers may well represent an appropriate strategy for internationally active companies.", "ex:volume": "43", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Cosmopolitan consumers as a target group for segmentation", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v43/n3/full/jibs201151a.html", "ex:pages": "285-305", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Petra Riefler"}, {"ex:name": "Adamantios Diamantopoulos"}, {"ex:name": "Judy A Siguaw"}]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "This paper explores how climate change affects multinational enterprises (MNEs), focusing on the challenges they face in overcoming liabilities and filling institutional voids related to the issue. Climate change is characterized by institutional failures, because there is neither an enforceable global agreement nor a market morality. Climate change is also a distinctive international business issue, as its institutional failures materialize differently in different countries. As governments are still highly involved, MNEs need to consider carefully their strategies to cope with non-market forces, including their embeddedness in multiple institutional settings. Using some illustrative examples of MNE responses to climate-related components in stimulus packages, we explore MNEs&rsquo; balancing act concerning their institutional embeddedness (or lack thereof) in home, host and supranational contexts as input for further research on the dynamics of MNE activities in relation to climate change.", "ex:volume": "43", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Multinational enterprises and climate change: Exploring institutional failures and embeddedness", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v43/n3/full/jibs201156a.html", "ex:pages": "332-341", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Jonatan Pinkse"}, {"ex:name": "Ans Kolk"}]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "This essay builds on the exposition by Thomas et al. and focuses on analyzing cause and effect in international business research.

Instead of being distributed equally, economic resources are agglomerated in specific countries, or even regions, and the subsidiaries located in these different environments have a heterogeneous resource configuration. This implies that dimensions of space related to geography and subsidiary network relationships may affect how the firm is managed. This paper investigates how spatial and contextual distance within multinational enterprises affects headquarters resource allocation to specific innovation transfer projects between subsidiaries. In brief, the results suggest that sub-national factors, such as the structure of the subsidiary network, offer a strong explanation for headquarters resource allocation. Positive and negative effects of national factors were also found, which implies that distance matters for headquarters resource allocation activities. By integrating the organizational and geographic dimensions, this paper contributes to knowledge about the drivers of headquarters resource allocation to subsidiaries, thereby extending theories related to how subsidiaries can evolve within the multinational enterprise with support from headquarters.", "ex:volume": "43", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "The effects of spatial and contextual factors on headquarters resource allocation to MNE subsidiaries", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v43/n3/full/jibs201157a.html", "ex:pages": "219-243", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Henrik Dellestrand"}, {"ex:name": "Philip Kappen"}]}]
