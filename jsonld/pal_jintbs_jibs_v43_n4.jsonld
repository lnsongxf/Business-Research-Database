[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Market liberalization in emerging-market economies and the entry of multinational firms spur significant changes to the industry/institutional environment faced by domestic firms. Prior studies have described how such changes tend to be disruptive to the relatively backward domestic firms, and negatively affect their performance and survival prospects. In this paper, we study how domestic supplier firms may adapt and continue to perform, as market liberalization progresses, through catch-up strategies aimed at integrating with the industry&apos;s global value chain. Drawing on internalization theory and the literatures on upgrading and catch-up processes, learning and relational networks, we hypothesize that, for continued performance, domestic supplier firms need to adapt their strategies from catching up initially through technology licensing/collaborations and joint ventures with multinational enterprises (MNEs) to also developing strong customer relationships with downstream firms (especially MNEs). Further, we propose that successful catch-up through these two strategies lays the foundation for a strategy of knowledge creation during the integration of domestic industry with the global value chain. Our analysis of data from the auto components industry in India during the period 1992&ndash;2002, that is, the decade since liberalization began in 1991, offers support for our hypotheses.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "43", "ex:title": "Catch-up strategies in the Indian auto components industry: Domestic firms&rsquo; responses to market liberalization", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v43/n4/full/jibs20124a.html", "ex:pages": "368-395", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Arun Kumaraswamy"}, {"ex:name": "Ram Mudambi"}, {"ex:name": "Haritha Saranga"}, {"ex:name": "Arindam Tripathy"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Firms face disadvantages when operating abroad. To overcome these disadvantages, foreign firms often adopt mitigating strategies. One such strategy is to imitate the practices of domestic firms (i.e., pursuing a strategy of local isomorphism). We understand little, however, about how firms vary in the extent of local isomorphism. To fill that gap, this paper explores the institutional drivers of local isomorphism decisions. The findings indicate that foreign firms choose a higher level of local isomorphism as the cultural, economic, and regulatory distances between the home country and the host country increase. Moreover, the evidence suggests that such local isomorphism is relatively enduring, as experience does not systematically moderate the relationship between distance and local isomorphism.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "43", "ex:title": "Institutional distance and local isomorphism strategy", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v43/n4/full/jibs20123a.html", "ex:pages": "343-367", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Robert Salomon"}, {"ex:name": "Zheying Wu"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Surveying 6509 managers from 24 countries/geopolitical entities, we tested the process through which individualism&ndash;collectivism at the country level relates to employees&rsquo; appraisals of and reactions to three types of work demands (i.e., work hours, workload, and organizational constraints). Our multilevel modeling results suggested that, while working the same number of hours, employees from individualistic countries reported a higher perceived workload than their counterparts in collectivistic countries. Furthermore, relationships of perceived workload and organizational constraints with job dissatisfaction and turnover intentions were stronger in individualistic than in collectivistic countries. Importantly, results of supplementary analyses suggested that the cultural value of individualism&ndash;collectivism moderated the mediation effect of perceived workload between work hours and both job dissatisfaction and turnover intentions.

Although our work modestly supports the optimal contracting theory-based expectation that compensation is positively associated with performance, it also reveals considerable cross-country variability in this relationship. We trace this variance to differences in the level of development of the formal and informal institutions protecting investors against managerial overcompensation and underperformance. In terms of intentionally devised and enforced formal institutions, we find significant positive moderating effects on the focal relationship of the rule of law and strength of investor protection variables. For self-enforcing informal institutions, we find similar effects for concentrated ownership and compensation-related entries in codes of good corporate governance. We also find that formal and informal institutions function in a complementary manner in shaping the performance sensitivity of executive compensation. The focal relationship becomes stronger when concentrated owners have access to well-functioning courts, and when informal norms of good governance are supported by shareholder protection laws. Our study thus suggests that optimal contracting theory must be supplemented with an institution-based view, to account for the conditioning effects of institutions on national contracting environments.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "43", "ex:title": "An institution-based view of executive compensation: A multilevel meta-analytic test", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v43/n4/full/jibs20126a.html", "ex:pages": "396-423", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Marc van Essen"}, {"ex:name": "Pursey PMAR Heugens"}, {"ex:name": "Jordan Otten"}, {"ex:name": "J (Hans) van Oosterhout"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "This paper integrates research on personality, dissonance and social networks to explore how expatriate interactions with host-country nationals (HCNs) are associated with expatriate effectiveness.
