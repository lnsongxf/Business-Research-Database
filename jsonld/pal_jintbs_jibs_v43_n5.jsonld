The present paper contextualizes the well-researched relationship between asset specificity and foreign market entry mode choice by introducing knowledge safeguards (international experience, host-country networks, and imitation) and institutional safeguards (property rights protection and cultural proximity) as alternative mechanisms for securing a firm&apos;s specific assets. Testing our hypotheses on a sample of 206 small and medium-sized enterprises, we find that knowledge safeguards and institutional safeguards weaken the effect of asset specificity on the choice of equity foreign market entry modes.

However, they create new challenges, and they are still not frequently used in IB research. In this editorial we outline some key methodological issues for the uses of MLM in IB, including criteria, sample size, and measure equivalence issues. We then examine promising directions for future multilevel IB research considering comparative opportunities at nation, multiple-nation cluster, and within-nation region levels, including large multilevel databases.

We applied the information-processing lens in global BPO and developed the logic that internationally disaggregated process integration requires a fit between process integration and BPO&apos;s task characteristics (i.e., task complexity and security) and task interdependence (task connectivity, stickiness, and dependency). This alignment is further moderated by the task context, such as the geographic dispersion of the global client&apos;s end-customers and the type of offshore provider (independent vendor vs captive and joint venture). Finally, we suggest that process integration has a positive but curvilinear relationship with the economic returns achieved by offshore providers. Our analysis of 308 BPO companies in India and China supports our propositions. We conclude that international managers monitoring and integrating globally disaggregated activities in BPO should establish a proper alignment with the BPO project&apos;s task traits and task interdependence, and look closely at the conditioning effect of external complexity.
