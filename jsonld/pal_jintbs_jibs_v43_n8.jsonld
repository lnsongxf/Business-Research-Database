[{"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "It is widely acknowledged in the international business literature that subsidiaries can make a strategic contribution to multinational corporations (MNCs). Departing from the common focus on subsidiary role, contexts and organizational MNC factors, this study explores the micro-level details of managers&rsquo; actions and interactions. We conducted an in-depth qualitative study into 38 problem-solving processes employed across four subsidiaries. Taking a non-routine problem-solving perspective on how subsidiaries contribute strategically to renewing MNC competences, this paper uncovers four problem-solving approaches: local template adaptation; superior technology creation; local template creation; and global principle creation. The findings depict how the way problems are framed influences knowledge search and solution-finding activities, and how these different activities may result in local and global solutions. The paper extends insights into MNC innovation and subsidiary initiative by detailing how subsidiary managers navigate different problem-solving approaches, and contributes to discussions on the micro-foundations and social aspects of MNC knowledge flows, revealing factors that trigger distance-spanning knowledge search.", "ex:volume": "43", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Problem solving in MNCs: How local and global solutions are (and are not) created", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v43/n8/full/jibs201225a.html", "ex:pages": "746-771", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Esther Tippmann"}, {"ex:name": "Pamela Sharkey Scott"}, {"ex:name": "Vincent Mangematin"}]}, {"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "As organizations globalize, culturally based variation in the ways employees conceptualize their relationships with their employers increases in importance. In the competition for talent, organizations must understand employee preferences and expectations regarding their treatment by the firm. Recently, culture&apos;s influence on the psychological contract (individual perceptions of employer obligations) has been noted with regard to the extent that employees perceive their psychological contracts as relational or transactional. We provide results from a survey conducted in a multinational corporation (MNC) indicating that the cultural value of collectivist orientation likely has its effect on the psychological contract through beliefs about the nature of social exchange. Data were consistent with creditor exchange ideology (appropriateness of giving more than has been received) mediating the relationship between collectivist orientation and perceptions of a relational psychological contract. By examining this relationship empirically, we go beyond the demonstration of cultural effects to describe an intermediate mechanism through which culture operates. Exchange norms are likely to play a mediating role in a variety of cross-cultural relationships, and may be used by managers as a lever to improve relationships with employees, as opposed to engaging in attempts to change individual cultural orientation.", "ex:volume": "43", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Collectivist orientation and the psychological contract: Mediating effects of creditor exchange ideology", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v43/n8/full/jibs201217a.html", "ex:pages": "772-782", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Elizabeth C Ravlin"}, {"ex:name": "Yuan Liao"}, {"ex:name": "Daniel L Morrell"}, {"ex:name": "Kevin Au"}, {"ex:name": "David C Thomas"}]}, {"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "This paper extends research on experiential learning of foreign subsidiaries by exploring the temporal conditions under which a foreign subsidiary can benefit from the experience of its sister subsidiaries. Building upon organizational evolution and learning literature, we propose that differences in entry timing among sister subsidiaries provide structural conditions that bound the opportunities for inter-subsidiary learning. We argue that different entry cohorts of sister subsidiaries are beneficial to a focal subsidiary, as they provide non-redundant, complementary experience from their different operational stages, and ignite the motivation to learn. Our empirical analysis of Japanese foreign subsidiaries provides strong evidence that survival is enhanced by the experience of different entry cohorts of sister subsidiaries, but not by that of similar cohorts. Qualitative evidence also shows that multiple channels of experience exchange across sister subsidiaries lead to actual learning. We further show that the survival benefit derived from different cohorts is contingent on the level of environmental change, as well as on the level of experience of the focal subsidiary and its parent firm. Our research highlights the importance of temporal heterogeneity in the internationalization process, and offers implications for the temporal strategy of multinational companies.", "ex:volume": "43", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Learning from age difference: Interorganizational learning and survival in Japanese foreign subsidiaries", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v43/n8/full/jibs201219a.html", "ex:pages": "719-745", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Young-Choon Kim"}, {"ex:name": "Jane W Lu"}, {"ex:name": "Mooweon Rhee"}]}, {"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "We investigate how the characteristics and experience of the entrepreneurial founding team (EFT) affect the export orientation and subsequent performance of the businesses they establish, while allowing for the mutually reinforcing relationship between exporting and productivity. Using a sample of UK technology-based firms, we hypothesise and confirm that the set of EFT human capital needed for entering export markets is different from that required for succeeding in export markets. Commercial and managerial experience helps firms become exporters, but once over the exporting hurdle it is education, both general and specific, that has a substantially positive effect. The overall pattern of human capital effects on productivity is similar to those for export propensity. We also find evidence that productive firms are more likely both to enter export markets and to be export intensive, and that exporting boosts subsequent firm productivity.", "ex:volume": "43", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Export propensity, export intensity and firm performance: The role of the entrepreneurial founding team", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v43/n8/full/jibs201216a.html", "ex:pages": "693-718", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Panagiotis Ganotakis"}, {"ex:name": "James H Love"}]}]
