[{"ex:issue": "9", "ex:abstract": "Based on Whitley&apos;s &ldquo;national business systems&rdquo; (NBS) institutional framework, we theorize about and empirically investigate the impact of nation-level institutions on firms&rsquo; corporate social performance (CSP). Using a sample of firms from 42 countries spanning seven years, we construct an annual composite CSP index for each firm, based on social and environmental metrics. We find that the political system, followed by the labor and education system, and the cultural system are the most important NBS categories of institutions that impact CSP. Interestingly, the financial system appears to have a relatively less significant impact.

Drawing on a field study of 101 subsidiaries in Japan, we develop a contingency model that distinguishes between four different types of recontextualization with characteristic language policies and practices: developing/locally adaptive, developing/globally integrated, established/locally adaptive, and established/globally integrated. Our analysis shows how each of these four types is accompanied by specific problems and challenges. In particular, it elucidates five important aspects of language implementation: (1) the emergence of language praxis from the interplay of headquarters strategies and local responses; (2) the hybridization of language practices; (3) the central role of key actors such as subsidiary presidents in recontextualization; (4) the pervasive power implications of language policies and practices; and (5) the multifaceted implications for strategic human resource management. By so doing, our analysis opens up new avenues for context-specific and practice-oriented studies of language in multinational companies.", "ex:volume": "43", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Language policies and practices in wholly owned foreign subsidiaries: A recontextualization perspective", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v43/n9/full/jibs201228a.html", "ex:pages": "808-833", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Vesa Peltokorpi"}, {"ex:name": "Eero Vaara"}]}, {"ex:issue": "9", "ex:abstract": "Drawing on social capital theory and the international business literature, we argue that domestic geography, in terms of localized potential social capital, facilitates individual firms&rsquo; awareness of business opportunities, including knowledge related to involvement in the foreign markets for goods and technology, thereby enhancing firms&rsquo; involvement in those foreign markets. When potential social capital reaches a certain threshold, it may work to trap firms into operating only within their home regions, thus reducing involvement in foreign markets. We conjecture that firms&rsquo; research and development investment moderates the relationship between potential social capital and degree of involvement in foreign markets, but given the very different properties of the two markets, with different signs for each market: a positive moderation effect for the markets for goods, and a negative effect for the markets for technology.
