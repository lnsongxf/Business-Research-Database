[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Although national culture is an important regulator of entrepreneurship, there is a dearth of studies that: (1) explore the effects of national cultural practices on entrepreneurial behaviors by individuals; (2) use appropriate multilevel research designs; (3) consider the effects of culture on different entrepreneurial behaviors, such as entry and post-entry growth aspirations. We combined Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) and Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) data from 42 countries for 2005&ndash;2008 to address these gaps, using a multilevel design. We found societal institutional collectivism practices negatively associated with entrepreneurial entry, but positively associated with entrepreneurial growth aspirations. Uncertainty avoidance practices were negatively associated with entry but not with growth aspirations, and performance orientation practices were positively associated with entry. Our analysis highlights the differential effects of cultural practices on entrepreneurial entry and growth aspirations, and demonstrates the value of multilevel techniques in analyzing the effect of culture on entrepreneurship.", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Consequences of cultural practices for entrepreneurial behaviors", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n4/full/jibs201315a.html", "ex:pages": "334-362", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Erkko Autio"}, {"ex:name": "Saurav Pathak"}, {"ex:name": "Karl Wennberg"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "This paper examines how national culture, and collectivism in particular, influences corruption in bank lending. We hypothesize that interdependent self-construal and particularist norms in collectivist countries lead to a higher level of lending corruption through their influence both on the interactions between bank officers and bank customers and on the dynamics among bank colleagues. Using a sample covering 3835 firms across 38 countries, we find strong evidence that firms domiciled in collectivist countries perceive a higher level of lending corruption than firms domiciled in individualist countries. In terms of economic magnitude, the effect of collectivism is substantially larger than the effects of other cultural dimensions (uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, and power distance) and institutional factors identified in prior studies (bank supervision, bank competition, information sharing, and media monitoring). We further find that the positive relationship between collectivism and lending corruption is not driven by endogeneity, and that it is robust to different measures of bank corruption, different measures of collectivism, and different estimation methods. Finally, we find that the link between collectivism and lending corruption cannot be explained by the role of the government in the economy, political connections, biased responses from disgruntled borrowers, or relationship lending.", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Collectivism and corruption in bank lending", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n4/full/jibs201319a.html", "ex:pages": "363-390", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Xiaolan Zheng"}, {"ex:name": "Sadok El Ghoul"}, {"ex:name": "Omrane Guedhami"}, {"ex:name": "Chuck C Y Kwok"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Responding to increased demands from stakeholder groups, many companies have instituted corporate citizenship programs in recent years, leveraging their specialized resources to create public goods and services at home and abroad. Significant suspicion nonetheless remains about the motives and impact of corporations acting in domains traditionally served by government and &ldquo;third-sector&rdquo; organizations. We argue that such ambivalence undermines the perceived legitimacy of private investments in public goods, and that this fundamental liability of privateness (LOP) constitutes a significant obstacle to corporations acting in the public domain through corporate citizenship initiatives. For multinational corporations (MNCs), the challenges stemming from the LOP are further amplified by the liability of foreignness (LOF) commonly associated with international business operations. We discuss the origins of the LOP and derive implications of the &ldquo;dual liability&rdquo; of LOP and LOF for partnering choices in MNCs&rsquo; corporate citizenship programs. We highlight limitations on the set of credible governance mechanisms available to participants in these partnerships, describe a set of alternative governance arrangements that serve to realign incentives among alliance partners, and link these to the severity of the LOP in a particular setting.

However, employees from different countries vary in their levels of out-group trust. The aim of this study is therefore to capture national forces driving out-group trust. Based on Kramer&apos;s theorizing on the multiple bases of trust, we argue that, at the societal level, dispositional, categorization-based and rule-based trust influence employees&rsquo; out-group trust. In particular, we argue for dispositional and rule-based societal trust to increase, and for categorization-based societal trust to decrease employees&rsquo; out-group trust through different types of socialization. Using data on 25,622 employees from 42 countries, we find partial support for the coexistence of these bases of societal trust. Disentangling trust-forming and trust-impeding models, we find support for dispositional and rule-based societal trust as drivers of employees&rsquo; out-group trust, and for categorization-based societal trust as impeding employees&rsquo; out-group trust. In a combined model, however, rule-based trust is not significantly related to employees&rsquo; out-group trust. Considering the coexistence of trust and distrust, employees&rsquo; out-group trust develops through socialization effects conveying general trust in others (i.e., high dispositional trust) and the equality of social groups (i.e., low categorization-based trust).", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "National context and individual employees&rsquo; trust of the out-group: The role of societal trust", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n4/full/jibs20139a.html", "ex:pages": "312-333", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Miriam Muethel"}, {"ex:name": "Michael Harris Bond"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Using foreign institutional ownership data in the US from 1990 to 2007, we examine whether foreign institutional investors face liabilities of foreignness (LOF) in the US stock market.

More importantly, we find that a change in foreign institutional ownership is negatively related to future returns, whereas this relation does not exist for domestic institutional ownership. The negative relation between the change in foreign institutional ownership and future returns is more pronounced when investors face a greater LOF in the US stock market &ndash; for instance, when they are from countries with higher institutional distance, information asymmetry, unfamiliarity, and cultural differences. The negative effect of country-specific LOF factors on the return-forecasting power of foreign institutional investors is more evident when they trade stocks with higher information asymmetry.
