[{"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "The international business (IB) literature has mostly emphasized the impact of location and firm characteristics on location choices. However, industries with a significant presence of multinational enterprises (MNEs) are oligopolistic in nature, which suggests that rivalry among firms plays an important role in firms&rsquo; dynamic decision-making processes. This paper explores how rivalry and differential knowledge accumulation among competitors affect MNEs&rsquo; geographic expansion across time and markets. Specifically, we build a model in which two competing firms with different capabilities simultaneously decide a sequence of market entries. Following previous research, we allow the possibility that certain markets are closer (a better fit) to one firm than to the other, and that certain knowledge is more transferable across markets (less market specific). We then solve the model computationally, and identify three equilibrium strategies &ndash; avoid, collocate, and stronger-chases-weaker &ndash; depending on the initial relative firm capabilities, market attractiveness, market&ndash;firm fit, and knowledge transferability. By explicitly incorporating firm rivalry across multiple markets, our model offers a comprehensive approach to understanding the drivers behind MNEs&rsquo; sequential location choices, and offers alternative explanations for some important empirical observations in IB, such as bunching and second-mover advantage in market entries.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:title": "Firm rivalry, knowledge accumulation, and MNE location choices", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n5/full/jibs201318a.html", "ex:pages": "504-520", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Juan Alc&aacute;cer"}, {"ex:name": "Cristian L Dezs&odblac;"}, {"ex:name": "Minyuan Zhao"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "International business (IB) research has long acknowledged the importance of supranational regional factors in building models to explain phenomena such as where multinational corporations (MNCs) choose to locate. Yet criteria for defining regions based on similar factors vary substantially, thus undermining consensus regarding which regional grouping schemes fit IB research models better. In response, we develop and empirically validate a theory of comparative regional scheme assessment for model-building purposes assuming that: (1) schemes can be classified based on their source of similarity; and (2) schemes within the same similarity class can be assessed for their structural coherence, based on group contiguity and compactness. Schemes with better structural coherence will also exhibit better fit with IB research models. We document support for our theory in comparative analyses of regional schemes used to explain where US-based MNCs locate operations around the world. Geography-, culture- and trade and investment-based schemes with better structural coherence exhibit better initial fit with MNC location models and less change in fit after modest scheme refinement using a simulated annealing optimization algorithm. Our approach provides criteria for comparing similar regional grouping schemes and identifying &ldquo;best-in-class&rdquo; schemes tailored to models of MNC location choice and other IB research models.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:title": "How well do supranational regional grouping schemes fit international business research models&quest;", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n5/full/jibs201316a.html", "ex:pages": "451-474", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Ricardo Flores"}, {"ex:name": "Ruth V Aguilera"}, {"ex:name": "Arash Mahdian"}, {"ex:name": "Paul M Vaaler"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "Several trends that affect the manufacturing of sophisticated goods &ndash; increasing international fragmentation of production, and lean and modular process technologies &ndash; have increased the importance of proximity in the supply chain. We use the case of the European automotive industry to simultaneously evaluate the relative importance of three dimensions: geographical, cultural, and relational proximity. Using a rich and novel data set, we find that carmakers value some aspects of each dimension independently in their sourcing strategy. The estimates indicate which proximity measures provide the largest (independent) benefits, but also that the positive effects the literature has attributed to some measures tend to reflect past relationships rather than predict new ones. In particular, co-location and a low cultural distance should be interpreted as outcomes of a sourcing strategy, not as predictors for sourcing success.

Consistent with these arguments, our analysis of a large sample of MNE location decisions using a multilevel multinomial model suggests not only that MNEs have a strong propensity to locate within global cities, but also that these choices are associated with a nuanced interplay of firm- and subsidiary-level factors, including investment motives, proprietary capabilities, and business strategy.

In this paper we argue that international business (IB) research examining the spatial dimension has serious weaknesses, stemming from its traditional assumption of the country as the location unit of analysis. While border-crossing remains the key research context of IB, placing it within a general spatial framework that recognizes both international and subnational spatial heterogeneity opens up vast new vistas for research. Analyzing MNEs as border-crossing multi-location enterprises allows the researcher to distinguish between (discrete) border effects and (continuous) distance effects and undertake a more fine-grained analysis of location. Within such analysis national borders may appear as qualitative discontinuities in space, that is, points at which spatial heterogeneity changes abruptly. However, subnational spatial heterogeneity is often the characteristic that drives firm strategy as MNEs decide to locate in particular agglomerations and not at random locations within a country. The complex firms that IB scholars study typically include multiple units within the same country, so that a complete analysis requires considering both subnational distance effects as well as international border effects.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:title": "MNEs as border-crossing multi-location enterprises: The role of discontinuities in geographic space", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n5/full/jibs201323a.html", "ex:pages": "413-426", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Sjoerd Beugelsdijk"}, {"ex:name": "Ram Mudambi"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "This study investigates the widely overlooked phenomenon of multinational enterprise (MNE) location avoidance, utilizing a multi-method research design and data on 131 foreign investment locations.

An 11-item measure composed of travel inconveniences shows a significant negative moderating effect on the relationship between foreign direct investment potential and investment intensity.
