[{"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "This study examines the citations used in the global branding literature (GBL), and evaluates the knowledge structure of this area of research to date. Our bibliometric analysis involves an examination of 120 global branding articles in business-related research. We employ multidimensional scaling to reveal a range of intellectual influences that have helped shape the GBL. The foundation of knowledge in the GBL is uncovered by analyzing co-citation data to identify important topical influences in the formation of global branding research. The conceptual framework developed incorporates five areas with important implications for the future development of global branding as an area of inquiry. These major research topics in the GBL are international branding strategy, brand positioning, brand/country origin, brand concept-image, and brand performance. We leverage resource- and capability-based paradigms, and use the five underpinning knowledge groups to propose an agenda for future research that fills existing gaps and offers the potential to advance and enrich the GBL.", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "A bibliometric analysis of the global branding literature and a research agenda", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n6/full/jibs201320a.html", "ex:pages": "622-634", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Brian R Chabowski", "Saeed Samiee", "G Tomas M Hult"]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "This study focuses on the role of geography in foreign subsidiary survival in host countries afflicted by political conflict. We argue that survival is a function of exposure to conflicts, and depends on the characteristics of place (the conflict zone) and space (geographic concentration and dispersion of other home-country firms). The roles of place and space are explored using street-level analysis of geographic information systems data for 670 Japanese multinational enterprises (MNE) subsidiaries in 25 conflict-afflicted host countries over 1987&ndash;2006. Through dynamic modeling of conflict zones as stretchable and shrinkable places relative to subsidiary locations, we develop a means of characterizing a foreign subsidiary&apos;s exposure to multiple threats in its geographic domain. Our results show that greater exposure to geographically defined threats, in both a static and a dynamic sense, reduces the likelihood of MNE survival. The findings indicate, moreover, that both concentration and dispersion with other firms affect survival; however, the effects depend on where the firm is spatially located (whether the firm is in a conflict zone) and with whom (home-country peers or sister subsidiaries).", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Place, space, and geographical exposure: Foreign subsidiary survival in conflict zones", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n6/full/jibs201312a.html", "ex:pages": "554-578", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Li Dai", "Lorraine Eden", "Paul W Beamish"]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "Given the importance of location choice for accessing knowledge, we examine the location choices of domestic and foreign firms in an emerging economy after market liberalization. In the literature, co-locating with other firms has been associated with agglomerative economies and knowledge spillovers that lower the liability of foreignness for foreign firms. However, as domestic firms are trying to upgrade their capabilities, or &ldquo;catch up,&rdquo; they may also prefer locations with other firms, as these locations have knowledge spillover potential. We develop competing hypotheses to test the extent to which catch-up motivations affect location decisions. Examining the location choices of 501 domestic and 68 foreign firms for their R&#38;D laboratories in India during 2005&ndash;2010, we find that domestic firms exhibit a stronger preference for cities with high agglomeration than foreign firms do. This shows that upgrading motivations dominate location choice during periods of accelerated catch-up in emerging economies.", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Agglomeration, catch-up and the liability of foreignness in emerging economies", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n6/full/jibs201314a.html", "ex:pages": "579-606", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Anna Lamin", "Grigorios Livanis"]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "We use a comprehensive database of venture-capital-backed companies from China to test whether and how foreign venture capitalists (VCs) can facilitate international initial public offerings of entrepreneurial companies.

The propensity to list overseas is moderated by the number of venture backers, the fund&apos;s size, and governance in the domestic market.

Explanations for the mixed findings have important managerial implications, because business managers have to estimate accurately the costs of doing business within and across regions before they make their internationalization decisions. To explain the existing mixed findings, this study differentiates between liabilities of foreignness at the country and regional levels, and explores the joint effects of liability of country foreignness (LCF) and liability of regional foreignness (LRF) on the performance of internationalizing firms. Using data from 167 Canadian firms, we find that LCF may not necessarily be negatively correlated with intra-regional diversification, but LRF is positively correlated with inter-regional diversification. LCF moderates the relationship between LRF and inter-regional diversification, and also mediates the relationship between intra-regional diversification and firm performance. LRF mediates the relationship between inter-regional diversification and firm performance. Missing one or more of these variables may result in different cost estimates. Identification of the relationships between these variables helps to improve the accuracy of estimating the costs of doing business aboard.", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Liability of country foreignness and liability of regional foreignness: Their effects on geographic diversification and firm performance", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n6/full/jibs201321a.html", "ex:pages": "635-647", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Gongming Qian", "Lee Li", "Alan M Rugman"]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "The peer review process is widely used by academic journals, including the Journal of International Business Studies (JIBS), to evaluate the quality of manuscript submissions relative to the journals&rsquo; scholarly goals.

We also surveyed current JIBS action editors and found that, despite the importance of high-quality reviews for the advancement of the field, few recalled being formally trained or mentored on how to write them. To better understand the features of a good review, the editors rated the various features of the peer reviews on helpfulness, and they also rated how often these features are present in the reviews they receive.
