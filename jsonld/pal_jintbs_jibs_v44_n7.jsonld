[{"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "Scholars studying foreign direct investment (FDI) spillovers usually examine whether productivity gains in domestic firms can be attributed to the presence of foreign firms in their industry. However, empirical estimation is often based on datasets that omit certain kinds of firms in the economy. We argue that identifying FDI spillover effects in such incomplete datasets is problematic, owing to measurement error and selection problems. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that spillover effect estimates from incomplete datasets are potentially biased. We discuss the theoretical implications of this, and demonstrate a weighted instrumental variable approach that could yield better spillover effect estimates in incomplete datasets.", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "FDI spillover effects in incomplete datasets", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n7/full/jibs201332a.html", "ex:pages": "719-744", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Alex Eapen"}]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "This paper shows that value creation by multinational enterprises (MNEs) is the result of activities where geographic distance effects can be overcome. We submit that geographic distance has a relatively low impact on international research and development (R&#38;D) investments, owing to the spiky nature of innovation, and to the unique ability of MNEs to absorb and transfer knowledge on a global scale. On the one hand, MNEs need to set up their labs as close as possible to specialized technology clusters where valuable knowledge is concentrated, largely regardless of distance from their home base. On the other, MNEs have historically developed technical and organizational competencies that enable them to transfer knowledge within their internal networks and across technology clusters at relatively low cost. Using data on R&#38;D and manufacturing investments of 6320 firms in 59 countries, we find that geographic distance has a lower negative impact on the probability of setting up R&#38;D than manufacturing plants. Furthermore, once measures of institutional proximity are accounted for, MNEs are equally likely to set up R&#38;D labs in nearby or in more remote locations. This result is driven by MNEs based in Triad countries, whereas for non-Triad MNEs the effect of geographic distance on cross-border R&#38;D is negative and significant.", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "How remote are R&#38;D labs&quest; Distance factors and international innovative activities", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n7/full/jibs201330a.html", "ex:pages": "649-675", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Davide Castellani"}, {"ex:name": "Alfredo Jimenez"}, {"ex:name": "Antonello Zanfei"}]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "Less-developed countries benefit from being connected to technologically and economically advanced countries. The well-documented mechanisms for this cross-national flow of knowledge all involve interfirm connections, such as trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), and alliances. We examine the potential of a different mechanism &ndash; interpersonal ties abroad &ndash; that has only recently become practicable, owing to advances in communication and transportation technologies, globalization, and increased migration. We investigate when business knowledge obtained from interpersonal ties in more-developed countries is more useful than locally sourced knowledge. Using a sample of South African managers, we find that knowledge from more-developed countries is not always more useful. Rather, overseas knowledge is preferable when novel and accessible: that is, when new-to-the-industry knowledge is needed, when there is already a strong tie, and when the knowledge does not involve a long discussion. Conversely, local knowledge is preferable when new-to-the-industry knowledge is not needed, when the interpersonal tie is a weak tie, and when a longer discussion is warranted. This study demonstrates the value of connections between individuals in countries at different levels of development as sources of useful knowledge, and suggests that international business research will benefit from exploring further the networks of individuals in addition to those of firms.", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Connections to distant knowledge: Interpersonal ties between more- and less-developed countries", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n7/full/jibs201328a.html", "ex:pages": "676-698", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Daniel Z Levin"}, {"ex:name": "Helena Barnard"}]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "Granting of exclusive rights is an important consideration for firms using licensing as a mode of entry into foreign markets, as exclusive contracts reduce licensors&rsquo; flexibility in a given market during the term of the agreement. By granting exclusivity to a licensee with greater technological potential, the exchange partners can increase the potential transactional value of the licensing agreement. At the same time, a licensee with strong technological potential will increase the threat of transactional hazards due to underinvestment and rent appropriation. In this paper, we develop and empirically test a model that evaluates the balancing of transactional value and transaction costs in exclusive licensing. In particular, we identify the conditions under which exclusive contracts are likely to be granted to foreign licensees with strong technological potential. Empirical results from a multilevel model, based on 375 international licensing agreements of US firms in high-technology industries during 1995&ndash;2008, show that licensees with a stronger technological potential are more likely to be granted exclusive rights in countries with strong intellectual property rights protection, and in industries with a high rate of technological change; but are less likely to be granted exclusive rights when there is a high degree of overlap between licensor and licensee products.", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Licensee technological potential and exclusive rights in international licensing: A multilevel model", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n7/full/jibs201331a.html", "ex:pages": "699-718", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Preet S Aulakh"}, {"ex:name": "Marshall S Jiang"}, {"ex:name": "Sali Li"}]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "We explore the relation between individualism and horizons and types of corporate investment, based on individualism&rsquo;s implications for risk taking.

Moreover, the effect of individualism on long-term investment hinges on R&#38;D: firms in individualistic countries invest more in R&#38;D projects but not more in physical assets. To test whether risk taking is the channel through which individualism works, we employ two-stage ordinary least squares and other analyses to nullify alternative explanations, such as: (1) uncontrolled institutions determine both individualism and R&#38;D; and (2) firms in individualistic countries invest more in R&#38;D because they have higher investment efficiency, or pick less-risky R&#38;D projects. We further find that individualistic firms tend to employ excess cash to increase R&#38;D rather than increase dividends, and R&#38;D decisions are less reliant on internal financing but more responsive to growth opportunities in individualistic countries.", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "National culture and corporate investment", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n7/full/jibs201326a.html", "ex:pages": "745-763", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Liang Shao"}, {"ex:name": "Chuck C Y Kwok"}, {"ex:name": "Ran Zhang"}]}]
