[{"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "We investigate the association between a firm&rsquo;s political connections and its merger and acquisition (M&#38;A) performance. Using a sample of M&#38;A deals made by politically connected acquirers and their matched non-connected peers across 22 countries, we find that political connections play an economically significant role in post-merger performance. The nature of this effect depends on the institutional setting. In countries with strong legal systems or low levels of corruption, politically connected bidders underperform unconnected bidders by roughly 15&percnt; in terms of abnormal stock returns over a 3-year period. In contrast, politically connected bidders outperform unconnected bidders by more than 20&percnt; in countries with weak legal systems or high levels of corruption. We find more evidence of differential post-merger performance for domestic mergers than for cross-border mergers. Overall, our findings show that political connectedness has a significant influence on M&#38;A activities, and the nature of this influence depends crucially on the institutional environment.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:title": "Institutions and the performance of politically connected M&#38;As", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n8/full/jibs201337a.html", "ex:pages": "833-852", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Paul Brockman"}, {"ex:name": "Oliver M Rui"}, {"ex:name": "Huan Zou"}]}, {"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "Foreign subsidiaries of multinational corporations (MNCs) rely on external partners, such as channel partners, to achieve global objectives. We conceptualize the subsidiary&rsquo;s channel partner as an extended link of the MNC&rsquo;s internal network: thus, the subsidiary&rsquo;s adaptation and execution of the MNC&rsquo;s global strategies should influence the subsidiary&rsquo;s channel relationship and performance. Building on the strategy&ndash;environment alignment framework, we study the influence of MNC global strategies (global efficiency, multinational flexibility, and worldwide learning) on a subsidiary&rsquo;s channel commitment and the moderating influence of the host-country environment. Survey data from German and Japanese MNCs in the United States indicate the importance of global strategies to a channel relationship. For example, we find that an emphasis on multinational flexibility is detrimental, but worldwide learning benefits the subsidiary&rsquo;s channel commitment. We also find that the host-country environment plays a contingent role: for example, a global efficiency strategy is beneficial for channel commitment in a stable environment, but detrimental in a dynamic environment. Our research offers key implications for MNCs; we suggest that when MNCs decide to lay emphases on global strategies the MNCs should consider not just their internal subsidiary network, but also their extended channel partner links that function in foreign markets.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:title": "MNC subsidiary channel relationships as extended links: Implications of global strategies", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n8/full/jibs201334a.html", "ex:pages": "787-812", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Mahima Hada"}, {"ex:name": "Rajdeep Grewal"}, {"ex:name": "Murali Chandrashekaran"}]}, {"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "This paper examines how functional and line-management stakeholders evaluate operational human resource management capabilities in multinational corporation (MNC) subsidiaries. We suggest that such evaluations are a function of two key structural factors: (1) that focal subsidiary human resource (HR) departments respond differentially to the expectations of differently located stakeholders; and (2) that the structural position of the stakeholder determines what cues he or she relies upon to construct the evaluation. Our findings show that the focal HR subsidiary department is likely to exert more effort towards meeting the expectations of line-management stakeholders, and we suggest that this is a function of line management&rsquo;s co-location with the focal HR department. Second, we find that co-located line-management stakeholders are more likely to rely on experience-based cues when constructing evaluations, whereas headquarters-located functional stakeholders tend to rely on cognition-based evaluation, driven by their ability to compare across different subsidiary HR departments. We contribute to the literature by going beyond existing research that has tended to focus on evaluation from the perspective of organizational behavior, by providing a structural perspective on capability evaluation in MNCs that combines the insights of role theory and cognitive choice heuristics.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:title": "Explaining stakeholder evaluations of HRM capabilities in MNC subsidiaries", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n8/full/jibs201327a.html", "ex:pages": "813-832", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Kristiina Makelal;"}, {"ex:name": "Ingmar Bjorkman"}, {"ex:name": "Mats Ehrnrooth"}, {"ex:name": "Adam Smale"}, {"ex:name": "Jennie Sumelius"}]}, {"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "This study explores when foreign subsidiaries outperform comparable local firms by evaluating the performance of local firms acquired by multinationals vs continuing local firms.

We define this bias as a share of global R&#38;D activities conducted in the home country that is not proportional to the general attractiveness of the country for multinational firms&rsquo; R&#38;D activities. We find home bias to be the predominant pattern, but with substantial variation among firms. The extent of the bias increases with the degree of scale and scope economies in R&#38;D, the coordination costs of international R&#38;D, and the embeddedness of firms&rsquo; R&#38;D in home countries&rsquo; innovation systems. Technology leadership is associated with greater home bias if the home country provides relatively strong intellectual property rights protection, and firms face potential knowledge dissipation abroad.
