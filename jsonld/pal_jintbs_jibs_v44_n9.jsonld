[{"ex:issue": "9", "ex:abstract": "Although biculturals represent a growing demographic, the nascent literature on biculturals has not addressed their cross-cultural leadership capabilities or effectiveness. Attributional patterns and variations across cultures are crucial, and call for higher attributional complexity (AC) and attributional knowledge to reduce cultural distance. This study provides a systematic theoretical connection between biculturals and their higher levels of AC and attributional knowledge, which account for their cross-cultural competence. This connection is then linked to attributional processes, drawing from recent literature on attributional models of leadership. The proposed theoretical model posits that biculturals have higher levels of AC and attributional knowledge, which helps them make more accurate attributions, which are also less culturally biased. Managerial behaviors resulting from these attributions lead to cross-cultural leadership effectiveness, because they absorb uncertainty on the part of subordinates. The proposed model addresses both cognitive and emotional competency elements of cross-cultural leadership. We contribute to the international business literature by providing a theoretical model for examining factors critical to the cross-cultural leadership effectiveness of leaders who have more than one cultural profile. Managerial implications for selection and training of international executives are discussed in the context of culture-specific and culture-general capabilities. Contributions, limitations, and boundary conditions are also discussed.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:title": "Biculturalism and attributional complexity: Cross-cultural leadership effectiveness", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n9/full/jibs201336a.html", "ex:pages": "922-940", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "C Lakshman"}]}, {"ex:issue": "9", "ex:abstract": "Studies examining the competitive implications of geographic scope have largely focused on creating competitive advantage. In an attempt to investigate a less-illuminated role of geographic scope &ndash; that of sustaining competitive advantage &ndash; this paper investigates the sources of and relationships among the causal factors leading to creation of isolating mechanisms or barriers to imitation. This paper first distinguishes two sources of causal factors linked to the creation of isolating mechanisms, intrinsic characteristics of knowledge, and geographic scope of knowledge acquisition, and then investigates the relationships among the causal factors from the two sources. Employing the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis method, this paper examines equifinality and functional equivalence of causal factors from the two sources. Empirical analyses with United States Patent and Trademark Office patent data of the semiconductor industry corroborate the main thesis of the paper that multiple paths can lead to the creation of isolating mechanisms and, in these paths, causal factors from the two sources of isolating mechanisms can be functionally equivalent. The results also provide managerial implications that firms with different sets of resources and capabilities can implement different types of isolating strategies to sustain their competitive advantage.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:title": "Many roads lead to Rome: Implications of geographic scope as a source of isolating mechanisms", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v44/n9/full/jibs201339a.html", "ex:pages": "898-921", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Minyoung Kim"}]}, {"ex:issue": "9", "ex:abstract": "This paper extends and builds on Ronen and Shenkar&rsquo;s synthesized cultural clustering of countries based on similarity and dissimilarity in work-related attitudes. The new map uses an updated dataset, and expands coverage to world areas that were non-accessible at the time. Cluster boundaries are drawn empirically rather than intuitively, and the plot obtained is triple nested, indicating three levels of similarity across given country pairs. Also delineated are cluster adjacency and cluster cohesiveness, which vary from the highly cohesive Arab and Anglo clusters to the least cohesive Confucian and Far Eastern clusters. Exploring predictors of cluster formation, we draw on the ecocultural perspective and other inputs, and examine the combined role of language, religion, and geography in generating cluster formation. We find that these forces play a prominent yet complex role: for instance, the religion and language brought by the Spanish fail to create a singular, cohesive Latin American cluster akin to the Anglo cluster. The role of economic variables is similarly considered. Finally, comparing the current map with that of 1985, we find strong support for the divergence (vs convergence) argument.

Findings revealed that the PL prototype converged more strongly with authoritarian leadership and NTL in hierarchical and collectivistic cultures than in egalitarian and individualistic ones.

We examine how such HQ disaggregation changes the role that HQ&ndash;subsidiary geographic distance plays in HQ decisions about subsidiaries. We argue that HQ disaggregation yields multiple HQ&ndash;subsidiary geographic distances, all of which are a likely source of ex post communication costs, and hence are likely to co-determine HQ decisions about subsidiaries.
