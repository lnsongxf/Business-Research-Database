[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "The paper reviews extant literature on subsidiary absorptive capacity and knowledge transfer within multinational corporations (MNCs), and proposes an agenda for future research on the relationship between these two constructs. It suggests that motivation should be viewed as a moderating factor between subsidiary absorptive capacity and MNC knowledge transfer, and that future research should make a clear distinction between the choices of MNC headquarters and those of subsidiaries regarding knowledge transfer.

We consider that the speed of the internationalization process depends on the type of experiential learning that results from decisions implicit in the internationalization process: choice of location and modes of operation. Firms develop two types of learning activities with respect to the selection of foreign markets and modes of operation: diversity and depth of accumulated international activities. We propose that depth of international activities has an inverted U-shaped impact on the speed of the internationalization process, while diversity of international activities has a U-shaped influence on the speed of internationalization process. The results of our longitudinal study of 889 firms over 23 years (1986&ndash;2008) suggest that diversity of international activities promotes long-term learning by exposing the firm to richer experiences, although such learning only takes place over time. Depth of international activities may accelerate the internationalization process in the short term, but it eventually restrains its potential for development in the long term.

In the decade since their laudable article was published, some contributions have been made highlighting the contingencies related to the effectiveness of HRM practices in MNCs, especially those affecting an organizations&rsquo; absorptive capacity. These contingencies &ndash; the &ldquo;moving parts&rdquo; &ndash; include country-level differences in HR systems, cross-cultural differences in acceptance of HR practices and individual-level factors affecting the effectiveness of HRM practices.

It first reviews scholarship on the MNE, with a focus on what has come to be known as &ldquo;internalization&rdquo; theory. One prong of this theory develops contractual/transaction cost-informed governance perspectives; and another develops technology transfer and capabilities perspectives. In this paper, it is suggested that the latter has been somewhat neglected. However, if fully integrated as part of a more complete approach, it can buttress transaction cost/governance issues and expand the range of phenomena that can be explained. In this more integrated framework, dynamic capabilities coupled with good strategy are seen as necessary to sustain superior enterprise performance, especially in fast-moving global environments. Entrepreneurial management and transformational leadership are incorporated into a capabilities theory of the MNE. The framework is then used to explain how strategy and dynamic capabilities together determine firm-level sustained competitive advantage in global environments. It is suggested that this framework complements contract-based perspectives on the MNE and can help integrate international management and international business perspectives.", "ex:volume": "45", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "A dynamic capabilities-based entrepreneurial theory of the multinational enterprise", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v45/n1/full/jibs201354a.html", "ex:pages": "8-37", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "David J Teece"}]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Based on a sample of 169 subsidiaries of multinational corporations (MNCs) operating in the USA, Russia, and Finland, this paper investigates the relationship between MNC subsidiary HRM practices, absorptive capacity and knowledge transfer.
