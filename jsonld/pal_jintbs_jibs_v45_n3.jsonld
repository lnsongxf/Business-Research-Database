[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Partner selection is a critical issue in building international joint ventures (IJVs). We argue that foreign firms are more likely to select local firms with unique network structural advantages within a local alliance network. We frame structural advantages as two network position traits: centrality and brokerage. Specifically, network centrality acts as a stronger network trait than brokerage in attracting foreign IJV partners. However, such a relationship may be moderated by foreign firms&rsquo; local experience and perceived capabilities. We contend that when foreign firms have a high level of local market experience and perceived capabilities, they may prefer a local broker over a centrally located local firm. Data on the domestic alliance network in China&rsquo;s electronics and information technology (IT) industries largely support our hypotheses. We conclude that as foreign investors become strategic insiders, they may not only seek a local partner&rsquo;s capability attributes, but also more critically pay attention to a local partner&rsquo;s domestic network.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "45", "ex:title": "Domestic alliance network to attract foreign partners: Evidence from international joint ventures in China", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v45/n3/full/jibs201371a.html", "ex:pages": "338-362", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Weilei (Stone) Shi"}, {"ex:name": "Sunny Li Sun"}, {"ex:name": "Brian C Pinkham"}, {"ex:name": "Mike W Peng"}]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "We define globalization as the geographical dispersion of multinational enterprises (MNEs)&rsquo; value chain, in combination with increased inter-regional coordination, and use detailed firm-level data to show that 12 of Sweden&rsquo;s 17 largest manufacturing companies indeed are global.

Based on a comparative case study of six MNEs from the United States and Sweden, this paper remedies this. It explores and explicates MNE subunits&rsquo; strategic responses to host country institutional constraints and opportunities in five different regions. A new-institutional approach is adopted, which allows for an investigation of MNE subunit agency in relation to normative and cognitive institutions, as well as regulative ones. This fine-grained analysis reveals not only what kinds of responses MNE subunits invoke, but why and how they are able to respond. We identify four strategic responses by which subunits shape, transpose and evade institutions in the pursuit of competitive advantage: Innovation, Arbitrage, Circumvention and Adaptation. These responses are driven by three key enablers: multinationality, foreignness and institutional ambiguity &ndash; that serve to enhance and heighten three mechanisms: reflexivity, role expectations and resources. By linking the enablers and the mechanisms to specific types of strategic responses in a framework and typology, the paper not only contributes to emerging research on the interplay between MNEs, institutions and strategy, but to strategy practice.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "45", "ex:title": "MNE institutional advantage: How subunits shape, transpose and evade host country institutions", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v45/n3/full/jibs201366a.html", "ex:pages": "275-302", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Patrick Regn&eacute;r"}, {"ex:name": "Jesper Edman"}]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "This paper extends signaling theory to the study of firms&rsquo; international alliances. Signals can be valuable in facilitating these collaborations because they reduce the risk of adverse selection surrounding cross-border partnerships. We specifically investigate whether firms&rsquo; affiliations with prominent financial intermediaries enable the formation of international collaborative agreements. We also argue and find that the signaling benefits of these affiliations diminish with the firm&rsquo;s engagement in international activities, which can function as alternative signals by which firms convey the quality of their resources and prospects. Examining firms&rsquo; cross-border activities helps to identify new and important signals that are unique to the international setting. Moreover, this also helps contextualize prior theory and findings that exist in the domestic setting on the effects of affiliations with financial intermediaries such as venture capitalists and investment banks. We conclude that signaling theory offers a promising addition to existing theories of international alliances and other cross-border activities. We contrast some of the main arguments and predications of signaling theory with other theories used in international business, and we emphasize the research opportunities that exist for employing this perspective in international business studies in the future.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "45", "ex:title": "Signals and international alliance formation: The roles of affiliations and international activities", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v45/n3/full/jibs20143a.html", "ex:pages": "321-337", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Jeffrey J Reuer"}, {"ex:name": "Roberto Ragozzino"}]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "International trade and R&#38;D offer significant opportunities for knowledge transfer through exports, but simultaneously increase potential competition through imports. In this paper, the author examines industry-level heterogeneity in the relationship between domestic innovation and international trade. Using a model of innovation in the global economy and a novel measure of relative industry strength, the paper examines differential effects of exports and imports in high-technology industries. These relationships are tested empirically using panel data from four high-technology industries in the US over the period 1973&ndash;2001. In industries that are relative global leaders, the empirical evidence points to gains from both exporting and importing. On the other hand, in industries that are relative global laggards, the results are more fluid. The author finds that exporting contributes favorably to domestic innovation in both leading and lagging industries when foreign R&#38;D is at its maximum; at lower levels of knowledge abroad, however, the net effect of exporting on lagging industries is negative. Results for importing are likewise nuanced. In industries that are relative leaders, increasingly sophisticated imports lead to greater domestic innovation when industry structure is more concentrated, providing a competitive kick-start.

The findings reveal that MNC parents can indeed cultivate subsidiaries&rsquo; ability to appropriate marketing knowledge through a combination of adopting specific social structures and investing in particular efforts. However, the effect of social structure on subsidiary absorptive capacity is indirect, and accounted for by the parents&rsquo; intensity of effort. A number of theoretical implications emerge from the findings for research on absorptive capacity in relation to the role of the knowledge source, the need to examine organizational influences in relation to one another, and validating the original absorptive capacity dimensions.
