[{"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "Language lies at the heart of international business (IB) activities, yet language as a key construct in the field of IB has not been sufficiently articulated or theorized. Language presents itself in forms such as national, corporate, technical or electronic, in functions in terms of defining hierarchies, exercising power or facilitating integration and in features such as the use of mixed syntax or gender-marking. Understanding the complex interplay between the multiple facets of language and how they affect day-to-day operations is becoming increasingly critical to global business effectiveness.

In particular, we develop a framework that helps to better understand how language-sensitive recruitment is related to competence, networks, identity, and power. We started by conducting a qualitative interview-based study of 101 MNC subsidiaries. This analysis elucidates the productive and counterproductive effects of language-sensitive recruitment on knowledge transfer related to communication competence, networks, identity, and power. To further understand the productive and counterproductive effects, we conducted a quantitative study in 285 MNC subsidiaries. We found an inverted U-shaped relationship between language-sensitive recruitment and knowledge transfer. Together, these two studies provide a better understanding of the multifaceted and at times counterintuitive implications of language-sensitive recruitment on knowledge transfer in MNCs. By elucidating these effects, this paper contributes to the stream of research examining the role of language in MNCs and international business more generally. It further adds to research on MNC knowledge transfer that to date has focused little attention on language. By elaborating on the potential unintended consequences of language-sensitive recruitment, this paper also has implications for international human resource management research.", "ex:volume": "45", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Knowledge transfer in multinational corporations: Productive and counterproductive effects of language-sensitive recruitment", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v45/n5/full/jibs20141a.html", "ex:pages": "600-622", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Vesa Peltokorpi", "Eero Vaara"]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "This paper aims to uncover the normative assumptions that guide language studies in international business. Relying on sociolinguistics and cosmopolitan theory, we point to the possibility of conceiving language as a social practice rather than a discrete entity, and understanding globalization as the entanglement between universality and particularity rather than treating these two notions separately. Combining these linguistic and global assumptions, we arrive at three different research approaches to study linguistic performances in global work settings: monological lingua franca, monological multilingualism and multilingual franca. As the latter approach is unexplored, we develop the third option which underlines a human-centered multilingualism that conceives language as a social activity in which speakers mobilize multiple linguistic resources to express voice. The advantages of such an approach are its ability to capture the complexities of contemporary global life and its emphasis on a new understanding of multilingualism and diversity that truly goes beyond any kind of monolingualism. In terms of practice implications, a multilingual franca approach provides space for emancipatory politics through allowing mixed language use.", "ex:volume": "45", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Re-considering language within a cosmopolitan understanding: Toward a multilingual franca approach in international business studies", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v45/n5/full/jibs20149a.html", "ex:pages": "623-639", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Maddy Janssens", "Chris Steyaert"]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "Based on an ethnographic study comprising interviews with and observations of 96 globally distributed members of six software development teams, we propose a model that captures how asymmetries in language fluency contribute to an us vs them dynamic common in global teams.

Our findings suggest that divisive subgroup dynamics occurred only in teams that also suffered from power contests, suggesting that power contests activate otherwise dormant faultlines.

We start by conducting an interpretive content analysis of both qualitative and quantitative cross-language studies published in four core IB journals over the course of a decade. Our analysis shows the dominance of a technicist view of translation associated with the equivalence paradigm. In contrast, we advocate a shift to a more contextualised approach informed by theoretical developments in translation studies. More specifically, we focus on two theoretical perspectives &ndash; skopos theory and cultural politics &ndash; which offer related but distinct approaches to rethinking equivalence. We conclude by advocating that the translation process be reframed as a process of intercultural interaction, rather than a lexical transfer of meaning. This reconceptualisation would, we argue, open up what is currently a &ldquo;black box&rdquo; in most IB studies. The contextualised approach that we offer has the potential not just to enrich the findings of studies, but also provide insights that are of multidisciplinary relevance.", "ex:volume": "45", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Translation in cross-language international business research: Beyond equivalence", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v45/n5/full/jibs201367a.html", "ex:pages": "562-582", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Agnieszka Chidlow", "Emmanuella Plakoyiannaki", "Catherine Welch"]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "Using ethnographic evidence from the former Soviet republics, this paper examines a relatively new and mainly unobserved concept in international business literature: the phenomenon of communication disengagement that manifests itself in many emerging markets. We link it to the deficiencies of the local professional business discourse rooted in language limitations, which reflects a lack of experience with the market economy. This hampers cognitive coherence between foreign and local business entities, adding to the liability of foreignness as certain instances of professional experience fail to find adequate linguistic expression, and complicates cross-cultural adjustments, causing multinational companies (MNCs) financial losses. We contribute to the IB literature by examining cross-border semantic sensemaking through a retrospectively constructed observational study. We argue that a relative inadequacy of the national professional idiom is likely to remain a feature of the business environment in post-communist economies for some time, and therefore should be factored into business strategies of MNCs.

The authors contribute to diversity research by distinguishing the exclusively negative language effects from the more ambivalent effects of other diversity dimensions. Their findings also illustrate how surface-level language diversity may create perceptions of deep-level diversity. Furthermore, their study advances MNT research by revealing the specific influences of language barriers on team trust, an important mediator between team inputs and performance outcomes. It thereby encourages the examination of other team processes through a language lens. Finally, their study suggests that multilingual settings necessitate a reexamination and modification of the seminal trust theories by Mayer, Davis and Schoorman, and by McAllister.
