[{"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "We examine whether the presence of International Investment Agreements (IIAs), negotiated among countries for foreign investor protection, lowers political risk faced by multinational enterprises (MNEs). Drawing on research from international business, political science, and international law, we argue that IIAs increase expected future cash flows, and hence the value of foreign assets, by limiting the ability of host governments to make discriminatory policy changes. However, the need for IIA protection, and the ability to benefit from it, varies with firm characteristics. Using detailed transaction-level data for sale of petroleum assets in 45 countries, we find that MNEs pay significantly higher amounts for those protected by IIAs than similar but unprotected assets, an effect moderated by the firm&rsquo;s reserve size and state ownership.", "ex:volume": "45", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Institutions sans fronti&egrave;res: International agreements and foreign investment", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v45/n6/full/jibs201370a.html", "ex:pages": "649-669", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Srividya Jandhyala"}, {"ex:name": "Robert J Weiner"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "Twenty-five years ago, Dunning articulated a vision for greater interdisciplinary grounding in international business (IB) research. Motivated by his foresight, this special issue aims to encourage research that explicitly combines ideas from different disciplines, with a view to creating new integrative theories with greater explanatory power than those based on a single discipline. Five articles selected from a pool of 60 submissions are presented in the special issue, each with its own distinctive interdisciplinary contribution to expanding our knowledge about an important IB phenomenon. In editing the special issue, the editors developed a new understanding of the opportunities and challenges in conducting interdisciplinary research. These insights are reported in the current editorial essay. We conclude by discussing four approaches to interdisciplinary inquiry observed across the five accepted papers: (1) addressing a new phenomenon, (2) asking a fresh question, (3) finding a better answer and (4) contributing to a base discipline.", "ex:volume": "45", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Advancing interdisciplinary research: Insights from the JIBS special issue", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v45/n6/full/jibs201434a.html", "ex:pages": "643-648", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Joseph L C Cheng"}, {"ex:name": "Julian Birkinshaw"}, {"ex:name": "Donald R Lessard"}, {"ex:name": "David C Thomas"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "Understanding firms&rsquo; behavior across countries &ndash; a key concern in the international business literature &ndash; requires the joint consideration of both institutional influences and firms&rsquo; profit maximization goals. In the corporate social responsibility (CSR) area, however, researchers have utilized theories that take into account only one or the other &ndash; institutional theory, which explains CSR as legitimacy-seeking activities in line with national-level institutions, or economic-based approaches that consider CSR effects only in terms of firm profitability. While an institutional argument implies convergence in CSR behavior among firms in similar institutional contexts, profit maximization logic treats CSR as a firm-specific behavior. We integrate these perspectives by demonstrating the moderating effects of firms&rsquo; economic motivations for seeking legitimacy on the relationship between institutional environment and CSR responsiveness. We argue that variations in firms&rsquo; economic visibility and economic vulnerability can bring about differences in their need for societal goodwill, and in turn, their legitimacy seeking. Findings on a database of apparel firms&rsquo; employee-related CSR across 23 countries support this overall argument. The integration of such fundamentally different theoretical perspectives allows us to contribute new theoretical insights to international business on the influence of national institutions on firms&rsquo; behavior.", "ex:volume": "45", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Firms&rsquo; corporate social responsibility behavior: An integration of institutional and profit maximization approaches", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v45/n6/full/jibs201429a.html", "ex:pages": "670-698", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Susan L Young"}, {"ex:name": "Mona V Makhija"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "How do multinational corporation (MNC) subsidiaries and local institutions help or hinder emerging market suppliers to upgrade their capabilities? Drawing on insights from economic sociology and comparative capitalism, we posit that in these contexts of scarce resources and inferior technologies upgrading depends on the ways in which organizational and institutional networks enable firms to integrate imported advanced knowledge with local applied knowledge. Using a combination of field work and unique survey data of Argentine auto parts suppliers, we show that process upgrading improves significantly when suppliers have ties to seemingly resource-weak non-market institutions that improve access to a variety of experiential knowledge. These institutions act as knowledge bridges, helping local firms tap into diverse applied knowledge embedded in isolated industrial districts and adapt frontier advanced practices to their local conditions. Moreover, suppliers appear to benefit from ties to MNC subsidiaries only when they simultaneously collaborate with certain non-market institutions that help them recombine experiential knowledge with the standards gained from the subsidiaries.", "ex:volume": "45", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Adaptation, bridging and firm upgrading: How non-market institutions and MNCs facilitate knowledge recombination in emerging markets", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v45/n6/full/jibs201419a.html", "ex:pages": "699-722", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Rafael A Corredoira"}, {"ex:name": "Gerald A McDermott"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "Drawing on insights from evolutionary psychology and sociology, this research seeks to explain the gender differences and within-sex variations in consumer responses to nudity in advertisements. Specifically, we argue that the abundant resources that come with modernization emancipate women from the dependency on a long-term relationship with a male partner for child bearing and rearing. Therefore, women in modern societies are more likely to use fast reproductive strategies (e.g., short-term mating) to enhance the chances of getting good genes from their mates for their offspring. Their physiological arousals activated by and attitudes toward male or female nudity in ads will change accordingly. In contrast, men&rsquo;s responses to nudity in ads are less affected by modernization. We conducted an experiment in six Chinese cities and obtained supportive evidence to illustrate these differences. There was also evidence indicating that the socialization of high socio-economic status may offset the force of evolution. This study highlights the usefulness of an interdisciplinary approach in answering important questions in international business.

We argue that a new employer will pay higher wages when signals indicate that potential employees have valuable, foreign human capital (e.g., the closed subsidiary was highly productive by host-country standards), and lower wages when signals indicate that potential employees have highly MNC-specific human capital (e.g., the employee had a long tenure in the closed subsidiary). We provide empirical evidence based on a sample of 110,133 displaced employees of closed MNC subsidiaries in Portugal. Our data set spans the period from 2005 to 2009.
