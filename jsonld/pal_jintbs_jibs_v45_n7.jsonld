[{"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "This article adopts a cognitive neuroscience perspective to develop theory about the consequences of foreign language use in organizational settings. In contrast to previous work that has focused on the interpersonal effects of foreign language use, we focus on intra-personal, cognitive processes that affect employee performance. Our model delineates how foreign language processing depletes cognitive resources, which can ultimately result in biased decision-making and reduced self-regulation. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of our model for international business research in the context of an increasing number of organizations that have adopted a common corporate language.", "ex:volume": "45", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Brain drain: The cognitive neuroscience of foreign language processing in multinational corporations", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v45/n7/full/jibs201426a.html", "ex:pages": "862-885", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Stefan Volk"}, {"ex:name": "Tine K&ouml;hler"}, {"ex:name": "Markus Pudelko"}]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "The treatment of translation in the international business (IB) literature has been predominantly concerned with research methodology and back-translation. Arguing for a less microscopic concept of translation in IB research, we advocate a more expansive perspective, whereby translation is understood as cross-border interplay of entire terrains of corporate contexts and experience linking multiple mental and social frames of reference. We apply three notions from linguistics and translation studies &ndash; equivalence, ambiguity and cultural interference &ndash; to problematize the translation of management terms and concepts across languages and to highlight the importance of historical and cultural embedding in the translation process. We substantiate the core argument through analysis of fragments from Russia&rsquo;s first Handbook of Knowledge Management, a text composed of 23 contributions translated from English into Russian, a language in restless regeneration, struggling arduously with Western management terms and concepts after 70 years of communism. This knowledge management text constitutes the essence of an entire corpus of modern management thought and action which is largely unfamiliar to the Russian business and scholarly community. We demonstrate how acts of translation serve as an analog for the cross-cultural transfer of knowledge and how these insights can advance IB translation research into new and rewarding directions.", "ex:volume": "45", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "A more expansive perspective on translation in IB research: Insights from the Russian Handbook of Knowledge Management", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v45/n7/full/jibs201410a.html", "ex:pages": "906-918", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Nigel J Holden"}, {"ex:name": "Snejina Michailova"}]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:volume": "45", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "In memoriam: Alan Rugman", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v45/n7/full/jibs201445a.html", "ex:pages": "785-786", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "John Cantwell"}]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "Emerging markets experience institutional and social changes over time that present different stakeholder expectations for multinational corporations (MNCs). MNCs are often accused of social misdeeds and experience public crises during the changes, leaving questions on how they adapt to the local social transition to sustain operations. Conventional adaptation strategies put too much emphasis on maximizing economic returns by arbitraging national differences and catering to local market and consumer characteristics. The economic orientation may fail to address evolving and diverse stakeholder expectations, easily leading to public crises. This study conceptualizes economic adaptation and social adaptation as two sets of knowledge and capabilities that would have equally important impacts on MNCs&rsquo; sustainable operations in emerging markets. The empirical testing examines consumer rights-related public crises experienced by 180 MNCs in China. The results suggest that MNCs&rsquo; social adaptation activities have significantly positive effects in mitigating public crises while certain aspects of economic adaption, such as early entry into China, reliance on local leadership, and speedy expansion of local employees, lead to public crises. The significant interaction effects confirm that MNCs need to follow a balanced approach, paying attention to both economic and social components to avoid public crises and sustain growth in emerging markets.", "ex:volume": "45", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "MNC strategy and social adaptation in emerging markets", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v45/n7/full/jibs20148a.html", "ex:pages": "842-861", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Meng Zhao"}, {"ex:name": "Seung Ho Park"}, {"ex:name": "Nan Zhou"}]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "We examine the role of cultural and language skills as resources for individuals&rsquo; boundary spanning ability in multinational corporations.

Analyzing a longitudinal data set (from 1997 to 2005) of 1959 newly established Canadian small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we show that no single strategy is superior per se but that internationalization strategy moderates the relative importance of resources to SMEs&rsquo; survival abroad.
