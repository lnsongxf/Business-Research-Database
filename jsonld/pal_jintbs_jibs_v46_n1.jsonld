[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Our study explores the source of improvement in the information environment from cross-listing shares on US stock exchanges. Are the improvements from cross-listing in the United States achieved more through public or private information channels? While we find evidence that US cross-listing is significantly associated with improvements in both public and private information precision, the association is stronger between cross-listing and improvements in private information precision. This suggests that the improvement in the information environment for cross-listed firms is largely due to analysts expending more effort on firm-specific information discovery as opposed to broader improvements in overall public disclosure. This research should influence international business scholars that improvements in the information environment do not occur solely through public information channels. They also occur through investors&rsquo; private information search activities.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "The impact of cross-listing in the United States on the precision of public and private information", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n1/full/jibs201451a.html", "ex:pages": "87-103", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Don Herrmann", "Tony Kang", "Yong Keun Yoo"]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "The JIBS 2014 Decade Award: Innovation, organizational capabilities, and the born-global firm", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n1/full/jibs201449a.html", "ex:pages": "1-2", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["John Cantwell"]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "In a recent commentary published in this journal, Shaver raises the provocative question of whether we need more entry mode studies.

Despite their growing importance, our understanding of how and why these firms develop and implement their internationalization strategies, and what makes them successful, remains incomplete. Addressing such questions has contributed substantially to the development of the research domain of international entrepreneurship (IE), which focuses on entrepreneurial aspects of doing business across borders, in the context of both small and large firms. While IE is much broader than born globals, these firms are central to the IE domain and the impact of the Knight and Cavusgil paper has helped to develop a stronger awareness of the important linkages and intersections between IE and the wider international business research community.

While the internationalization of AMNEs&rsquo; R&#38;D activities can largely be explained in terms of the twin strategies of competence exploitation and competence creation, EMNE R&#38;D internationalization is rooted in the firms&rsquo; overall catch up strategy to get on par with industry leaders. An in-depth comparison of knowledge flows reveals that within AMNEs, headquarters often serves the primary source of knowledge for R&#38;D subsidiaries. In contrast, within EMNEs, headquarters accesses knowledge from R&#38;D subsidiaries in advanced economies for innovation catch-up.

Using the Social Relations Model to analyze 13,616 dyadic interactions among 2090 members of 289 teams in a large MNC, we find that, for both international and non-international differences, those that are position-based (i.e., geographic and structural differences) created greater barriers than those that are person-based (i.e., nationality and demographic differences).
