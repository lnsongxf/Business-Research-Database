[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Integrating agency theory with institutional analysis in international business, we propose a state-control perspective to analyze government-control mechanisms in emerging economies&rsquo; globalization of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). We identify two types of state control that influence SOEs&rsquo; globalization decisions and the degree of globalization (DOG): state ownership control and executives&rsquo; political connections, both of which are contingent upon the home country&rsquo;s evolving institutional environments. Using a two-step corporate globalization decision model and 17,272 firm &ndash; year observations of non-financial, Chinese-listed companies, we find a strong impact of both types of state control on SOEs&rsquo; globalization, although the impacts differ between the periods before and after domestic governance reform and across different globalization decision steps. The diminishing impact of executives&rsquo; political connections and the increasing impact of state ownership control on firms&rsquo; DOG demonstrate the evolving relationship between the state and the managers, as well as the dynamics of state control in globalizing SOEs.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "An anatomy of state control in the globalization of state-owned enterprises", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n2/full/jibs201435a.html", "ex:pages": "223-240", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Hao Liang"}, {"ex:name": "Bing Ren"}, {"ex:name": "Sunny Li Sun"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Multinational enterprises (MNEs) encounter relentless stakeholder pressures when operating across linguistic, cultural and institutional boundaries.

These local stakeholders are members of communities of place (CofP), who steward the land their ancestors have inhabited for centuries, and their voices have grown as to how that land is used. As their voices have grown, MNEs should improve CSR outcomes with CofP through better communications.

We examine a sample of European companies that initiate the voluntary issuance of an annual report in English in addition to the local language annual report. To control for self-selection, we use a difference-in-differences design with a propensity score matched control sample. We find that adoption of English as an external reporting language is associated with increased foreign ownership, decreased information asymmetry, and increased analyst following. We also find that these benefits are not conditional on the use of IFRS for financial reporting. Our findings hold if we run a number of robustness checks to control for correlated events (creation of an investor relations service, provision of conference calls, and/or changes in management). These results are consistent with the language used in the annual report acting as a barrier to investment for some investors and with annual reports issued in English reducing investors&rsquo; information processing costs.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "International evidence on the impact of adopting English as an external reporting language", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n2/full/jibs201433a.html", "ex:pages": "180-205", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Thomas Jeanjean"}, {"ex:name": "Herv&eacute; Stolowy"}, {"ex:name": "Michael Erkens"}, {"ex:name": "Teri Lombardi Yohn"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Contrasting with extant research centred on the organizational challenges of sourcing services in culturally distant countries, we show that cultural differences between home and host countries do not prevent firms from achieving their cost savings targets. Instead, the effect is positive, both for the captive and outsourcing governance models. Using insight from social psychology research and the theory of organizations, we build the argument that the positive effect is due to cultural differences providing an attention stimulus for decision-makers to thoroughly gather and process information on the costs and benefits of global sourcing, thereby reducing the risk of cost estimation errors. The empirical validation uses a data set of 624 global services sourcing initiatives obtained from the Offshoring Research Network, complemented with multiple external sources of cross-country data on cultural differences, languages, geographic distance and education levels. The main contribution of the article is to add much needed nuance to the otherwise monotonic negative view of cultural differences in extant global sourcing literature.

International business theory predicts that multinational enterprises will engage in political activities to gain a competitive advantage over rivals. I hypothesize that MNBs with greater bargaining power and favorable institutions received state capital injections on more attractive terms than foreign rivals. I test this hypothesis by studying the October 2008 state recapitalizations of MNBs by the UK, France, Germany, the United States, and Switzerland. I measure the relative attractiveness of state bailouts by comparing the bank stock price reactions when the bailouts were announced. The stock prices of MNBs receiving more favorable state support outperformed foreign rivals, reflecting the competitive advantage gained. States imposed more punitive terms on banks when political and legal institutions were more favorable and MNBs were unable to form a coalition. States that are highly dependent on banks and where state bailouts were large relative to GDP were also more punitive. These findings highlight the importance of political behavior as a tool of strategy, and the need for coordination on banking policy across states to reduce moral hazard.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Political bargaining and multinational bank bailouts", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n2/full/jibs201447a.html", "ex:pages": "206-222", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Michael R King"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "How does language friction affect alliance formation? Language friction is a form of cultural friction arising from structural differences in the respective languages used by potential partners to reason and solve problems together. A little language friction may prompt partners to rethink solutions, thereby enhancing collaboration, but excessive friction may impede collaboration. We develop a Language Friction Index (LFI) to quantify relative differences in linguistic structure for any language pair. Utilizing a unique data set of semiconductor design activities (1988&ndash;2001), our empirical analysis finds an inverted U-shaped relationship between partners&rsquo; LFI and the likelihood of cross-border research and development (R&#38;D) alliance formation. This relationship is further moderated by prior ties and technological distance. Our findings have several important implications, including: (1) language differences are a measurable and discernible source of cultural friction; (2) the effects of language friction are economically significant and strategically consequential; (3) certain aspects of language friction occur independent of language proficiency and persist despite the use of lingua franca to reduce language barriers; (4) linguistic diversity is an indirect marker of cognitive diversity, which is useful in boosting creativity, especially in first-time collaborations; (5) beyond R&#38;D alliances, language friction may also influence other types of strategic interactions and organizational processes.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Language friction and partner selection in cross-border R&#38;D alliance formation", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n2/full/jibs201456a.html", "ex:pages": "123-152", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Amol M Joshi"}, {"ex:name": "Nandini Lahiri"}]}]
