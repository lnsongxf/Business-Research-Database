[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Drawing on the structural perspective in organizational theory, this study develops a conceptual framework of the social hierarchy within the multinational corporation (MNC). We suggest that parent country nationals (PCNs), host country nationals (HCNs), and third country nationals (TCNs) occupy distinctively different positions in the social hierarchy, which are anchored in their differential control or access to various forms of capital or strategically valuable organizational resources. We further suggest that these positions affect employees&rsquo; perceptions of senior leadership opportunities, defined as the assessment of the extent to which nationality and location influence access to senior leadership opportunities. Using multilevel analysis of survey data from 2039 employees in seven MNCs, the study reveals two significant findings. First, HCNs and TCNs perceive that nationality and location influence access to senior leadership opportunities more than PCNs. Second, three moderating factors &ndash; gender, tenure, and education &ndash; increase the perception gaps between PCNs on the one hand and HCNs and TCNs on the other, although these results are inconsistent. These findings indicate that the structural position of PCNs, HCNs, and TCNs in the social hierarchy affect sense-making and perceptions of access to senior leadership opportunities.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Perceived senior leadership opportunities in MNCs: The effect of social hierarchy and capital", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n3/full/jibs201453a.html", "ex:pages": "285-307", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Orly Levy", "Sully Taylor", "Nakiye A Boyacigiller", "Todd E Bodner", "Maury A Peiperl", "Schon Beechler"]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "To overcome the costs of doing business abroad, researchers have suggested either legitimacy- or efficiency-based solutions. However, both types of solutions still treat host-country customers as external to the theory. We highlight the role of customers in the international professional business service setting and argue that customer involvement is positively related to the perceived internationalization performance of multinational corporations (MNCs). MNCs with managers who perceive higher legitimacy pressures and greater needs for local knowledge tend to undertake greater efforts to build customer involvement. Furthermore, we develop a configuration framework between perceived strategic needs and MNCs&rsquo; capabilities. Specifically, MNCs that match relational capability with legitimacy needs and absorptive capacity with knowledge needs are more likely to engage in customer involvement. Our survey of 175 Chinese MNCs provides evidence that customer involvement is positively related to perceived internationalization performance. When MNCs&rsquo; relational capabilities are stronger, the positive relationship between legitimacy pressure and customer involvement increases. By contrast, MNCs with greater perceived market ambiguity improve customer involvement only when they have stronger absorptive capacity. We conclude that MNCs may simultaneously reduce legitimacy and efficiency costs through customer involvement after considering the fit between perceived environmental pressures and firm capabilities.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Customer involvement and service firm internationalization performance: An integrative framework", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n3/full/jibs201457a.html", "ex:pages": "355-380", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Xiao Zhang", "Weiguo Zhong", "Shige Makino"]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Work practices that involve employees are generally assumed to be less effective in more hierarchical societies where employees&rsquo; values are not aligned with such practices. In this study, we challenge this assumption by developing a theory that differentiates between the symbolic and instrumental aspects of involvement work systems and proposing that their symbolic impact will be more pronounced in egalitarian societies, whereas their instrumental impact will be more pronounced in hierarchical societies. In particular, we draw on the symbolic action perspective and theories on culture to test the relationship between involvement work systems and operational effectiveness by incorporating organizational climate of participation and national cultural differences in power distance. Using multi-source, multilevel data from 260 facilities of a multinational company operating in 22 countries, we found that the mediated relationship between involvement work systems and operational effectiveness through climate of participation (i.e., the symbolic impact) was stronger among facilities located in lower power distance societies. On the other hand, the direct relationship between involvement work systems and operational effectiveness (i.e., the instrumental impact) was stronger in higher power distance societies.

However, theoretical issues, methodological challenges, and inconsistent results hinder scholarship on why distance plays such an influential role. To address these problems, we draw from cognitive research on similarity comparisons to re-conceptualize distance and test a model of internationalization decisions. Analyzing the verbal protocols of executives considering a series of internationalization opportunities, we demonstrate that, over and above objective distance indicators, considerations that reduce distance (commonalities) and considerations that augment distance (differences) have distinct effects on decisions of where, when, and how to internationalize. As such, our study contributes new insights for understanding the nature and effects of distance, across different dimensions of distance and internationalization decisions. Moreover, internationalization theories have come to emphasize different theoretical rationales for explaining the influential role of distance on different decisions. By integrating these rationales together with the notion that distance-reducing commonalities and distance-augmenting differences have distinct implications for internationalization decisions, we introduce the notion that it is not only the addition of distance considerations that matters but also the directionality of such changes. Doing so, our study points to new theoretical and methodological insights to help address prior criticisms and advance future research.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Seeking commonalities or avoiding differences&quest; Re-conceptualizing distance and its effects on internationalization decisions", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n3/full/jibs201452a.html", "ex:pages": "253-284", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["David W Williams", "Denis A Gr&eacute;goire"]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Consumer ethnocentrism (CE) is a popular construct in international marketing research and is generally measured using the CETSCALE, a reliable scale with proven predictive validity but with limited evidence about its construct validity, dimensionality and cross-cultural measurement invariance.
