[{"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "Marketing products globally is challenging due to the diverse nature of markets. We use market heterogeneity, unbranded competition, resource and infrastructure availability, and sociopolitical governance as country-market characteristics that distinguish between developed and emerging countries. We investigate their moderating role on the relationship between elements of the marketing mix and brand sales. We provide evidence, from a hierarchical linear model and a panel data set of brands from 14 emerging and developed markets that account for 62&percnt; of the global GDP, that country-market characteristics moderate the relationship between the complete set of marketing mix elements and brand sales performance asymmetrically. While distribution and price have the largest impact in emerging and developed countries, respectively, product innovation and advertising have significantly larger impacts in emerging markets relative to developed countries. These finding highlights the importance of contingency view of marketing strategy in global markets.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:title": "Marketing mix and brand sales in global markets: Examining the contingent role of country-market characteristics", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n5/full/jibs201469a.html", "ex:pages": "596-619", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "S Cem Bahadir"}, {"ex:name": "Sundar G Bharadwaj"}, {"ex:name": "Rajendra K Srivastava"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "We introduce the concept of International Coherence (IC) to describe the degree of relatedness in a multinational enterprise (MNE). We propose that IC hinges on the interplay of the relatedness between any two MNE units and the linkages that tie them together. Linkages can be thought of as the often costly &ldquo;pipes&rdquo; that allow the &ldquo;content&rdquo;, that is, resources and information that define relatedness, to &ldquo;flow&rdquo;. We argue that greater IC increases the potential of an MNE to generate economies by facilitating resource sharing and diffusion, as well as learning and knowledge creation among MNE units while controlling corresponding bureaucratic costs. In turn, this will lead to superior MNE performance. We also hypothesize that firms facing high levels of competition will have greater incentives to capitalize on IC. To test our hypotheses, we first estimate the relatedness between units by the revealed unit relatedness using data on nearly a half a million global investments by all public MNEs worldwide. We then use this information and data on 960 US MNE units&rsquo; locations to estimate IC and find support for our hypotheses.

Data from 166 knowledge-intensive projects support our argument that, in contrast to process-based incentives that influence more local search, outcome-based incentives motivate employee teams to reach well beyond their immediate location, which in turn enhances performance. At the same time, we demonstrate that expanded reach also increases the likelihood of accessing more codifiable knowledge, which can hurt performance.

This article builds on the attention-based view to examine how selective attention &ndash; the focus on certain issues or answers at the exclusion of others &ndash; works in the global knowledge-sourcing process in MNCs. The results reveal an intriguing paradox: while MNCs may establish foreign subsidiaries far from headquarters to identify diverse, novel knowledge, and overcome local search, headquarters&rsquo; decision makers tend to favor opportunities that are market proven and simply confirm what the MNC already knows. Subsidiary managers&rsquo; pre-selling and selling efforts, however, can play a pivotal role in overcoming that bias.

Accordingly, we develop a moderated mediation model at the subsidiary level to examine how shared language affects subsidiaries&rsquo; tacit knowledge inflows from HQ. Specifically, we study (1) whether this relationship is mediated by the extent to which subsidiary managers share HQ goals and vision, and the extent to which Human Resources decisions are centralized at HQ; and (2) whether subsidiary type (greenfields vs acquisitions) moderates these mediated relationships such that in both cases the mediation will be stronger in foreign acquisitions compared with foreign greenfields. Building on a sample of 817 subsidiaries in 9 countries/regions and a novel subjective measure of shared language, we find support for our model.
