A cross-cultural test of the framework among Chinese (toward Japan) and American (toward Russia) consumers supports the mediational role of emotions, and finds that agonistic emotions are related to NWOM and product avoidance, but not product quality judgment. In contrast, retreat emotions are related to product avoidance and product quality judgment, but not NWOM.

Central to our understanding of the effects of IPRs on product access is the influence of national differences in patent protection on corporate behavior and business strategy of multinational firms. Using detailed product data on US exports from 1990 to 2000, this research note assesses the impact of strengthening IPRs in developing countries on product variety of US exports. Colonial origin and cross-industry variation in patent effectiveness serve to identify the impact. The results show that the strengthening of IPRs increased exports of new products in patent-sensitive industries. The expansion in product variety accounted for the entire increase in US exports. The findings substantiate claims that ratification of TRIPS by developing countries promotes access to new foreign products and technologies. Additionally, the results demonstrate that patent protection is a significant institutional factor in US firms&rsquo; business decisions over the introduction of new products and processes into a developing country marketplace.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Does stronger patent protection increase export variety&quest; Evidence from US product-level data", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n6/full/jibs201512a.html", "ex:pages": "724-731", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Olena Ivus"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "Using in-depth data from 155 Pakistani auto components suppliers, we study the role of socialization in knowledge transfer from international joint venture assemblers.

Four studies in three countries show that high-cosmopolitan consumers demonstrate environmental concern and engage in sustainable behavior. To successfully target this promising segment with sustainable products or messages to promote sustainable behavior, marketers and public policymakers should highlight the benefit of these products/behaviors for the global (rather than the local) environment.

Building on institutional, network, and organizational-learning theory, we suggest that firms imitate the internationalization modes of their peers in their network. Moreover, we argue that a firm&rsquo;s imitation propensity depends on two important boundary conditions: network position and past experience. Applying a longitudinal event history analysis to analyze the complete population of 977 German biotechnology firms between 1996 and 2012 largely supports our hypotheses. Our findings reveal that firms imitate the internationalization modes of their peers in a precise manner. This implies that the imitation of others can initially serve as a presumably convenient low-risk shortcut to a planned or experience-driven internationalization process. Furthermore, our results confirm that this imitation process is channeled through formal network relations and that central network positions that are associated with superior information access, enhanced legitimacy, and status may promote deviating behavior. Acknowledging the interplay of different learning sources, our findings additionally show that initial internationalization mode choices of SMEs can have a lasting effect on subsequent internationalization behavior. Overall, our study contributes to a more nuanced view of imitative behavior of internationalizing SMEs and its boundary conditions, and highlights future research opportunities that exist for considering imitation and its implications in international business research.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "SME internationalization modes in the German biotechnology industry: The influence of imitation, network position, and international experience", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n6/full/jibs20158a.html", "ex:pages": "629-655", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Marie Oehme"}, {"ex:name": "Suleika Bort"}]}]
