[{"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "How do the senior decision-makers within a multinational enterprise (MNE) think through and determine an internationalization decision? Despite the cognitive foundations of several key constructs, standard internationalization models do not explicitly incorporate managerial cognition. We argue that the boundedly rational decision-maker is underspecified in international business models and this oversight contributes to weak empirical findings on experience, learning, internationalization strategy and MNE performance. Drawing on these extant models, we identify seven knowledge domains and interdependencies that may make up decision-makers&rsquo; mental models. Granted rare access to senior executives and board members engaged in a foreign direct investment decision, we find substantial heterogeneity in the mental models these individuals used to make sense of the opportunity. This variance aligns with differences in individuals&rsquo; experience along four dimensions: international breadth, depth, diversity and prior strategic decision-making. We argue these cognitive processes &ndash; how individuals exercise judgment about information search parameters, assessment and decision integration, and how decision teams coalesce in their thinking &ndash; are crucial microfoundations for modeling heterogeneity in firm-level internationalization strategies and performance.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Managerial cognition and internationalization", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n7/full/jibs20159a.html", "ex:pages": "733-760", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Elizabeth Maitland", "Andr&eacute; Sammartino"]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "We study the conditions under which firms can capitalize on their international human capital (IHC).

While extant research has examined antecedents of separate targets of identification, it has not fully addressed the challenge of identifying factors capable of supporting both simultaneously. This study examines the influence of individual- and organizational-level factors on the dual values-based identification of foreign subsidiary employees. Drawing on acculturation and organizational socialization theory, we test hypotheses on multilevel data from 793 managers and professionals in 90 foreign subsidiaries belonging to 11 Nordic MNCs. The results show that dual values-based identification is associated with acculturation and first-hand contact at the individual level, and a supportive social context for affective learning at the organizational level. Through its emphasis on higher-order elements that connect different parts of the MNC, rather than those that lead to the formation of in-groups and out-groups, the values-based approach to identification contributes to our understanding of dual identification in MNC subsidiaries, and represents a more positive treatment of cultural diversity. The findings have heightened practical relevance given the emphasis individuals are placing on values congruence in career choices and MNC efforts at instilling shared values.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Dual values-based organizational identification in MNC subsidiaries: A multilevel study", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n7/full/jibs201518a.html", "ex:pages": "761-783", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Adam Smale", "Ingmar Bjorkman", "Mats Ehrnrooth", "Sofia John", "Kristiina Makela", "Jennie Sumelius"]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "This research proposes a strategic human capital alignment framework to examine whether the alignment between subsidiary strategy (i.e., export-oriented vs local market-oriented strategy) and human capital (i.e., parent firm vs local-specific human capital) is positively related to subsidiary performance in multinational enterprises (MNEs). We further explore two important exogenous (i.e., foreign exchange rate change) and endogenous (i.e., MNE international experience) boundary conditions, since they may adjust the positive effect of strategic human capital alignment on performance. The analysis, based on 5604 subsidiary observations of 423 MNEs from 1990 to 2012, confirms the positive synergic effect of aligning subsidiary strategy and human capital and shows the moderating effects of foreign exchange rate change and MNE international experience. By presenting the importance of subsidiary strategy &ndash; global staffing alignment and the roles of external economic environments and internal organizational capabilities as boundary conditions, the strategic human capital alignment framework suggests that what makes human capital valuable for the firm is its alignment with strategic orientation.
