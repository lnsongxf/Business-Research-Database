[{"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "In this article we draw from social cognition theory to explore the influence of confirmation bias on perceptions of psychic distance. Despite the prominence of psychic distance, and other forms of distance, as potential predictor variables in international business (IB) research, very little work has been done exploring the factors and processes that shape a decision maker&rsquo;s perceptions of distance. We argue in this article that social cognition theory can help fill that void. Specifically, we hypothesize that confirmation bias may influence managers&rsquo; processing of information concerning differences between cultures. Such a bias may cause managers to attend more to information that confirms pre-existing beliefs, and discount information that contradicts pre-existing beliefs, thus biasing their perceptions of psychic distance. Using an experimental approach, the impact of confirmation bias on perceptions of psychic distance is confirmed in a sample of 200 Australian managers. The observed changes in perceptions are also associated with changes in perceptions of risk and preferences for entry modes in a hypothetical business scenario. As a result this article demonstrates how the application of social psychology theories and methods can provide new theoretical perspectives to explain when, how, and why individual-level perceptions of psychic distance might diverge from national-level averages.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Confirmation bias in individual-level perceptions of psychic distance: An experimental investigation", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n8/full/jibs201519a.html", "ex:pages": "938-959", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Daniel W Baack", "Douglas Dow", "Ronaldo Parente", "Donald R Bacon"]}, {"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "A foreign distributor&rsquo;s motivation to perform local marketing tasks for an exporter is often poor due to agency conflicts and transaction cost constraints characterizing the export channel. While exporters may engage in actions such as offering incentives and overseeing partner activities to improve foreign marketing, such intrusions into partner operations often fail to enhance the distributor&rsquo;s role performance. Drawing on motivation theory, the authors develop a model explaining the efficiency of different incentive types in enhancing the distributor&rsquo;s motivational context to act on behalf of the exporter, thereby improving relationship quality, distributor relationship-specific investments, and, consequently, distributor role performance. The authors use a sample of 278 European exporters to test hypotheses regarding relationship factors that mediate and moderate the incentive&ndash;role performance relationship. The results indicate that the impact of low-powered incentives (LPIs) substitutes for the effect of high-powered incentives on relationship quality and specific investments, the key mediators driving distributor role performance. In addition, exporter oversight of distributor activities weakens the effectiveness of LPIs to increase distributor-specific investment. The authors derive implications for designing portfolios of incentives, with inferences based on efficiently matching incentive-induced motivational context with foreign distributor&rsquo;s actions required to accomplish exporter goals.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Effect of exporter&rsquo;s incentives on foreign distributor&rsquo;s role performance", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n8/full/jibs201517a.html", "ex:pages": "960-983", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Claude Obadia", "Daniel C Bello", "David I Gilliland"]}, {"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "This article exploits changes in country-level employment protection regulations as a source of plausibly exogenous variation in labor laws and finds that these regulations play an important role in cross&dash;border merger activity. Over the 1991&ndash;2009 period, countries that tighten employment regulations attract more foreign acquirers, especially those from countries with relatively more flexible labor regulations. The results appear to be robust to alternative specifications. Importantly these patterns are pronounced in those recipient country sectors in which foreign acquirers may find attractive targets at bargain prices: sectors with relatively high productivity and skill. The article also provides evidence suggesting that, because pro-labor reforms allow foreign acquirers to cherry pick more skilled and productive local firms, these transactions are associated with greater deal synergies and improved post-merger operating performance.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Labor market regulations and cross-border mergers and acquisitions", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n8/full/jibs201516a.html", "ex:pages": "984-1009", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Azizjon Alimov"]}, {"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "A recent Journal of International Business Studies editorial on interaction effects within and across levels highlighted the importance of and difficulty associated with justifying and reporting of such interaction effects.

We propose that subsidiaries pay varying levels of attention to demands depending on their peers&rsquo; norm-conforming behavior, resulting in heterogeneous practice implementation. We study the implementation of 25 practices, associated with three corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues in 101 worldwide subsidiaries of a multinational enterprise (MNE). Consistent with the idea that attention is limited and therefore selective, we find that external peers&rsquo; conformity to the CSR norm directs subsidiaries&rsquo; attention toward the CSR-related demands of external constituents at the expense of the demands from the headquarters. However, internal peers&rsquo; conformity increases attention to both external and headquarters&rsquo; demands related to CSR. As higher attention levels result in higher practice implementation, internal and external peers&rsquo; conformity drives the heterogeneity of practice implementation in the MNE. Our results suggest the need to rethink the influence of peers&rsquo; conformity on subsidiaries&rsquo; implementation of practices, as it not only triggers mimicry based on legitimacy but also and simultaneously a more strategic response based on internal and external competitive threats and attention allocation.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Peer conformity, attention, and heterogeneous implementation of practices in MNEs", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n8/full/jibs201521a.html", "ex:pages": "917-937", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Rodolphe Durand", "Anne Jacqueminet"]}]
