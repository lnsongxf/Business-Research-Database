[{"ex:issue": "9", "ex:abstract": "Understanding the influence of culture on business operations has been one of the most enduring components of international business (IB) and international management (IM) theorizing and empirical investigation. While several critiques and debates questioned the significant progress made in this domain, the special issue we introduce here is meant to demonstrate that further advancement on how we conceptualize and measure culture is not only needed, but also possible. We provide an overview of past and current approaches in the measurement of culture in IB/IM and the challenges associated with these approaches, and emphasize the important, yet insufficiently acknowledged, link between the theoretical conceptualization of culture and its measurement. We then introduce the four articles included in the special issue and highlight how they break away from the &ldquo;addiction&rdquo; to approaches that have been very useful in getting where we are today, but that might not always be useful in advancing knowledge beyond what we already know. Last but not the least, we offer our own perspective on promising directions in conceptually and methodologically rethinking the study of culture in IB and IM.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Conceptualizing and measuring culture in international business and management: From challenges to potential solutions", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n9/full/jibs201533a.html", "ex:pages": "1011-1027", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Dan V Caprar"}, {"ex:name": "Timothy M Devinney"}, {"ex:name": "Bradley L Kirkman"}, {"ex:name": "Paula Caligiuri"}]}, {"ex:issue": "9", "ex:abstract": "International business (IB) research has predominantly relied on value constructs to account for the influence of societal culture, notably Hofstede&rsquo;s cultural dimensions. While parsimonious, the value approach&rsquo;s assumptions about the consensus of values within nations, and the generality and stability of cultural patterns of behavior are increasingly challenged. We review two promising alternatives &ndash; the constructivist approach centering on schemas and the intersubjectivist approach centering on norms &ndash; and the evidence that demonstrates their usefulness in accounting for international differences in the behavior of managers, employees, and consumers. We propose a situated dynamics framework, specifying the role of values, schemas, and norms in accounting for cultural differences, and delineating conditions under which each causal mechanism is operative. Values play a more important role in accounting for cultural differences in weak situations where fewer constraints are perceived; schemas play a more important role when situational cues increase their accessibility and relevance; and norms play a more important role when social evaluation is salient. Directions for future research based on this integrative framework and its implications for the measurement of culture and application in IB are discussed.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Values, schemas, and norms in the culture&ndash;behavior nexus: A situated dynamics framework", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n9/full/jibs201466a.html", "ex:pages": "1028-1050", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Kwok Leung"}, {"ex:name": "Michael W Morris"}]}, {"ex:issue": "9", "ex:abstract": "Most research on culture in international business either aggregates people within a country into a single, homogeneous, national culture, or examines heterogeneity within countries based on exogenous criteria. In this study, we explore heterogeneity in cultural values within and across countries endogenously through the configurations of values people share in common. We develop a theory of culture archetypes and use a novel methodology that identifies a small number of distinct configurations of values &ndash; archetypes &ndash; in our data. These data come from the World Values Survey 2005 and Schwartz&rsquo;s model of culture. We identify four culture archetypes in Japan, USA and China, and six in India. The existence of transnational and subnational archetypes across the four countries suggests the need to recognize culture as a combination of universal &ndash; etic &ndash; as well as unique &ndash; emic &ndash; characteristics. Our approach also distinguishes between those individuals represented by our archetypes and those individuals who more closely resemble the average values of a country. By unifying both archetypes and national averages within one theoretical and methodological schema we thus reconcile the conflicting perspectives in the field.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Mindscapes across landscapes: Archetypes of transnational and subnational culture", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n9/full/jibs201511a.html", "ex:pages": "1051-1079", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Sunil Venaik"}, {"ex:name": "David F Midgley"}]}, {"ex:issue": "9", "ex:abstract": "This article reports the development and validation of a theory-based, short form measure of cultural intelligence (SFCQ). The SFCQ captures the original theoretical intent of a multifaceted culture general form of intelligence that is related to effective intercultural interactions. The validity of the scale is established with 3526 participants in five language groups from around the world. Results provide evidence for construct and criterion-related validity of the measure, and indicate that cultural intelligence is a single latent factor reflected in three intermediate facets. In support of construct validity the measure is modestly related to but distinct from emotional intelligence and personality and correlates positively with several indicators of multicultural experience. With regard to criterion-related validity, it relates as predicted to several dimensions of intercultural effectiveness.

Not only do high levels of fractionalization affect the use of statistical means to account for cultural distance (CD), we show that it is not constant and therefore the dynamics of change need to be addressed. We pursue the study of the dynamics and potential endogeneity through an in-depth case study of South Africa over the course of the twentieth century. There is evidence of processes of modernization whereby economic progress impacts upon ELF. There are also complex interactions between the various measures of fractionalization and other sociopolitical and institutional variables. This provides us with an opportunity to bridge the CD and institutional distance literature as institutions impact upon culture and multinational enterprises, and institutional development is, in turn, affected by these. We call for a more realistic assessment of what is being captured in cultural measures and for recognition of the complexity of the notion of identity formation and its dynamics. Countries may have different underlying cultural schisms, including ELF, and its introduction will allow for a richer exploration of distance and diversity in International Business.", "ex:volume": "46", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "The impact of ethno-linguistic fractionalization on cultural measures: Dynamics, endogeneity and modernization", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v46/n9/full/jibs20156a.html", "ex:pages": "1080-1098", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "John M Luiz"}]}]
