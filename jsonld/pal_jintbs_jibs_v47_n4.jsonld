[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Selecting appropriate samples in cultural distance research is vital to producing valid empirical results. Over 80&percnt; of empirical cultural distance studies use a sample comprised of either a single home country with varying host countries or a single host country with varying home countries. When difference scores are used in the calculation of cultural distance based on single-country samples the resulting cultural distance measures typically are highly correlated with one or more of the varying countries&rsquo; underlying national culture dimensions, making it impossible to determine whether findings are due to cultural distance or to varying countries&rsquo; national culture effects. This is referred to as a confounded variables problem and means that for an overwhelming number of cultural distance studies, we cannot with certainty have confidence in the verity of their findings. To resolve this uncertainty we propose that cultural distance scholars select samples comprised of at least two home/host countries. We empirically demonstrate that two-country samples where most of the national culture dimensions for the two countries differ create certitude with respect to results, eliminating the cultural distance confounded variables problem. We describe the single-country sample problem, illustrate the proposed a priori two-country solution, and suggest avenues for future research.", "ex:volume": "47", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Solving the single-country sample problem in cultural distance studies", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v47/n4/full/jibs201615a.html", "ex:pages": "471-479", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Lance Eliot Brouthers"}, {"ex:name": "Victor B Marshall"}, {"ex:name": "Dawn L Keig"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "The question that motivated this editorial was, &ldquo;where are the IB experiments?&rdquo; The short answer is that experiments are largely absent from the IB literature; and we argue that they shouldn&rsquo;t be.

We theorize that synergies will emerge in foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) when cultural differences in leadership beliefs are less central to the host nation&rsquo;s cultural identity; while disruption will occur when differences are in more culturally central leadership beliefs. Analyzing survival data from 274 FIEs in China, we found support for these hypotheses with five of the six GLOBE leadership dimensions. As predicted, differences in the Participative and Team-Oriented dimensions were associated with higher firm death, while differences in the Charismatic, Autonomous and Self-Protective dimensions were associated with firm survival. Our results indicate that while there are areas where differences may indeed need to be accepted or minimized, there are other areas where differences can be beneficial. This requires that managers identify more central aspects of local culture to determine whether to minimize differences or to leverage their synergistic potential.", "ex:volume": "47", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Cultural friction in leadership beliefs and foreign-invested enterprise survival", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v47/n4/full/jibs201616a.html", "ex:pages": "453-470", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Pamela Tremain Koch"}, {"ex:name": "Bradley Koch"}, {"ex:name": "Tanya Menon"}, {"ex:name": "Oded Shenkar"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "This study investigates the impact of language barriers on multilingual virtual teams members&rsquo; choice between different communication media in their inner-team interactions.

Our study advances research on communication and knowledge exchange in multilingual virtual collaboration by showing how language barriers alter the process of converging different viewpoints through team interaction, by suggesting language-related modifications to the seminal media synchronicity theory, and by demonstrating the benefits of new media in multilingual settings. It also broadens the disciplinary scope of language research in international business by introducing theories from communication studies and cognitive research.

We develop this index using a multi-step data-driven procedure involving five data standardizations, seven weighting approaches, and five aggregation methods.
