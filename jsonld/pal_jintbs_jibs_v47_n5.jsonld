[{"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "This article evaluates the effect of adopting Internet-enabled information and communication technology (ICT adoption) on the decision to reorganize production across national borders (foreign boundary decision) by multinational enterprises (MNEs). Using a transaction cost framework, we argue that ICT adoption influences foreign boundary decisions by lowering coordination costs both internally and externally for the firm. We propose that the heterogeneity in the technology&rsquo;s characteristics, namely complexity and the production processes&rsquo; degree of codifiability, moderate this influence. Using a difference-in-differences methodology and exploiting the richness of confidential US Census Bureau microdata, we find that overall ICT adoption is positively associated with greater likelihood of in-house production, as measured by increases in intra-firm trade shares. Furthermore, we find that more complex forms of ICT are associated with larger increases in intra-firm trade shares. Finally, our results indicate that MNEs in industries in which production specifications are more easily codified in an electronic format are less likely to engage in intra-firm relative to arm&rsquo;s length trade following ICT adoption.", "ex:volume": "47", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "The impact of information and communication technology adoption on multinational firm boundary decisions", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v47/n5/full/jibs20166a.html", "ex:pages": "563-576", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Wenjie Chen"}, {"ex:name": "Fariha Kamal"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "This article outlines the evolution of additive manufacturing technology, culminating in 3D printing and presents a vision of how this evolution is affecting existing global value chains (GVCs) in production. In particular, we bring up questions about how this new technology can affect the geographic span and density of GVCs. Potentially, wider adoption of this technology has the potential to partially reverse the trend towards global specialization of production systems into elements that may be geographically dispersed and closer to the end users (localization). This leaves the question of whether in some industries diffusion of 3D printing technologies may change the role of multinational enterprises as coordinators of GVCs by inducing the engagement of a wider variety of firms, even households.", "ex:volume": "47", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Global value chains from a 3D printing perspective", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v47/n5/full/jibs201547a.html", "ex:pages": "595-609", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Andr&eacute; O Laplume"}, {"ex:name": "Bent Petersen"}, {"ex:name": "Joshua M Pearce"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "The new techno-economic paradigm of the information age has brought about new structures and processes in international business (IB).

These firms offer a platform that allows users to interact with each other and generate value through user co-creation of content. Because of this, ibusiness firms face different challenges when they internationalize compared with traditional firms, even those online. In this article we extend existing internationalization theory to encompass this new type of organization. We theorize that because ibusiness firms produce value through the creation and coordination of a network of users, these firms tend to suffer greater liabilities of outsidership when expanding abroad and therefore concentrate on network and diffusion-based user adoption processes as they internationalize. Based on a multi-case investigation of a sample of ibusiness firms, we develop new theory and testable hypotheses.

Combining knowledge from different specialties could be a costly process in the international technology alliances (ITAs) context. We argue that the combination of different specializations requires the development of &ldquo;trans-specialization understanding&rdquo; (TSU) instead of the internalization of partners&rsquo; specialist knowledge. This article examines the extent to which inter-firm governance in ITAs shapes TSU, and whether the development of TSU is endangered by cultural distance. We hypothesize that relational governance, product modularity, and cultural distance influence TSU development, which in turn influences firm performance. We collected data from 110 non-equity ITAs between software and hardware firms participating in the mobile device sector. We analyzed the data using partial least squares path modeling. Our findings suggest that TSU largely depends on product modularity and relational governance in alliances. However, while cultural distance negatively moderates the path from relational governance to TSU, it has no effect on the relationship between product modularity and TSU. Based on this, we conclude that product modularity can substitute for relational governance when strong relational norms are not well-developed in international alliances. Thus cultural distance does not invariably amount to a liability in ITAs.", "ex:volume": "47", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Trans-specialization understanding in international technology alliances: The influence of cultural distance", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v47/n5/full/jibs201610a.html", "ex:pages": "577-594", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Yong Kyu Lew"}, {"ex:name": "Rudolf R Sinkovics"}, {"ex:name": "Mo Yamin"}, {"ex:name": "Zaheer Khan"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:volume": "47", "ex:source": "Journal of International Business Studies", "ex:title": "Do international investors enhance private firm value&quest; Evidence from venture capital", "ex:url": "http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v47/n5/full/jibs201626a.html", "ex:pages": "620-620", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Douglas Cumming"}, {"ex:name": "April Knill"}, {"ex:name": "Kelsey Syvrud"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "International business literature has largely explained the international dispersion of firms&rsquo; activities as a choice based on trade-offs between cost minimisation, knowledge seeking, managing transaction costs and maintaining control.

Linking the characteristics of a product to the scope for horizontal and vertical decoupling in a value network allows us to re-frame recent discussions in the literature about fragmentation of activities vs tasks and to develop an overall picture of the way industry-specific peculiarities characterise (and also constrain) viable international configurations. We show how our framework can be used to interpret data on the scope for decoupling and dispersion collected from industry experts and elucidate the relationships between configuration options and measures of product characteristics.
