The U.S. firms employed a variety of hedging techniques.The recent experiments with quasi-floating exchange rates have produced new evidence on some old questions about exchange-rate flexibility. One of these questions is whether substantial flexibility disrupts international trade by stimulating more demand for forward-exchange cover than the market can easily satisfy.1For affirmative answers to this question, see the following: H.S. Houthakker, &ldquo;Exchange Rate Adjustment,&rdquo; in U.S. Congress, Subcommittee of the Joint Economic Committee, Factors Affecting the United States Balance of Payments, 87th Cong., 2d. sess., Washington, 1962, pp. 292&ndash;93: Robert V.

Halm (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton Univ. Press, 1970), pp. 203&ndash;08. Those who answer this question in the affirmative usually reason along the following lines. Substantial exchange-rate flexibility leads business management to expect greater exchange-rate variations. Therefore, management seeks to cover more of its foreign-exchange explosure (i.e., seeks to &ldquo;insure&rdquo; against the greater exchange rate risk by purchasing or selling foreign currency forward. &copy; 1973 JIBS.

The manufacturing and extractive industries.One of the most significant global developments of post World War II is the massive growth of multinational business operations. Although most of this growth is concentrated in the manufacturing and extractive industries, U.S. Service firms increasingly are establishing beachheads of their own abroad. This development raises questions relating to the underlying motives of and problems encountered in the multinationalization of U.S. service firms. To address these and other issues, a mail survey of multinational advertising, consulting, and law firms was conducted in 1971. A three-page questionnaire, consisting of open-ended questions, served as the survey instrument.&copy; 1973 JIBS.

On the other, we have assertions by individuals that multinational enterprises are among the foremost practitioners of corruption, particularly in the less-developed nations where they operate. In view of these parallel developments, it would appear that there would be much more research and, thereafter, discussion of multinational corruption in the programs and literature of international business than presently exists. Some possible reasons for the lack of treatment given to this area may be (1) the difficulties in defining the phenomenon; (2) the delicacy of the research which characterizes the area; (3) the problems of obtaining data; and (4) the lack of agreement on the political, social, and economic effects of corruption.&copy; 1973 JIBS.
