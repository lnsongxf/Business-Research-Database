[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Rutgers University assumes with enthusiasm responsibility for publishing the Journal of International Business Studies. Through this statement the University&apos;s Graduate School of Business Administration tells its academic, business and government colleagues the world over that it will execute this responsibility diligently. The School does not make this commitment lightly, nor without recognizing that during the next decade universities will be under great pressure to cut costs and to economize in other ways. But, the School also recognizes that journals of quality are essential to scholarship, teaching and the advancement of knowledge. We will, therefore, support the Journal to the best of our ability.&copy; 1975 JIBS.

This note presents data on one input&ndash;the demand for higher level personnel in international business as reflected by advertisements. The methodology involved clipping advertisements of &ldquo;positions available&rdquo; in international business from The Wall Street Journal during the eighteen month period, October 1973 through March 1975. Then they were classified according to the qualifications specified. It should be noted that such advertisements tend to be for experienced persons rather than for newly graduated students. They do not indicate what the market looks for when recruiting students with training in International Business. Rather, such advertisements suggest what qualifications will be needed for advancement in the international activities of firms so long as future business requirements continue the same as at present. In other words, an analysis of advertisements provides information on only one dimension, albeit an important one, of the market for persons trained for international business. Attention also should be given to trends in international business problems and activities that, in the future, may create a demand for different skills than at present. One can list other methodologies needed.&copy; 1975 JIBS.
