An understanding of the essential elements of the Western and Japanese management systems helps us to understand the results. Secondary findings were that problems for expatriate managers were more apparent in international firms than joint ventures, and for expatriate American-owned firms than their Western European counterparts.&copy; 1977 JIBS.
