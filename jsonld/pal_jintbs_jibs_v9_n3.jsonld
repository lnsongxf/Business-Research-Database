The subscriber of the product test magazines, seen as an important group of purchasers and trend setters, were found to have less favorable attitudes to all aspects of advertising studied in 1976 than 1970, both in the U.S and West Germany. Differences in attitudes among age groups are much more clearly structured in 1976, with young subscribers showing consistently lower attitudes. Differences are shown between countries, particularly in varied views of economic and social dimensions. Implications are discussed and future research suggested.&copy; 1978 JIBS.
