In a subsequent experiment, these findings were extended to hypothetical choices in which the acquisition and forfeiture conditions were created by manipulating initial attribute-level reference states instead of ownership.

In this article, the authors build on the sunk cost literature (e.g., Thaler 1980, 1985) and predict that price bundling leads to a disassociation or “decoupling” of transaction costs and benefits, thereby reducing attention to sunk costs and decreasing a consumer’s likelihood of consuming a paid-for service (e.g., a theater performance). Four studies show this to be the case. In two lab studies, the authors show that having a bundled four-day ski pass as opposed to four one-day ski tickets decreases a person’s likelihood of skiing on the final day of a four-day ski vacation. They replicate this result in a field study, showing that multiperformance ticket holders are more likely to forgo a given theatrical performance than are single-performance ticket holders, all else held constant. In a final study, the authors show that the decreased attention to sunk costs brought about by price bundling can be either cognitively driven (i.e., it is difficult to allocate a single payment across multiple benefits) or motivationally driven (i.e., there is an underlying desire to avoid consumption).

Experiment 2 tested the theory in a print advertising context and extended the design by manipulating the type of ethnic prime participants saw (Asian or Caucasian) and the market that the focal advertisement targeted (Asian or Caucasian).

Building on this general proposition, the authors show that the introduction of the no-choice option strengthens the attraction effect, weakens the compromise effect, and decreases the relative share of an option that is “average” on all dimensions. They also examine the mechanisms underlying the impact of having the option not to choose and the conditions under which the no-choice option is likely to affect relative option shares.

Because these applications employ real-world data in which the true number of segments is unknown, it is not clear whether these criteria are effective.

Specifically, the authors hypothesize that consumers often evaluate LPs on the basis of their individual effort to obtain the reward relative to the relevant reference effort (e.g., the effort of typical other consumers). When consumers believe they have an effort advantage over typical others (i.e., an idiosyncratic fit with the LP), higher program requirements magnify this perception of advantage and can therefore increase the overall perceived value of the program. The authors support this proposition in a series of studies in which the perceived idiosyncratic fit was manipulated either by reducing the individual effort or by raising the reference effort. The authors’ findings also indicate that (1) idiosyncratic fit considerations are elicited spontaneously, (2) idiosyncratic fit mediates the effect of effort on consumer response to LPs, and (3) an alternative account for the results based on signaling is not supported.

For example, to target consumers for a coupon mailing, a retail chain may want to predict whether a prospective customer’s grocery expenditures exceed a predetermined threshold. The current approach to this prediction problem is to model the response variable and then apply the discretizing function to the predicted value of the response variable. In contrast with this “indirect” approach, the authors propose a “direct” approach in which they model discretized values of the response variable. They show theoretically that the direct approach achieves better predictive performance than the commonly used indirect approach when the response model is misspecified and the sample size is large. These two conditions are commonly met in direct marketing situations. This result is counterintuitive because the direct approach entails “throwing away” information. However, although both the discretized response data and the continuous data provide biased predictions when a misspecified model is used, the lower information content of the discretized variable helps the bias be smaller. The authors demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in a simulation experiment, a retail targeting application, and a customer satisfaction application.

They account for variability across stores through a random-effects factor structure that represents the variation of within- and between-category price effects separately. The model is calibrated on weekly store sales data of items in three orange juice subcategories (refrigerated, frozen, and shelf-stable). The authors study competition between national brands and private labels across the subcategories, for which their model lends itself well. The results show asymmetrical price competition not only within but also across subcategories: the cross-subcategory impact of national brands on store brands appears to be substantially greater than that of store brands on national brands. In addition, the model supports the implementation of price zones at a more granular level than the current practice.", "e:keyword": ["Local polynomial regression", "Dirichlet process prior", "Bayesian shrinkage", "Nonparametrics", "Cross-category price effects", "National brand", "Private label", "Store brand"]}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.41.4.457.47014", "e:abstract": "Previous research has explored how both internal and external references prices affect consumer perceptions and consequently the price that consumers are willing to pay for a product or service.

Specifically, the authors find that standards competition motivates consumers to pay more attention to information that is comparative in nature. Thus, information about the relative (absolute) performance of a product has a stronger (weaker) impact on a product's share in markets with standards competition (Study 1). Standards competition also moderates the effectiveness of different advertising formats: It strengthens the effect of comparative advertisements but weakens the effect of noncomparative advertisements (Study 2). As a result, two commonly observed drawbacks of comparative advertisements—negative attitude toward the ad and source confusion—disappear in the presence of standards competition (Study 2), and comparative advertisements even induce greater confidence in the advertised brand (Study 3). Finally, in the presence of standards competition, the superiority of comparative advertisements is stronger when the advertised brand has a disadvantage in terms of brand familiarity than when it has an advantage (Study 3).

Second, some, but not all, executional elements that have been shown (in the literature) to drive recall and persuasion are effective at driving perceptions of similarity.

Information products are market forecasts that are available from different competing information sellers; information buyers use these products to make repeated marketing decisions. Sellers set prices to maximize their profit, and buyers decide from which sellers to buy to maximize their own profit (through their marketing decisions). Buyers and sellers are assigned to one of two quality conditions: high-quality, reliable information and low-quality, unreliable information. The reliability of information products (forecasts) is exogenously set and must be inferred by both buyers and sellers from historical forecasts about another market. The results from this experimental market fully support the theory. After some experimentation, prices converge to levels that are strikingly different between the two quality conditions: Prices are significantly higher when the information sold is unreliable (low quality).

This enables the authors to estimate cross-promotion effects by imputing the level of competitive promotions. The authors test the proposed model on synthetic data through a Monte Carlo experiment. Then, they apply and test the model to actual prescription and sampling data from two main competing pharmaceutical firms in the same therapeutic category. The two tests show that compared with several benchmark models, the proposed random coefficients hidden Markov model successfully imputes unobserved competitive promotions and, accordingly, reduces biases in the own- and cross-promotion parameters. Furthermore, the proposed model provides better predictive validity than the benchmark models.", "e:keyword": ["Sales promotion", "Sales forecasting", "Hidden Markov model", "Missing data problem", "Hierarchical Bayes analysis"]}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.3.516", "e:abstract": "Hedging offsets the risk of an existing stake by counterbalancing it with a new stake—for example, complementing a bet on the race favorite with another bet on a promising upstart.

Second, how effective are the temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal price search strategies in obtaining lower prices? and Third, what is the impact of alternative price search strategies on retailer profit? The authors use a unique data collection approach that combines household surveys with observed purchase data to address these questions. Their key results are as follows: Geography (the spatial configuration of store and household locations) and opportunity costs are useful predictors of a household's price search pattern. Households that claim to search spatiotemporally avail approximately three-quarters of the available savings on average. Households that search only temporally save about the same as those that search only spatially.

However, the direct measurement of preferences, or rather utilities, has been criticized as being imprecise in many cases. Against this background, the authors present a compositional consumer preference measurement approach based on paired comparisons, otherwise known as PCPM. The trade-off character of paired comparisons ensures that the stated judgments are more intuitive than traditional self-explicated preference statements. In contrast to the latter, PCPM accounts for response errors and thus allows for the elicitation of more precise preferences. The authors benchmark PCPM against adaptive conjoint analysis and computer-assisted self-explication of multiattributed preferences to demonstrate its relative validity and predictive accuracy in two empirical studies using complex, high-involvement products.

Second, the authors study how consumers' reactions to inventory shortages differ across customer segments. They use these observations to illustrate how the seller might benefit from prioritizing fulfillment policies according to customer traits.

This debate raises the question: Do a retail chain's PL investments subsidize rival PLs? In addition, how does this affect their choice share vis-à-vis national brands? The authors investigate whether consumers generalize knowledge from product experience across PLs of different retail chains and whether such cross-brand learning depends on the PL brands' link with the chain name or on their quality differences. The proposed brand choice model captures cross-brand learning through quality perception spillovers (consumers adjust beliefs about PL quality on the basis of consumption experience) and familiarity spillovers (uncertainty about a PL diminishes with rival PL consumption). Household scanner panel data on dish soap and breakfast cereals yield clear evidence of cross-retailer learning among standard PLs, regardless of their name or quality differences. The results also reveal that familiarity spillovers dominate quality-level spillovers, implying that the presence of cross-learning benefits PLs and enhances their market position relative to national brands.

Thus, communication mix elements—advertising and word of mouth (WOM)—can play important, distinct, and yet interdependent roles in stimulating new product demand. Their effectiveness may fluctuate within and across stages and spill over from earlier to later stages. Thus, the authors construct a dynamic linear model to study the dynamic effects of advertising and WOM on demand for heterogeneous products across stages.

The results show that advertising and WOM exert dynamic, yet diverse, influences on demand for new products. For example, while increased ad spending is more effective at an earlier stage due to repetition wear-in and synergy with WOM, increased WOM activities at a later stage could become more powerful in driving demand.

The authors show that the impact of effectiveness cues on product usage is driven by inference making and is moderated by cue salience and people's need for cognition.

Consistent with this perspective, five studies demonstrate that attribute numerosity benefits hedonic more than utilitarian options by increasing the extent to which the former appear useful. Consequently, increasing attribute quantity equally across the choice set shifts choice toward hedonic options, regardless of whether the attributes are hedonic, utilitarian, or mixed in nature. Consistent with this conceptualization, these effects become amplified when decision makers engage in heuristic processing and when priming makes usefulness salient.

In this article, the authors focus on one such rigidity: the constraints faced by firms in fine-tuning contracts to the full distribution of heterogeneity of their employees. The authors explore the implication of these constraints for the provision of incentives within the firm. The study’s application is to sales force compensation, wherein a firm maintains a sales force to market its products. Consistent with ubiquitous real-world business practice, the study assumes that a firm is restricted to fully or partially set uniform commissions across its agent pool. The authors show that this restriction implies an interaction between the composition of agent types in the contract and the compensation policy used to motivate them, leading to a “contractual externality” in the firm and generating gains to sorting. This article explains how this contractual externality arises; discusses a practical approach to endogenizing agents and incentives at a firm in its presence; and presents an empirical application to sales force compensation contracts at a U.S. Fortune 500 company that explores these considerations and assesses the gains from a sales force architecture that sorts agents into divisions to balance firmwide incentives. Empirically, the authors find that the restriction to homogeneous plans significantly reduces a firm’s payoff, relative to a fully heterogeneous plan, when the firm is unable to optimize the composition of its agents. However, a firm’s payoff under a homogeneous plan comes very close to that under a fully heterogeneous plan when the firm can optimize both composition and compensation.

In a series of five studies, they show that a touch interface, such as that provided by an iPad, compared with a nontouch interface, such as that of a desktop computer with a mouse, facilitates the choice of an affect-laden alternative over a cognitively superior one—what the authors call the “direct-touch effect.” The studies provide some mediational support that the direct-touch effect is driven by the enhanced mental simulation of product interaction with the more affective choice alternative on touch interfaces. The authors also test the moderator of this effect. Using multiple product pairs as stimuli, the authors obtain consistent results, which have rich theoretical and managerial implications.", "e:keyword": ["Computer interfaces", "Mental simulation", "Sensory marketing", "Embodied cognition", "Food choice"]}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0576", "e:abstract": "Going beyond traditional seasonality, this research introduces the concept of the intrayear category demand cycle. This phenomenon reflects demand cycles most consumer packaged goods categories experience throughout the year, with periods of higher demand following periods of lower demand. The author argues that acknowledging the existence of these cycles and understanding their impact on both advertising and pricing effectiveness and practice is critical for marketers. Specifically, the author demonstrates how both advertising and price elasticities and observed advertising and prices evolve along these cycles for a unique set of 252 brands—ranging from high-advertising, high-priced “premium mass” brands to low-advertising, low-priced “value niche” brands—in 61 consumer packaged goods categories. Overall, both advertising efectiveness and observed advertising are found to be stronger at demand peaks. Surprisingly, consumer reactions to price decreases are weaker at demand peaks, whereas reactions to price increases remain unchanged. However, effectiveness evolutions and observed action patterns along these intrayear cycles are both markedly diverse across the different types of brands.", "e:keyword": ["Advertising", "Price", "Intrayear cyclicality", "Marketing-mix effectiveness", "Time series"]}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0591", "e:abstract": "Consumers often schedule their activities in an attempt to use their time more efficiently. Although the benefits of scheduling are well established, its potential downsides are not well understood. The authors examine whether scheduling uniquely undermines the benefits of leisure activities. In 13 studies using unambiguous leisure activities that consumers commonly schedule (e.g., movies, a coffee break), they find that scheduling a leisure activity (vs. experiencing it impromptu) makes it feel less free-flowing and more work-like. Furthermore, scheduling diminishes utility from leisure activities, in terms of both excitement in anticipation of the activities and experienced enjoyment. Importantly, the authors find that maintaining the free-flowing nature of the activity by “roughly scheduling” (without prespecified times) eliminates this effect, thus indicating that the effect is driven by a detriment from scheduling rather than by a boost from spontaneity.

Specifically, in three experiments, they examine how people react to lump sums versus equivalent streams of monthly income. Their primary question of interest is whether people exhibit more or less sensitivity to changes in retirement wealth expressed as lump sums (e.g., $100,000) or monthly equivalents (e.g., $500 per month for life). They also test whether people exhibit an “illusion of wealth,” by which lump sums seem more adequate than monthly amounts in certain conditions, as well as the opposite effect, in which lump sums seem less adequate.

In eight studies, comprising 11,508 participants making 2,423 donation decisions in both experimental settings and a large-scale natural field experiment, the authors investigate the effect of “choice-option” defaults on the donation rate, average donation amount, and the resulting revenue. They find (1) a “scale-back” effect, in which low defaults reduce average donation amounts; (2) a “lower-bar” effect, in which defaulting a low amount increases donation rate; and (3) a “default-distraction” effect, in which introducing any defaults reduces the effect of other cues, such as positive charity information. Contrary to the view that setting defaults will backfire, defaults increased revenue in the field study.

However, when the contest winner is determined by the minimum or maximum output contribution within the team, heterogeneity in team composition exerts a deleterious effect on team effort, with the stronger and weaker members expending unequal effort. Our model also shows that in a contest between two symmetric teams, when team members are homogeneous, all three contest metrics yield identical team effort; however, when team members are heterogeneous, the average metric elicits the highest team effort.
