Thus, choosing a Weberian point of view, this paper simultaneously describes organizations as `structures of domination' and as `structures of legitimacy'.

For one, data from ten Dutch and eight British companies in the chemical and food and drink industries indicate that the use of advanced manufacturing technologies significantly alters the production environment in terms of product, production and process flexibility. The strength of the impact, however, differs between large batch and mass production on the one hand and continuous process production on the other, and is dependent on the type(s) of automation methods implemented.

Results of the study challenge the mechanistic approach of organizational responses to external pressures, presenting evidence of the interactive nature of such responses.

If these costs become too high, one would expect firms to refrain from investing in innovation. A major function of law and regulation is to reduce such risk and uncertainty. However, national legal systems differ in their capacity to reduce risk and uncertainty both effectively and efficiently.

Although superstition is often regarded as irrational and unfounded, practitioners try to justify it on the grounds of superstition’s substantive validity or instrumental value. Interestingly, half-believers of superstition admit that they experience cognitive dissonance: they should not base their decisions on superstition but they do. Another important finding is that feng shui experts play their roles as expert, provocateur, legitimizer, and comforter in strategic decision-making when providing advice to their business clients.", "e:keyword": ["Superstition", "Feng shui", "Chinese business", "Decision-making", "Uncertainty", "Rationality"]}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0170840604042406", "e:abstract": "The processing of means-end frames is proposed as a key to understanding the reproduction and evolution of organizational fields.

By applying a discursive methodology, we propose a new approach for the study of organizational legitimacy construction that incorporates both its evaluative and cognitive dimensions.

Second, face games generate an ‘interaction order’ that has structuring properties and is therefore central to the social construction of sense within a group setting. We illustrate our contribution through an empirical study of face games and sensemaking within a consultancy task force.

The model focuses on the articulation process within conjunctures of social practice, and in particular how social actors endeavour to make advantageous articulations which achieve a degree of permanence in an inherently changeable world. It also considers how discourses are articulated together to create hybrid forms of professional discourse.

These include a paralysis of resistance, an experience of pollution and uncleanliness, and feelings of disgust, worthlessness and corruption. Miasma may occur in organizations that undergo a sudden transformation involving the discarding and loss of many of their valued members through downsizing or retrenchment, without either separation rituals or psychological mourning.

Based on inductive field research with four research and development teams in a multinational corporation known for innovation, this study addresses the research questions: (a) What are the key constraints experienced by R&D teams and what impact do these have on team creativity?, and (b) Under what conditions do constraints inhibit or enhance R&D team creativity?

Next, drawing upon qualitative data on identity and work from websites and interviews with senior managers in environmental non-governmental organizations, we identify configurations of social position, identity, and work that result in a distinct set of challenger roles.

Findings suggest that unlike the “boundaryless” opportunities associated with globe-trotting professionals, the majority of professional migrants are significantly constrained by the organizational and inter-subjective settings in which they work.

More specifically, identity work proved integral to reaching a temporary identity truce, or reconciliation of experienced contradictions, through distancing from illegitimate others and embedding of one’s identity within an established tradition.

The complex articulation of the relationships involved and the associated often non-predetermined nature of emergent policies, allows for the identification of applicable, e.g. consensus-based, policies. Internat ionalization of production and the TNC is linked with the emergence of internat ional state apparatuses, such as the EC, but also the 'new international division of labour, deindustrialization and 'relative decline'. Being a home base to TNCs does not immunize a country from deindustrialization.

Agency theory attributes uncertainty in performance outcomes to moral hazard, adverse selection and the state of nature.

Even in such settings where it is generalizable, principal-agent approaches to contract design are unrealistic to the extent that they presume that performance in organizations results exclusively from individual-contributor jobs, exagger ate the degree to which individuals are work-averse, and emphasize the quant ity of effort at the expense of the quality and type of effort.

This is referred to as the unmanaged organization, a kind of organizational dreamworld in which desires, anxieties and emotions find expressions in highly irrational construc tions. The chief force in this terrain is fantasy and its landmarks include stories, myths, jokes, gossip, nicknames, graffiti and cartoons. In the organizational dreamworld, emotions prevail over rationality and pleasure over reality.
