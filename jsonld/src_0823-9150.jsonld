Specifically, the authors hypothesize that, if enterprise systems improve management's access to decision-relevant internal information, higher quality management earnings forecasts should ensue. Consistent with disclosure theory and the purported technical characteristics of enterprise systems, the authors find a positive association between enterprise system implementations and subsequent increases in the likelihood of management forecast issuance and the accuracy of the forecasts. Additional robustness tests support the argument that improvements in management forecasts are due to improvements in the firm's internal information environment rather than to enhancements in management's ability to manage earnings. Beyond accumulating financial reporting information, the authors note that such systems provide management with information to make day-to-day operational decisions. Moreover, the paper provides a basis for considering management forecast qualities as a measurable proxy for improvements in the firm's internal information environment that result from information technology investments.", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12002", "e:abstract": "This study examines whether mandatory adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) leads to capital market benefits through enhanced financial statement comparability. U.K. domestic standards are considered very similar to IFRS, suggesting any capital market benefits observed for U.K.-domiciled firms are more likely attributable to improvements in comparability (i.e., better precision of across-firm information) than to changes in information quality specific to the firm (i.e., core information quality). If IFRS adoption improves financial statement comparability, we predict this should reduce insiders' ability to benefit from private information. Consistent with these expectations, we find that abnormal returns to insider purchases ― used to proxy for private information ― are reduced following IFRS adoption. Similar results obtain across numerous subsamples and proxies used to isolate IFRS effects attributable to comparability. Together, the findings are consistent with mandatory IFRS adoption improving comparability and thus leading to capital market benefits by reducing insiders' ability to exploit private information.", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12003", "e:abstract": "This paper examines the effect of voluntary financial reporting on firms' reporting quality using a reporting regime change in Taiwan. Before 2001, Taiwan's Company Act imposed a mandatory public reporting requirement of filing audited financial statements on private firms with contributed capital exceeding a certain threshold. This requirement was rescinded in 2001 and private firms since have had discretion over public financial reporting. We divide private firms retroactively into two groups: voluntary reporting firms, those continuing the practice of filing financial statements after the regime change; and nonvoluntary reporting firms, those discontinuing the reporting practice after the regime change. We find that financial reporting quality is higher for voluntary reporting firms than for nonvoluntary reporting firms and that this quality difference translates into a lower cost of debt for voluntary reporting firms.

Theory and anecdotal evidence suggest that mutual monitoring may either decrease effort by facilitating collusion or increase effort by stimulating competition. In our first experiment, we find that mutual monitoring increases effort, because participants do not attempt to collude but rather behave competitively. This result leads us to expand our theory and develop hypotheses to predict that the effect of mutual monitoring depends on whether employees have the inclination to collude or compete. Specifically, we predict that mutual monitoring decreases effort when employees are inclined to collude and increases effort when employees are inclined to compete; that is, mutual monitoring will not change the basic inclination created by the workplace setting, but will “turn up the volume” on the effect that such inclination has on effort. Consistent with our predictions, our second experiment finds that mutual monitoring leads to lower effort when participants have a collusive inclination and (eventually) higher effort when they have a competitive inclination.

We extend this line of research to test if larger Big 4 offices have fewer client restatements.

The revised Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements that resulted from the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) limit nonaudit services (NAS) and mandate NAS fee disclosure. The SEC's requirements are based on the argument that auditor independence could be impaired—and hence audit quality may be reduced—when auditors become economically dependent on their clients or audit their own work. Economic bonding leads to reduced independence, which can lead to reduced audit quality. We study a sample of firms sanctioned by the SEC for fraudulent financial reporting in Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases (SEC-sanctioned fraud firms) and examine whether there is a relationship between auditor fee variables and the likelihood of being sanctioned by the SEC for fraud. We use SEC sanction as a measure of audit quality that has not previously been used in the auditor fee literature and is more precise than some of the other proxies used for flawed financial/auditor reporting. We find, in univariate tests, that fraud firms paid significantly higher (total, audit, and NAS) fees. However, in multivariate tests, when controlling for other fraud determinants and endogeneity among the fraud, NAS, and audit fee variables, we find that while  NAS fees and total fees are positively and significantly related to the likelihood of being sanctioned by the SEC for fraud, audit fees are not. These findings suggest that higher NAS fees may cause economic bonding, thereby leading to reduced audit quality. Our findings of significantly higher NAS fees and total fees in fraud firms hold after controlling for latent size effects and other rigorous testing.

To an auditor who is highly rewarded for revenue generation and growth, nonaudit services may represent a particularly strengthened economic bond with the client. Prior research shows that, in general, nonaudit service fees received in the current period do not impair audit quality. We examine a different setting. We propose that auditor independence can become impaired, and audit quality compromised, when clients that currently purchase relatively low amounts of nonaudit services, increase their purchases of nonaudit services from the auditor in the subsequent period. We test our prediction in the context of earnings management as a proxy for audit quality, measured by (a) performance-adjusted discretionary accruals and (b) classification shifting of core expenses. Our results indicate that prior to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, rewards to the auditor in the form of future additional nonaudit service fees from current-year high fee-growth-opportunity clients adversely affects audit quality. This effect is particularly strong among companies with powerful incentives to manage earnings. Our findings indicate that regulators should consider the multiperiod nature of the client–auditor relationship when contemplating policies that restrict nonaudit services, as well as the overall environment in which audit partners operate.

We find that there is continuing recognition of CEO influence in the director nomination process, the level of which varies widely by company. Also, there is considerable variability in the formalization of the director nomination process (e.g., some NCs use search firms and a matrix/grid approach to assessing director skill sets across the board, while others do not).

However, the majority of past research treats all inside directors as a homogenous group. This study considers that issue in the context of chief financial officers (CFO) serving on their own company's board. Our research is important because individuals in different executive roles bring different skills and knowledge to board interactions, highlighting the potential for differential contributions. As prior research does not specifically distinguish CFOs from other board insiders, the potential benefits of knowledge sharing due to increased communication with other board members may have been masked. Specifically, the CFO is directly responsible for the quality of the financial reporting process and can therefore be associated with specific outcome measures. Our results show that the percentage of CFOs serving on their own boards is not large, likely due to the perspective (consistent with agency theory and reflected in independence guidelines) that company insiders on boards could promote their own best interest at the expense of shareholders. Contrary to this perception, we find that companies whose CFO has a seat on the board are associated with higher financial reporting quality (i.e., a lower likelihood of reporting a material weaknesses in internal controls or having a financial restatement, and better accruals quality). Yet, we also find potential drawbacks in that CFOs with a board seat tend to have higher excess compensation and lower likelihood of termination following poor performance, signaling greater entrenchment. While our results provide information to companies considering appointing the CFO to the board, both costs and benefits are demonstrated, and thus we conclude that each board should consider this decision based on its own circumstances and composition.", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12048", "e:abstract": "The recent financial crisis has stimulated a renewed interest in understanding the determinants of stock price crash risk (i.e., left tail risk).

Prominent economists, such as Olivier Blanchard, argue that removing the perception of tail risks (in addition to realized tail risks) is crucial in restoring investor confidence and stabilizing the stock market.

In our experiment, we manipulate the likelihood of future uncontrollable events and whether bonuses are determined individually or are drawn from a shared bonus pool. Results show that managers are less willing to adjust when the likelihood of future events is high to avoid setting a precedent, thereby motivating employees to adapt to changing conditions. We also find that managers are less willing to adjust, regardless of event likelihood, when compensation interdependence is high, to avoid demotivating unaffected employees. Finally, we find that participants' general attitudes toward compensation significantly influence their adjustment decisions beyond the effects of our independent variables.

Effective monitoring has also been positively associated with accounting conservatism. Building upon these prior results, we predict an increase in accounting conservatism after hedge fund intervention. We use a large sample of hedge fund activist events and identify control firms with similar likelihoods of being targeted using the propensity score matching method to apply difference-in-difference tests. We find that when hedge fund activists have relatively large ownership and sufficient time to exert their monitoring power, target firms experience significant increases in conditional conservatism. CFO turnovers, upward/lateral auditor switches, and improvements in audit committee independence after intervention are accompanied by greater increases in conditional conservatism. Finally, we find greater increases in conditional conservatism when there is a lack of monitoring by dedicated institutional investors before the intervention.

This paper, using a unique data set from Korea, aims to determine whether a direct causal link between recommendation changes and prerelease trading exists, by comparing trading behavior of client investors with non-client investors.

We examine the causes of these problems and why they persist. To do so, we interview 24 very experienced auditors about how they audit complex accounting estimates such as fair values and impairments and what problems they experience in the process. We find that auditors overwhelmingly choose to audit the details of management's estimate rather than use other allowable approaches. The steps auditors describe and the language they use to describe those steps indicate that they follow a process of verifying individual elements of management's assertions on a piecemeal basis, resulting in overreliance on management's process, rather than engaging in a critical analysis of the overall estimate. The problems that auditors identify are consistent with this view, and include failures to notice inconsistencies among the estimate and other internal data or external conditions and overreliance on specialists to identify, evaluate, and challenge critical assumptions. We interpret these processes and problems using institutional theory and identify two root causes: standards' and firm policies' emphasis on verifying management's model, and audit firms' division of knowledge between auditors and specialists. Institutional theory proposes these conventions arise from firms extending use of procedures that are legitimate in one area (i.e., auditing accounts without significant uncertainty) to a new area (i.e., auditing complex estimates), even though they are likely less effective in the new area. These conventions are reinforced by regulators' method of inspection and by firms' reluctance to change methods without a prompt to change to a clearly better method. We argue that these institutionalized conventions thwart auditors' good-faith attempts to engage in skeptical analysis of estimates.

First, less profitable firms have greater incentives to make performance commitments that help to reduce the share compensation that controlling shareholders have to pay. Second, firms entering into such commitments engage in earnings management to meet the promised performance target when actual performance falls short, and firms facing greater default costs tend to manage earnings more aggressively. Third, depending on the performance metric stipulated in the commitment contract, firms employ varying methods to manage earnings.

When audit fees and hours are considered together, the unit audit price of ISAs is significantly lower than that of non-ISAs. This indicates that higher total audit fees associated with ISAs are likely to be attributable to greater audit hours associated with ISAs.

In the absence of the value statement, participants with piece-rate rewards for correct responses generate more correct and incorrect responses than do their counterparts with fixed pay, correcting errors as they go along to maximize compensation. Essentially, piece-rate compensation acts as an output control, incentivizing participants to maximize correct responses through a “produce-and-improve” strategy. The value statement suppresses this strategy because participants appear to perceive it as an input constraint, prompting greater initial care at the expense of lower overall productivity. As a result, the value statement eliminates the gains in correct responses that piece-rate incentivized participants otherwise realize.

Further, an organization's nonfinancial performance and the perceived fairness of donor evaluation focus interact to influence director monitoring practices.

Given that improvements in both comparability and reporting quality are primary stated objectives of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), it is important to understand their relative roles in shaping the information environment of financial statement users following IFRS adoption. Using 1,861 first-time adopters in 23 countries, I find that firms with a larger improvement in comparability have larger increases in Q, liquidity, forecast accuracy, and forecast agreement following adoption, relative to other adopters. In contrast, improvements in reporting quality around adoption appear to have only a second-order effect that is generally limited to Q effects among those adopters with concurrent improvements in comparability. These results are robust to alternative design and variable specifications. Finally, I continue to find these results for samples restricted to countries with weaker pre-adoption institutional environments and countries that did not initiate proactive financial statement reviews, indicating that strong institutions and regulatory improvements are not driving the results.

In an experiment, when informal controls to encourage cooperation were absent (less collaborative environment), managers’ selling price estimates were more conciliatory when the opponent was described as displaying negative emotions than when described as displaying positive emotions.

A growing body of research demonstrates that light regulation fails to achieve the SEC's goals, because investors find information processing costly and fail to protect themselves.

Focusing on the activities of three institutional bodies in the early twentieth century, the paper documents how their repeated recourse to “publicity,” which relied crucially on accounting technologies, failed to turn the corporation into an entity more sensitive to the public interest. Specifically, two interrelated contributions are made to existing literature on accounting and corporate governance. Firstly, the paper documents the early historical development of the now taken-for-granted phenomenon of accounting and adjudicating at the entity level (Miller and Power 2013). Secondly, the paper offers a rejoinder to present-day projects of corporate governance which identify better and enhanced accountability as key to the successful reform of the corporation. During the progressive era, accounting expanded and territorialized new spaces, bringing trusts out of a hitherto secretive, private realm and into the view of the public.

One of the well-known explanations is a phenomenon called tax avoidance. We develop a grounded theory model of influences on corporate tax planning through a series of 19 in-depth German tax expert interviews. Our research identifies three independent hurdles in the tax planning process, which can help to explain different levels of tax expense across companies. Those three hurdles sequentially address which tax planning methods are available (defined by business characteristics), desirable (given via aims of tax planning), and implementable (determined by tax manager power). A large part of previous research has estimated the influence of firm characteristics, which we incorporate in the broader term business characteristics, on tax expense, while the other influences that we identify have largely been left “out of the equation.” In the light of the current public debates on tax avoidance, we reveal two important findings: First, we find that companies vary widely in the aggressiveness of their aims of tax planning, which contrasts sharply with the picture often drawn by undifferentiated media reports. Second, tax managers can assume very different levels of power in their organization. The implementation of desirable tax planning methods varies depending on this level of tax manager power.

Previous research has shown that analysts' forecasts of quarterly earnings per share (EPS) are more accurate than those of accepted time-series models. In addition, some previous research suggests that, on average, analysts' forecasts tend to be optimistic (i.e., biased). Two explanations for analysts' superiority have been proposed: (1) analysts use more recent information than can time-series models and (2) analysts use forecast-relevant information not included in the time-series of past earnings. This paper provides evidence on a third potential source of analyst superiority: the possibility that humans can use past earnings data to predict future earnings more accurately than can mechanical time-series models. We find that human judges do no worse than accepted time-series models when both use the same information set: namely, the series of past EPS figures. To date, little or no research has attempted to determine why analyst bias might exist. Still, some possible reasons have been forwarded. First, pessimistic forecasts or reports may hinder future efforts of the analyst or the analyst's employer to obtain information from the company being analyzed. Second, forecast data bases may suffer a selection bias if analysts tend to stop following those firms that they perceive as performing poorly. This study proposes, and provides evidence regarding, a third possible explanation for analyst bias: the use of judgmental heuristics by analysts.

Therefore, when analyzing contemporaneous returns, particularly with samples exhibiting a large industry concentration, a nongeneralized t-test should be preferred to a generalized least squares t-test because of the dependencies that may exist. Because the generalized least squares t-tests are highly sensitive to errors in specifying an appropriate abnormal return model, a portfolio time-series ordinary least squares regression should be preferred to a generalized least squares regression even when the variance or covariance matrix of abnormal returns can be estimated with a high degree of reliability. In testing for the mean effects, the concern for event period variance increases seems to be unwarranted, and the variance estimators using event period data are inefficient and biased.

Recent attention on labor productivity has resulted in many manufacturing concerns negotiating incentive contracts with the labor force. Such incentive contracts provide for management and the work force to share monetary benefits generated by productivity gains. These gain-sharing contracts require a benchmark level of labor productivity from which to assess productivity gains. This paper examines gain-sharing contracts in an agency setting, deriving conditions under which contracts using a performance evaluation measure of a ratio of total labor hours to standard direct labor hours might be optimal. These optimality conditions are characterized in terms of the fixed and variable cost components of the total labor requirement and the standard direct labor requirements. An observed gain-sharing contract based on such a measure is then evaluated using actual production data. The generalized method of moments is employed to estimate the key production parameters, indicating that the optimality conditions are violated. The characterization of optimal gain-sharing contracts thus clarifies the manner in which productivity must be measured if these programs are to provide the proper incentives to the work force.", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1990.tb00789.x", "e:abstract": "Abstract.  “What economic problems do existing accounting institutions solve?” Experimental economics helps to answer this question.

The nature of optimal equilibrium contracts for auditors hired by firms to certify the validity of firms' financial reports is studied in this paper. Financial reports may affect the interest rates at which firms can borrow funds; hence, without auditing, firms might be inclined to present favorable, if not altogether accurate, financial information. We observe that an optimal audit contract that allows auditors' contracts to be contingent on the audit report can take different forms depending on the parameter values; only in rare cases is an optimal contract independent of the audit report. Specifically, in some cases, an optimal contract is characterized by a payment for a favorable report that is larger than the payment for an unfavorable report. In other cases, the conclusion is reversed. We note, in contrast to the spirit of agency models, that an audit contract need not function in equilibrium as a motivational device inducing the auditor to work; in some cases, it serves as a means to transfer signaling costs from low-risk firms to high-risk firms. We also provide a rationale for mandating noncontingent audit contracts.

This focus is maintained by eliminating any role for learning or consumption smoothing in the contracting arrangement. Because they allow for commitment to future investment strategies contingent on current-period reports, relative to short-term contracts, long-term contracts exhibit efficiency gains. There is an endogenous demand for both budget and variance reports. By considering an N-period model, gains from long-term contracting are shown to be positively related to the principal's flexibility in committing to future investment strategies that are contingent on the agent's prior period report(s). Sequential resolution of the agent's uncertainty, either within or across periods, strictly enhances the demand for long-term contracting.

To detect a location shift in leptokurtic residuals, a nonparametric rank test may be more efficient than a parametric t-test.

The sign and Wilcoxon test statistics are calculated from the event-period residuals, so skewness and potential cross-sectional dependencies are not accounted for, causing a concern about the reliability of these tests for event studies.

The MW statistic is a nonparametric analogue of the standardized residual (the residual scaled by its estimated standard deviation) used in the parametric (Patell-type) t-test.

This first study of Canadian securities' earnings forecasts published by Institutional Brokers Estimate System (IBES) focuses on changes in the mean earnings per share forecasts of 159 to 188 companies from 1985 to 1987. Cumulative average residuals are used to detect the announcement effects of large earnings forecast revisions. The main results of this study are the following. First, an investor with access to changes of earnings per share forecasts at the beginning of the month of publication could realize abnormal excess returns. Second, trading strategies based on earnings forecasts revisions can also yield abnormal returns, but the magnitude of the revision, the sector of the company, and the month in which the revision is realized must be considered. Third, when financial analysts' forecasts are published, the informational content of large revisions in forecasts has already been discounted by the market. This result is similar to findings of U.S.– and U.K.–based studies. Finally, large forecasts revisions coincide with a period of abnormal returns. However, the information content of the announcement of forecasts changes cannot be established. The gains are larger if the trade is undertaken before the diffusion of the forecast revision to the IBES subscribers. These results do not vary with the model chosen to predict company returns. This does not necessarily indicate the existence of a market inefficiency because information acquisition and analysis costs, as well as transaction costs, may diminish considerably these abnormal trading gains.", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1991.tb00821.x", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

At present, there continues to be no precise scale for measuring the degree of credibility lent to financial statements by the auditor.

Among the objectives of report revision are better auditor-user communication and abridgment of auditor legal liability. Few empirical studies have considered the former; none that we know of have examined the latter.

This study investigates the translation of foreign financial statements in inflationary economies. The analysis is conducted by comparing the results obtained from the temporal and current rate methods to the translated adjusted-for-inflation (TAI) financial statements under varying degrees of purchasing power parity. The findings indicate that under perfect purchasing power parity, the temporal method yields undistorted results versus TAI. The current rate method, however, results in a distortion. When the purchasing power parity degree is not perfect, both the current rate and temporal methods distort the results. However, if the inflation exceeds the devaluation of the local currency, translation using the temporal method results in a lower distortion. This result is reversed when the devaluation of the local currency exceeds the rate of inflation. The study then proceeds to examine, from the viewpoint of a standard-setting body, the translation models in a cost-benefit framework. The results indicate that TAI is usually the best. This result is due to the fact that the benchmark model is more informative than the other methods, and the information production costs are close to the costs under the temporal method. Further, if the rate of inflation exceeds the devaluation of the local currency, the temporal method dominates the current rate method. The opposite holds if the devaluation of the local currency exceeds the rate of inflation. Moreover, this study examines the implications of CICA Handbook. Section 1650.

Debt contracts represent a series of rational trade-offs. Firms with higher debt face more restrictions, which are tighter and more likely to restrict managerial actions. Similarly, borrowers are more likely to agree to tighter extensive restrictions in exchange for more substantial loans. The evidence also indicates that larger firms that possess greater resources to avoid default are able to negotíate looser agreements that contain fewer restrictions. Secured loans do not impose a large number of accounting-based restrictions on managements' actions because secured lenders have less need to restrict managements' options.

The market assesses the credibility of the forecast in setting the price of the firm's stock. A partially separating equilibrium is presented. The implications of the equilibrium are consistent with empirical regularities concerning the market's reaction to management forecasts. In particular, a majority of management forecasts contain good news, forecasts containing bad news are more credible than forecasts containing good news, and stock price reactions are stronger for firms that are not followed by financial analysts.

A key characteristic of the reporting of private management information is that managers do not always report their information, and they reveal or withhold both “good” and “bad” news. Several recent papers provide models of managers' voluntary disclosure decisions. These models are typically constructed so that managers do not always disclose or withhold their information, despite rational behavior by both the privately informed managers and interested uninformed parties external to the firm. Our paper seeks to contribute further to this literature by developing a richer model of the forces that might influence a manager's decision to disclose private information. Our model is a direct extension of the model in Darrough and Stoughton (1990). In our model, there is a continuum of possible private incumbent signals and the entrant may be privately informed about the cost of entry. Partial disclosure of private information results from the tension that exists between an informed manager's desire to communicate good news to (and hide bad news from) the capital market and his desire to communicate bad news to (and hide good news from) competitors in the firm's product market.", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1992.tb00870.x", "e:abstract": "", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1992.tb00871.x", "e:abstract": "Abstract.  Economic models of tax reporting were tested experimentally. Subjects were given endowments and made tax reporting decisions subject to monetary penalties for underpayment of taxes and uncertainty about the amount of taxable income and the tax agency's cutoff point for audit selection. Two types of tax audit regimes were considered. In the first (nonstrategic audit regime), subjects faced a fixed probability of audit selection. A second (strategic) audit regime also was examined in which the probability of audit selection varied in response to tax reports as in the Reinganum and Wilde (1988), Beck and Jung (1989b), and Jung (1991a) models. Five hypotheses based on the comparative statics predictions of the models were tested and four were supported by the experimental data. Among the noteworthy findings are that tax rate changes have significant effects on reporting decisions under both audit regimes, rather than just under the strategic audit regime as hypothesized. A reduction (increase) in taxable income uncertainty induces subjects to report a low level of income significantly more (less) often under strategic auditing, but does not have a significant effect on income reports when audit policies are nonstrategic. The effects of changes in the level of uncertainty about the audit cutoff point are also investigated and found to depend upon the benefit of conducting an audit. Finally, we find that subjects generally report a low income more frequently than predicted by either the strategic or nonstrategic models.", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1992.tb00872.x", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

One theoretical approach recently emphasized in the accounting literature is positive accounting theory. Synonymous with this theoretical view are the 1978 and 1979 articles published by Ross Watts and Jerold Zimmerman. These two articles prompted criticism from three different perspectives. There are critiques that refer to technical research methods problems, critiques concerned with philosophy of science issues, and critiques centered on the limitations of economics-based accounting research. In their 1990 article, Watts and Zimmerman responded to most of the published critiques. They specifically claimed that methodological criticisms have failed to have any influence on accounting research. This paper provides a critical examination and assessment of these alleged failures by examining two types of critiques, economics-based critiques and those based on issues of the philosophy of science. The critiques discussed include those to which Watts and Zimmerman responded as well as several other critiques that either Watts and Zimmerman failed to discuss or that were not published until after their 1990 article appeared. Positive accounting theory is shown to be applied economic positivism. Tracing the historical background of positive accounting research through its economic roots shows that the “positive” aspect of the Watts and Zimmerman approach is more rhetoric than methodology. It is argued that positive accounting theory does represent a problem shift toward a domain of research that is appropriate for Chicago School economics. A review of the published critiques of positive accounting theory shows that although critiques based on philosophy of science may not be very effective, economics-based critiques that emphasize the limitations of equilibrium-based economic analysis offer a promising avenue for methodological critiques of positive accounting theory.", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1992.tb00875.x", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

Results also show that although an unattainable time budget affects behavior, peer pressure has the most significant impact on underreporting. The present study makes three important contributions to the auditing and psychology literature. First, it establishes the significance of peer pressure as an antecedent to underreporting.

The role of accounting information in investment decision making and capital markets has been investigated by exploring fundamental connections between accounting numbers and market-based phenomena of interest. Studies of bond rating predictions have described how bond raters make their judgments as a function of accounting and other data. This study expands our knowledge of these fundamental connections by investigating whether bond ratings have a direct impact on bond yields and how accounting information impacts the bond yields—directly, or indirectly through the bond ratings. A simultaneous equation system is constructed using firm-specific financial information, bond ratings by two major rating agencies, and initial offering yields. The sample used in this study consists of 189 new issue industrial bonds rated by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's that were issued from 1981 through 1985. Tests of alternative structural model configurations provide evidence regarding the interrelations between bond ratings, financial information, and bond yields. The improvements in the statistical methodology lead to a better understanding and assessment of the relative roles of bond ratings and financial information in setting bond prices. The use of simultaneous equation modeling allows the interrelations among yields, ratings, and financial information to be assessed and allows the direct and indirect effect of financial information on yields to be estimated. This results in the ability to conclude that financial information affects bond ratings, that bond ratings directly affect bond yields, that financial information also directly affects bond yields, and that financial information indirectly affects bond yields through its effect on ratings.

Much work has been directed to develop aggregate efficiency measures for firms or decision-making units (DMUs) in which we are able to observe only the outputs and inputs. Assuming that each DMU has the same type of observed outputs and inputs and using only this information, Farrell's technical efficiency and the CCR ratio can be used to assign an aggregate measure of efficiency to each DMU, which can then be used to compare the efficiency of the DMUs. This paper considers a subset of the general aggregate efficiency problem called the matched output/input case in which each output is matched to exactly one input, forming a subunit. Dividing the output by the input for each subunit within a DMU yields a subunit ratio that is the output per unit input. For a particular subunit, the subunit ratios for two DMUs can be compared directly. If all the subunit ratios of one DMU exceed the corresponding subunit ratios in another DMU, then we should reasonably expect that any aggregate efficiency measure has the efficiency of the first DMU greater than the efficiency of the other DMU. This requirement is defined as the Matched Output/Input Axiom, which is then shown to be violated for certain data sets satisfying Simpson's Paradox.

This paper extends the growing literature on factors affecting cross-sectional and intertemporal variation in earnings response coefficients. It tests the empirical implications of recent theoretical work by Choi and Salamon (1989) and Holthausen and Verrecchia (1988), who model the degree of price adjustment associated with earnings announcements as a function of the amount of noise or garbling in the accounting earnings signal relative to valuation-relevant cash flows or dividends. The particular earnings measurements considered relate to U.S. multinational companies and to the differences in income determination under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 8 and SFAS No. 52. The study finds a modestly smaller relative price adjustment for a given amount of unexpected earnings for multinational firms than for nonmultinationals during the SFAS No. 8 period. This finding is consistent with multinationals producing “noisier” earnings signals during this time period. However, several indirect measures suggest that there was greater prior probability uncertainty associated with the future cash flows or dividends of the nonmultinational sample. Accordingly, this cannot be ruled out as a competing explanation for the observed differences in the market's response to earnings signals during the SFAS No. 8 period. Following the implementation of SFAS No. 52, the earnings response coefficient increased substantively for firms whose accounting for translation gains or losses was most affected by this standard. These results suggest that the earnings measurements produced under SFAS No. 52 were perceived by market participants to be of higher quality (less noisy) than those produced under SFAS No. 8.

Account balances are typically subjected to separate audit procedures (e.g., accounts receivable and inventory). Two or more assertions about a single financial balance may be subjected to separate tests (e. g., completeness and existence). Two or more transaction streams combining to form a single balance (e. g., sales on account and cash receipts on account combine into accounts receivable) may be tested separately. A financial balance may be subdivided into two or more account components for separate testing (e.g., retail accounts receivable and wholesale accounts receivable). In all of these audit testing scenarios, the question arises as to the appropriate way to combine or aggregate the evidence gathered from separate tests of subpopulations into an overall conclusion about the amount of audit risk being borne, that is, the risk of a material amount of misstatement remaining undetected in the overall population at the conclusion of such separate audit tests. A number of algorithms and heuristics have been proposed for combining audit risks at the subpopulation level into overall risk conclusions about audit risk at a more aggregate level. Some of the heuristics involve piecemeal evaluation of individual subpopulations to draw overall conclusions about the financial statements as a whole. This paper analyzes one such approach, the Poisson distribution-based “max rule,” for combining judgments of audit risk based on tests of subpopulations. This prescription has been interpreted to mean that the overall risk of material misstatement in a population is the maximum of the audit risks computed with respect to the individual subpopulations, but we believe that such an interpretation is incorrect. Furthermore, given the literature that has promoted the max rule, some auditors could misapply the concurrency property of the Poisson distribution. Although the max rule may be justified at the planning stages of the audit, we show that, if it is used at the evaluation stage of the audit, it can lead to underestimation of the upper error limit and overall risk faced upon completing tests of subpopulations and should not be used to evaluate results of audit procedures applied to subpopulations to draw overall audit conclusions.", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1993.tb00393.x", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

Few studies have examined auditors' decisions to use internal auditors as assistants. In addition, those that have investigated this issue have primarily concentrated on the three internal audit factors: objectivity, competence, and work performed. This study expands the research in this area by investigating the impact of inherent risk on auditors' decisions to use internal auditors as assistants. Specifically, the study examines the effect of inherent risk on (1) the extent to which auditors consider factors related to the internal audit function in making decisions to use internal auditors as assistants and (2) the complexity of auditors' decision processes in making such judgments. The results indicate that inherent risk impacts the extent to which internal audit objectivity and work performed affect auditors' decisions to use internal auditors as assistants. In high inherent risk conditions, the results suggest that auditors use a complex configural decision process to evaluate the objectivity and work performed of the internal auditors. Specifically, in the high inherent risk condition, the effect of the work performed by the internal auditors on auditors' decisions to use internal auditors as assistants is contingent upon the level of internal audit objectivity.

Adequate disclosure of risks and uncertainties is an issue of interest to the accounting profession and regulators both in Canada and in the United States. Previously, auditors were required to modify their audit reports in the presence of material uncertainties. However, following suggestions that such disclosure is redundant and not useful, the CICA removed this requirement in 1980. Auditors in the United States are still required to disclose material uncertainties in the audit report. The criterion of predictive ability is used in this research to evaluate the potential usefulness of this report modification requirement. Specifically, the study examines the ability of report modifications to predict the materially adverse resolutions of pending litigation. The subsequent resolution patterns for a sample of litigation loss contingencies (with an audit report modification) and a control sample of litigation loss contingencies (without an audit report modification) were compared. The results indicate that a larger proportion of contingencies with an audit report modification were resolved materially against the client. Also noteworthy, audit report modifications had incremental predictive ability over other types of disclosures such as footnotes to the financial statements and prior media disclosure of the contingency.", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1993.tb00901.x", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

This paper examines a two-consumption date principal/agent model in which the manager receives private information at the first date. After observing his private information, the manager (agent) selects both the capital and personal effort he will invest in production. Operating cash flows are realized at both dates and any uninvested funds at the initial date are either paid out as a dividend to the equityholders (principal) or invested in zero net present value investments that require no effort. The aggregate cash flow at the second date is paid out as a dividend to the equityholders. The compensation contract specifies the manager's compensation as a function of the information available at the two dates. The key issue is whether it is valuable to have the contract based on the agent's communication of his private information. As in a single-consumption date model, communication may permit the implementation of more efficient incentives with respect to the manager's action choices. In addition, communication can facilitate the smoothing of the manager's consumption over the two dates. Direct communication can have positive value, but the analysis identifies a number of factors that can result in communication having no value. These factors include no direct preference for effort, public reporting of the private information at the second date, access to personal investments, and access to a dividend policy that will costlessly convey the private information through first-date dividends. Although access to personal investments may make communication redundant (since it is an alternative means of smoothing consumption), the analysis identifies conditions under which the equityholders would prefer to use communication and restrict the manager's access to personal investments (since it can have a negative effect on incentives).", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1993.tb00906.x", "e:abstract": "", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1994.tb00397.x", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

The occurrence of conglomerate mergers is somewhat of a mystery. This paper presents a model demonstrating a tax motive for these mergers. Specifically, conglomerate mergers are unions between firms with not highly correlated earning prospects—when one merger partner underperforms (earning inadequate income) in the future, the other is likely to overperform. By amalgamating such firms into common taxable entities, conglomerate mergers create several tax benefits: (1) improved chances that future tax write-offs and credits will be immediately utilized in full rather than deferred as less valuable loss-carryforwards; (2) reduced chances that tax write-offs and credits are permanently lost in bankruptcy; and (3) an enhanced ability to write off the interest on additional debt Empirical support for these results are presented. Given (1) and (2), the U.S. tax law changes in 1981 and 1986 would respectively encourage and discourage merger activity, outcomes that were indeed observed. Consistent with (3), a cross-sectional examination of U.S. mergers shows that mergers were more likely to increase consolidated leverage when earnings of the predecessor firms were less highly correlated.

Consumption taxes of various forms are of increasing importance worldwide. This study employs a laboratory market design to investigate differential market reactions to three consumption tax forms while holding all other factors constant. Ten laboratory markets were conducted, each involving nine volunteer participants.

The three tax forms were (1) a sales tax imposed on retail consumers of a commodity, (2) a gross-receipts tax imposed on retail sellers, and (3) a value-added tax imposed on sellers at two levels of production. At least three markets were conducted under each tax regime as a basis for experimental comparison. The tax rates used in each structure were chosen so that a competitive model would predict different equilibrium prices but the same tax burdens (the sum of explicit and implicit taxes) across the three tax regimes. Results generally support these predictions, with somewhat stronger support for equivalent tax revenues (explicit taxes collected) than for equivalent tax incidence (distribution of tax burdens after price adjustments). Observed tax incidence differences suggest that market agents who are called upon to explicitly pay taxes actually bear relatively lower tax burdens after implicit tax price adjustments.

The credibility of individual commercial borrowers, which lenders refer to as “character,” affects lenders' use of accounting information. This effect of source credibility is subtle compared to the effect of external audits on the use of financial statements in other contexts.

Character facts will not affect judgments or loan decisions significantly when accounting facts are negative (supporting loan denial). This accounting/character interaction is predicted to become stronger as lenders gain experience and develop criteria for evaluating character. In an experiment, lenders read a loan application that contained facts concerning accounting, character, and other information; the accounting and character facts were manipulated to be either positive or negative, resulting in four versions of the application. The lenders recommended approval or denial of the loan and estimated the likelihood that the loan would be fully repaid (a risk estimate).

Recent studies have begun to apply contemporary capital markets methods to historical, archival accounting data. This paper discusses period-specific issues relevant to such research. The general categories of issues considered are agency relationships and the capital market environment, trading practices, regulation, and corporate information disclosure.

First, the population characteristics of security holders were different, and a “money trust” comprised of investment bankers often controlled large corporations. This implies that careful thought needs to be given to assumptions about the role of publicly available information and “retail” investors in securities trading. Second, trading practices were quite different: stock price manipulation was tolerated, as were “wash” and “matching” securities transactions. These conditions, coupled with corporate disclosure of dubious quality and widespread colored financial press reporting, create difficulties in interpreting security price and trading activity. Third, while financial reporting regulation was minimal during the early 1900s, it is unclear whether government threats of regulation may have been regarded as sufficiently plausible by companies so as to motivate “voluntary” behavior.

In addition, negative result studies are capable of making a valuable contribution to science and their systematic omission impedes the advance of the discipline.

The study is motivated by the concern that high levels of concentration may be detrimental, resulting in lower levels of competition, which could harm clients through higher fees and lower levels of service. However, a counterargument is that high levels of concentration may not be detrimental but may result because market leaders display exceptional performance, providing lower-priced audits (perhaps due to economies of scale) and/or enhanced service to clients. We obtained audit fee and financial data on 140 life and health insurance companies and 101 property and casualty insurance companies. Our findings indicate that concentration is negatively associated with fees, suggesting that higher levels of concentration are related to higher levels of price competition (i.e., lower fees). Additionally, we address the validity of concentration as a surrogate for competition by examining competition among the market leaders. Our analysis examines the fees paid by 47 insurance companies that switched auditors during the sample period. We investigate the effect of industry specialization on fees paid by clients that switch auditors, finding evidence of significant fee cutting among market leaders for each others' clients but no evidence of fee reductions for clients switching from nonleaders to market leaders.

Auditors, regulators, and academics are interested in the pricing practice of “lowballing” and its relationship to auditor independence. Several analytical models have examined these issues. However, these theories have gone untested primarily due to a lack of field data concerning important environmental variables. In this study, a multiperiod model of lowballing and independence is developed and tested in laboratory markets via the experimental economics methodology. The study contributes to the literature in two respects. First, it represents one of the first studies providing empirical evidence and theory testing of the relationship between lowballing and independence. Second, the model presents a new rationale for low-ball pricing and its relationship to auditor independence. Lowballing and impairment of independence, occurring without exogenous transaction costs, are caused by positing cross-sectional variation in audit cost and quality and an informational advantage that accrues to an incumbent auditor-client pair regarding future variation in these audit dimensions. The model is operationalized in a multiperiod laboratory market consisting of multiple sellers and buyers. Sixteen markets are conducted to test price and reporting predictions of the model.

As to familiarity, 5 journals were nearly universally known, and a total of 15 had wide recognition. Financial, managerial, and auditing faculty exhibited similar familiarity patterns, while tax faculty had a somewhat different pattern. As to quality perceptions, relatively few journals achieved high quality evaluations. There was, however, general consensus across the different subject-area faculty as to the top journals.

This article reports the results of an investigation into the informativeness of financial communications with shareholders when the level of market uncertainty regarding future firm performance varies. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the informativeness of annual reports is positively associated with the level of market uncertainty. The informativeness of annual reports is measured by the extent of price reaction, regardless of direction, at the time of disclosure. To obtain a sample of firms with temporal variation in the level of market uncertainty, the article investigates firms nearing financial distress. Financial distress is represented by the firm's receipt of a going-concern audit report from the external auditor. Time periods immediately preceding receipt of the going-concern report are presumed to exhibit changing market uncertainty regarding future firm prospects. The empirical evidence is consistent with the article's hypothesis in that price reactions to annual reports systematically vary the nearer the firms are to financial distress. Specifically, price reactions to annual reports for the three years preceding distress are more than 35 percent larger than the price reactions to reports from earlier periods. This evidence is consistent with the informativeness of financial disclosures being dependent on the level of market uncertainty and advances our understanding of the usefulness of accounting disclosures to market participants.

Generally accepted auditing standards, auditing textbooks, and firm audit manuals indicate that, other things equal, the presence of significant monetary incentives based on financial results increases the inherent risk of material misstatement, and higher inherent risk should ordinarily cause the auditor to exercise a heightened degree of professional skepticism in conducting the audit. This article addresses the following basic research question: Are auditors sensitive to management's incentives to manage earnings? Research that examines whether auditors distinguish between explanations provided by managers with different incentives is important because audit standards indicate that inquiry of management can assist the auditor in evaluating significant unexpected differences. Two experiments were conducted. The first experiment explored whether management-buyout-induced incentives to make income-decreasing accruals affect auditors' judgments of the probability that a material misstatement exists. As predicted, auditors were sensitive to these incentives. The second experiment explored whether bonus-induced incentives affect auditors' judgments of the probability that a material misstatement exists. The auditors agreed that bonus plans such as the one in the experiment create incentives for management to make income-increasing or income-decreasing accruals depending on the terms of the plan. However, the auditors' judgments were unaffected by whether the unexpected difference and management's incentives were congruent. The auditors opted for potential audit effectiveness rather than potential audit efficiency by assuming that—on balance—management had incentives congruent with the unexpected overstatement.", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1994.tb00450.x", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

We find that for “good news firms, the probability of forecasting is increasing in the financing requirements but decreasing in the threat of competitor entry. The converse holds for “bad news” firms. These results lend further empirical support to the observation that the familiar good news hypothesis tested in the management earnings forecast literature offers only a partial explanation for the decision to forecast.

The data also provide support for the OSC's concern about a voluntary disclosure bias. Only 17.5 percent of our sample forecasts represent revisions downward relative to the previous year's results.

Les auteurs font appel aux théories proposées par Darrough et Stoughton (1990) afin de mieux comprendre pourquoi certaines entreprises incorporent volontairement des prévisions directionnelles à leurs rapports annuels alors que d'autres s'en abstiennent. Les données qu'ils recueillent sont conformes à leurs prédictions selon lesquelles la politique d'information d'une entreprise reflète ses préoccupations à l'égard de la cote d'évaluation que lui attribue le marché des capitaux et à l'égard de la concurrence à laquelle elle doit faire face sur le marché des produits. Les auteurs constatent que pour les entreprises dont l'information est favorable, la probabilité de produire de l'information prévisionnelle croît lorsque l'entreprise a besoin de capitaux, mais décroît lorsqu'un nouveau concurrent menace d'entrer sur le marché. L'inverse est vrai pour les entreprises dont l'information est défavorable. Ces résultats viennent étayer plus solidement, sur le plan empirique, l'observation selon laquelle l'hypothèse familière de l'information favorable vérifiée dans les travaux portant sur la prévision des résultats par la direction n'offre qu'une explication partielle à la décision de produire de l'information prévisionnelle.

This study provides further evidence about whether accounting choice decisions reflect a consistent strategy to manage income by investigating the relation between methods used in financial reports and lobbying positions on accounting for income taxes. A numerical income-strategy score is calculated for each lobbyist based on whether the firm chose an income-increasing or income-decreasing alternative for the following: depreciation, inventory, investment tax credit, and pension amortization. We find that firms lobbying for no tax allocation, the most income-increasing alternative, have higher average income strategies (more income increasing) than firms lobbying for comprehensive allocation, the most income-decreasing alternative. Combining the firms favoring either no allocation or partial allocation (due to the conceptual similarity of these alternatives), we find that their average income strategy score is also higher than firms favoring comprehensive allocation. Further, firms favoring discounting deferred taxes, which would ordinarily increase net income by reducing the deferred portion of income tax expense, employ more income-increasing strategies than firms opposed to discounting. In contrast, the hypothesized relationship was not found between income strategy and when the benefits anticipated from the use of a net operating loss carryforward should be recognized. Nevertheless, the combined lobbying positions differ significantly between both the upper and lower third and upper and middle third of the firms classified by their income strategy scores.

This article addresses two important questions about auditing and audit research: How do auditors learn from experience? How can auditor behavior be studied in context? To answer the first question, I investigated whether established learning theory applies in one audit setting despite suggestions that the audit does not provide an environment conductive to learning. In investigating whether learning occurred, I explored the issues of auditor efficiency and effectiveness. To study auditor learning over an extended period in a real task and incentive setting, I employed archival data from a Big Six firm. The benefits of exploring the effects of “real-life” auditor behavior without interference by the researcher come at a cost. Using archival data poses several methodological questions that do not usually have to be addressed by behavioral accounting researchers. Thus, the tradeoffs involved in the archival approach to studying auditor behavior are explored. In addition, this article provides descriptive information about an audit setting not studied to date: the central research unit. This setting involves having auditors examine financial accounting problems, an activity not well understood by audit researchers. I show, consistent with learning theory and despite the problematic nature of the audit environment for learning, that the auditors display definite improvements in efficiency and effectiveness.

Previous work on hypothesis generation demonstrates that auditors tend to generate frequently occurring financial statement errors as their initial hypotheses to explain unexpected fluctuations. However, such work does not examine how the initially generated hypothesis affects subsequent performance at identifying an actual error. We hypothesized that the initially generated hypothesis would interfere with an auditor's ability to subsequently switch to a different hypothesis. Thus, if the initial hypothesis were incorrect, auditors would find it difficult to switch hypotheses in order to identify an actual error. Moreover, initially generating a frequent error would exacerbate this difficulty. Auditor-subjects were asked to generate an initial error hypothesis after seeing a pattern of fluctuations in which sales and accounts receivable were overstated. After they generated their initial hypothesis, half of the subjects were provided with additional information that was consistent with a very frequent error (sales cutoff) and the other half were provided with information consistent with an infrequent error (sales recorded twice). As expected, we found that initially generating the very frequent error (i.e., sales cutoff) versus some other less frequent error affected auditors' subsequent performance at identifying actual errors. Specifically, auditors who generated the very frequent error as their initial hypothesis performed best when it was the actual error, but performed worst when the infrequent error was the actual error. In contrast, auditors who generated a less frequent error as their initial hypothesis performed moderately well (i.e., between best and worst) both when the actual error was frequent and when it was infrequent.

This study investigates the relation between disclosure policy and liquidity in equity markets. Disclosure policy influences market liquidity because uninformed investors “price protect” against adverse selection, and this price protection is manifested in market liquidity. Bid-ask spreads, the empirical measure of market liquidity used in this study, are predicted to be inversely related to disclosure policy. In addition, increased trading by informed traders and higher probability of information event occurrence are predicted to both increase spreads and intensify the relation between spreads and disclosure policy. These predictions apply during periods in which no news about the firm is disclosed or pending. The results show that relative bid-ask spreads for firms with disclosure rankings in the bottom third of the empirical distribution are approximately 50 percent higher than spreads for firms with disclosure rankings in the top third of the empirical distribution. Tests that assume endogenous disclosure policy reveal a significant negative relation between disclosure policy and spreads, even after controlling for the effects of return volatility, trading volume, and share price. Tests for cross-sectional variation in spreads and for the sensitivity of spreads to disclosure policy based on informed trade activity and probability of information event occurrence are generally consistent with the predictions, though these results are not statistically significant.

Piaget argued that young children can solve only the most straightforward types of problems and are not capable of solving complex problems simply because their minds have not developed sufficiently. With maturation, more complex types of problems can be solved. To measure the formal reasoning level of intermediate accounting students, we used an instrument developed by Piaget. Then, we related this level to the marks they received on examinations in several accounting courses.

We also find that firms manipulating earnings are: (i) more likely to have boards of directors dominated by management; (ii) more likely to have a Chief Executive Officer who simultaneously serves as Chairman of the Board; (iii) more likely to have a Chief Executive Officer who is also the firm's founder, (iv) less likely to have an audit committee; and (v) less likely to have an outside blockholder.

This study extends the Beck, Davis, and Jung (1992) experimental study by incorporating opportunities for taxpayer subjects to purchase advice before making their tax reporting decisions. Tax advice has two roles in the model and experiment. First, tax advice allows taxpayers to reduce their uncertainty about the amount of taxes owed. This permits us to study the demand for tax advice in conjunction with its effect on tax reporting decisions. Second, the decision to purchase tax advice from an expert provides a means of signaling that may alter tax agency audit policies. The resulting audit policies, in turn, can affect taxpayers' decisions to purchase tax advice. These interdependencies are incorporated in a game-theoretic model and several predictions are tested experimentally. Consistent with theory, subjects sorted themselves into three groups based upon their private information. Another prediction supported by the experiment is that the demand for tax advice increased with the magnitude of an uncertain tax deduction (amount-at-risk). We also found, as expected, that the effects of tax advice on pre-audit tax revenues depend upon the amount-at-risk. When the amount-at-risk was high, subjects in settings with tax advice reported lower average incomes and paid lower taxes than did those subjects in settings without the opportunity to purchase tax advice. The opposite was true for the low amount-at-risk condition, supporting our prediction that tax advice and amount-at-risk would have an interactive effect on tax reporting. Analysis was also performed on post-audit tax collections. Contrary to theory, post-audit tax payments were found to increase when subjects had an opportunity to purchase tax advice. This result apparently was caused by a tendency to over-purchase tax advice and, in some cases, to report a low income regardless of the advice received.", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1996.tb00492.x", "e:abstract": "", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1996.tb00493.x", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

We examine variations in the relation between a hospital's level of service capability and the operating costs of its departments and activities (e.g., surgery, laboratory, laundry). We propose a model of the hospital as a set of concentric, interrelated services organized around a core mission to provide patient care. We hypothesize that increases in service capability (i.e., complexity of operations) will increase overall operating costs. At the departmental level, we expect variations in service capability to have a greater cost impact in departments that are closer to the patient. We examine these issues using 1986 data from 154 acute-care hospitals. We disaggregate total operating costs into 18 pools that together account for 84 percent of all operating costs. We find that models with aggregate drivers explain about 90 percent of the variance in overall hospital costs. Complexity is found to be a significant determinant of overall operating costs. At the departmental level, models with department-specific drivers dominate models that employ aggregate drivers. We find that approximately 45 percent of hospital operating costs are significantly associated with the complexity of care provided. There is only limited support for the claim that the effect of the complexity of care provided on operating costs increases as the extent of a department's direct contact with the patient increases. Hence, although our results suggest that the complexity of care should be accounted for in any cost allocation and reimbursement scheme, they also suggest that finding the “right” level of adjustment is a difficult task because complexity differentially affects costs in the various departments.", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1996.tb00498.x", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

It is well known that monitoring information can be used to reduce moral hazard problems. This paper analyzes a model in which the agent can affect the precision (or quality) of the information observed by the principal. In particular, the agent is assumed to be capable of supplying two types of effort: productive effort and effort that reduces the outcome variance. Variance reduction improves the principal's ability to use the outcome to infer the agent's productive effort. However, if the agent's variance-reducing actions are unobservable, a moral hazard problem related to those actions arises. The principal then faces a trade-off between obtaining monitoring benefits from variance reduction and the costs of motivating the agent to choose the desired level of outcome variance. Moreover, the incentives that the principal sets up to motivate the agent to reduce the variance also affect the agent's incentives to increase the outcome. The paper establishes conditions under which the principal motivates the agent to expend nonzero effort in reducing the variance. The incentives for variance reduction depend on the agent's degree of risk aversion and on the feasibility of nonmonotonic contracts.

Under conditions of economic instability, they are more inclined to acquire processed information, and processed and unprocessed information combined.

Individuals appear to recognize the optimism contained in biased forecasts and attempt to adjust for such biases. Our results also suggest that individuals can more effectively use processed information than unprocessed information, regardless of the degree of forecast bias.

Using regressions of analysts' earnings forecast revisions on unexpected earnings, unexpected dividends, and five variables that reflect whether the signs of unexpected earnings and dividends confirm or contradict each other, we find evidence of both corroboration and substitution. Analysts' earnings forecast revisions are significantly related to the five corroborative variables, and this relation has statistically significant explanatory power beyond that in the magnitudes of unexpected earnings and unexpected dividends. Consistent with expectations, we find that the evidence of corroboration varies across the noisiness of earnings information; there is more evidence of corroboration when earnings are more variable. We also find evidence consistent with analysts substituting away from earnings, toward dividend information for firms with noisy earnings information (high variance).

In response to increased concerns about audit efficiency and effectiveness, analytical procedures are increasingly being used in place of and as a supplement to substantive tests of details. Despite their increased use, little is known about how analytical procedures are performed in practice. The purpose of this study is to describe how auditors perform analytical procedures at the planning, substantive testing, and overall review stages of the audit.

One reason for the paucity of research is the lack of publicly available data with which to empirically examine relationships and test theories. However, recent legislation in the United Kingdom requires publication of nonaudit fees paid to a company's auditor, and this disclosure provides the data with which to investigate the joint provision of consultancy and audit services. A model is developed that seeks to explain a company's decision to hire nonaudit services from the auditor. The model argues that companies that face potentially high agency costs purchase relatively smaller amounts of nonaudit services from their auditor. High agency-cost companies require independent audits in order to reassure investors and creditors; the provision of joint services, which increases the economic bonding of the auditor to the client, may jeopardize independence or the appearance of independence.

The accounting method in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 8 for restatement of a foreign operation's financial statements denominated in a foreign currency into the parent's currency equivalents for inclusion in the parent company's financial statements was severely criticized by market participants and managers. Its replacement, SFAS No. 52, represented an attempt to improve on the methods of SFAS No. 8. This study examines two questions: did SFAS No. 8 produce relevant information for valuing US multinational firms, and are the results reported under SFAS No. 52 more valuation relevant than those reported under SFAS No. 8? Valuation relevance is studied because the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has stated that relevance is an important criterion for choosing among alternative accounting methods. Considered collectively, the results suggest that the rules in SFAS No. 8 produced a poor accounting measure for valuing US multinational firms, and that the introduction of SFAS No. 52 has resulted in a significant improvement in the valuation relevance of the accounting numbers associated with the restatement of a foreign operation's financial statements. However, this improvement applies only to the subset of firms that designated a foreign currency as their functional currency (i.e., switched to the current-rate method) and not to firms that designated the dollar as their functional currency (i.e., as if they still reported under SFAS No. 8).", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1997.tb00545.x", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

The research is important because it highlights the need to include auditors from several firms in research designs, provides evidence of differences in moral development among public accounting firms, and profiles the professions' average level of moral development for three levels. The data are from 494 managers and seniors (204 females and 290 males) from five Big Six firms. Using the Defining Issues Test (Rest 1979a) to measure moral development, several results were noted. First, the results indicate a difference in the average level of moral development among firms, suggesting that use of subjects from only one firm inhibits the generalizability of findings regarding moral development. Second, female managers are at a significantly higher average level of moral development than male managers. In fact, the average scores for male managers fell between those expected for senior high school and college students. The data suggest that a greater percentage of high-moral-development males and low-moral-development females are leaving public accounting than their respective opposites. These results indicate that the profession has retained, through advancement, males who are potentially less sensitive to the ethical implications of various issues.

Regulators have recently cited concerns about the extent and quality of accounting consultation within accounting firms on difficult client accounting policy issues. In this paper we report the results of research that examines the role of accounting consultation units in public accounting firms. We describe the five largest accounting consultation units in Canada. The accounting consultation units are then examined through the lens of organizational memory theory. We find differences among the accounting consultation units in their ability to act as a source of organizational memory for their firms. These differences include the following: the amount of resources devoted to the consultation function, the structure of the units, the mandate received by the unit from the firm, and the availability and amount of documentation about previous consultations. These differences suggest that firms' accounting consultation units differ in their ability to provide technical accounting advice. This variability may affect the actual or perceived quality of such advice to both clients and external regulators.

Consistent with prior research, we treat audit quality as a dichotomous variable and assume that Big Six auditors are of higher quality than non-Big Six auditors. Earnings management is captured by discretionary accruals that are estimated using a cross-sectional version of the Jones 1991 model. Prior literature suggests that auditors are more likely to object to management's accounting choices that increase earnings (as opposed to decrease earnings) and that auditors are more likely to be sued when they are associated with financial statements that overstate earnings (as compared to understate earnings). Therefore, we hypothesize that clients of non-Big Six auditors report discretionary accruals that increase income relatively more than the discretionary accruals reported by clients of Big Six auditors. This hypothesis is supported by evidence from a sample of 10,379 Big Six and 2,179 non-Big Six firm years. Specifically, clients of non-Big Six auditors report discretionary accruals that are, on average, 1.5-2.1 percent of total assets higher than the discretionary accruals reported by clients of Big Six auditors. Also, consistent with earnings management, we find that the mean and median of the absolute value of discretionary accruals are greater for firms with non-Big Six auditors.

Consistent with our stakeholder concern prediction, disclosing firms have higher compensation levels and are more apt to have received prior shareholder proposals about executive compensation. Contrary to this prediction, we find a negative association between financial press coverage of compensation policies and the probability of disclosure. Additionally, the disclosure decision is unrelated to the defensibility of compensation policies and the firm's corporate governance profile.

The results indicate that the more liberal Dutch audit market has the highest dynamic measures of market structure and the highest concentration. Hence, the results show that high concentration can go hand in hand with high-market-share mobility and high audit-firm entry and exit.

Comstock. and Pritz 1994; Swenson 1995; Gupta and King 1997).

We extend the theoretical work of Gal-Or 1986 to incorporate an endogenous imprecise cost signal in two imperfect market structures: Cournot competition and Bertrand competition with imperfectly substitutable products. In addition, we theoretically link market structure to product market strategy. To examine product market strategy, we employ a laboratory markets design that allows for strategic reaction by a rival firm in each of these markets, because the competitive position of a firm is determined by its capacity to produce at low cost, or to differentiate its product from other products (Porter 1985). Consistent with our theoretical work, we argue that firms that compete on the basis of cost leadership (which we demonstrate may be characterized as Cournot competition), benefit through increased profits from increased product cost accuracy, whereas firms that compete on the basis of product differentiation (which we demonstrate may be characterized as Benrand competition) do not benefit from such increased product cost accuracy. Our results are consistent with this contention. That is, profit is higher in the experimental cost leadership markets (operationalized as Cournot markets) when subjects know their true cost, while profit is higher in the experimental product differentiation markets (operationalized as Bertrand markets) when subjects receive uninformative cost reports and make their decisions based on expected costs.

We focus on carryforwards because, in providing this information each period, management must use their private information about the firm's profitability prospects. Thus, accounting measurement of tax carryforwards is another way of providing a management earnings forecast. In analyzing the role of carryforwards in valuation, we distinguish between two conflicting effects. First, deferred taxes from carryforwards represent future tax savings; hence, they should be valued positively as assets. In contrast, the existence of tax carryforwards may signal a higher likelihood of future losses, which would have a negative effect on expected earnings and share prices. We find that analysts consider earnings of firms with carryforwards to be less persistent because of the increased likelihood of future losses. We also find that analysts tend to be less precise and more optimistic (biased) in forecasting earnings of firms with carryforwards. This higher optimism and lower precision are more pronounced just after firms adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SPAS) 109 and are almost entirely corrected over time. An analysis of investors' valuation indicates a strong positive relation between deferred taxes from carryforwards and share prices, suggesting that these carryforwards are valued as assets. Also, earnings and book values of equity are valued less in firms that have carryforwards than in firms without carryforwards. Finally, the valuation allowance required under SFAS 109 assists equity investors in valuing a firm's earnings and net assets.

One way that auditors can compensate for this risk exposure is to lower their threshold for issuing modified audit reports, an action that will increase modified reports and, therefore, lessen the likelihood of failing to issue a modified report when appropriate. We call this auditor reporting conservatism and test if high-accrual firms in the United States, are more likely to receive modified audit reports for asset realization uncertainties and going concern problems. Empirical results for a large sample of U.S. publicly listed companies support the hypothesis that auditors are more conservative, that is, more likely to issue both types of modified audit reports for high-accrual firms.

Because price control regulation is costly to firms, it is a type of regulatory intervention that can impact a firm's accounting decisions (Watts and Zimmerman, 1978). Thus, regulatory changes that give firms relief from price controls provide incentives for earnings management. This paper examines discretionary accruals made by New Zealand manufacturing firms in response to two sets of regulations issued in 1971 and 1972. These regulations allowed manufacturing firms to apply for price increases to gain relief from financial hardship caused by the 1970 Price Freeze Regulation. Using a modified accruals mode! that adjusts for price-level movements, the paper tests discretionary accruals of two samples of manufacturing firms and one control sample of nonmanufacturing firms. The results provide evidence of income decreasing discretionary accruals by manufacturing firms for the years during which they could apply for price increases. The control firms do not exhibit significant discretionary accruals in 1971 or 1972. Also, this paper provides evidence that failing to adjust for price-level movements in high inflationary periods could result in inferences of income decreasing discretionary accruals where none may exist.", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1999.tb00588.x", "e:abstract": "We investigate capital investment problems when a manager knows the costs of a set of available projects, while the owner only holds probabilistic beliefs about these costs.", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1999.tb00590.x", "e:abstract": "This paper examines how market prices, volume, and traders' dividend expectations respond to public information releases in laboratory markets for a long-lived financial asset. The objective is to study deviations from the symmetric information risk-neutral rational expectations (RE) benchmark, which predicts no trade in such settings. The results of a series of double-auction and call markets are reported in which traders manage a portfolio of cash and asset shares over 15 rounds of trading. A public signal regarding the value of the liquidating dividend is released every third round, and traders' subjective expectations of the liquidating dividend are elicited each round as cash-motivated forecasts. We find that, despite the public dividend signal, traders' dividend forecasts are heterogeneous. Forecasts and prices both underreact to the public signals, with prices under-reacting more than forecasts. In general, price changes are not closely associated with public signals, and there is greater excess price volatility in double auctions than in call markets. Forty-three percent of trades are inconsistent with the trader's forecasts, and inconsistent trades occur more frequently in the double-auction markets. On average, approximately 10 percent of the outstanding shares are traded in each round, and trading volume is increasing in the mean absolute forecast revision and decreasing in the contemporaneous dispersion in forecasts. These results suggest that differential processing of the public signal and/or speculative trading for short-term gain may help to explain why symmetric information RE predictions are often not supported in empirical and experimental settings.

Challenged by measurement difficulties common to research on management control systems, prior ERM studies present mixed findings.

Results show a market reaction to signals of enhanced management control from initial ERM quality ratings and rating revisions, and a stronger response to earnings surprises for firms with higher ERM quality.

To address these questions we construct a model of profitability biases (differences between reported profitability under R&D expensing and capitalization) and show that the key drivers of the reporting biases are the differences between R&D growth and earnings growth (momentum), and between R&D growth and return on equity (ROE). Companies with a high R&D growth rate relative to their profitability (typically early life-cycle companies) report conservatively, while firms with a low R&D growth rate (mature companies) tend to report aggressively under current generally accepted accounting principles.

Importantly, there is little professional guidance on how auditors should consider such factors when formulating an appropriate audit strategy, and there has been only one prior study on this issue (Cohen and Hanno 2000). Because there are no current specific auditing standards that relate to the effect of corporate governance on the audit process, we conducted a semi-structured interview with 36 auditors on current audit practices in considering corporate governance in the audit process. Reflecting on client experiences, auditors indicate a range of views with regard to the elements included in the rubric of “corporate governance”. Most significantly, auditors view management as the primary driver of corporate governance. The inclusion of top management in the “corporate governance mosaic” is inconsistent with agency theory's prescription of the board and other mechanisms serving as a means to independently oversee management's actions to protect stakeholders. Auditors consider corporate governance factors to be especially important in the client acceptance phase and in an international context. Further, despite the attention placed on the audit committee in the academic literature, in the business community, and by regulators in different countries (e.g., Canada, United States, Australia), several respondents indicated that their experiences with their clients suggest that audit committees are typically ineffective and lack sufficient power to be a strong governance mechanism.

First, firms' new investments increase significantly when auditors' liability level increases from low to medium, and decrease significantly as the liability level increases from medium to high. This result provides support for the argument that adequate auditor liability is necessary to motivate firms to invest in new projects. Excessive liability, however, may discourage firms from making new investments. Second, the frequency of audit failure decreases insignificantly when auditors' liability increases.

We argue that the costs of managing earnings through different income statement items vary and that the benefits of earnings management through each of these items depend on the context. We thus make differential predictions regarding which specific accrual will be used to manage earnings in each of the three contexts we consider. To measure earnings management for specific accruals, we develop performance-matched measures to capture the unexpected component of accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, depreciation expense, and special items. Consistent with our predictions, we find that firms issuing equity appear to prefer managing earnings upward by accelerating revenue recognition. Specifically, we find that accounts receivable for these firms are unexpectedly high. Conversely, for the management buyout context, we predict and find unexpected accounts receivable to be negative. For firms trying to avoid reporting an earnings decrease, we expect firms to be less concerned with earnings persistence and therefore more likely to use more transitory, and less costly, items to achieve their goal. We find that special items are significantly more positive for this group.

Interestingly, the analysis also reveals that aggregating earnings over longer periods increases the positive covariance between aggregate earnings and the accounting lag, which may further increase the R2. This positive covariance can lead to an earnings coefficient greater than one over some range of aggregation, which is consistent with the findings of Easton et al. that over the 10-year interval the returns-earnings regression slope coefficient is greater than one (1.7). The empirical results highlight the fact that the slope coefficient, which is greater than one and increasing with the interval, accounts for much of the increment to the returns-earnings R2. In fact, constraining the slope coefficient to be one results in an R2 of 11 percent for the 10-year interval, which is considerably lower than the R2 of 47 percent when the regression is unconstrained.

On the other hand, public disclosure can be used to narrow this information gap and to lower the cost of capital. This paper provides a theoretical model to examine the economic incentives behind these two forms of information dissemination and their consequences on the cost of capital.

Taken together, our findings suggest that SFAS No. 115 caused some of the accounting and economic consequences predicted by bankers, analysts, and academics.", "e:keyword": ["Economic consequences of financial reporting", "Regulatory risk", "Risk management", "SFAS No. 115"]}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1506/wyaw-jlgf-xu60-e8cq", "e:abstract": "Using matched samples of JIT adopters and nonadopters, we examine the association of JIT adoption with firms' financial reporting and tax incentives, earnings-management histories, and LIFO reserve levels. We find evidence that adoption decisions are influenced by the interaction of firms' LIFO reserves with their income smoothing, debt covenant, and tax incentives. We also find that adoption is less likely for firms historically engaging in high degrees of earnings management, particularly when such firms have no substantial LIFO reserves. Our study extends earlier research demonstrating a relation between inventory valuation method and year-end inventory transactions, and documents a relation between earnings-management incentives and a fundamental supply-chain design choice.", "e:keyword": ["Earnings management", "Just‐in‐time", "LIFO liquidations", "LIFO reserves"]}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1506/x478-1075-4pw5-1501", "e:abstract": "", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1506/xvqv-nq4a-08ex-fc8a", "e:abstract": "We analyze the ability of earnings and non-earnings performance metrics to explain the variability in annual stock returns for industries where we identify, ex ante, an allegedly preferred (for valuation purposes) summary performance metric. We identify three industries where earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and cash from operations (CFO) are preferred, and three industries where specific non-GAAP performance metrics are preferred. As a benchmark, we also examine the ability of EBITDA and CFO to explain returns for seven industries for which earnings is the preferred metric. Results for the benchmark earnings industries show that earnings dominates EBITDA and CFO in explaining returns. All other results are inconsistent with the view that perceptions of preferred metrics are reflected in actual aggregate investment behaviors.", "e:keyword": ["Cash flows", "Earnings", "Nonfinancial measures", "Performance metrics"]}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1506/y224-5q33-g6r2-817m", "e:abstract": "", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1506/y51r-c3yf-mt0t-bwe2", "e:abstract": "", "e:keyword": []}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1506/y917-mpry-panf-prve", "e:abstract": "Auditors' professional judgements are typically made following a discussion of contentious issues with other auditors (Gibbins and Mason 1988). These discussions may be with others at various levels in the hierarchy of the audit firm, with informal discussion with peers often taking place prior to formal discussions with audit supervisors (see, e.g., Solomon 1987). This study uses an experiment, involving 286 public accountants, to consider how discussion with peers may influence auditors' subsequent resolution of realistic audit-specific moral dilemmas. Auditors were asked to prescriptively discuss how an accountant ideally should resolve a moral dilemma, or to deliberatively discuss how an accountant actually would resolve a moral dilemma. The results showed that auditors have higher moral reasoning scores after prescriptive discussion with peers and lower moral reasoning scores after deliberative discussion with peers. Thus, the study findings point to the significance of discussion of contentious dilemmas with peers and the importance of type of discussion for predicting and explaining auditors' moral reasoning. More specifically, the results indicate that discussion with peers may provide information and/or signal what is important and acceptable to the resolution of a moral dilemma, which facilitates transformation of an auditor's moral reasoning. This suggests the importance of informal mechanisms, such as peer discussion, as part of the social control system in audit firms.", "e:keyword": ["Auditors", "Ethics", "Moral reasoning", "Social interaction"]}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1506/ykrx-huqu-9v28-ea16", "e:abstract": "Numerous studies have documented that stock returns are negatively related to changes in interest rates, but there has been little corroborating research on the information in interest-rate changes about the fundamentals that the stock market prices. The negative correlation is often attributed to changes in the discount rate, a denominator effect in a valuation model. However, there may also be a numerator effect on the expected payoffs that are discounted. This paper shows that changes in interest rates are positively related to subsequent earnings, but the change in earnings is typically not large enough to cover the change in the required return. Hence, the net (numerator and denominator) effect on equity value is negative, consistent with the results of the research on interest rates and stock returns.", "e:keyword": ["Earnings", "Equity valuation", "Expected inflation", "Interest rates"]}]
