While much attention has focused on the relationship between attributes of the innovation and the adoption decision, little has been done to study the adopters’ reactions to changes in these attributes over time. An important innovation attribute is price, which is commonly used as a proxy for adoption cost. In this paper, we investigate how organizations in the United States react to mainframe price changes over a period of thirty years, from 1955 to 1984. A parsimonious diffusion model that integrates both diffusion and pricing effects is developed. The model is empirically tested using annual adoption and pricing data of mainframes. Quality-adjusted price index is used to account for any changes in quality improvement over time.

Second is the fact that the effects of anonymity interacts with other situational variables, making its relation to disinhibition complex.

A considerable amount of current research in finance theory deals with modeling and prediction of these costs for equities trading, and commercial products and services recently have become available for probabilistically estimating real-time transaction implementation costs versus transaction size on a stock-specific basis.Earlier papers described the concept of satisfaction-or preference-based trading, with optimization of trade matching on the basis of mutual preference.

Results reveal that the achievement of strategic payoffs is a function of EDI embeddedness, which is defined as how central or peripheral a specific EDI network is to managing interfirm interdependence. In a model of EDI initiator strategic payoff, we argue that EDI embeddedness, which is influenced by existing interfirm relationship, moderates the impact of adopter EDI use on initiator strategic payoff derived from the EDI investment.

Nine BPR projects were executed and analyzed in detail, leading to the identification of 87 themes regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of the project. These themes were organized into 12 categories of lessons learned that provide insight into the \"best practices\" and together informed the evolution of the collaborative business engineering (CBE) approach to BPR.

We then empirically examined the aptness of our model using a sample of 465 data warehouse users from seven different organizations that employed report-based, query-based, and analytical business intelligence tools.

We examine conditions under which it is optimal for suppliers to operate in such markets, explaining why these markets may not always be detrimental for them.

The personalizing firm profiles the customer (based on past purchases) to recommend products. Hence, if a customer purchases less frequently from the personalizing firm, the recommendations made to her become less relevant.

This study proposes a new class of systems, termed autonomous scientifically controlled screening systems (ASCSS), designed to detect individuals’ purposely hidden information about target topics of interest. These hidden topics of interest could cover a wide range, including knowledge of concealed weapons, privacy violations, fraudulent organizational behavior, organizational security policy violations, preemployment behavioral intentions, organizational insider threat, leakage of classified information, or even ...", "ex:volume": "3;article:article:10.1080/07421222.2014.995535;wgroup:string:Publication Websites;website:website:TFOPB", "ex:source": "Journal of Management Information Systems", "ex:title": "Autonomous Scientifically Controlled Screening Systems for Detecting Information Purposely Concealed by Individuals", "ex:url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/07421222.2014.995535", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": ["automated screening kiosk", "autonomous scientifically controlled screening system", "concealed information test", "credibility assessment", "deception detection", "defensive response", "design science", "eye-tracking measures", "orienting response", "physical security"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Nathan W.

A multiple-group analysis reveals significant differences in trust formation, particularly in the cues considered in the evaluation of online services. Whereas a large user base inspires confidence in digital natives, naturalized digitals are more geared toward familiar brands and recommendations.

We are not aware of prior studies that examine parental or students’ attitudes and preferences toward data mining of educational application accounts, and how these attitudes differ across several countries.

We address the following research questions: What is the impact of IT investment on the return and risk dimensions of industry financial performance? How do industry characteristics moderate the relationship between IT investment and industry performance? Our analysis of these questions finds that higher levels of industry competition are associated with higher IT productivity (contribution of IT to value-added output), lower IT profitability (contribution of IT to industry average return on assets [ROA]), and higher IT risk (contribution of IT to ex ante variability of ROA). This is consistent with the notion that competition induces riskier IT investments, despite the fact that returns tend to be competed away.

DSR in IS has not reached maturity yet. This is particularly true of artifact evaluation. This paper investigates the “what” and the “how” of IS artifact evaluation: what are the objects and criteria of evaluation, the methods for evaluating the criteria, and the relationships between the “what” and the “how” of evaluation?

While the free offering helps capture potential customers, it might cannibalize the sales of premium goods or services. This paper adopts a game theoretical approach to examine the impact of free offering on the competition between two firms in the presence of network effects. The firms can either offer a free core product and a paid service or offer them as a bundle. The core product has stand-alone value and can be used separately but the value-added service has no value without the core product. We derive the market equilibria and present conditions under which the free offering strategy outperforms the bundling strategy.

The results from the empirical study of 96 Wikipedia articles suggest that (1) diversity should be encouraged, as the creative abrasion that is generated when cognitively diverse members engage in task-related conflict leads to higher-quality articles, (2) task conflict should be managed, as conflict—notwithstanding its contribution to creative abrasion—can negatively affect group output, and (3) groups should maintain a balance of both administra...", "ex:volume": "4;wgroup:string:Publication Websites;website:website:TFOPB", "ex:source": "Journal of Management Information Systems", "ex:title": "Information Quality in Wikipedia: The Effects of Group Composition and Task Conflict", "ex:url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.2753/MIS0742-1222270403;issue:issue:10.1080/mmis20.v027.i04", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": ["co-creation", "cognitive diversity", "collaboration", "community-based production", "group composition", "information quality", "task conflict", "Wikipedia"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": " Ofer   Arazy "}, {"ex:name": " Oded   Nov "}, {"ex:name": " Raymond   Patterson "}, {"ex:name": " Lisa   Yeo "}]}, {"ex:issue": "27", "ex:abstract": "Despite the extensive research on information technology (IT) outsourcing, our knowledge and understanding of how industry characteristics impact the use of IT outsourcing remain limited.

Using actual working professionals in an online experiment of hypothetical scenarios, we empirically tested the WBRS-M for reporting computer abuse and find that anonymity, trust, and risk are highly salient in the WBRS context.

In particular, we show that the relationship between contractual and relational governance oscillates between complementarity and substitution.

While busesinss-to-business (B2B) technology solutions, such as CPFR (collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment), facilitate the sharing of historical information (e.g., transaction records), business intelligence (e.g., potential customer demand) is considered private. Central to CPFR is collaborative demand forecasting (CDF) that allows supply chain partners to share private demand information and incorporate the jointly derived demand forecast into production planning and product replenishment decisions. Implementing CDF, however, is a challenge because of the high costs of the laborious collaboration effort (e.g., to resolve forecast differences).

Results from a survey of 539 employee users suggest that SRS engenders an emotion-focused coping response in the form of moral disengagement from ISP violations, which in turn increases one's susceptibility to this behavior. Our multidimensional view of SRS—comprised of security-related overload, complexity, and uncertainty—offers a new perspective on the workplace environment factors that foster noncompliant user behavior and inspire cognitive rationalizations of such behavior. The study extends technostress research to the information systems security domain and provides a theoretical framework for the influence of SRS on user behavior.

The benefits from a potential outsourcing relationship expansion have strategic implications for relational incentive provision. Modeling \"information poaching\" in IT outsourcing as an incentive problem with contractibility constraints, our analysis shows that this problem could be mitigated in a repeated game where the outsourcing client and the service provider agree on a relational contract. When the two partners share the belief that they can potentially benefit from a future relationship expansion, they are more likely to behave cooperatively during the early stages of their relationship. However, when they disagree about the likelihood of the future relationship expansion, they will have different preferences on a set of otherwise equivalent relational bonus contracts.
