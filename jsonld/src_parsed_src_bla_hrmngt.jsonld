No one can fully characterize the future, but with the help of the authors in this issue, we can begin to envision it. The themes proposed in this article propose that the reality, impact, and professionalism will change as HR evolves. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "ex:volume": "44", "ex:source": "Human Resource Management", "ex:title": "Conclusion: Reality, impact, and professionalism", "ex:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.20065/abstract", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2005", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Michael Losey", "Susan R.

Not surprisingly, small business leaders have raised concerns about the quality of HR programs in their firms and the fact that HR consumes scarce managerial time. While professional employer organizations (PEOs) emerged in response to such concerns, much controversy exists as to whether and how small businesses benefit from PEO utilization. Using a survey of more than 740 small businesses, we examine the relationship between PEO utilization and two key small business outcomes: managerial time required by HR activities and satisfaction with HR outcomes. Our results indicate that firms not using a PEO reported significantly lower levels of satisfaction with HR outcomes than firms that used a PEO for a limited set of transactional services and firms that used a PEO for both transactional and strategic HR services. Among firms using a PEO, satisfaction with HR outcomes was significantly higher among firms that obtained a broader set of transactional and strategic HR services. Firms that used a PEO also reported that HR consumed significantly less managerial time relative to leaders in firms that made no use of a PEO. However, there was no significant difference in the time demanded by HR between firms that used a limited set of transactional services and those that used a broader range of transactional and strategic services.

Testing our hypotheses on responses from 430 team members and team leaders pertaining to 145 software development teams, results support both predictions. Acknowledging the possible benefits of certain types of external influence (e.g., constructive feedback), the findings demonstrate that team-external managers of innovative projects should generally refrain from interfering in team-internal operational decisions.

In particular, we found that West Point utilizes traditional human resource management functions of recruiting, selection, job rotation, and training to improve their character-development process. In addition to utilizing these traditional human resource functions, West Point also engages in more contemporary and strategic HR practices such as managing communication, promoting organizational learning, organizational design and development, and organizational socialization and culture shaping to enhance the character and integrity of its members. Accordingly, we feel that the West Point character-development approach can be utilized across settings to assist nonmilitary organizations to aspire and reach higher ethical standards.

Almost one in six full-time hourly and salary employees works a shift outside the 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. window that researchers use to define the temporal bounds of the traditional workday. Almost half of those working in restaurants and bars work such alternate shifts, as do more than a quarter of workers in hospitals and manufacturing facilities. Drawing on interviews and observations in a Midwestern auto parts plant, this study explores how individuals in this predominantly male workforce talk about fulfilling family responsibilities in the face of relatively inflexible shift schedules. Interviews and observations reveal how the time pressures of shift work, particularly the afternoon-evening shift, affect the ability of fathers to participate in their children's activities, especially organized sports. Without formal options for scheduling flexibility, workers turn to a variety of informal approaches, such as ad hoc arrangements with sympathetic supervisors or the assistance of coworkers in covering for absences. In extreme cases, workers may engage in independent actions, often placing their jobs at risk. These findings contribute to the literature on work-family conflict and the gender dynamics of work-family life programs.

In this research, we investigate this assumption through an analysis of the relationship between an employee's willingness to become involved (”active orientation”) on employee reports of their OCC. We find, using data from 1,214 public-sector employees, that an active orientation toward involvement plays a significant role as a moderator in reducing employee reports of OCC.

This constructive approach stemmed from the self-confidence developed in the HR function over years of process improvement and culture change. Second, the HR professionals were motivated (rather than threatened) by the high stakes involved in this organizational transition.

Thus, it became clear that the body of knowledge on organizational learning is less fragmented and does not contain any contradictions.

These factors become critical in the context of human resource management because employees who want to quit may become less productive or even dysfunctional for the organization. Interviews and a questionnaire-based survey were used in this research. The survey was conducted using software professionals with work experience of less than four years, with the results based on 533 responses.

In this study, we investigate the effects of organizational culture to determine the types of cultural characteristics that are strongly associated with efforts to integrate the supply chain and delivery performance. Previous researchers have theorized and demonstrated that organizational culture leads to adopting management practices consistent with the culture and that these practices are associated with firm performance. There has been a relative dearth of research, however, on the impact of organizational culture in operations management literature. Thus, this study investigates the effects of organizational culture, measured by the competing values framework (CVF), on two types of supply chain integration efforts: (1) internal integration and (2) external integration with key suppliers and key customers. Employing the CVF, we assess organizational culture along four dimensions—market, hierarchy, clan, and adhocracy. Results indicate that culture does influence firms to adopt internal and external integration practices. Our findings also provide evidence that a firm's adhocracy culture score is positively associated with external integration, while a firm's hierarchy culture score is negatively associated with both internal and external integration practices. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "ex:volume": "49", "ex:source": "Human Resource Management", "ex:title": "Investigating the impact of organizational culture on supply chain integration", "ex:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.20381/abstract", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2010", "ex:keyword": ["Organizational culture", "Supply chain integration", "Partial least squares", "Competing values framework"], "ex:creator": ["Michael J.

The discussion is based on an in-depth case study conducted in the service industry in 2008. Implications are that planning processes must be fine-tuned to account for delays in the aging chain.

Drawing on human resource management and industrial relations literature, we test hypotheses concerning the relationship between direct and union voice arrangements and job satisfaction. This relationship represents a gap in the literature, which is important from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Controlling for a range of personal, job, and workplace characteristics, regression analyses suggest that although evidence of voice complementarity exists, direct voice appears to be the central voice arrangement underpinning employees' job satisfaction.

The current study examines whether organizations showing greater consideration for employees' morale and welfare in the downsizing process experience increased labor productivity. Further, because downsizing diminishes human capital and interferes with an organization's social exchange relationships, we posit that attention to employees' morale and welfare will be particularly important for high-performance work systems (HPWS) that rely on human capital for competitive advantage. We tested our hypothesis with a sample of organizations that had downsized using survey data matched with secondary data.

Thus, HR professionals have had little, if any, reason to be interested in subconscious processes. In the past decade, however, laboratory experiments by social psychologists have shown that goals can be primed. That is, people's behavior is affected by goals of which they are unaware. Because a conscious goal consumes cognitive resources, this finding has important implications for employee efficiency in the workplace. This paper discusses the results of priming a performance goal in two organizational settings. Call center employees who were primed using a photograph of a woman winning a race raised significantly more money from donors than those who were randomly assigned to a control group. A meta-analysis revealed that a photograph can prime the subconscious to increase job performance.

Data was collected via interviews and document analysis in four networks, spanning both the public and private sectors in the United Kingdom. Despite a set of potentially favorable conditions within these networks to promote alignment, integration, and consistency, implementation was impeded by other equally powerful forces, including differences in employer goals within networks, especially between public and private sector organizations; intraorganizational tensions within internal labor markets for organizations involved in networks; using divergent HR policies between organizations within multi-employer networks; and contradictions between the pursuit of “among employee” or “temporal” consistency for workers.

Researchers have generated many insights and practitioners have developed many interventions regarding culture in M&A. Managing culture, however, is often a low priority when executives are consumed with the deal's financial and strategic aspects. The authors propose a framework for how Human Resources (HR) can work with business partners in managing acculturation in M&A. They first examine the relationship between cultural differences and M&A outcomes, how culture manifests itself in combinations, and the causes and stages of culture clash. They then highlight the value of a clear “cultural endstate” in M&A and apply classic change management theory to identify actions that unfreeze current cultural mind-sets, move people toward the desired endstate, and refreeze the desired culture. Their framework specifies HR actions for four distinct cultural endstates—pluralism (in which the partner companies coexist), integration (in which the partners blend current cultures together), assimilation (in which one company absorbs the other), and transformation (in which the partner companies abandon key elements of their current cultures and adopt new values and norms). © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "ex:volume": "50", "ex:source": "Human Resource Management", "ex:title": "A framework for the human resources role in managing culture in mergers and acquisitions", "ex:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.20445/abstract", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": ["Mergers", "Acquisitions", "M&A", "Corporate culture", "Acculturation", "Change management", "Human resources"], "ex:creator": ["Mitchell Lee Marks", "Philip H.

Whereas existing literature on the topic views equality as underscoring the importance of distributive justice, power, or identity, the role of culture remains relatively obscure. In this study, the authors explore equality as a dynamic construct associated with two major processes in mergers of equals: cultural clash and cultural construction. The authors employ a qualitative case study with interviews and analysis of company materials from BroadBand, a wireless Internet access provider, to address the role of culture and equality in mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The results shed light on how and why social actors entering into mergers may enact a culture of equality. First, firms may develop new aspirations and patterns of appreciation and initiate practices and strategies that construct equality as an integral part of the merger. Second, when distributive equality becomes a liability, it incites change. In the context of equality, this change results in strategic action that transforms the meaning of “a merger of equals” to a more practical, pragmatic, and integrative equality, which takes into account the interests and the needs of the merged firm. Third, contrary to the common skeptical and cynical portrayal of mergers of equals, this study found equality to be a crucial factor during postmerger integration. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "ex:volume": "50", "ex:source": "Human Resource Management", "ex:title": "Cultural clashes in a “merger of equals”: The case of high‐tech start‐ups", "ex:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.20446/abstract", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": ["Merger of equals", "Equality", "Cultural clash", "Cultural construction", "Practices of equality"], "ex:creator": ["Israel Drori", "Amy Wrzesniewski", "Shmuel Ellis"]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "The author proposes a knowledge-based theoretical approach to cultural integration in mergers and acquisitions (M&A).

In addition, there is an emphasis on the leadership development of the mentors. Reverse mentoring is situated in the mentoring literature as an alternative form of mentoring, with unique characteristics and support functions exchanged that distinguish it from other developmental relationships. A model is developed that focuses on key variables to consider and how reverse mentoring may benefit individuals and organizations. Generational differences are also presented, and the ways in which reverse mentoring capitalizes on millennial capabilities and preferences are highlighted throughout.

We focus on employment brand–related predictors, specifically perceptions linked to the provision of unique employment experiences, organizational identity strength, perceived prestige, and judgments of whether the acquiring organization acts in accordance with its corporate identity claims. The study showed that perceptions of prestige immediately after acquisition predict identification 12 months hence, as do judgments of whether the organization acts in accordance with its corporate social responsibility–based corporate identity claims. These judgments also predict subsequent levels of discretionary effort and long-term intent to leave, as do perceptions linked to the provision of unique employment experiences. Perceived change in these unique employment experiences is also related to change in identification and intent to leave across time.

Two unique contributions are that we analyze accommodations for employees without disabilities as well as for those with disabilities, and compare perspectives on accommodation costs and benefits among employees, their coworkers, and their managers.

Based on case studies of four Indian IT services MNCs, involving 51 in-depth interviews of business and human resource (HR) leaders at the corporate and subsidiary levels, we identify five key HR roles—namely, strategic business partner, guardian of culture, builder of global workforce and capabilities, champion of processes, and facilitator of employee development.

But when employees exited for internal reasons (problems within the employment relationship), they engaged in multiple exit cycles and moved from indirect communication strategies toward increasingly direct ones. Managerial responses to these strategies failed to capitalize on opportunities to nurture post-exit relationships and sometimes generated a “vendetta effect” among exiting employees. The results suggest that managers might benefit from training in how to conduct effective exit conversations, particularly with employees who are leaving for internal reasons. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "ex:volume": "54", "ex:source": "Human Resource Management", "ex:title": "Can We Still be Friends?

Existing literature suggests that while women in China are comparatively well represented in management roles, they face distinctive pressures and barriers to their progress arising from entrenched patriarchal and collectivist aspects of the Chinese cultural tradition. However, little is known about how these aspects impact on women's orientations towards their careers and to what extent influential Western career theories are adequate in interpreting their experience. Drawing on interviews with 20 women managers in China, the article interprets women's orientations towards their careers in relation to their adherence to traditional gender roles and collectivist values. Using this framework, a fourfold taxonomy is developed which identifies “conformist,” “revolutionary,” “soloist,” and “dissident” orientations. The article suggests that Western career theories fail to capture the collective dimension, and thus do not account fully for the range of experience and orientations of Chinese women managers that are captured in the taxonomy. Implications, both practical and theoretical, are discussed. Recommendations are also made as to how management and career development policies might be developed in organizations in China in order to address the diverse needs and preferences of women managers. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "ex:volume": "54", "ex:source": "Human Resource Management", "ex:title": "Women Managers’ Careers in China: Theorizing the Influence of Gender and Collectivism", "ex:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.21643/abstract", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": ["Gender diversity", "International HRM", "Work‐family conflict", "Careers"], "ex:creator": ["Carol Woodhams", "Huiping Xian", "Ben Lupton"]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Ten years ago, Bowen and Ostroff (2004) criticized the one-sided focus on the content-based approach, where researchers take into account the inherent virtues (or vices) associated with the content of HR practices to explain performance.

Further, there is no clear taxonomy of psychological climate, although the climate literature suggests that psychological climate perceptions should form higher-order (i.e., abstract, broad) dimensions. Two meta-analyses have been conducted to evaluate higher-order frameworks, but neither study tested the psychometric structure of their hypothesized models. The current meta-analysis estimated the intercorrelations and criterion-related validity of 23 psychological climate constructs in order to test the theoretical frameworks proposed by prior meta-analyses. Confirmatory factor analyses supplemented by a method analogous to item-to-scale correlations indicated little empirical support for the a priori frameworks. Results suggest that that psychological climate may be parsimoniously represented by two dimensions. Task climate was most strongly indicated by supervisor goal setting, innovation, and organizational responsiveness. Relational climate was most strongly indicated by work group warmth and social rewards. A path analysis was estimated to test whether job satisfaction partially mediated the association between psychological climate and the outcomes of job performance, turnover intentions, and psychological well-being.

In contrast, the HRM literature on knowledge sharing examines the influence of single practices on individual-level knowledge sharing, but fails to include the influence of combinations of practices. We link the idea of fit between practices to employee motivation for knowledge sharing by arguing that rewards may be ambiguous and difficult to interpret, but that such ambiguity may be reduced if rewards are combined with other aligned HRM practices, notably job design and work climate. Thus, fit is established through the ambiguity-reducing effect of combining specific HRM practices. Accordingly, we test for complementarities among rewards, job design, and work climate in the form of a three-way interaction among these variables with respect to their impact on knowledge-sharing motivation. Our analysis of 1,523 employees in five knowledge-intensive firms shows that employees who are exposed to knowledge-sharing rewards experience higher levels of autonomous motivation to share when they are simultaneously exposed to a noncontrolling job design and work climate that support knowledge sharing. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "ex:volume": "54", "ex:source": "Human Resource Management", "ex:title": "Why Complementary HRM Practices Impact Performance: The Case of Rewards, Job Design, and Work Climate in a Knowledge‐Sharing Context", "ex:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.21649/abstract", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": ["Reward systems", "Knowledge management", "Job design"], "ex:creator": ["Nicolai J.

The aim of this article is to examine the impact of motivation-enhancing HR practices on the productivity, motivation, and performance of commercial bank employees to promote and attain contextual ambidexterity within the organization. The theoretical model presented in this article shows how ex-ante incentives (incentives based on past performance) and ex-post incentives (incentives based on future performance) affect productivity, motivation, and performance of employees. The results are tested empirically by analyzing real quarterly data of commercial bank employees in Israel. The main results show that workers with relatively high abilities might take advantage of both ex-ante and ex-post incentives. In contrast, workers with relatively low ability are unable to take advantage of both incentive schemes.

We propose a conceptual model in which top management HPWS values moderate the relationship between HR cause-effect beliefs and the intensity of HPWS programs reported by managers as well as the relationship between HPWS programs and employees’ perceptions of implemented HPWS practices. We test our model using a unique multisource data set collected from 120 hotel franchisees that includes survey responses from 648 managers and 1,293 employees.

Besides examining job satisfaction differences between employees with and without disabilities, we focus on perceived flexibility as an organizational boundary condition, arguing for its influence on the job satisfaction of employees with disabilities. We introduce perceived centralization and formalization, representing different indicators of flexibility, as moderators of the disability–job satisfaction relationship. Regression analysis using data from 110 small and medium-sized companies with 4,141 employees reveals that employees with disabilities are less satisfied than their colleagues without disabilities in highly centralized environments. As predicted, a decentralized organizational context relates to higher job satisfaction levels for all employees, but especially for those having a disability.

Our findings indicate that the types of large investor, namely, family and institutional, are differentially associated with the likelihood of the firm using these CHRPs. Specifically, family owners with their long-term investment horizon, as well as their stakeholder orientation, increase the likelihood of the firm using these practices. In contrast, large institutional owners with their shorter-term investment horizon, as well as their investor orientation, decrease the likelihood of the firm using these practices. Furthermore, among institutional investors, transient institutional investors are negatively associated with these practices, while dedicated institutional investors are not associated with these practices.

While politicians have the intention of enhancing fertility and well-being of families, employers expect positive responses from working parents based on the norm of reciprocity. Since industrialized countries increase public family support year by year, the question arises as to whether this may trigger unanticipated consequences. If both the state and companies invest in substitutive services, they might unintentionally spark competition. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine whether public childcare may “crowd out” the reciprocity effects of corporate childcare on working parents. In Switzerland, state family policies vary among the 26 cantons, so we are able to compare cantons with a high and low number of cantonal childcare services. Using survey data taken from 414 working parents living in different Swiss cantons, we examined whether public childcare affects organizational-related responses of working parents. First, our results support the expected level of reciprocity: working parents in companies with their own childcare services show higher organizational commitment than parents in companies without this support. Second, we find evidence for a crowding-out effect: in family-supportive cantons with numerous public childcare services, working parents’ commitment to companies with their own childcare services is lower than in less family-friendly cantons.

It is not known whether these gaps are closing, at what rate, and whether all groups are affected equally; nor is it known whether merit pay alleviates or exacerbates existing pay gaps. In addressing these issues, the analysis draws on longitudinal payroll data from a large UK-based organization. Results show that pay gaps are closing; however, the rate of convergence is slow relative to the size of existing pay disparities, and slowest of all for people with disabilities. When the effect of merit pay is isolated, it is found to have a small positive effect in reducing pay gaps, and this effect is generally larger for dual/multiple-disadvantaged groups.

A national sample of human resource managers from 155 Canadian firms responded to surveys about their firm's diversity and equality management (DEM) practices. Cluster analysis and latent class modeling identified three distinct approaches to DEM: classical disparity DEMS showing limited development of DEM-related practices, institutional DEMS involving complex selection mechanisms and monitoring of employment statistics, and configurational DEMS linking diversity to business strategy. Hypothesis-testing analyses indicated that both institutional and configurational DEMS were predicted by coverage by the Canadian employment equity program, federal contractor status, and the presence of a diversity expert on staff. Only configurational DEMS was predicted by inclusion of HRM in developing business strategy. Configurational DEMS positively predicted the employment of workers with disabilities and members of visible minority groups as well as ROA. These findings support the proposition based on strategic human resource management (SHRM) theory that DEM practices should be considered as bundles and that vertical linkage to strategy is important for DEM effectiveness.

Interviews with 42 managers in 20 North American employers suggested that managers were more likely to support RLW for employees whom they saw as (1) high-performers, (2) flexible in their use of RLW, and (3) doing conducive jobs. Interviews with 20 HR experts and 24 senior executives revealed four dimensions of organizational support, two cultural (senior management support and discourse on career penalties) and two structural (adaptation of HR systems and organizational diffusion). In embracing organizations there was a higher frequency of more supportive managers than there was in ambivalent organizations.

A complementary, qualitative interview-based study (Study 3) confirmed that well-implemented controls facilitate trust in the organization; however, poorly implemented control systems that are inconsistent, overly rigid, or incentivize untrustworthy behavior can undermine trust in the organization. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "ex:volume": "55", "ex:source": "Human Resource Management", "ex:title": "How Do Controls Impact Employee Trust in the Employer?", "ex:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.21733/abstract", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": ["Trust", "Control", "Procedural fairness", "Organizational prestige"], "ex:creator": ["Antoinette Weibel", "Deanne N.

I go on to argue that we do not need more proof that HRM practices are associated with financial performance. The best CEOs already believe this, though they need knowledge and practices that will enable them to develop a positive sustainable HRM system. HRM research, both normal and action science, must answer the question of how a “great” HRM system—practices, leadership, organization design, culture, and change processes—might be developed over time (its takes years) and how great companies can avoid the liquidation of intangible assets in the face of pressures for short-term performance.

Overemphasis on the latter produces research that is relevant only to academics and that is not used in organizations. I argue, as have others, that in addition to rigor, a successful scientific discipline must prove itself relevant to the society in which it is embedded. Hence, the objectives of SHRM should be twofold: to influence academic thinking and conceptualizing, but also to alter the way managers set priorities and make decisions.

Conceptual papers question the usefulness of ESVPs, arguing that they may promote selective expression at work in the way that employees who use ESVPs suggest work-related process improvements (i.e., promotive voice) but still remain silent about issues that disturb smooth cooperation (i.e., cooperative silence). Prior research that treated voice and silence as being mutually exclusive cannot clarify how using ESVPs relates to voice and silence and under which conditions these links are particularly strong. Drawing from an employee survey in a UK branch of a multinational technology company, we apply a differentiated approach that treats voice and silence as separate behaviors and considers their specific motivators. Results from structural equation modeling show that even though employees use ESVPs and engage in voice, silence may still linger as a potential threat to performance and well-being. Moreover, moderator analyses revealed that affective attachment to the organization increased and job engagement decreased the occurrence of this potentially dangerous coincidence. Our findings provide evidence for the usefulness of more differentiated approaches to employee voice and silence and indicate that factors that facilitate voice, be they formal procedures or pro-organizational attitudes, might not suffice to overcome silence at work.

Unlike supervisors as a rating group, results show that peer and subordinate raters as a group may be more likely to have their ratings negatively influenced by cultural distance, an effect that may be exacerbated for peer ratings from countries higher in power distance and lower in humane orientation. This study contributes to the understanding of multisource feedback systems to assess expatriate leadership effectiveness by identifying likely group ratings tendencies linked to cultural distance and hierarchical perspectives. Organizations should develop strategies to mitigate possible effects of cultural distance on subordinate and peer ratings of expatriates. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "ex:volume": "56", "ex:source": "Human Resource Management", "ex:title": "Rating Expatriate Leader Effectiveness in Multisource Feedback Systems: Cultural Distance and Hierarchical Effects", "ex:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.21763/abstract", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2017", "ex:keyword": ["International HRM", "Performance assessment", "Training and development", "Diversity", "Feedback"], "ex:creator": ["Ellen Ernst Kossek", "Jason L.

According to theory, this entails enabling simultaneous high levels of exploration and exploitation within a subsystem. The practices involved in enabling contextual ambidexterity form a major and relatively unexplored leadership challenge. Our main aim is to draw on a combination of ambidexterity and complexity theory insights to understand how contextual ambidexterity emerges in dynamic contexts. We contribute to the literature on the role of leadership in enabling contextual ambidexterity by exploring the daily practices leaders enact to stimulate exploration and exploitation as well as to shift dynamically between them to (re)gain contextual ambidexterity. We present the results of two qualitative studies exploring leadership in project-based organizations where the pressure for contextual ambidexterity is relevant. We show that in responding adaptively to environmental stimuli, leaders shift between practices to emphasize exploitation or exploration to (re)gain the needed high levels of both, and their enactments are bounded by the conditions of keeping exploration and exploitation simultaneously high. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding contextual ambidexterity as a dynamic accomplishment that emerges in everyday interactions, the role of leaders in enabling contextual ambidexterity, and the need for HR managers to support leaders in enacting this dynamic form of leadership. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "ex:volume": "54", "ex:source": "Human Resource Management", "ex:title": "Exploring the Role of Leadership in Enabling Contextual Ambidexterity", "ex:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.21764/abstract", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": ["Leadership", "Contextual ambidexterity", "Requisite complexity", "Qualitative studies"], "ex:creator": ["Liselore A.

We identify employee outcomes, such as commitment and competence, as mediating processes that explain the effects of incentive pay on firm performance. We further propose procedural justice climate and environmental turbulence as boundary conditions that determine the strength of the effects of incentive pay on employee outcomes. The research model is tested using multisource data collected at three time points over a five-year period from 227 Korean companies. Our analysis confirmed that incentive pay enhanced employee commitment and competence, which, in turn, improved the operational and financial performances of firms. The effect of incentive pay on employee commitment was negative for firms with a low procedural justice climate, but positive for firms operated under a highly turbulent environment. By contrast, the effect of incentive pay on employee competence was positive only for firms operated under a stable environment.

We integrate resource-based and dynamic capability theories in order to identify and investigate two intervening mechanisms that link HR practices to firm performance. The first mechanism is the intellectual capital resources comprising the human, social, and organizational capital that HPWS create. The second mechanism is the uses to which both HPWS and resources can be applied, operationalized as organizational ambidexterity, the simultaneous exploitation of existing knowledge and exploration of new knowledge.

In contrast to earlier studies of plateauing, it was found that occupational characteristics mitigate the effects of plateauing. The plateaued technical specialists experienced the expected declines in job attitudes; however, in project management, and to a lesser extent in administration, it was the plateaued group whose career outlook was most positive. Interview data suggested that the critical factor operating here was not plateauing per se, but the extent to which learning is required and experience and acquired skills are utilized and recognized in the work role.

Consistent with this condition, most executive education activities overstress classroomstyle receptive methods, while neglecting active learning. Reasons for this state of affairs are proposed.

In terms of managerial efficiency and performance per se, the evidence strongly suggests that there are far more similarities than differences between the way men and women ‘manage’. However, there are some major sex differences in relation to demographic profiles, job status and employment factors, career development, occupational stress levels, and attitudes towards female managers compared to their male counterparts. One in nine managers in Britain are women and less than one per cent occupy senior management positions. Women managers tend to have to be more highly qualified than men managers, are more likely to be single or divorced, and encounter more prejudice and discrimination in the work environment. In addition, compared to male managers female managers have to cope with additional stresors stemming both from their work and home lives. It is suggested that many of these differences are hampering the career prospects of women in management and contributing towards the difficulties they have in reaching the higher levels of management compared to men.

In accordance with this paradigm shift, leading Japanese firms have started reforming their Human Resource Management (HRM) function from a productivity-centered to a creativity-centered one— creative HRM. Creative HRM has three pillars: (1) the creation of the strategic vision through commitment of the employees, (2) an entrepreneurial middle management as a key strategic node, and (3) multi-dimensional personnel management. Creation and realization of the strategic vision through the active commitment of an entrepreneurial middle management is necessary for the self-renewal of the firm. “Japanese Personnel Management” that might have been overadapted to the traditional strategic paradigm is now transforming itself from a “group-centered” personnel administration to an “individual-centered” one.

But these quick fixes attempt to treat symptoms (e.g., leniency), while diseases (e.g., lack of managerial accountability for performance improvement or development) go unchecked. Rather than periodic revisions to the rating scales, PMM can be made relevant by linking it to strategy execution. PMM can be a vital tool for strategy execution by signaling what is really important, providing ways to measure what is important, fixing accountability for behavior and results, and helping to improve performance. In this article a PMM process is described which begins with identification of Critical Success Factors (CSFs) derived directly from business strategy.

This article compares my own transition experiences with the theories of subidentity change and executive succession. It also identifies implications for future research based upon the differences observed, such as the perceived or virtual permanence of the acting administration. The conclusion offers recommendations for practice, such as the need for clarity of role expectations, strong leadership, and clear strategic direction; the value of a long hand-off process; and the utility of planned transition events. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.", "ex:volume": "34", "ex:source": "Human Resource Management", "ex:title": "Unplanned executive transitions and the dance of the subidentities", "ex:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.3930340106/abstract", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "1995", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Douglas T.

Selecting one member of the group, however, to handle a poorly performing member resulted in relatively lenient disciplinary actions. Consistent with this finding, the attitude survey results revealed that individual group members are reluctant to assume responsibility for disciplining a poorly performing group member. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.", "ex:volume": "40", "ex:source": "Human Resource Management", "ex:title": "Managing Individual Performance in Work Groups", "ex:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.4016/abstract", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2001", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Robert C.
