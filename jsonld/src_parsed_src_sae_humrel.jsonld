[{"ex:issue": "12", "ex:abstract": "This article provides a novel perspective on technology transfer by arguing that incorporation of a new technology into an organization may require it to become different in more ways than existing research would have us believe. This is especially true when host and home organizations are based in two widely different institutional environments. Because institutional pressures exert themselves on organizational behavior from both outside and inside the organization, they are critical in determining whether the transfer process is successful. Borrowing from institutional theory, the institutional environment of an organization is divided into regulative, normative and cognitive aspects. It is argued that, although less obvious in their influence, normative and cognitive institutions are no less important than the relatively more visible regulatory institutions.

Only to the extent that all three of these conditions are fully met is destructive violence likely. Although women in whom these three conditions were present would be as likely as men to commit violent acts, men qualify much more frequently and fully than women.

Employing distinct interpretive repertoires, professions construct different versions of team work and make competing legitimacy claims. These discursive practices both reflect and reproduce structural inequality between the professions. Ultimately, the privileged position of surgeons and anaesthetists over nurses and operating department practitioners is legitimated and maintained.

The article identifies three particular problems prevalent in the current organizational discourse literature: reductionism, overpacking, and colonization and suggests three analytical strategies to overcome these problems: counter-balancing concepts — aiming to avoid seeing ‘everything’ as discourse — relativizing muscularity — being more open about discourse’s constitutive effects — and disconnecting discourse and Discourse t...", "ex:volume": "64", "ex:source": "Human Relations", "ex:title": "Decolonializing discourse: Critical reflections on organizational discourse analysis", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0018726711408629", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": ["Discourse", "Language", "Methodology", "Organizational culture", "Power", "Subjectivity"], "ex:creator": ["Mats Alvesson", "Dan Kärreman"]}, {"ex:issue": "9", "ex:abstract": "In this article we respond to Bargiela-Chiappini, Iedema and Mumby.We notice that there is considerable agreement concerning the state of the art of organizational discourse analysis, while also discussing the disagreements.

Derived from a historical context, this trade-off has contemporary relevance and is helpful in reconciling contradictory evidence on slack.", "ex:volume": "", "ex:source": "Human Relations", "ex:title": "When too many are not enough: Human resource slack and performance at the Dutch East India Company (1700–1795)", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0018726717691340", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2017", "ex:keyword": ["Contingent workers", "Human resources", "Management history", "Organizational slack", "Personnel selection"], "ex:creator": ["Stoyan V Sgourev", "Wim van Lent"]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "", "ex:volume": "1", "ex:source": "Human Relations", "ex:title": "Index to Authors", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/001872674700100101", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "1947", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": []}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "", "ex:volume": "1", "ex:source": "Human Relations", "ex:title": "Editorial Policy", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/001872674700100102", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "1947", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": []}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "", "ex:volume": "1", "ex:source": "Human Relations", "ex:title": "Frontiers in Group Dynamics", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/001872674700100103", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "1947", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Kurt Lewin"]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "", "ex:volume": "1", "ex:source": "Human Relations", "ex:title": "Transitional Communities and Social Re-Connection", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/001872674700100104", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "1947", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Adam Curle"]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "", "ex:volume": "1", "ex:source": "Human Relations", "ex:title": "Autistic Hostility and Social Reality", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/001872674700100105", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "1947", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Theodore M.

Nevertheless, the kinds of effects which may be observed can be expected to vary with situational aspects confronting the group and the understanding of these factors may be crucial to the development of reasonably precise organizational theory.

In a 2 x 2 design, democratic and autocratic managers, classified according to scores on a leadership belief scale, were assigned both democratic and autocratic subordinates. On observing their responses, it was found that both types of managers behaved democratically with democratic subordinates and autocratically with autocratic subordinates.

The essential difference between this approach and that adopted in ethnomethodology is that the dialectical method recognises that knowledge grows out of the conflict between \"being\" and \"consciousness, \" and in the contradictions between conditions of life and perceptions of its alternatives.

Finally, it is suggested that research concerning the documentary methods accompanying such \"formalization,\" via the machinery M.E.D. and H.R.M., would benefit from ethnomethodological analyses of the type originated by Garfinkel.", "ex:volume": "42", "ex:source": "Human Relations", "ex:title": "The Panopticon: From Bentham's Obsession to the Revolution in Management Learning", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/001872678904200804", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "1989", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Stephen Fox"]}, {"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "Most previous treatments of conflict style have focused upon five strategies: avoiding (withdrawing), forcing (competing), smoothing (accommodating), compromising, and confronting (collaborating), purported to lie in a two-dimensional (assertion and cooperation) space.

Group elements, e.g., roles, subgroups, group episodes, and social acts, are viewed as signifiers open to particular significations each of which may be represented within the imaginary history of the group, i.e., in particular people and events. This theoretical position is arrived at via an application of Lacan's ideas to implications drawn from an examination of Freud's works on narcissism and group psychology. To Freud, the group is bound together by narcissistic identifications among the members who have each incorporated important aspects of the leader into his/her ego-ideal. The myth of the primal horde exemplifies this basic group structure.

I construct a conceptual framework for understanding organizational learning at an organizational level of analysis. This framework is based on the proposition that organizational learning is visible in the organizational dynamics created from the interaction between politics (power relations) and emotion within an organization. Using a combination of psychodynamic theory and reflections on the politics of organizing I develop the idea that organizations are learning when the 'establishment' that is being created through the very process of organizing can be identified and critically reflected upon. I use a case example of a change initiative within Hyder PLC, a multinational company, to identify organizational dynamics that limit organizational learning. In the final part of the article, I discuss the conclusions that emerged from the case example and the implications of these conclusions for the theory ...", "ex:volume": "54", "ex:source": "Human Relations", "ex:title": "Power and emotion in organizational learning", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/a019197", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2001", "ex:keyword": ["Change", "Organizational analysis", "Organizational learning", "Politics", "Power and emotion"], "ex:creator": ["Russ Vince"]}, {"ex:issue": "10", "ex:abstract": "This article reviews the processes involved in interfirm learning and identifies an alternative form of alliance in which the objective is knowledge creation, not knowledge acquisition or transfer.

Parents' volunteer worker role was subject to conflict with and interruption by the expectations of their organizational client role, which constrained teachers' ability to direct parents' work in the classroom. Managerial effectiveness required responding to the demands and expectations of both sets of roles through a process of adaptive self-regulation.

The framework involves understanding how the organization is imagined, experienced and maintained through the influence of social and strategic politics, as well as the resulting emotional and political relations within which attempts at change have to be managed.

We suggest that negative capability can create an intermediate space that enables one to continue to think in difficult situations. Where positive capability supports 'decisive action', negative capability supports 'reflective inaction', that is, the ability to resist dispersing into defensive routines when leading at the limits of one's knowledge, resources and trust.

We develop a framework for pragmatic validity that encompasses knowledge represented in all three modes. However, we also note an over-reliance on the propositional mode in academia, which contrasts with a preference for narrative and visual knowledge among practitioners. Explicit and propositional knowledge are key criteria for achieving scientific validity, but more ambiguous knowledge serves important functions in organizational life and may thus possess pragmatic validity.

A case study of a course in group dynamics is presented, and the desire of students in that course to learn about groups simply by being in a group is considered. The article argues that the desire to learn simply by having an experience expresses a conservative impulse. If all we have is an experience, all we can learn is the inevitability of repeating it. This makes learning from experience the enemy of creativity as its purpose is not to discover what might be, but to assure the reproduction of what is. Learning from experience in this sense means failing to learn from experience. Failure to learn from experience is linked to fear of thinking.
