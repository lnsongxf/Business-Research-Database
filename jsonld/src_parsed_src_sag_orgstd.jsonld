Our analysis suggests that attributing institutional change to a single event or ‘jolt’ leads to a flawed understanding of institutional change processes. We demonstrate that, rather than causing institutional change, events are a part of the change process, and only become significant as actors bring them to our notice and ‘theorize’ around them (Greenwood et al. 2002).

The subcontracting regime was transformed from a reliance on a series of decentralized local networks of suppliers to a highly centralized arrangement that bore increasing semblance to a unitary hierarchy.

It argues that Lacanian theory can illuminate the (negative) dialectic between subject and organized Other and account for obedience and attachment to organized frameworks of social life in two ways: first, by focusing on the symbolic presuppositions of authority and power; and, second, by exploring the role of fantasy and enjoyment in sustaining them and in neutralizing resistance.", "ex:volume": "29", "ex:source": "Organization Studies", "ex:title": "Peripheral Vision", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0170840608094848", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2008", "ex:keyword": ["Desire", "Fantasy", "Identification", "Jouissance", "Lacan", "Lack", "Power", "Psychoanalysis", "Resistance", "Subjection"], "ex:creator": ["Yannis Stavrakakis"]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "", "ex:volume": "29", "ex:source": "Organization Studies", "ex:title": "Organization Studies", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0170840608095143", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2008", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": []}, {"ex:issue": "8-9", "ex:abstract": "", "ex:volume": "29", "ex:source": "Organization Studies", "ex:title": "Thank You and Goodbye!

My findings indicate that, through the acquisition of experience, individuals become attentive to a wide range of events surrounding them (via attentional breadth) and attuned to the opportunities that reside within these events (via attentional integration). Therefore, in achieving these two qualities of attention, individuals are able to see not only more events but also more possibilities.", "ex:volume": "34", "ex:source": "Organization Studies", "ex:title": "Things Seen and Unseen: Investigating Experience-Based Qualities of Attention in a Dynamic Work Setting", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0170840612464752", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": ["Attentional breadth", "Attentional integration", "Dynamic settings", "Experience", "Qualities of attention", "Sensegiving"], "ex:creator": ["Erik Dane"]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "Firms can be conceived as political entities in which various stakeholders struggle against each other to reach goals.

Moreover, in countries as similar as France and Italy, organizational diversity as epitomized by the survival of savings banks has taken two apparently diverse routes.

Second, we operationalize this frame in a longitudinal study of an organizational change initiative focusing on strategic rebranding in an industrial firm. We elucidate how roles and identities co-evolve over time and how roles and role transitions figure in the organization-based identity work of individuals.

According to this logic, means-to-an-end relationships are the primary motivation for all action. Drawing on the insights of Martin Heidegger, we show how the preoccupation with gathering facts to justify environmental initiatives on the basis of ‘efficiency’ impoverishes our thinking about what is essential to our existence.

The key insights of the case study show that brand-centred control – unlike traditional normative control that typically works inside the company – also engages an external audience (customers, fans, and the wider public) as an additional source of normative control.

As this essay tries to assess, it is necessary to separate the existence of hierarchical form from the question of to what extent the organization can function in a democratic way. Transaction-specific phenomena and other 'inner-logical' factors preclude the elimination of hierarchy. Democracy in organizations, however, is less tied to particular organizational forms than to e.g. equal possibilities among organizational actors to control mandator positions.

In the second stage, the hypotheses generated from these implications are empirically tested. By utilizing data collected from 64 U.S. national manufacturing trade associations, Weber's analytical distinctions between corporate groups and organizations are examined. The patterns of findings are congruent with Weber's argument that organizations are a distinct subset of corporate groups.

To challenge this dogma, attention is given to Kuhn's understanding that there is continuity as well as incommensurability in the process of theory development.

This paper iden tifies and critiques these limitations. It proposes an alternative view of organ izational environment as an economic biosphere.

As the development of TQM is rich in icons and symbolism, it is argued that it acts both to legitimate current changes in organization through the penetration of the market, and also as a market model of organization based on customer and supplier links.

The proposed model of these processes implies a set of complex interactions between density and population age in effecting vital rates in organizational populations. These hypotheses are tested with data on entries of firms into the automobile indus tries of Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy during 1886-1981.

The second objective is to develop a framework which will allow the integration of a time-space analysis into IT research, and thus enable a more holistic and coherent view of the implementation problem.

Results generally showed that the organizational founding rate depends on two sets of variables.
