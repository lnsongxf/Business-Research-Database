The result contributes by stressing the importance of strategic learning processes, especially in conjunction with entrepreneurial exploration strategies. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the effect from exploration to strategic learning is moderated by the level of exploitation.

He was the first to empirically explore topics such as venture capital decision making; entrepreneurial networks; cultural influences on entrepreneurial behavior; and many issues in corporate venturing. Through the creation of vibrant, global, scholarly networks, the founding of the Journal of Business Venturing, his dedication to training and mentoring the next generation of scholars, and establishing the first large-scale systematic global data collection in the field, Mac has made an irreplaceable contribution to the well-established field that entrepreneurship has become. He and his students have been acknowledged as having made significant breakthroughs in our understanding of entrepreneurial phenomena, recognized by a burgeoning number of awards and testaments to scholarly recognition. He argues that the challenge for future researchers will be to tackle big, messy problems that do not lend themselves to the popular methodologies employed by academia today.

As a result, those innovations which involve cross-line-of-business interdependence are trumped by the firm's articulated strategy and structure. Social structures could, potentially, fill this coordination gap. But social structures associated with the initiation of interdependent innovation are inversely associated with their execution. We build a dynamic, corporate-level, evolutionary model in which individuals autonomously initiate cross-line-of-business projects not through the formal structure of the firm, but using contacts from their own social networks. Some of these projects are selected and actively supported by senior executives; this support sends clear signals about what collaboration is valued by the firm, which gives other actors powerful, albeit informal, incentives to connect with others across the interunit boundary. As a result, the sparse interunit social structure that was conducive to initiation changes, becoming much more cohesive (at least locally) and is able to support execution and retain these interdependent innovations. Thus, where intra-divisional innovations are primarily driven by organizational structure, we suggest that interdivisional innovations are driven primarily by social networks.

Whether framed in the language of invention versus refinement or local search versus long jumps, the spirit of the argument is of an explicit trade-off that resource-constrained organizations must make to secure their survival and success. While we do not dispute the fundamental truth that underlies this tension, we do believe this dominant characterization of the process of exploration may be masking key drivers of this tension and potential paths towards its resolution. We argue that, from the perspective of an actor, all activities are inherently exploitative in their nature, in the sense that they are undertaken with the explicit expectation that they may achieve meaningful progress on some dimension of performance. The key distinction regards the extent to which the dimension of performance is recognized and legitimated from the perspective of the organizational context in which the actor is operating. Acts perceived as ‘exploratory’ are, thus, more accurately characterized as acts of exploitation directed along new performance dimensions. We consider the organizational challenges that such exploratory action poses and the implications for entrepreneurial initiatives. From the perspective of the focal actor engaged in the exploratory initiative, the challenge is to identify ‘projections’ of the payoff of the initiative they are pursuing, either onto those dimensions of performance that are of interest to the organization, or onto more concrete measures of product-market acceptance and financial return. Low-dimensional representations of the business landscape are an inevitable by-product of bounded rationality and the need for organizations and their strategies to coordinate and direct collective action.

In contrast, large firms are skilled at establishing competitive advantages, but their heavy emphasis on the efficiency of their existing businesses often undermines their ability to continuously explore for additional opportunities. Building on a variety of theories, including network, learning, resource-based, and real options, we suggest that collaborative innovation can enable both types of firms to overcome their respective challenges. Collaborative innovation is the pursuit of innovations across firm boundaries through the sharing of ideas, knowledge, expertise, and opportunities. For small firms, we contend that pursuing entrepreneurship collaboratively allows them to preserve their creativity and flexibility while mitigating the inherent liabilities of smallness. We argue that collaborative innovation permits large firms to exploit their advantage-creating skills while concurrently exploring for opportunities outside their current domain.

We develop operational measures of each of these behaviors and find significant differences between innovative entrepreneurs and executives in a large sample survey of 72 successful and unsuccessful innovative entrepreneurs and 310 executives. Drawing on network theory, we develop a theory of entrepreneurial opportunity recognition that explains why these behaviors increase the probability of generating an idea for an innovative venture. We contend that one's ability to generate novel ideas for innovative new businesses is a function of one's behaviors that trigger cognitive processes to produce novel business ideas. We also posit that innovative entrepreneurs are less susceptible to the status quo bias and engage in these information-seeking behaviors with a motivation to change the status quo.

However, not all opportunity ideas survive this full process. Between the conceptualization stage and the objectification stage, some ideas are abandoned due to inadequate objectification. Also, between the objectification stage and the enactment stage, some objectified opportunities are abandoned due to insufficient resource support. We identify variables that influence the likelihood that opportunity ideas will be objectified and other variables that influence the likelihood that objectified opportunities will be enacted, and these variables are incorporated into empirically testable propositions. In the discussion section, we describe several boundary conditions for our theory, contrast the theory with objectivist (discovery) theory, and derive implications for future research.

Drawing on organizational learning theory, we develop an integrative framework that looks at the joint and interactive effects of experiential learning by the firm, the management team's pre-start-up international experience (i.e., congenital learning), and interorganizational learning from key exchange partners (customers, suppliers, investors, etc.). Utilizing empirical data on 114 young, technology-based firms in Flanders, Belgium, we find that a firm's level of international experience negatively moderates the effects of congenital and interorganizational learning on the extent of internationalization. That is, the lower a firm's experiential learning, the more significant the effects of the start-up team's prior international knowledge base and the knowledge and skills acquired through key partners.

We compare and contrast two models of team formation – a rational process model and an interpersonal relations model – and identify the network contexts under which each is most applicable.

Nonetheless, there are entrepreneurial strategies through which new ventures might achieve the advantages of small world networks.

We do so by integrating concepts from the behavioral agency model and a resource-based concept known as familiness to advance a base proposition that explains the effects of different ownership structures (controlling ownership, sibling partnership, and cousin consortium) on risk-taking behaviors in family firms. Then, drawing insights from the family firm and household economics literatures, we discuss the contingent effects of three distinct forms of altruism (parental, paternalistic, and psychosocial) on the base proposition. The framework advances our current understanding of risk taking in family businesses in two ways: first, by proposing how and when risk-taking behaviors differ across these firms; and second, by offering a variant of the base behavioral agency model that is better suited for explaining risk taking at family firms.
