In the present study, we examined the neural mechanisms underlying this process, testing key hypotheses derived from transformational and social identity approaches to leadership. While undergoing functional MRI, supporters from the two major Australian political parties (Liberal vs. Labor) were presented with inspirational collective-oriented and noninspirational personal-oriented statements made by in-group and out-group leaders. Imaging data revealed that inspirational (rather than noninspirational) statements from in-group leaders were associated with increased activation in the bilateral rostral inferior parietal lobule, pars opercularis, and posterior midcingulate cortex: brain areas that are typically implicated in controlling semantic information processing. In contrast, for out-group leaders, greater activation in these areas was associated with noninspirational state...", "ex:volume": "0", "ex:source": "Journal of Management", "ex:title": "The Neuroscience of Inspirational Leadership", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0149206314565242", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": ["leadership", "fMRI", "social neuroscience", "group membership", "social identity", "transformational leadership", "semantic processing", "theory of mind", "mentalizing", "mirror system", "attention", "confirmation bias", "cognitive dissonance"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Pascal Molenberghs"}, {"ex:name": "Guy Prochilo"}, {"ex:name": "Niklas K.

To address this lack, we conducted four studies encompassing six samples (N = 925) from three countries (United States, Greece, and United Kingdom) that establish the psychometric properties and nomological network of the Political Will Scale. We demonstrate that the scale exhibits both convergent and discriminant validity with several conceptually related constructs while also determining that political will positively relates to influence and work-related behaviors. As an extension of our findings, political will seems to explain variance over and above political skill in relation to influence tactics, status, and career growth potential.

Specifically, we hypothesized that AL would have distinct effects through both personalized AL, which is a leader’s direct effect on a follower, and through generalized AL, which is a leader’s indirect or group-based effect on a follower as a result of leadership effects among the follower’s coworkers. These hypotheses were consistent with a complete review of the empirical literature on AL’s effects and the results from a sample of leaders and followers working in a large multinational company. The data showed that the two paths of AL’s influence had distinct relationships with follower responses.

The self-defense view of diminished self-esteem suggests that abusive supervision motivates destructive behavior in an attempt to reassert personal control and protect victims’ self-image. The self-presentational view of diminished self-esteem suggests abusive supervision motivates behavior that attempts to signal fit with and value to the workgroup and organization. On the basis of these two theoretical perspectives, we examine how employees’ diminished self-esteem from abusive supervision can motivate destructive work behavior (i.e., supervisor-directed deviance, organizational deviance) and self-presentational behavior (i.e., putting on a façade, ingratiation). Additionally, employees’ turnover intentions, which are an indicator of employees’ psychological detachment from the organization, are considered a moderator of the effects of abusive supervision on dimin...", "ex:volume": "0", "ex:source": "Journal of Management", "ex:title": "The Motivational Effects of Diminished Self-Esteem for Employees Who Experience Abusive Supervision", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0149206314566462", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": ["abusive supervision", "self-esteem", "diminished self-esteem", "workplace deviance", "façade", "ingratiation"], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Ryan M.

In Study 1, we observed natural fluctuations in self-efficacy as individuals completed a mathematics test, finding that the tendency to reduce resource allocation with high self-efficacy is most clearly observed when time is scarce. In turn, an inverted-U relationship between resource allocation and overall performance under high time scarcity emerged such that moderate levels of resource allocation resulted in the highest levels of performance.
