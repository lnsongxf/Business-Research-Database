[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "We build a model of child labor and study its implications for welfare. We assume that there is a trade-off between child labor and the accumulation of human capital. Even if parents are altruistic and child labor is socially inefficient, it may arise in equilibrium because parents fail to fully internalize its negative effects. This occurs when bequests are zero or when capital markets are imperfect. We also study the effects of a simple ban on child labor and derive conditions under which it may be Pareto improving in general equilibrium. We show that the implications of child labor for fertility are ambiguous.", "ex:volume": "108", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Is Child Labor Inefficient?", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/316097", "ex:pages": "663-679", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2000", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Jean-Marie Baland", "James A.

Little is known about the ability of individual members of the household to keep consumption smooth over time or relative to other members of the household. We use data on adult nutrition in Ethiopia to investigate whether individuals are able to smooth their consumption over time and within the household. We find that poorer households are not able to do so. Furthermore, poor southern households do not engage in complete risk sharing; women in these households bear the brunt of adverse shocks. This result implies that the collective model of household organization, which imposes Pareto efficiency on allocations, is rejected for these households. Finally, we obtain estimates of the relative Pareto weights in household allocation. We find that a wife's relative position is better if customary laws on settlements at divorce are favorable or if she comes from a relatively wealthy background and that poor southern women have lower Pareto weights in allocation.", "ex:volume": "108", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "In Sickness and in Health: Risk Sharing within Households in Rural Ethiopia", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/316098", "ex:pages": "688-727", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2000", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Stefan Dercon", "Pramila Krishnan"]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "The number of producers in the U.S. tire industry grew for 25 years and then declined sharply, and the industry evolved to be an oligopoly.

The resulting decision rules and equilibrium conditions are used to estimate the underlying parameters of the model using aggregate data. These policy functions are used to evaluate the short- and long-run effects of the French policies. We find that these policies do stimulate the automobile sector in the short run but, through the induced changes in the cross-sectional distribution of car ages, create the basis for subsequent low activity.
