South (North) has a comparative advantage in lower- (higher-) indexed goods and, hence, specializes in goods with lower (higher) income elasticities of demand. Product cycles and a southern terms-of-trade deterioration result from faster population growth and uniform productivity growth in South and a global productivity improvement. South's domestic income redistribution policy can improve its terms of trade so much that every household in South may be better off, at the expense of North.", "ex:volume": "108", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "A Ricardian Model with a Continuum of Goods under Nonhomothetic Preferences: Demand Complementarities, Income Distribution, and North-South Trade", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/317684", "ex:pages": "1093-1120", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2000", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Kiminori Matsuyama"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "We propose a model with micropolitical foundations to contrast different political regimes.

Unfortunately, this parameter has been difficult to estimate in the context of the U.S. disability insurance program since all workers face an identical benefits schedule. I surmount this problem by studying the experience of Canada, which operates two distinct disability insurance programs: for Quebec and for the rest of Canada. The latter program raised its benefits by 36 percent in January 1987, whereas benefits in Quebec were constant.

The ratio of the monies in the cash-in-advance constraint is endogenous. Bimetallism is feasible: we find a continuum of steady states indexed by the constant exchange rate of the monies. Bimetallism is not desirable: among steady states, welfare under monometallism is higher than under any bimetallic equilibrium.

Moreover, aggregate data suggest that average income tax rates are higher, and distributions of posttax income flatter, in countries with proportional representation than in those with majority rule. While there are other differences between these countries, this paper explores how variations in the political system per se influence equilibrium redistributive tax rates and income distributions. A three-party proportional representation model is developed in which taxes are determined through legislative bargaining among successful electoral parties, and the economic decision for individuals is occupational choice.

This market offers firms facing high marginal abatement costs the opportunity to purchase the right to emit SO2 from firms with lower costs, and this is expected to yield cost savings compared to a command-and-control approach to environmental regulation. This paper uses econometrically estimated marginal abatement cost functions for power plants affected by Title IV of the CAAA to evaluate the performance of the SO2 allowance market. Specifically, we investigate whether the much-heralded fall in the cost of abating SO2, compared to original estimates, can be attributed to allowance trading. We demonstrate that, for plants that use low-sulfur coal to reduce SO2 emissions, technical change and the fall in prices of low-sulfur coal have lowered marginal abatement cost curves by over 50 percent since 1985. The flexibility to take advantage of these changes is the main source of cost reductions, rather than trading per se. In the long run, allowance trading may achieve cost savings of $700$800 million per year compared to an \"enlightened\" command-and-control program characterized by a uniform emission rate standard. The cost savings would be twice as great if the alternative to trading were forced scrubbing. However, a comparison of potential cost savings in 1995 and 1996 with modeled costs of actual emissions suggests that most trading gains were unrealized in the first two years of the program.", "ex:volume": "108", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Sulfur Dioxide Control by Electric Utilities: What Are the Gains from Trade?", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/317681", "ex:pages": "1292-1326", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2000", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Curtis Carlson"}, {"ex:name": "Dallas Burtraw"}, {"ex:name": "Maureen Cropper"}, {"ex:name": "Karen L.
