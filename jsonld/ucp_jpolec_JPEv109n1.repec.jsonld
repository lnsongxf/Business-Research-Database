[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "I study the earnings structure and the equilibrium assignment of workers when workers exert intrafirm spillovers on each other. I allow for arbitrary spillovers provided that output depends on some aggregate index of workers' skill. Despite the possibility of increasing returns to skills, equilibrium typically exists. I show that equilibrium will typically be segregated and that the skill space can be partitioned into a set of segments and any firm hires from only one segment. Next, I apply the model to analyze the effect of information technology on segmentation and the distribution of income. There are two types of human capital, productivity and creativity, that is, the ability to produce ideas that may be duplicated over a network. Under plausible assumptions, inequality rises and then falls when network size increases, and the poorest workers cannot lose. I also analyze the impact of an improvement in worker quality and of an increased international mobility of ideas.", "ex:volume": "109", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "On the Distribution of Income and Worker Assignment under Intrafirm Spillovers, with an Application to Ideas and Networks", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/318604", "ex:pages": "1-37", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2001", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Gilles Saint-Paul"}]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "This paper offers some new estimates of the contribution of learning to the rapid increases in labor productivity observed in the construction of Liberty ships during World War II.

The two key assumptions are constraints on lump-sum transfers from poorer members and disproportionate control rights wielded by wealthier members. Transfers of rents to the latter are achieved by depressing prices paid for inputs supplied by members and diverting resulting retained earnings. The theory predicts that increased heterogeneity of landholdings in the local area causes increased inefficiency by inducing a lower input price and a lower level of installed crushing capacity. Predictions concerning the effect of the distribution of local landownership on sugarcane price, capacity levels, and participation rates of different classes of farmers are confirmed by data from nearly 100 sugar cooperatives in the Indian state of Maharashtra over the period 197193.", "ex:volume": "109", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Inequality, Control Rights, and Rent Seeking: Sugar Cooperatives in Maharashtra", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/318600", "ex:pages": "138-190", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2001", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Abhijit Banerjee"}, {"ex:name": "Dilip Mookherjee"}, {"ex:name": "Kaivan Munshi"}, {"ex:name": "Debraj Ray"}]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "This paper is based on the idea that for each partner in a marriage, there are two distinct types of leisure. One type is each person's independent (or private) leisure, and the other type is spousal leisure, whose importance has long been emphasized in the literature of psychology. While each type of leisure is unobservable (only total leisure is observed), it is shown that the recent collective models of the intrahousehold allocation initiated by Chiappori can be extended to identify each type of leisure up to an additive constant. In particular, the effects of each member's wage, household unearned income, and extrahousehold environmental parameters on the independent and spousal leisure and on the sharing rule are fully identified.

We propose a new model to address the question of enfranchisement. The main feature of our model is that it takes into account natural affinities, such as religion or class, that may exist between voters.
