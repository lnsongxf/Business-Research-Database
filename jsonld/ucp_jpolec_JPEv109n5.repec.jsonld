[{"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "This paper examines the role of individual instruction and teacher quality in determining economic growth and convergence across school districts. The model shows that if teacher quality is more important for human capital accumulation than individual instruction, human capital convergence will occur between two school districts. This convergence arises because a poor school district hires relatively better teachers but uses them in larger classes in comparison with a rich school district. The model is estimated on panel data of the states of the United States from 1882 to 1990. The estimates indicate that teacher quality is relatively more important for human capital accumulation than individual instruction. The model accounts for all the mean growth in state per capita incomes and between 80 and 100 percent of convergence in state per capita incomes.", "ex:volume": "109", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Teachers, Growth, and Convergence", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/322830", "ex:pages": "1021-1059", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2001", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Robert Tamura"]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "Suppose that n buyers each want one unit and m sellers each have one or more units of a good. Sellers post prices, and then buyers choose sellers. In symmetric equilibrium, similar sellers all post one price, and buyers randomize. Hence, more or fewer buyers may arrive than a seller can accommodate. We call this frictions. We solve for prices and the endogenous matching function for finite n and m and consider the limit as n and m grow. The matching function displays decreasing returns but converges to constant returns. We argue that the standard matching function in the literature is misspecified and discuss implications for the Beveridge curve.", "ex:volume": "109", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Pricing and Matching with Frictions", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/322835", "ex:pages": "1060-1085", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2001", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Kenneth Burdett", "Shouyong Shi", "Randall Wright"]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between gun ownership and crime. Previous research has suffered from a lack of reliable data on gun ownership. I exploit a unique data set to reliably estimate annual rates of gun ownership at both the state and the county levels during the past two decades. My findings demonstrate that changes in gun ownership are significantly positively related to changes in the homicide rate, with this relationship driven almost entirely by an impact of gun ownership on murders in which a gun is used. The effect of gun ownership on all other crime categories is much less marked. Recent reductions in the fraction of households owning a gun can explain one-third of the differential decline in gun homicides relative to nongun homicides since 1993.", "ex:volume": "109", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "More Guns, More Crime", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/322833", "ex:pages": "1086-1114", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2001", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Mark Duggan"]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "An innovation in this paper is to introduce a time-to-build technology for the production of market capital into a model with home production.

For men of all working ages and women under 40, Current Population Survey data show a sharp drop in the employment of disabled workers after the ADA went into effect. Although the number of disabled individuals receiving disability transfers increased at the same time, the decline in employment of the disabled does not appear to be explained by increasing transfers alone, leaving the ADA as a likely cause. Consistent with this view, the effects of the ADA appear larger in medium-size firms, possibly because small firms were exempt from the ADA.

The analysis yields three results that suggest significant sectoral specificity of physical capital and substantial costs of redeploying the capital. First, other aerospace companies are overrepresented among buyers of the used capital relative to their representation in the market for new investment goods. Second, even after age-related depreciation is taken into account, capital sells for a substantial discount relative to replacement cost; the more specialized the type of capital, the greater the discount. Yet, capital sold to other aerospace firms fetches a higher price than capital sold to industry outsiders.
