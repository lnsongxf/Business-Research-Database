[{"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "This paper studies mechanisms behind the rise of mass consumption societies. The development process depicted follows the Flying Geese pattern, in which a series of industries take off one after another. As productivity improves in these industries, each consumer good becomes affordable to an increasingly large number of households, which constantly expand the range of goods they consume. This in turn generates larger markets for consumer goods, which leads to further improvement in productivity. For such virtuous cycles of productivity gains and expanding markets to occur, income distribution should be neither too equal nor too unequal. With too much equality, the economy stagnates in a poverty trap. With too much inequality, the development stops prematurely.", "ex:volume": "110", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "The Rise of Mass Consumption Societies", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/341873", "ex:pages": "1035-1070", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2002", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Kiminori Matsuyama"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "Empirical work testing for a negative trade-off between risk and incentives has not had much success: the data suggest a positive relationship between measures of uncertainty and incentives rather than the posited negative trade-off. I argue that the existing literature fails to account for an important effect of uncertainty on incentives through the allocation of responsibility to employees. When workers operate in certain settings, firms are content to assign tasks to workers and monitor their inputs. By contrast, when the situation is more uncertain, they delegate responsibility to workers but, to constrain their discretion, base compensation on observed output.", "ex:volume": "110", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "The Tenuous Trade-off between Risk and Incentives", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/341874", "ex:pages": "1071-1102", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2002", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Canice Prendergast"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "This paper develops a dynamic general equilibrium model of an agricultural economy in which poor farmers borrow from rich farmers.
