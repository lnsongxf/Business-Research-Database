[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "While English auctions are the most common in practice, their rules typically lack sufficient structure to yield a tractable theoretical model without significant abstractions. Rather than relying on one stylized model to provide an exact interpretation of the data, we explore an incomplete model based on two simple assumptions: bidders neither bid more than their valuations nor let an opponent win at a price they would be willing to beat. Focusing on the symmetric independent private values paradigm, we show that this limited structure enables construction of informative bounds on the distribution function characterizing bidder demand, on the optimal reserve price, and on the effects of observable covariates on bidder valuations. If the standard theoretical model happens to be the true model, our bounds collapse to the true features of interest. In contrast, when the true data‚Äêgenerating process deviates in seemingly small ways from that implied by equilibrium in the standard theoretical model, existing methods can yield misleading results that need not even lie within our bounds. We report results from Monte Carlo experiments illustrating the performance of our approach and comparing it to others. We apply our approach to U.S. Forest Service timber auctions to evaluate reserve price policy.", "ex:volume": "111", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Inference with an Incomplete Model of English Auctions", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/344801", "ex:pages": "1-51", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2003", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Philip A.

This paper examines this question empirically. The analytical framework involves a general equilibrium model of preferential trade and an econometric model with tight links to this theory. This framework is used to implement tests of the natural trading partners hypothesis using U.S. trade data for the years 196495: Welfare changes that would result from preferential tariff reductions by the United States against various trading partners are first estimated, and correlations with bilateral \"distance\" measures (with and without controls for income levels) are then examined. Since the argument for \"natural\" trading partners is based on the greater likelihood of geographically proximate countries to be more significant trading partners, correlations between the welfare change estimates and bilateral trade volume are examined as well.

Two features of this growth present challenges to the standard trade models. First, the growth is generally thought to have been generated by falling tariff barriers worldwide. But tariff barriers have decreased by only about 11 percentage points since the early 1960s; the standard models cannot explain the growth of trade without assuming counterfactually large elasticities of substitution between goods. Second, tariff declines were much larger prior to the mid 1980s than after, and yet, trade growth was smaller in the earlier period than in the later period. The standard models have difficulty generating this nonlinear feature. This paper develops a two-country dynamic Ricardian trade model that offers a resolution of these two puzzles. The key idea embedded in this model is vertical specialization, which occurs when countries specialize only in particular stages of a good's production sequence. The model generates a nonlinear trade response to tariff reductions and can explain over 50 percent of the growth of trade. Finally, the model has important implications for the gains from trade.", "ex:volume": "111", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Can Vertical Specialization Explain the Growth of World Trade?", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/344805", "ex:pages": "52-102", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2003", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Kei-Mu Yi"}]}]
