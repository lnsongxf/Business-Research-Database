This paper explains the difference between these two experiences by focusing on the role played by caste. The theoretical model contrasts caste- and non-caste-based societies: in the former, there exists an inherited component to status (caste) that is independent of wealth, and in the latter, wealth is the primary determinant of status. Modernization is assumed to involve two components: increasing average wealth and increasing wealth dispersion within status (or caste) groups. The paper shows that, in caste-based societies, the increases in wealth dispersion that accompany modernization necessarily lead to increases in dowry payments, whereas in non-caste-based societies, increased dispersion has no real effect on dowry payments and increasing average wealth causes the payments to decline.", "ex:volume": "111", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Why Dowry Payments Declined with Modernization in Europe but Are Rising in India", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/367679", "ex:pages": "269-310", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2003", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Siwan Anderson"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "This paper presents a spatial econometric method for characterizing productivity comovement across sectors of the U.S. economy. Input-output relations provide an economic distance measure that is used to characterize interactions between sectors, as well as conduct estimation and inference. We construct two different economic distance measures. One metric implies that two sectors are close to one another if they use inputs of other industrial sectors in nearly the same proportion, and the other metric implies that sectors are close if their outputs are used by the same sectors. Our model holds that covariance in productivity growth across sectors is a function of economic distance. We find that (1) positive cross-sector covariance of productivity growth generates a substantial fraction of the variance in aggregate productivity, (2) cross-sector productivity covariance tends to be greatest between sectors with similar input relations, and (3) there are constant to modest increasing returns to scale. We test and reject the hypothesis that these correlations are due to a common shock.", "ex:volume": "111", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "A Spatial Analysis of Sectoral Complementarity", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/367681", "ex:pages": "311-352", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2003", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Timothy G.

Producers and consumers of a commodity (or buyers and sellers of an asset) who wish to trade can choose between two competing types of intermediaries: \"middlemen\" (dealer/brokers) and \"market makers\" (specialists). Market makers post publicly observable bid and ask prices, whereas the prices quoted by different middlemen are private information that can be obtained only through a costly search process. We consider an initial equilibrium with which there are no market makers but there is free entry of middlemen with heterogeneous transactions costs. We characterize conditions under which entry of a single market maker can be profitable even though it is common knowledge that all surviving middlemen will undercut the market maker's publicly posted bid and ask prices in the postentry equilibrium. The market maker's entry induces the surviving middlemen to reduce their bid-ask spreads, and as a result, all producers and consumers who choose to participate in the market enjoy a strict increase in their expected gains from trade. When there is free entry into market making and search and transactions costs tend to zero, bid-ask spreads of all market makers and middlemen are forced to zero, and a fully efficient Walrasian equilibrium outcome emerges.", "ex:volume": "111", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Middlemen versus Market Makers: A Theory of Competitive Exchange", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/367684", "ex:pages": "353-403", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2003", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "John Rust"}, {"ex:name": "George Hall"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "The classical model of balance of payments crises implicitly assumes that the central bank sits passively as international reserves dwindle. In practice, however, central banks typically defend pegs aggressively by raising short-term interest rates. This paper analyzes the feasibility and optimality of raising interest rates to delay a potential BOP crisis. Interest rate policy works through two distinct channels. By raising demand for domestic, interest-bearing liquid assets, higher interest rates tend to delay the crisis. Higher interest rates, however, increase public debt service and imply higher future inflation, which tends to bring forward the crisis. We show that, under certain conditions, it is feasible to delay the crisis, but raising interest rates beyond a certain point may actually hasten the crisis. A similar nonmonotonic relationship emerges between welfare and the increase in interest rates. It is thus optimal to engage in some active interest rate defense but only up to a certain point. In fact, there is a whole range of interest rate increases for which it is feasible to delay the crisis but not optimal to do so.", "ex:volume": "111", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Delaying the Inevitable: Interest Rate Defense and Balance of Payments Crises", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/367682", "ex:pages": "404-424", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2003", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Amartya Lahiri"}, {"ex:name": "Carlos A.

However, such honest reporting is not an equilibrium except in the extreme case in which the property values are identical for all households.
