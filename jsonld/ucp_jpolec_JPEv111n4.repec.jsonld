[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "We construct a dynamic general equilibrium production economy to explicitly link expected stock returns to firm characteristics such as firm size and the book-to-market ratio. Stock returns in the model are completely characterized by a conditional capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Size and book-to-market are correlated with the true conditional market beta and therefore appear to predict stock returns. The cross-sectional relations between firm characteristics and returns can subsist even after one controls for typical empirical estimates of beta. These findings suggest that the empirical success of size and book-to-market can be consistent with a single-factor conditional CAPM model.", "ex:volume": "111", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Equilibrium Cross Section of Returns", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/375379", "ex:pages": "693-732", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2003", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Joao Gomes"}, {"ex:name": "Leonid Kogan"}, {"ex:name": "Lu Zhang"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "In the United States, more than two-thirds of decedents with multichild families divide their estates exactly equally among their children.
