[{"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "In this paper, we find that the age-adjusted elasticity of child wealth with respect to parental wealth is 0.37 before the transfer of bequests. Lifetime income and asset ownership jointly explain nearly two-thirds of the wealth elasticity. Education, past parental transfers, and expected future bequests account for little of the remaining elasticity. Survey measures of risk correlate strongly between parents and children. However, they explain little of the intergenerational similarity in the propensity to own different assets, suggesting that children's savings propensities are determined by mimicking their parents' behavior, or the inheritance of preferences not related to risk tolerance. Our results imply that while parents do pass on human capital and saving propensities to their children, the level of intergenerational fluidity is much greater than that suggested by recent accounts in the popular press.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:volume": "111", "ex:title": "The Correlation of Wealth across Generations", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/378526", "ex:pages": "1155-1182", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2003", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Kerwin Kofi Charles"}, {"ex:name": "Erik Hurst"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "Motivated by the behavior of asset prices, trading volume, and price volatility during episodes of asset price bubbles, we present a continuous-time equilibrium model in which overconfidence generates disagreements among agents regarding asset fundamentals. With short-sale constraints, an asset buyer acquires an option to sell the asset to other agents when those agents have more optimistic beliefs. As in a paper by Harrison and Kreps, agents pay prices that exceed their own valuation of future dividends because they believe that in the future they will find a buyer willing to pay even more. This causes a significant bubble component in asset prices even when small differences of beliefs are sufficient to generate a trade. In equilibrium, bubbles are accompanied by large trading volume and high price volatility. Our analysis shows that while Tobin's tax can substantially reduce speculative trading when transaction costs are small, it has only a limited impact on the size of the bubble or on price volatility.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:volume": "111", "ex:title": "Overconfidence and Speculative Bubbles", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/378531", "ex:pages": "1183-1219", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2003", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Jose A.
