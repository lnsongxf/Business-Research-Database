[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "This paper provides a case study of the effect of labor relations on product quality. We consider whether a long, contentious strike and the hiring of replacement workers at Bridgestone/Firestone's Decatur, Illinois, plant in the mid-1990s contributed to the production of defective tires. Using several independent data sources and looking before and after the strike and across plants, we find that labor strife at the Decatur plant closely coincided with lower product quality. Monthly data suggest that defects were particularly high around the time concessions were demanded and when large numbers of replacement workers and returning strikers worked side by side.", "ex:volume": "112", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Strikes, Scabs, and Tread Separations: Labor Strife and the Production of Defective Bridgestone/Firestone Tires", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/381479", "ex:pages": "253-289", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2004", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Alan B.

Love, however, can complicate the picture. If love is fleeting or the resolution of agents' income uncertainty occurs predominantly later in life, then marriages with good economic matches last longer. In contrast, if love is persistent and the resolution of uncertainty to agents' income occurs early, then marriages with good economic matches are more likely to be caught short with too little love to save a marriage. Consequently, once married, the partners will be more likely to divorce. Evidence is provided to distinguish between these alternative scenarios.", "ex:volume": "112", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Marriage and Consumption Insurance: What's Love Got to Do with It?", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/381477", "ex:pages": "290-318", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2004", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Gregory D.

The relationship between wealth and entry into entrepreneurship is essentially flat over the majority of the wealth distribution. It is only at the top of the wealth distributionafter the ninety-fifth percentilethat a positive relationship can be found. Segmenting businesses into industries with high and lowstarting capital requirements, we find no evidence that wealth matters more for businesses requiring higher initial capital. When using inheritances as an instrument for wealth, we find that both past and future inheritances predict current business entry, showing that inheritances capture more than simply liquidity.

We resolve this long-standing question using new empirical methods applied to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the Survey of Consumer Finances, and the Consumer Expenditure Survey. We find a strong positive relationship between saving rates and lifetime income and a weaker but still positive relationship between the marginal propensity to save and lifetime income. There is little support for theories that seek to explain these positive correlations by relying solely on time preference rates, nonhomothetic preferences, or variations in Social Security benefits.

We find strong support for the proposition that both judicial independence and constitutional review are associated with greater freedom.

Our results imply that a one-percentage-point increase in the tax rate is associated with a 3 percent increase in evasion.
