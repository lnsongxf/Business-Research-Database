[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "The neoclassical growth model is used to identify the short-run effects of neutral technology shocks, which affect the production of all goods homogeneously, and investment-specific shocks, which affect only investment goods. The real equipment price, crucial for identifying the investment shocks, experiences an abrupt increase in its average rate of decline in 1982, so the analysis is based on a split sample. On the basis of the preferred specification, the two technology shocks account for 73 percent of hours' and 44 percent of output's business cycle variation before 1982, and 38 percent and 80 percent afterward. The shocks also account for more than 40 percent of hours' and 58 percent of output's forecast errors over a three- to eight-year horizon in both samples. The majority of these effects are driven by the investment shocks.", "ex:volume": "114", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "The Dynamic Effects of Neutral and Investment-Specific Technology Shocks", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/505048", "ex:pages": "413-451", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2006", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Jonas D.

While exogenous asymmetric information has been shown to select a unique equilibrium, we show that the endogenous information generated by policy interventions leads to multiple equilibria. The policy maker is thus trapped into a position in which self-fulfilling expectations dictate not only the coordination outcome but also the optimal policy. This result does not rely on the freedom to choose out-of-equilibrium beliefs, nor on the policy being a public signal; it may obtain even if the policy is observed with idiosyncratic noise.", "ex:volume": "114", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Signaling in a Global Game: Coordination and Policy Traps", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/504901", "ex:pages": "452-484", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2006", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["George-Marios Angeletos", "Christian Hellwig", "Alessandro Pavan"]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Do Walrasian markets function orderly in the presence of adverse selection? In particular, is their outcome efficient when exclusive contracts are enforceable? This paper addresses these questions in the context of a Rothschild-Stiglitz insurance economy. We identify an externality associated with the presence of adverse selection as a special form of consumption externality. Consequently, we show that competitive equilibria always exist but are not typically incentive efficient. However, as markets for pollution rights can internalize environmental externalities, markets for consumption rights can be designed to internalize the consumption externality due to adverse selection. With such markets competitive equilibria exist and incentive-constrained versions of the first and second welfare theorems hold.", "ex:volume": "114", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Efficient Competitive Equilibria with Adverse Selection", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/503754", "ex:pages": "485-516", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2006", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Alberto Bisin", "Piero Gottardi"]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Behavioral economics has demonstrated systematic decision-making biases in both lab and field data.

We show that capuchins react rationally to both price and wealth shocks but display several hallmark biases when faced with gambles, including reference dependence and loss aversion.
