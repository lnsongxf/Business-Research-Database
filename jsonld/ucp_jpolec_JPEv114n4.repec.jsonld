[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "We solve each household's optimal saving decisions using a life cycle model that incorporates uncertain lifetimes, uninsurable earnings and medical expenses, progressive taxation, government transfers, and pension and social security benefits. With optimal decision rules, we compare, household by household, wealth predictions from the life cycle model using a nationally representative sample. We find, making use of household-specific earnings histories, that the model accounts for more than 80 percent of the 1992 cross-sectional variation in wealth. Fewer than 20 percent of households have less wealth than their optimal targets, and the wealth deficit of those who are undersaving is generally small.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:volume": "114", "ex:title": "Are Americans Saving \"Optimally\" for Retirement?", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/506335", "ex:pages": "607-643", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2006", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "John Karl Scholz"}, {"ex:name": "Ananth Seshadri"}, {"ex:name": "Surachai Khitatrakun"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "We incorporate multiagent, principal-agent theory into general equilibrium analysis.

The contracts are identified with firms, so the market determines which firms exist and who is assigned to which firm in what capacity.

I use evidence from Romania, where in 1966 dictator Nicolae Ceauescu declared abortion and family planning illegal.

Children born after the abortion ban attained more years of schooling and greater labor market success. The reason is that urban, educated women were more likely to have abortions prior to the policy change, and the relative number of children born to this type of woman increased after the ban.
