[{"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "This paper constructs and calibrates a parsimonious model of occupational choice that allows for entrepreneurial entry, exit, and investment decisions in the presence of borrowing constraints. The model fits very well a number of empirical observations, including the observed wealth distribution for entrepreneurs and workers. At the aggregate level, more restrictive borrowing constraints generate less wealth concentration and reduce average firm size, aggregate capital, and the fraction of entrepreneurs. Voluntary bequests allow some high-ability workers to establish or enlarge an entrepreneurial activity. With accidental bequests only, there would be fewer very large firms and less aggregate capital and wealth concentration.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:volume": "114", "ex:title": "Entrepreneurship, Frictions, and Wealth", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/508032", "ex:pages": "835-870", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2006", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Marco Cagetti"}, {"ex:name": "Mariacristina De Nardi"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "We develop a framework for valuing improvements in health and apply it to past and prospective reductions in mortality in the United States.

Cumulative gains in life expectancy after 1900 were worth over $1.2 million to the representative American in 2000, whereas post-1970 gains added about $3.2 trillion per year to national wealth, equal to about half of GDP.

Adaptive organizations provide employees with flexibility to tailor their tasks to local information. Coordination is maintained by limiting specialization and improving communication. Alternatively, by letting employees stick to some preagreed action plan, organizations can ensure coordination without communication, regardless of the extent of specialization. Among other things, our theory shows how extensive specialization results in organizations that ignore local knowledge, and it explains why improvements in communication technology may reduce specialization by pushing organizations to become more adaptive.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:volume": "114", "ex:title": "Adaptive Organizations", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/508031", "ex:pages": "956-985", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2006", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Wouter Dessein"}, {"ex:name": "Tano Santos"}]}]
