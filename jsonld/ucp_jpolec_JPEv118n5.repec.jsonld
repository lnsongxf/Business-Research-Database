The receiver observes only a signal provided by the sender and accepts the prospect if his Bayesian inference about the prospect's relevance exceeds his opportunity cost. The sender's profits are typically maximized by partial information disclosure, whereby the receiver is induced to accept less relevant but more profitable prospects (\"switches\") by pooling them with more relevant but less profitable ones (\"baits\"). Extensions include maximizing a weighted sum of sender profits and receiver surplus and allowing the sender to use monetary incentives.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:volume": "118", "ex:title": "Optimal Information Disclosure", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/657922", "ex:pages": "949 - 987", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2010", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Luis Rayo"}, {"ex:name": "Ilya Segal"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "We study the effect of releasing public information about productivity or monetary shocks using a micro-founded macroeconomic model in which agents learn from the distribution of nominal prices.

We show that the negative indirect effect can dominate. Thus, the public information release may increase uncertainty about the monetary shock and reduce welfare.
