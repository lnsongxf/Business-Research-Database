[{"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "This paper develops a novel theory of marketing costs within a trade model with product differentiation and heterogeneity in firm productivities. A firm enters a market if it is profitable to incur the marginal cost to reach a single consumer. It then faces an increasing marginal penetration cost to access additional consumers. The model, therefore, can reconcile the observed positive relationship between entry and market size with the existence of many small exporters in each exporting market. Comparative statics of trade liberalization predict a large increase in trade for goods with positive but low volumes of previous trade.", "ex:volume": "118", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Market Penetration Costs and the New Consumers Margin in International Trade", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/657949", "ex:pages": "1151 - 1199", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2010", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Costas Arkolakis"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "This paper studies whether labor scarcity encourages technological advances, that is, technology adoption or innovation, for example, as claimed by Habakkuk in the context of nineteenth-century United States.

I show that labor scarcity encourages technological advances if technology is strongly labor saving and will discourage them if technology is strongly labor complementary.

In the econometric model, candidates experience momentum effects when their performance in early states exceeds expectations. The empirical application uses daily polling data from the 2004 presidential primary. We find that Kerry benefited from surprising wins in early states and took votes away from Dean. Owing to these momentum effects, early voters had up to five times the influence of late voters in the selection of candidates, and this helps to explain the distribution of advertising expenditures.
