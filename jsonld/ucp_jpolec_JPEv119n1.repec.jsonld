[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "We propose an equilibrium model that can explain a wide range of international finance puzzles, including the high correlation of international stock markets, despite the lack of correlation of fundamentals. We conduct an empirical analysis of our model, which combines cross-country-correlated long-run risk with Epstein and Zin preferences, using U.S. and U.K. data, and show that it successfully reconciles international prices and quantities, thereby solving the international equity premium puzzle.

An approximate factor model finds that nearly all of IP variability is associated with common factors. We then use a multisector growth model to adjust for the effects of input-output linkages in the factor analysis. Thus, a structural factor analysis indicates that the Great Moderation was characterized by a fall in the importance of aggregate shocks while the volatility of sectoral shocks was essentially unchanged. Consequently, the role of idiosyncratic shocks increased considerably after the mid-1980s, explaining half of the quarterly variation in IP.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:volume": "119", "ex:title": "Sectoral versus Aggregate Shocks: A Structural Factor Analysis of Industrial Production", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/659311", "ex:pages": "1 - 38", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Andrew T.
