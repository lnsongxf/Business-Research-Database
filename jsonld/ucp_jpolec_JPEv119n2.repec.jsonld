[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Electronic medical records (EMRs) facilitate fast and accurate access to patient records, which could improve diagnosis and patient monitoring. Using a 12-year county-level panel, we find that a 10 percent increase in births that occur in hospitals with EMRs reduces neonatal mortality by 16 deaths per 100,000 live births. This is driven by a reduction of deaths from conditions requiring careful monitoring. We also find a strong decrease in mortality when we instrument for EMR adoption using variation in state medical privacy laws. Rough cost-effectiveness calculations suggest that EMRs are associated with a cost of $531,000 per baby's life saved.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:volume": "119", "ex:title": "Can Health Care Information Technology Save Babies?", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/660083", "ex:pages": "289 - 324", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Amalia R.

Before elections, factions compete to direct local public goods to their local constituencies. The model of factional competition delivers a rich set of implications relating the internal organization of the party to the allocation of resources. In doing so, the model provides a unified explanation of two prominent features of public resource allocations: the persistence of (possibly inefficient) policies and the tendency of public spending to favor incumbent party strongholds over swing constituencies.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:volume": "119", "ex:title": "Factions and Political Competition", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/660298", "ex:pages": "242 - 288", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Nicola Persico"}, {"ex:name": "Jos&#x000E9; C.

Leased assets trade more frequently and produce more output than owned assets because (1) high-volatility firms are more likely to lease than low-volatility firms and (2) firms shed leased asssets faster than owned assets amid productivity shocks because of lower transaction costs. Commercial aircraft data show that leased aircraft have holding durations 38 percent shorter and fly 6.5 percent more hours than owned aircraft. These differences arise primarily because when profitability declines, carriers keep owned aircraft and return leased aircraft, which lessors redeploy to more productive operators.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:volume": "119", "ex:title": "Leasing and Secondary Markets: Theory and Evidence from Commercial Aircraft", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/660730", "ex:pages": "325 - 377", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Alessandro Gavazza"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "We study a model in which voters choose between two candidates on the basis of both ideology and competence.
