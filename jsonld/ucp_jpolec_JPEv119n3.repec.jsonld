[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "The new-Keynesian, Taylor rule theory of inflation determination relies on explosive dynamics. By raising interest rates in response to inflation, the Fed induces ever-larger inflation, unless inflation jumps to one particular value on each date. However, economics does not rule out explosive inflation, so inflation remains indeterminate. Attempts to fix this problem assume that the government will choose to blow up the economy if alternative equilibria emerge, by following policies we usually consider impossible. The Taylor rule is not identified without unrealistic assumptions. Thus, Taylor rule regressions do not show that the Fed moved from \"passive\" to \"active\" policy in 1980.", "ex:volume": "119", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Determinacy and Identification with Taylor Rules", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/660817", "ex:pages": "565 - 615", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["John H.

Productivity shocks are found to generate large fluctuations in workers' transitions, unemployment, and vacancies when matches are experience goods, but not when matches are inspection goods.", "ex:volume": "119", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Efficient Search on the Job and the Business Cycle", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/660864", "ex:pages": "468 - 510", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Guido Menzio", "Shouyong Shi"]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "The high and rising household savings rate in China is not easily reconciled with the traditional explanations that emphasize life cycle factors, the precautionary saving motive, financial development, or habit formation.

The pressure on savings spills over to other households. Both cross-regional and household-level evidence supports this hypothesis.
