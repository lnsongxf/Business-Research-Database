[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "We develop and test an economic theory of insurgency motivated by the informal literature and by recent military doctrine. We model a three-way contest between violent rebels, a government seeking to minimize violence by mixing service provision and coercion, and civilians deciding whether to share information about insurgents. We test the model using panel data from Iraq on violence against Coalition and Iraqi forces, reconstruction spending, and community characteristics (sectarian status, socioeconomic grievances, and natural resource endowments). Our results support the theory's predictions: improved service provision reduces insurgent violence, particularly for smaller projects and since the \"surge\" began in 2007.", "ex:volume": "119", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Can Hearts and Minds Be Bought?

These investment shocks generate differences in risk premia due to their heterogeneous impact on firms: they benefit firms producing investment relative to firms producing consumption goods and increase the value of growth opportunities relative to the value of existing assets. Using data on asset returns, I find that a positive investment shock leads to high marginal utility states.

We modify this requirement, first, by taking into account the status quo (given by the current wealth) and the possibility of rejecting gambles, and second, by comparing rejections that are substantive (i.e., uniform over wealth levels or over utilities). This yields two new stochastic orders: \"wealth-uniform dominance\" and \"utility-uniform dominance.\" Unlike stochastic dominance, these two orders are complete: any two gambles can be compared.

Both substitutability and complementarity generate externalities; cheaper communication eliminates externalities in the former case but not necessarily in the latter.
