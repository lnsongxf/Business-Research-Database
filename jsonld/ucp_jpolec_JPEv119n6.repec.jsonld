[{"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "This paper proposes a new mechanism for combinatorial assignment--for example, assigning schedules of courses to students--based on an approximation to competitive equilibrium from equal incomes (CEEI) in which incomes are unequal but arbitrarily close together. The main technical result is an existence theorem for approximate CEEI. The mechanism is approximately efficient, satisfies two new criteria of outcome fairness, and is strategyproof in large markets. Its performance is explored on real data, and it is compared to alternatives from theory and practice: all other known mechanisms are either unfair ex post or manipulable even in large markets, and most are both manipulable and unfair.", "ex:volume": "119", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "The Combinatorial Assignment Problem: Approximate Competitive Equilibrium from Equal Incomes", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/664613", "ex:pages": "1061 - 1103", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Eric Budish"]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "The burden of proof, a central feature of adjudication and other decision-making contexts, constitutes an important but largely unappreciated policy instrument. The optimal strength of the burden of proof, as well as optimal enforcement effort and sanctions, involves trading off deterrence and the chilling of desirable behavior, the latter being absent in previous work. The character of the optimum differs markedly from prior results and from conventional understandings of proof burdens. There are important divergences across models in which enforcement involves monitoring, investigation, and auditing. A number of extensions are analyzed, in one instance nullifying key results in prior work.", "ex:volume": "119", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "On the Optimal Burden of Proof", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/664614", "ex:pages": "1104 - 1140", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2011", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Louis Kaplow"]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "We estimate an equilibrium model of dynamic oligopoly with durable goods and endogenous innovation to examine the effect of competition on innovation in the personal computer microprocessor industry.

Our key innovation is to use changes in congressional committee chairmanships as a source of exogenous variation in state-level federal expenditures. We show that fiscal spending shocks appear to significantly dampen corporate investment activity. This retrenchment occurs within large and small states and is most pronounced among geographically concentrated firms.
