[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "This paper builds a framework for the analysis of macroeconomic fluctuations that incorporates the endogenous determination of the number of producers and products over the business cycle. Economic expansions induce higher entry rates by prospective entrants subject to sunk investment costs. The sluggish response of the number of producers generates a new and potentially important endogenous propagation mechanism for business cycle models. The return to investment determines household saving decisions, producer entry, and the allocation of labor across sectors. Our framework replicates several features of business cycles and predicts procyclical profits even for preference specifications that imply countercyclical markups.", "ex:volume": "120", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Endogenous Entry, Product Variety, and Business Cycles", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/665825", "ex:pages": "304 - 345", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Florin O.

We document this by showing that changes in Treasury supply have large effects on a variety of yield spreads. As a result, Treasury yields are reduced by 73 basis points, on average, from 1926 to 2008. Both the liquidity and safety attributes of Treasuries are driving this phenomenon. We document this by analyzing the spread between assets with different liquidity (but similar safety) and those with different safety (but similar liquidity). The low yield on Treasuries due to their extreme safety and liquidity suggests that Treasuries in important respects are similar to money.", "ex:volume": "120", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "The Aggregate Demand for Treasury Debt", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/666526", "ex:pages": "233 - 267", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Arvind Krishnamurthy", "Annette Vissing-Jorgensen"]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "I show that the pricing of a broad class of long-dated assets is driven by the possibility of extraordinarily bad news.

In the data, when interest rate spreads rise, debt maturity shortens and the spread on short-term bonds rises more than the spread on long-term bonds. We build a dynamic model of international borrowing with endogenous default and multiple debt maturities. Long-term debt provides a hedge against future fluctuations in spreads, whereas short-term debt is more effective at providing incentives to repay. The trade-off between these hedging and incentive benefits is quantitatively important for understanding the maturity structure in emerging markets.", "ex:volume": "120", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Default and the Maturity Structure in Sovereign Bonds", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/666589", "ex:pages": "187 - 232", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Cristina Arellano", "Ananth Ramanarayanan"]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "We construct a simple model, consistent with Becker and Tomes, that decomposes the intergenerational income elasticity into the causal effect of financial resources, the mechanistic transmission of human capital, and the role that human capital plays in the determination of fathers' permanent incomes.
