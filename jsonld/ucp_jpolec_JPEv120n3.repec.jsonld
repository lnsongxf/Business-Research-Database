[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "This paper demonstrates that the option to move in and out of the parental home is a valuable insurance channel against labor market risk, which facilitates the pursuit of jobs with the potential for high earnings growth. Using monthly panel data, I document an empirical relationship among coresidence, individual labor market events, and subsequent earnings growth. I estimate the parameters of a dynamic game between youths and parents to show that the option to live at home can account for features of aggregate data for low-skilled young workers: small consumption responses to shocks, high labor elasticities, and low savings rates.", "ex:volume": "120", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Moving Back Home: Insurance against Labor Market Risk", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/666588", "ex:pages": "446 - 512", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Greg Kaplan"}]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "We examine a dynamic model of up-or-down problem solving.

Authorities may not want to stand by and watch banks collapse. However, unconstrained direct bailouts undermine the disciplinary role of deposits.

By contrast, constrained central bank intervention to lower rates maintains private discipline, while offsetting contractual rigidity. It may still lead banks to make excessive liquidity promises.

We elicit parents' choices between monthly government transfers conditional on their adolescent child attending school and guaranteed, unconditional transfers of varying sizes. In the baseline treatment, an overwhelming majority of parents prefer conditional transfers to larger unconditional transfers. However, few parents prefer conditional payments if they are offered text message notifications whenever their child misses school. These findings suggest important intergenerational conflicts in these schooling decisions, a lack of parental control and observability of school attendance, and an additional rationale for conditional cash transfer programs--the monitoring they provide.", "ex:volume": "120", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "The Schooling Decision: Family Preferences, Intergenerational Conflict, and Moral Hazard in the Brazilian Favelas", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/666746", "ex:pages": "359 - 397", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Leonardo Bursztyn"}, {"ex:name": "Lucas C.
