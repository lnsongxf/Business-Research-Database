[{"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "We construct a marriage market model of matching along multiple dimensions, some of which are unobservable, in which individual preferences can be summarized by a one-dimensional index combining the various characteristics. We show that, under testable assumptions, these indices are ordinally identified and that the male and female trade-offs between their partners' characteristics are overidentified.

Our explanation features decreasing returns to scale: As the industry's size increases, every manager's ability to outperform passive benchmarks declines. The poor track record occurred before the growth of indexing modestly reduced the share of active management to its current size. At this size, better performance is expected by investors who believe in decreasing returns to scale. Such beliefs persist because persistence in industry size causes learning about returns to scale to be slow. The industry should shrink only moderately if its underperformance continues.", "ex:volume": "120", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "On the Size of the Active Management Industry", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/667987", "ex:pages": "740 - 781", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["&#x0013D;ubo&#x00161; P&#x000E1;stor", "Robert F.
