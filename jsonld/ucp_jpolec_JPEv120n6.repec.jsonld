We study a model with heterogeneous firms that are subject to idiosyncratic firm-specific shocks, calibrated to data for the 50 largest economies in the world. When the firm size distribution follows a power law with an exponent close to minus one, idiosyncratic shocks to large firms have an impact on aggregate volatility. Smaller countries have fewer firms and, thus, higher volatility. Trade opening makes the large firms more important, thus raising macroeconomic volatility. Trade can increase aggregate volatility by 15-20 percent in some small open economies.", "ex:volume": "120", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Country Size, International Trade, and Aggregate Fluctuations in Granular Economies", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/669161", "ex:pages": "1083 - 1132", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Julian di Giovanni"}, {"ex:name": "Andrei A.

We rule out the subject pool and the laboratory setting as potential causes and identify the type of activity involved as the source of the lack of cooperation in our field experiment.

This paper tests how accurately theoretical models of dynamic pricing describe sellers' behavior in secondary markets for event tickets, a classic example of a perishable good. It shows that the simplest dynamic pricing models describe very accurately both the pricing problem faced by sellers and how they behave, explaining why sellers cut prices dramatically, by 40 percent or more, as an event approaches. The estimates also imply that dynamic pricing is valuable, raising the average seller's expected payoff by around 16 percent.", "ex:volume": "120", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Dynamic Pricing Behavior in Perishable Goods Markets: Evidence from Secondary Markets for Major League Baseball Tickets", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/669254", "ex:pages": "1133 - 1172", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2012", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Andrew Sweeting"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "Most new consumer durable goods experience rapid prices declines and quality improvements, suggesting the importance of modeling dynamics.
