[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "This paper quantifies the gains from openness arising from trade and multinational production (MP). We present a model that captures key dimensions of the interaction between these two flows: trade and MP are competing ways to serve a foreign market, MP relies on imports of intermediate goods from the home country, and foreign affiliates of multinationals can export part of their output. The calibrated model implies that the gains from trade can be twice as high as the gains calculated in trade-only models, while the gains from MP are slightly lower than the gains computed in MP-only models.", "ex:volume": "121", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Trade, Multinational Production, and the Gains from Openness", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/670136", "ex:pages": "273 - 322", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Natalia Ramondo"}, {"ex:name": "Andr&#x000E9;s Rodr&#x000ED;guez-Clare"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "I study a model of mobilization and rebel tactical choice. Rebel leaders choose between conventional tactics that are heavily reliant on mobilization, irregular tactics that are less so, and withdrawal from conflict. The model yields the following results, among others. Increased nonviolent opportunity has a nonmonotone effect on the use of irregular tactics. Conflict has option value, so irregular campaigns last longer than the rebels' short-term interest dictates, especially in volatile military environments. By demonstrating lack of rebel capacity and diminishing mobilization, successful counterinsurgencies may increase irregular violence. Conflict begets conflict by eroding outside options, thereby increasing mobilization.", "ex:volume": "121", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Rebel Tactics", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/670137", "ex:pages": "323 - 357", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Ethan Bueno de Mesquita"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Child sponsorship is a leading form of direct aid from wealthy country households to children in developing countries.
