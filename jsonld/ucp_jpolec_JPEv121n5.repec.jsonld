[{"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "We introduce a model in which agents in a network can trade via bilateral contracts. We find that when continuous transfers are allowed and utilities are quasi-linear, the full substitutability of preferences is sufficient to guarantee the existence of stable outcomes for any underlying network structure. Furthermore, the set of stable outcomes is essentially equivalent to the set of competitive equilibria, and all stable outcomes are in the core and are efficient. By contrast, for any domain of preferences strictly larger than that of full substitutability, the existence of stable outcomes and competitive equilibria cannot be guaranteed.", "ex:volume": "121", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Stability and Competitive Equilibrium in Trading Networks", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/673402", "ex:pages": "966 - 1005", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "John William Hatfield"}, {"ex:name": "Scott Duke Kominers"}, {"ex:name": "Alexandru Nichifor"}, {"ex:name": "Michael Ostrovsky"}, {"ex:name": "Alexander Westkamp"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "This paper studies models of credit with limited commitment and, therefore, endogenous debt limits.

An attribute is salient for a good when it stands out among the good's attributes relative to that attribute's average level in the choice set (or, more broadly, the choice context). Consumers attach disproportionately high weight to salient attributes, and their choices are tilted toward goods with higher quality/price ratios.
