When IP is appropriable, a market for inventions forms and competitive pressures increase incentives to innovate. Competition among producers, the demand side of the market for inventions, and competition among inventors, the supply side of the market for inventions, create incentives to innovate. When IP is not fully appropriable, markets for inventions are limited and competitive pressures can decrease incentives to innovate. Firms vertically integrate R&D and production and share technology to appropriate the returns to IP. This implies that antitrust policy and IP protections are complements.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:volume": "121", "ex:title": "How Do Competitive Pressures Affect Incentives to Innovate When There Is a Market for Inventions?", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/674134", "ex:pages": "1007 - 1054", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Daniel F.

We study this problem in the context of a directed search model of the labor market populated by homogeneous workers and heterogeneous firms. The optimal redistribution can be attained using a positive unemployment benefit and an increasing and regressive labor income tax. The positive unemployment benefit serves the purpose of lowering the search risk faced by workers. The increasing and regressive labor tax serves the purpose of aligning the cost to the firm of attracting an additional applicant with the value of an application to society.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:volume": "121", "ex:title": "Taxation and Redistribution of Residual Income Inequality", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/674135", "ex:pages": "1160 - 1204", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Mikhail Golosov"}, {"ex:name": "Pricila Maziero"}, {"ex:name": "Guido Menzio"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "We study the cyclical implications of credit market imperfections in a quantitative dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium model wherein firms face persistent shocks to aggregate and individual productivity. In our model economy, optimal capital reallocation is distorted by two frictions: collateralized borrowing and partial investment irreversibility. We find that a negative shock to borrowing conditions can, on its own, generate a large and persistent recession through disruptions to the distribution of capital. This recession, and the subsequent recovery, is distinguished both quantitatively and qualitatively from that driven by an exogenous shock to total factor productivity.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:volume": "121", "ex:title": "Credit Shocks and Aggregate Fluctuations in an Economy with Production Heterogeneity", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/674142", "ex:pages": "1055 - 1107", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Aubhik Khan"}, {"ex:name": "Julia K.

Equilibrium portfolios are biased toward domestic assets because endogenous international relative price fluctuations make domestic assets a good hedge against labor income risk.
