[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "The least productive agents in an economy can be vital in generating growth by spurring technology diffusion. We develop an analytically tractable model in which growth is created as a positive externality from risk taking by firms at the bottom of the productivity distribution imitating more productive firms. Heterogeneous firms choose to produce or pay a cost and search within the economy to upgrade their technology. Sustained growth comes from the feedback between the endogenously determined distribution of productivity, as evolved from past search decisions, and an optimal, forward-looking search policy. The growth rate depends on characteristics of the productivity distribution, with a thicker-tailed distribution leading to more growth.", "ex:volume": "122", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Equilibrium Imitation and Growth", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/674362", "ex:pages": "52 - 76", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Jesse Perla"}, {"ex:name": "Christopher Tonetti"}]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "We analyze a model economy with many agents, each with a different productivity level. Agents divide their time between two activities: producing goods with the production-related knowledge they already have and interacting with others in search of new, productivity-increasing ideas. These choices jointly determine the economy's current production level and its rate of learning and real growth. We construct the balanced growth path for this economy. We also study the allocation chosen by an idealized planner who takes into account and internalizes the external benefits of search. Finally, we provide three examples of alternative learning technologies and show that the properties of equilibrium allocations are quite sensitive to two of these variations.", "ex:volume": "122", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Knowledge Growth and the Allocation of Time", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/674363", "ex:pages": "1 - 51", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Robert E.
