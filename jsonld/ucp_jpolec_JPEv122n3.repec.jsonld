[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "Large cities produce more output per capita than small cities. This higher productivity may occur because more talented individuals sort into large cities, because large cities select more productive entrepreneurs and firms, or because of agglomeration economies. We develop a model of systems of cities that combines all three elements and suggests interesting complementarities between them. The model can replicate stylized facts about sorting, agglomeration, and selection in cities. It also generates Zipf's law for cities under empirically plausible parameter values. Finally, it provides a useful framework within which to reinterpret extant empirical evidence.", "ex:volume": "122", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Productive Cities: Sorting, Selection, and Agglomeration", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/675534", "ex:pages": "507 - 553", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Kristian Behrens"}, {"ex:name": "Gilles Duranton"}, {"ex:name": "Fr&#x000E9;d&#x000E9;ric Robert-Nicoud"}]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "We study business cycle variation in individual earnings risk using a confidential and very large data set from the US Social Security Administration. Contrary to past research, we find that the variance of idiosyncratic shocks is not countercyclical. Instead, it is the left-skewness of shocks that is strongly countercyclical: during recessions, large upward earnings movements become less likely, whereas large drops in earnings become more likely. Second, we find that the fortunes during recessions are predictable by observable characteristics before the recession. Finally, the cyclicality of earnings risk is dramatically different for the top 1 percent compared with the rest of the population.", "ex:volume": "122", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "The Nature of Countercyclical Income Risk", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/675535", "ex:pages": "621 - 660", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Fatih Guvenen"}, {"ex:name": "Serdar Ozkan"}, {"ex:name": "Jae Song"}]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "We measure the capitalization of housing market externalities into residential housing values by studying the unanticipated elimination of stringent rent controls in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1995.

The nature of the complementarities determines the equilibrium skill distribution across cities. With extreme-skill complementarity, the skill distribution has thicker tails in large cities; with top-skill complementarity, there is first-order stochastic dominance. Using wage and housing price data, we find robust evidence of thick tails in large cities: large cities disproportionately attract both high- and low-skilled workers, while average skills are constant across city size. This pattern of spatial sorting is consistent with extreme-skill complementarity, where the productivity of high-skilled workers and of the providers of low-skilled services are mutually enhanced.", "ex:volume": "122", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Spatial Sorting", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/676141", "ex:pages": "554 - 620", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Jan Eeckhout"}, {"ex:name": "Roberto Pinheiro"}, {"ex:name": "Kurt Schmidheiny"}]}]
