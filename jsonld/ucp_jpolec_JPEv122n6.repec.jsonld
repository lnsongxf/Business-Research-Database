We propose a simple model that captures these features, conveying new insights. A firm's price can deflect or draw attention to its market, and consequently, limited attention introduces a new dimension of cross-market competition. We characterize the equilibrium and show that having partially attentive consumers improves consumer welfare. With less attention, consumers are more likely to miss the best offers; but enhanced cross-market competition decreases average price paid, as leading firms try to stay under the consumers' radar.", "ex:volume": "122", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Competing for Consumer Inattention", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/677253", "ex:pages": "1203 - 1234", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Geoffroy de Clippel"}, {"ex:name": "Kfir Eliaz"}, {"ex:name": "Kareen Rozen"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "This study explores the tension between the standard economic theory of preference and nonstandard theories of preference that are motivated by an underlying theory of framing.

Most of this disparity can be explained by prosecutors' initial charging decisions, particularly the filing of charges carrying mandatory minimum sentences.
