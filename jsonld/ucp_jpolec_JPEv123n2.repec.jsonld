[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "This paper evaluates the impact of three different performance incentive schemes using data from a social experiment that randomized 88 Mexican high schools with over 40,000 students into three treatment groups and a control group. Treatment 1 provides individual incentives for performance on curriculum-based mathematics tests to students only, treatment 2 to teachers only, and treatment 3 gives both individual and group incentives to students, teachers, and school administrators. Program impact estimates reveal the largest average effects for treatment 3, smaller impacts for treatment 1, and no impact for treatment 2.", "ex:volume": "123", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Aligning Learning Incentives of Students and Teachers: Results from a Social Experiment in Mexican High Schools", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/675910", "ex:pages": "325 - 364", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Jere R.

This is a theoretical and econometric exercise as the analysis is linked to a rigorously delineated model of interdependent decisions.

We consider identification of both endogenous and contextual social effects under alternative assumptions regarding an analyst's a priori knowledge of social structure or access to individual-level or aggregate data. Finally, we discuss potential ramifications for identification of endogenous formation of social structure.", "ex:volume": "123", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Linear Social Interactions Models", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/679496", "ex:pages": "444 - 496", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Lawrence E.

We use the formula to investigate the cream skimming effect of hypothetical voucher programs on the high school graduation rate and other outcomes of the students who would remain in public school.

Proponents of these policies contend that employment impacts are negligible and suggest that consumers pay for higher labor costs through imperceptible increases in goods prices. Adopting this empirical scenario, the analysis demonstrates that an increase in the national minimum wage produces a value-added tax effect on consumer prices that is more regressive than a typical state sales tax and allocates benefits as higher earnings nearly evenly across the income distribution.
