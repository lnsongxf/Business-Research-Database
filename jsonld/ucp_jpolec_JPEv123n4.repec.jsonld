This implicitly assumes a criterion that tests beliefs against the observed outcomes generated by the model. We formalize this requirement in stationary environments. We show that there is a tension between requiring that beliefs can be tested against systematic errors and allowing agents to disagree or be uncertain about the long-run fundamentals.

The Panic of 1907 originated in the shadow banks of the time, New York's trust companies. The runs were caused by a shock unrelated to the trust companies' nonfinancial corporate clients. In the years following the panic, corporations affiliated with the worst-affected trusts made fewer capital investments, paid lower dividends, and suffered lower profitability and higher borrowing costs relative to firms without such connections. The shock to New York's trust companies accounted for at least 18.4 percent of the decline in corporate investment in the United States in 1908.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:volume": "123", "ex:title": "Economic Effects of Runs on Early \"Shadow Banks\": Trust Companies and the Impact of the Panic of 1907", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/681575", "ex:pages": "902 - 940", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Carola Frydman"}, {"ex:name": "Eric Hilt"}, {"ex:name": "Lily Y.

The choice of trade finance terms balances the risk that an importer defaults on an exporter and the possibility that an exporter does not deliver goods as specified.
