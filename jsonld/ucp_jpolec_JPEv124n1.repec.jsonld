[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "We analyze participation in international environmental agreements in a dynamic game in which countries pollute and invest in green technologies. If complete contracts are feasible, participants eliminate the holdup problem associated with their investments; however, most countries prefer to free ride rather than participate. If investments are noncontractible, countries face a holdup problem every time they negotiate; but the free-rider problem can be mitigated and significant participation is feasible. Participation becomes attractive because only large coalitions commit to long-term agreements that circumvent the holdup problem. Under well-specified conditions even the first-best outcome is possible when the contract is incomplete.", "ex:volume": "124", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Participation and Duration of Environmental Agreements", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/684478", "ex:pages": "160 - 204", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Marco Battaglini", "B&#x000E5;rd Harstad"]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "We assess the static and dynamic implications of alternative market-based policies limiting greenhouse gas emissions in the US cement industry. Our results highlight two countervailing market distortions. First, emissions regulation exacerbates distortions associated with the exercise of market power in the domestic cement market. Second, emissions \"leakage\" in trade-exposed markets offsets domestic emissions reductions. Taken together, these forces can result in social welfare losses under policy regimes that fully internalize the emissions externality. Market-based policies that incorporate design features to mitigate the exercise of market power and emissions leakage deliver welfare gains when damages from carbon emissions are high.", "ex:volume": "124", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Market-Based Emissions Regulation and Industry Dynamics", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/684484", "ex:pages": "249 - 302", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": ["Meredith Fowlie", "Mar Reguant", "Stephen P.

Second, the diffusion of residential air conditioning explains essentially the entire decline in hot day-related fatalities.
