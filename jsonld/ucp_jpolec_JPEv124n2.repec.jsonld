[{"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Many macroeconomists argue that productivity is low in developing countries because of frictions that impede the adoption of modern technologies. I argue that in the retail trade sector, developing countries rationally choose technologies with low measured labor productivity. My theory is that the adoption of modern retail technologies is optimal only when household ownership of complementary durable goods, such as cars, is widespread. Because income is low in the developing world, households own few such durables. The theory implies that policies that increase measured retail productivity do not necessarily increase welfare.", "ex:volume": "124", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Explaining Cross-Country Productivity Differences in Retail Trade", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/684718", "ex:pages": "579 - 620", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "David Lagakos"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Some technologies save lives&#x02014;new vaccines, new surgical techniques, safer highways.

How is growth theory altered when technologies involve life and death instead of just higher consumption? This paper shows that taking life into account has first-order consequences. Under standard preferences, the value of life may rise faster than consumption, leading society to value safety over consumption growth.

Competition for talent leads to an escalation of performance pay, shifting effort away from long-term investments, risk management, and cooperation. Efficiency losses can exceed those from a single principal, who dulls incentives to extract rents. As competition intensifies, monopsonistic underincentivization of low-skill agents first decreases and then gives way to growing overincentivization of high-skill ones. Aggregate welfare is thus hill-shaped, while inequality tends to rise monotonically. Bonus caps can help restore balance in incentives but may generate other distortions.", "ex:volume": "124", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Bonus Culture: Competitive Pay, Screening, and Multitasking", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/684853", "ex:pages": "305 - 370", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Roland B&#xe9;nabou"}, {"ex:name": "Jean Tirole"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "This paper shows that adding a small application cost to a transfer program can substantially improve targeting through self-selection.
