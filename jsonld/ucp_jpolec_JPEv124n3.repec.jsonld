[{"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "We propose a theory of self-fulfilling unemployment fluctuations. When a firm increases its workforce, it raises demand and weakens competition facing other firms, as employed workers spend more and have less time to search for low prices than unemployed workers. These effects induce other firms to hire more labor in order to scale up their presence in the product market. The feedback between employment and product market conditions generates multiple equilibria&#x02014;and the possibility of self-fulfilling fluctuations&#x02014;if differences in shopping behavior between employed and unemployed are large enough. Evidence on spending, shopping, and prices suggests that this is the case.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:volume": "124", "ex:title": "Shopping Externalities and Self-Fulfilling Unemployment Fluctuations", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/685909", "ex:pages": "771 - 825", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Greg Kaplan"}, {"ex:name": "Guido Menzio"}]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "I investigate how teamwork may reduce moral hazard by joint monitoring and management.

Both are simultaneously determined by countries' capabilities, that is, by countries' productivity and quality levels for each good. Our theoretical setup has two features. (1) Some goods have fewer high-quality producers/countries than others, meaning that there is comparative advantage. (2) Imperfect competition allows high- and low-quality producers to coexist.
