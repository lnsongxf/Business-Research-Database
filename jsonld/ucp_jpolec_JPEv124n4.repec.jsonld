Each period, the profit-maximizing mechanism awards units to the buyers with the highest valuations exceeding a sequence of cutoffs. We show that these cutoffs are deterministic, depending only on the inventory and time remaining; in the continuous-time limit, the optimal mechanism can be implemented by posting anonymous prices. When incoming demand decreases over time, the optimal cutoffs satisfy a one-period-look-ahead property and prices are defined by an intuitive differential equation.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:volume": "124", "ex:title": "Revenue Management with Forward-Looking Buyers", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/686713", "ex:pages": "1046 - 1087", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Simon Board"}, {"ex:name": "Andrzej Skrzypacz"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Some booms in housing prices are followed by busts.

News of a future sovereign default hampers financial intermediation. First, it tightens the funding constraints of banks, reducing their resources to finance firms (liquidity channel). Second, it generates a precautionary motive to deleverage (risk channel). I estimate the model using Italian data, finding that sovereign risk was recessionary and that the risk channel was sizable. I also use the model to measure the effects of subsidized long-term loans to banks.
