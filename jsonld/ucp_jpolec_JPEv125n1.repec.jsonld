[{"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "This paper studies a quantitative general equilibrium model of housing. The model has two key elements not previously considered in existing quantitative macro studies of housing finance: aggregate business cycle risk and a realistic wealth distribution driven in the model by bequest heterogeneity in preferences. These features of the model play a crucial role in the following results. First, a relaxation of financing constraints leads to a large boom in house prices. Second, the boom in house prices is entirely the result of a decline in the housing risk premium. Third, low interest rates cannot explain high home values.", "ex:volume": "125", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "The Macroeconomic Effects of Housing Wealth, Housing Finance, and Limited Risk Sharing in General Equilibrium", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/689606", "ex:pages": "140 - 223", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2017", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Jack Favilukis"}, {"ex:name": "Sydney C.

First, the tax rates adopted by different countries are generally uncorrelated with their growth performance. Second, countries that drastically reduce private incentives to invest severely hurt their growth performance. In our model, the effects of taxation on growth are highly nonlinear. Low tax rates have a very small impact on long-run growth rates. But as tax rates rise, their negative impact on growth rises dramatically. The median voter chooses tax rates that have a small impact on growth prospects, making the relation between tax rates and economic growth difficult to measure empirically.", "ex:volume": "125", "ex:source": "Journal of Political Economy", "ex:title": "Nonlinear Effects of Taxation on Growth", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/689607", "ex:pages": "265 - 291", "ex:year": "", "ex:date": "2017", "ex:keyword": [], "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Nir Jaimovich"}, {"ex:name": "Sergio Rebelo"}]}, {"ex:issue": "1", "ex:abstract": "We study the distributional consequences of trade in a world with two industries and two heterogeneous factors of production.
