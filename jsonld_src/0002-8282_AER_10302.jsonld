In our model, the optimal policy of an antitrust authority that seeks to maximize expected consumer surplus imposes a tougher standard on \"larger\" mergers, i.e., those involving firms with a larger pre-merger market share. The optimal policy is a response to a bias in firms' proposal incentives: firms always propose a larger merger when it is better for consumers than a smaller one, but sometimes will propose the larger one even when it is worse for consumers."}, {"e:author": ["Felix Kubler", "Larry Selden", "Xiao Wei"], "e:volume": "103", "e:url": "http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.103.2.1034", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1034-53", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.103.2.1034", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Inferior Good and Giffen Behavior for Investing and Borrowing", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "The standard assumption that asset demand increases in income and decreases in price has its origin in Arrow's classic model with one risky and one risk free asset, where both are held long, and preferences exhibit decreasing absolute and increasing relative risk aversion. However if one allows shorting of the risk free asset or decreasing relative risk aversion, the risk free asset can not only fail to be a normal good but can be a Giffen good. This behavior can occur even for members of the popular HARA utility family.

We fully characterize the solicitation strategy that maximizes donations net of fund-raising costs. It is optimal for the fund-raiser to target only the \"net contributors\" -- donors who would give more than their solicitation costs. We show that as the income inequality increases, so does the level of the public good, despite a (potentially) non-monotonic fund-raising strategy. This implies that costly fund-raising can provide a novel explanation for the non-neutrality of income redistributions and government grants often found in empirical studies."}]
