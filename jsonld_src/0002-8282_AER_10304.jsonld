I analyze subgame perfect equilibrium in this model when the economic variable follows a linear growth trend with noise. Equilibrium is essentially unique and stationary, bearing a subtle formal relation to optimal search models. Policy makers tend to act during crises, display risk aversion conditional on acting, and prefer interventions that induce permanent noise."}, {"e:author": ["James Cloyne"], "e:volume": "103", "e:url": "http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/ds/june2013/20111351_ds.zip", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1507-28", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/ds/june2013/20111351_ds.zip", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Discretionary Tax Changes and the Macroeconomy: New Narrative Evidence from the United Kingdom", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "This paper provides new estimates of the macroeconomic effects of tax changes using a new narrative dataset for the United Kingdom.
