A systematic increase in interest rates in response to a growing bubble is shown to enhance the fluctuations in the latter, through its positive effect on bubble growth. The optimal monetary policy seeks to strike a balance between stabilization of the bubble and stabilization of aggregate demand. The paper's main findings call into question the theoretical foundations of the case for \"leaning against the wind\" monetary policies."}, {"e:author": ["Emi Nakamura", "J?n Steinsson"], "e:volume": "104", "e:url": "http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/ds/10403/20111109_ds.zip", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "753-92", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/ds/10403/20111109_ds.zip", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Fiscal Stimulus in a Monetary Union: Evidence from US Regions", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "We use rich historical data on military procurement to estimate the effects of government spending. We exploit regional variation in military build-ups to estimate an \"open economy relative multiplier\" of approximately 1.5.

The latter is highly sensitive to how strongly aggregate monetary and tax policy \"leans against the wind.\" Our open economy relative multiplier \"differences out\" these effects because monetary and tax policies are uniform across the nation.
