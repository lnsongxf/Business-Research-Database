During the same period we have also observed a significant liberalization of international financial markets. We propose a multi-country model with incomplete markets and show that governments may choose higher levels of debt when financial markets become internationally integrated. We also show that public debt increases with the volatility of uninsurable income (idiosyncratic risk). To the extent that the increase in income inequality observed in some industrialized countries has been associated with higher idiosyncratic risk, the paper suggests another potential mechanism for the rise in public debt."}, {"e:author": ["Christopher P.

Signals that are more likely to be observed after unusual events may increase both uncertainty and disagreement among agents. In a simple business cycle model, such signals can explain why we observe (i) occasional large changes in macro economic aggregate variables without a correspondingly large change in underlying fundamentals (ii) persistent periods of high macroeconomic volatility and (iii) a positive correlation between absolute changes in macro variables and the cross-sectional dispersion of survey expectations."}, {"e:author": ["Cosmin L.

Shocks to confidence about future TFP are modeled as changes in ambiguity. To assess the size of those shocks, our estimation uses not only data on standard macro variables, but also incorporates the dispersion of survey forecasts about growth as a measure of confidence. Our main result is that TFP and confidence shocks together can explain roughly two thirds of business cycle frequency movements in the major macro aggregates. Confidence shocks account for about 70% of this variation."}, {"e:author": ["Ilan Guttman", "Ilan Kremer", "Andrzej Skrzypacz"], "e:volume": "104", "e:url": "http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/ds/10408/20120468_ds.zip", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "2400-2420", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "8", "e:doi": "http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/ds/10408/20120468_ds.zip", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Not Only What but Also When: A Theory of Dynamic Voluntary Disclosure", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "We examine a dynamic model of voluntary disclosure of multiple pieces of private information. In our model, a manager of a firm who may learn multiple signals over time interacts with a competitive capital market and maximizes payoffs that increase in both period prices.

We then provide direct evidence that the spatial distribution of population relative to the capital affects different accountability mechanisms: newspapers cover state politics more when readers are closer to the capital, voters who live far from the capital are less knowledgeable and interested in state politics, and they turn out less in state elections. We also find that isolated capitals are associated with more money in state-level campaigns, and worse public good provision."}, {"e:author": ["Ralf Martin", "Mirabelle Mu?ls", "Laure B. de Preux", "Ulrich J.

We formalize this fundamental economic logic and apply it to analyzing compensation rules proposed under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, where emission permits are allocated free of charge to carbon intensive and trade exposed industries. We show that this practice results in substantial overcompensation for given carbon leakage risk. Efficient permit allocation reduces the aggregate risk of job loss by more than half without increasing aggregate compensation."}, {"e:author": ["Maarten Goos", "Alan Manning", "Anna Salomons"], "e:volume": "104", "e:url": "http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/ds/10408/20111536_ds.zip", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "2509-26", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "8", "e:doi": "http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/ds/10408/20111536_ds.zip", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Explaining Job Polarization: Routine-Biased Technological Change and Offshoring", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "This paper documents the pervasiveness of job polarization in 16 Western European countries over the period 1993-2010.

When the plaintiff has private information about damages, we find that the optimal (plaintiff-funder) loan induces all plaintiff types to make the same demand, resulting in full settlement; implementation may entail a very high repayment amount. Plaintiffs' attorneys with contingent-fee compensation benefit from such financing, as it eliminates trial costs. When the defendant has private information about his likelihood of being found liable, we find that the likelihood of settlement is unaffected. In both settings the defendant's incentive for care-taking is unaffected."}, {"e:author": ["Robert W.

To identify racial interactions we estimate models that include both student and classroom fixed effects and focus on students with limited choice in courses. We find that the performance gap in terms of class dropout rates and grade performance between white and underrepresented minority students falls by 20 to 50 percent when taught by an underrepresented minority instructor. We also find these interactions affect longer term outcomes such as subsequent course selection, retention, and degree completion."}]
