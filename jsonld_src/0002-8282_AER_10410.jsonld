We analyze a model with two parties allocating a fixed budget to a public good and private transfers each period over an infinite horizon. We compare two institutions that differ in whether public good spending is discretionary or mandatory. We model mandatory spending as an endogenous status quo since it is enacted by law and remains in effect until changed. Mandatory programs result in higher public good spending; furthermore, they ex ante Pareto dominate discretionary programs when parties are patient, persistence of power is low, and polarization is low."}, {"e:author": ["Geoffroy de Clippel"], "e:volume": "104", "e:url": "http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/ds/10410/20120787_ds.zip", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "2975-3002", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "10", "e:doi": "http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/ds/10410/20120787_ds.zip", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Behavioral Implementation", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "Implementation theory assumes that participants' choices are rational,"}, {"e:author": ["Hunt Allcott", "Todd Rogers"], "e:volume": "104", "e:url": "http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/ds/10410/20131161_ds.zip", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "3003-37", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "10", "e:doi": "http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/ds/10410/20131161_ds.zip", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "The Short-Run and Long-Run Effects of Behavioral Interventions: Experimental Evidence from Energy Conservation", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "We document three remarkable features of the Opower program, in"}, {"e:author": ["Michael Greenstone", "Rema Hanna"], "e:volume": "104", "e:url": "http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/ds/10410/20110832_ds.zip", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "3038-72", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "10", "e:doi": "http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/ds/10410/20110832_ds.zip", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Environmental Regulations, Air and Water Pollution, and Infant Mortality in India", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "Using the most comprehensive developing country dataset ever"}, {"e:author": ["Matthew Gentzkow", "Jesse M.

Since interest rates are determined through a search and negotiation process, consolidation weakens consumers' bargaining positions. We use reduced-form techniques to estimate the mergers' distributional impact, and show that competition benefits only consumers at the bottom and middle of the transaction price distribution, and that mergers reduce the dispersion of prices. We illustrate that these effects can be explained by the presence of search frictions, and that the average effect of mergers on rates underestimates the increase in market power."}]
