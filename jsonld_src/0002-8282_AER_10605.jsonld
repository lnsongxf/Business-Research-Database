Better institutions, a more business friendly environment and lower barriers to trade and investment amplify the positive impact of R&D spending on MFP.

First, gender gaps in employment rates, earnings, and college attendance vary substantially across the parental income distribution. Notably, the traditional gender gap in employment rates is reversed for children growing up in poor families: boys in families in the bottom quintile of the income distribution are less likely to work than girls. Second, these gender gaps vary substantially across counties and commuting zones in which children grow up. The degree of variation in outcomes across places is largest for boys growing up in poor, single-parent families. Third, the spatial variation in gender gaps is highly correlated with proxies for neighborhood disadvantage. Low-income boys who grow up in high-poverty, high-minority areas work significantly less than girls. These areas also have higher rates of crime, suggesting that boys growing up in concentrated poverty substitute from formal employment to crime.

We compare the distributions of wealth over time of people whose parent died and those whose parent did not. Bequests account for 26 percent of the average post-bequest wealth 1-3 years after parental death and significantly affect wealth throughout the distribution. Bequests increase absolute wealth inequality (variance of the distribution censored at the top/bottom 1% increases by 33 percent), but reduce relative inequality (the top 1% share declines by 6 percentage points from the base of 31 percent)."}, {"e:author": ["Robert Gordon", "David Joulfaian", "James Poterba"], "e:volume": "106", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/ds/10605/P2016_1037_ds.zip", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "662-67", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/ds/10605/P2016_1037_ds.zip", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Revenue and Incentive Effects of Basis Step-Up at Death: Lessons from the 2010 \"Voluntary\" Estate Tax Regime", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "In 2010, the U.S. estate tax expired and executors of wealthy decedents were not required to file estate tax returns. In the absence of the estate tax, beneficiaries received assets with carryover rather than stepped-up basis. Unrealized capital gains accounted for 44 percent of the fair market value of non-cash assets in estates that chose the carryover basis regime, and an even higher percentage for some asset categories. Many of the largest gains were on assets that had been held for at least two decades."}, {"e:author": ["Peter L.
