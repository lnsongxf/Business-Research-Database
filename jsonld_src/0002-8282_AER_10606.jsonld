Evidence from the American Mathematics Competitions", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "This paper uses data from the American Mathematics Competitions to examine the rates at which different high schools produce high-achieving math students. There are large differences in the frequency with which students from seemingly similar schools reach high achievement levels. The distribution of unexplained school effects includes a thick tail of schools that produce many more high-achieving students than is typical. Several additional analyses suggest that the differences are not primarily due to unobserved differences in student characteristics. The differences are persistent across time, suggesting that differences in the effectiveness of educational programs are not primarily due to direct peer effects."}, {"e:author": ["Bryan Kelly", "Hanno Lustig", "Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh"], "e:volume": "106", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=XLbyLK-J4SBhFu3eaic4EFoBbkq0jXqU", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1278-1319", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=XLbyLK-J4SBhFu3eaic4EFoBbkq0jXqU", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Too-Systemic-to-Fail: What Option Markets Imply about Sector-Wide Government Guarantees", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "We examine the pricing of financial crash insurance during the 2007-2009 financial crisis in US option markets, and we show that a large amount of aggregate tail risk is missing from the cost of financial sector crash insurance during the crisis.

This paper studies China's rising domestic content in exports using firm- and customs transaction-level data. The approach embraces firm heterogeneity and hence reduces aggregation bias. The study finds that the substitution of domestic for imported materials by individual processing exporters caused China's domestic content in exports to increase from 65 to 70 percent in the period 2000-2007. Such substitution was induced by the country's trade and investment liberalization, which deepened its engagement in global value chains and led to a greater variety of domestic materials becoming available at lower prices."}, {"e:author": ["Vojtěch Bartoš", "Michal Bauer", "Julie Chytilová", "Filip Matějka"], "e:volume": "106", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=ksQsmIf7-uNd6KnhRM4FoS--FDd_Ctya", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1437-75", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=ksQsmIf7-uNd6KnhRM4FoS--FDd_Ctya", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Attention Discrimination: Theory and Field Experiments with Monitoring Information Acquisition", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "We integrate tools to monitor information acquisition in field experiments on discrimination and examine whether gaps arise already when decision makers choose the effort level for reading an application.

Both results are consistent with a model of endogenous allocation of costly attention, which magnifies the role of prior beliefs and preferences beyond the one considered in standard models of discrimination.

We study the effects of one such affirmative action program: an admissions policy that fixes percentage quotas, common across more than 200 engineering colleges, for disadvantaged castes and for women. We show that the program increases college attendance of targeted students, particularly at relatively higher-quality institutions. An important concern is that affirmative action might harm intended beneficiaries by placing them in academic programs for which they are ill-prepared.

A production process can be coordinated ex ante, by letting agents stick to a prespecified plan of action. Alternatively, agents may adapt to task-specific shocks, in which case tasks must be coordinated ex post, using communication. When attention is scarce, an optimal organization coordinates only a few tasks ex post. Those tasks are higher performing, more adaptive to the environment, and influential. Hence, scarce attention requires setting priorities, not just local optimization.

We find that a large share of the expected gains from the technology comes from crowding in of other investments. Therefore, improved technologies that reduce risk by protecting production in bad years have the potential to increase agricultural productivity in normal years."}, {"e:author": ["Emily Oster", "Ira Shoulson", "E.
