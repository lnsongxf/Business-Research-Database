Experimentation is modeled as a one-armed bandit that yields successes following a Poisson process. Its unknown intensity is high or low. The agent has private information, his type being his prior belief that the intensity is high. The agent values successes more than the principal does, so prefers more experimentation. The optimal mechanism is a cutoff rule in the belief space: the cutoff gives pessimistic types total freedom but curtails optimistic types' behavior. Pessimistic types over-experiment while the most optimistic ones under-experiment. This delegation rule is time consistent."}, {"e:author": ["Liana Jacobi", "Michelle Sovinsky"], "e:volume": "106", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=Tk2XWNVvFRP0y1t0byz6TOY6YItF1geb", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "2009-45", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "8", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=Tk2XWNVvFRP0y1t0byz6TOY6YItF1geb", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Marijuana on Main Street? Estimating Demand in Markets with Limited Access", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "Marijuana is the most common illicit drug with vocal advocates for legalization. Among other things, legalization would increase access and remove the stigma of illegality. Our model disentangles the role of access from preferences and shows that selection into access is not random. We find that traditional demand estimates are biased resulting in incorrect policy conclusions. If marijuana were legalized, those under 30 would see modest increases in use of 28 percent, while on average use would increase by 48 percent (to 19.4 percent). Tax policies are effective at curbing use, where Australia could raise AU$1 billion (and the United States US$12 billion)."}, {"e:author": ["David Atkin"], "e:volume": "106", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=mRRrLDIt7UsMuNxP5s43SoWF-MzyifJm", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "2046-85", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "8", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=mRRrLDIt7UsMuNxP5s43SoWF-MzyifJm", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Endogenous Skill Acquisition and Export Manufacturing in Mexico", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "This paper presents empirical evidence that the growth of export manufacturing in Mexico during a period of major trade reforms (the years 1986 to 2000) altered the distribution of education. I use variation in the timing of factory openings across commuting zones to show that school drop-out increased with local expansions in export-manufacturing industries. The magnitudes I find suggest that for every 25 jobs created, one student dropped out of school at grade 9 rather than continuing through to grade 12. These effects are driven by less-skilled export-manufacturing jobs which raised the opportunity cost of schooling for students at the margin."}, {"e:author": ["Alex Imas"], "e:volume": "106", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=Hu9ih7fcBwiOovNjLJaeZqEKMdZ8-opO", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "2086-2109", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "8", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=Hu9ih7fcBwiOovNjLJaeZqEKMdZ8-opO", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "The Realization Effect: Risk-Taking after Realized versus Paper Losses", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "Understanding how prior outcomes affect risk attitudes is critical for the study of choice under uncertainty. A large literature documents the significant influence of prior losses on risk attitudes. The findings appear contradictory: some studies find greater risk-taking after a loss, whereas others show the oppositeâ€”that people take on less risk. I reconcile these seemingly inconsistent findings by distinguishing between realized versus paper losses. Using new and existing data, I replicate prior findings and demonstrate that following a realized loss, individuals avoid risk; if the same loss is not realized, a paper loss, individuals take on greater risk."}, {"e:author": ["Amitabh Chandra", "Amy Finkelstein", "Adam Sacarny", "Chad Syverson"], "e:volume": "106", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=Je6hVdyLXrDxkVlaiiuS_v8svsoR1-uw", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "2110-44", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "8", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=Je6hVdyLXrDxkVlaiiuS_v8svsoR1-uw", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Health Care Exceptionalism?

Results suggest that consolidation greatly increased profitability in an industry with otherwise declining profitability. Groups with broader national coverage attract more advertising per station. Joint ownership of two stations within a market and network ownership both allow for significant cost savings. There is some evidence that within-market consolidation allows stations to achieve local market power.

The model also explains the observed cross-state variation in consumer default rates. I find that BAPCPA significantly reduced bankruptcy rates, but increased foreclosure rates when house prices fell.

Our results suggest that audits enable voters to select responsive but corruptible politicians to office. Audit programs must disseminate results when they are most relevant for votersâ€”shortly before an electionâ€”and ensure that these programs are sustained, long-term commitments."}]
