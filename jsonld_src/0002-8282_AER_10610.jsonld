Several models in this class are able to account for the positive excess kurtosis of the size distribution of price changes that appears in the data. We review empirical measures of kurtosis and frequency and conclude that a model that successfully matches the microevidence on kurtosis and frequency produces real effects that are about four times larger than in the Golosov-Lucas model, and about 30 percent below those of the Calvo model. We discuss the robustness of our results to changes in the setup, including small inflation and leptokurtic cost shocks."}, {"e:author": ["Nick Arnosti", "Marissa Beck", "Paul Milgrom"], "e:volume": "106", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=ZjfFN7a4MVrSPN-hKQjdO40u9oiG_5nU", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "2852-66", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "10", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=ZjfFN7a4MVrSPN-hKQjdO40u9oiG_5nU", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Adverse Selection and Auction Design for Internet Display Advertising", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "We model an online display advertising environment in which \"performance\" advertisers can measure the value of individual impressions, whereas \"brand\" advertisers cannot. If advertiser values for ad opportunities are positively correlated, second-price auctions for impressions can be inefficient and expose brand advertisers to adverse selection. Bayesian-optimal auctions have other drawbacks: they are complex, introduce incentives for false-name bidding, and do not resolve adverse selection. We introduce \"modified second bid\" auctions as the unique auctions that overcome these disadvantages. When advertiser match values are drawn independently from heavy-tailed distributions, a modified second bid auction captures at least 94.8 percent of the first-best expected value. In that setting and similar ones, the benefits of switching from an ordinary second-price auction to the modified second bid auction may be large, and the cost of defending against shill bidding and adverse selection may be low."}, {"e:author": ["Arik Levinson"], "e:volume": "106", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=GCe8AEsmrVO53LU0dJugfUlI870Vt0TH", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "2867-94", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "10", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=GCe8AEsmrVO53LU0dJugfUlI870Vt0TH", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "How Much Energy Do Building Energy Codes Save?

We evaluate the impact of biometrically authenticated payments infrastructure (\"Smartcards\") on beneficiaries of employment (NREGS) and pension (SSP) programs in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, using a large-scale experiment that randomized the rollout of Smartcards over 157 subdistricts and 19 million people. We find that, while incompletely implemented, the new system delivered a faster, more predictable, and less corrupt NREGS payments process without adversely affecting program access. For each of these outcomes, treatment group distributions first-order stochastically dominated those of the control group. The investment was cost-effective, as time savings to NREGS beneficiaries alone were equal to the cost of the intervention, and there was also a significant reduction in the \"leakage\" of funds between the government and beneficiaries in both NREGS and SSP programs. Beneficiaries overwhelmingly preferred the new system for both programs. Overall, our results suggest that investing in secure payments infrastructure can significantly enhance 'state capacity' to implement welfare programs in developing countries."}, {"e:author": ["Ufuk Akcigit", "Salomé Baslandze", "Stefanie Stantcheva"], "e:volume": "106", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=BbYb0lS8BFZhMWVWC35YnzLqB1QJXd_d", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "2930-81", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "10", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=BbYb0lS8BFZhMWVWC35YnzLqB1QJXd_d", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Taxation and the International Mobility of Inventors", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "We study the effect of top tax rates on \"superstar\" inventors' international mobility since 1977, using panel data on inventors from the US and European Patent Offices.

Households' ability to self-insure against these shocks depends on how they affect local interest rates. In the United States, most borrowing occurs through the mortgage market and is influenced by the presence of government-sponsored enterprises (GSE). We establish that despite large regional variation in predictable default risk, GSE mortgage rates for otherwise identical loans do not vary spatially. In contrast, the private market does set interest rates which vary with local risk. We use a spatial model of collateralized borrowing to show that the national interest rate policy substantially affects welfare by redistributing resources across regions."}, {"e:author": ["Sandra Sequeira"], "e:volume": "106", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=iewgUa0ECujVA-FwZo5QkXLJRV0kUNtD", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "3029-63", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "10", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=iewgUa0ECujVA-FwZo5QkXLJRV0kUNtD", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Corruption, Trade Costs, and Gains from Tariff Liberalization: Evidence from Southern Africa", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "This paper exploits quasi-experimental variation in tariffs in southern Africa to estimate trade elasticities. Traded quantities respond only weakly to a 30 percent reduction in the average nominal tariff rate. Trade flow data combined with primary data on firm behavior and bribe payments suggest that corruption is a potential explanation for the observed low elasticities. In contexts of pervasive corruption, even small bribes can significantly reduce tariffs, making tariff liberalization schemes less likely to affect the extensive and the intensive margins of firms' import behavior. The tariff liberalization scheme is, however, still associated with improved incentives to accurately report quantities of imported goods, and with a significant reduction in bribe transfers from importers to public officials."}, {"e:author": ["Oded Galor", "Ömer Özak"], "e:volume": "106", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=5oY0DgVa-Y3L8J3Gk5Metm7EK80iGixy", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "3064-3103", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "10", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=5oY0DgVa-Y3L8J3Gk5Metm7EK80iGixy", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "The Agricultural Origins of Time Preference", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "This research explores the origins of observed differences in time preference across countries and regions.

A manager can invest in attention technology to recognize good worker performance. The technology may break and is costly to replace. We show that as time passes without recognition, the worker's belief about the manager's technology worsens and his effort declines. The manager responds by investing, but this investment is insufficient to stop the decline in effort and eventually becomes decreasing. The relationship therefore continues deteriorating, and a return to high performance becomes increasingly unlikely.

The results in BBK are robust to using tax rates from the literature (Sialm 2009). The arguments in Schulz (2016) thus crucially depend on implausibly large tax estimates.
