In recessions, the stock market falls and all types of investment fall, including employers' investment in job creation. The discount rate implicit in the stock market rises, and discounts for other claims on business income also rise. A higher discount implies a lower present value of the benefit of a new hire to an employer. According to the leading view of unemployment--the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model--when the incentive for job creation falls, the labor market slackens and unemployment rises. Thus high discount rates imply high unemployment."}, {"e:author": ["Katharina Knoll", "Moritz Schularick", "Thomas Steger"], "e:volume": "107", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=gTCEMwsslCDLSCRA4u51NBY5e7bS2ZX3", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "331-53", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=gTCEMwsslCDLSCRA4u51NBY5e7bS2ZX3", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "No Price Like Home: Global House Prices, 1870-2012", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "How have house prices evolved over the long run? This paper presents annual house prices for 14 advanced economies since 1870. We show that real house prices stayed constant from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, but rose strongly and with substantial cross-country variation in the second half of the twentieth century. Land prices, not replacement costs, are the key to understanding the trajectory of house prices. Rising land prices explain about 80 percent of the global house price boom that has taken place since World War II. Our findings have implications for the evolution of wealth-to-income ratios, the growth effects of agglomeration, and the price elasticity of housing supply."}, {"e:author": ["Leslie A.

Standard models of repeated interaction formalize the observation that cartels keep participants in line through the threat of punishment, but they fail to explain two important factual observations: first, apparently deliberate cheating actually occurs; second, it frequently goes unpunished even when it is detected.

In this paper, we aim at providing more generalizable results by investigating a large local labor market, with a focus on peer effects in wages rather than productivity. Our estimation strategy--which links the average permanent productivity of workers' peers to their wages--circumvents the reflection problem and accounts for endogenous sorting of workers into peer groups and firms. On average over all occupations, and in the type of high-skilled occupations investigated in studies on knowledge spillover, we find only small peer effects in wages. In the type of low-skilled occupations analyzed in extant studies on social pressure, in contrast, we find larger peer effects, about one-half the size of those identified in similar studies on productivity."}, {"e:author": ["Raymond Fisman", "Daniel Paravisini", "Vikrant Vig"], "e:volume": "107", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=ALD9AVXyzpUZ-3oYMT1dvDwBqpOwB2ov", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "457-92", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=ALD9AVXyzpUZ-3oYMT1dvDwBqpOwB2ov", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "Cultural Proximity and Loan Outcomes", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "We present evidence that cultural proximity (shared codes, beliefs, ethnicity) between lenders and borrowers increases the quantity of credit and reduces default. We identify in-group lending using dyadic data on religion and caste for officers and borrowers from an Indian bank, and a rotation policy that induces exogenous matching between them. Having an in-group officer increases credit access and loan size dispersion, reduces collateral requirements, and induces better repayment even after the in-group officer leaves. We consider a range of explanations and suggest that the findings are most easily explained by cultural proximity serving to mitigate information frictions in lending."}, {"e:author": ["Ulrike Malmendier", "Klaus M.

We estimate a positive UI wage effect exploiting an age-based regression discontinuity design in Austria. A search model incorporating duration dependence predicts two countervailing forces: UI induces workers to seek higher-wage jobs, but reduces wages by lengthening unemployment. Matching-function heterogeneity plausibly generates a negative relationship between the UI unemployment-duration and wage effects, which holds empirically in our sample and across studies, reconciling disparate wage-effect estimates. Empirically, UI raises wages by improving reemployment firm quality and attenuating wage drops."}, {"e:author": ["Hanming Fang", "Qing Gong"], "e:volume": "107", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=VfIhlVFuXIDPwupxoXW7ItwnCLIKMTJu", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "562-91", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=VfIhlVFuXIDPwupxoXW7ItwnCLIKMTJu", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "Detecting Potential Overbilling in Medicare Reimbursement via Hours Worked", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "We propose a novel and easy-to-implement approach to detect potential overbilling based on the hours worked implied by the service codes which physicians submit to Medicare.

When inputs are scarce, an efficient economy carries out only the most productive projects; when inputs are abundant, the economy implements less productive projects as well. This link between decreasing returns and efficiency suggests that misallocation can reduce the extent of aggregate decreasing returns. I formalize this connection and establish two main results: (i) misallocation amplifies the volatility of output with respect to fluctuations in inputs; and (ii) financial integration amplifies shocks in relatively distorted economies, but mitigates them in less distorted economies."}, {"e:author": ["Samuel Lundstrom"], "e:volume": "107", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=V0l21Sdo8lEhnpv0EHIxLMShqvzLgA3l", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "623-28", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=V0l21Sdo8lEhnpv0EHIxLMShqvzLgA3l", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "The Impact of Family Income on Child Achievement: Evidence from the Earned Income Tax Credit: Comment", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "In a recent article in the American Economic Review, Dahl and Lochner (2012) use changes in the Earned Income Tax Credit to estimate the causal effect of family income on child achievement.
