First, we establish the equivalence between such models and reduced exchange models in which countries directly exchange factor services. This equivalence implies that, for an arbitrary change in trade costs, counterfactual changes in the factor content of trade, factor prices, and welfare only depend on the shape of a reduced factor demand system. Second, we provide sufficient conditions under which estimates of this system can be recovered nonparametrically. Together, these results offer a strict generalization of the parametric approach used in so-called gravity models. Finally, we use China's recent integration into the world economy to illustrate the feasibility and potential benefits of our approach."}, {"e:author": ["Sergiu Hart", "Ilan Kremer", "Motty Perry"], "e:volume": "107", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=DhxSeS5iqCnaZ8AVjJyoTPcwPGMV6Biv", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "690-713", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=DhxSeS5iqCnaZ8AVjJyoTPcwPGMV6Biv", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "Evidence Games: Truth and Commitment", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "An evidence game is a strategic disclosure game in which an informed agent who has some pieces of verifiable evidence decides which ones to disclose to an uninformed principal who chooses a reward.

We compare the setup in which the principal chooses the reward after the evidence is disclosed to the mechanism-design setup where he can commit in advance to a reward policy, and show that under natural conditions related to the evidence structure and the inherent prominence of truth, the two setups yield the same outcome."}, {"e:author": ["Linda Babcock", "Maria P.

We examine the allocation of a task that everyone prefers be completed by someone else (writing a report, serving on a committee, etc.) and find evidence that women, more than men, volunteer, are asked to volunteer, and accept requests to volunteer for such tasks. Beliefs that women, more than men, say yes to tasks with low promotability appear as an important driver of these differences. If women hold tasks that are less promotable than those held by men, then women will progress more slowly in organizations."}, {"e:author": ["Kyle C.

First, the MAC is revealed by the price of traded permits. Second, the permit price is estimated using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) comparing stock returns of firms on either side of the policy's free permit cutoff rule. Third, because Waxman-Markey was never implemented, I extend the RDD approach to incorporate prediction market prices which normalize estimates by policy realization probabilities.

Financial distortions create an incentive for firms to raise prices in response to adverse financial or demand shocks. This reaction reflects the firms' decisions to preserve internal liquidity and avoid accessing external finance, factors that strengthen the countercyclical behavior of markups and attenuate the response of inflation to fluctuations in output."}, {"e:author": ["Marco Del Negro", "Gauti Eggertsson", "Andrea Ferrero", "Nobuhiro Kiyotaki"], "e:volume": "107", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=6XekIvQAsbO5gg66gjLWVKzOFKvS05uQ", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "824-57", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=6XekIvQAsbO5gg66gjLWVKzOFKvS05uQ", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "The Great Escape?

Buyers are searching for high-quality drugs, but they determine drugs' quality (i.e., their purity) only after consuming them. Hence, sellers can rip off first-time buyers or can offer higher-quality drugs to induce buyers to purchase from them again. In equilibrium, a distribution of qualities persists. The estimated model implies that if drugs were legalized, in which case purity could be regulated and hence observable, the average purity of drugs would increase by approximately 20 percent and the dispersion would decrease by approximately 80 percent. Moreover, increasing penalties may raise the purity and affordability of the drugs traded by increasing sellers' relative profitability of targeting loyal buyers versus first-time buyers."}, {"e:author": ["Lukasz A.

We argue that the widespread adoption of IT by the debt collection industry in the 1990s contributed to the observed expansion of unsecured risky lending such as credit cards. Our model stresses the importance of delinquency and private information about borrower solvency. The prevalence of delinquency implies that the costs of debt collection must be borne by lenders to sustain incentives to repay debt. IT mitigates informational asymmetries, allowing lenders to concentrate collection efforts on delinquent borrowers who are more likely to repay."}, {"e:author": ["Justin P.

Among other results, I show that there is a nonpredatory (and possibly procompetitive) justification for the observation that such larger firms may charge below cost on the core product lines of their smaller rivals."}]
