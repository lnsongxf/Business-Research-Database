The human brain has always been highly tuned toward narratives, whether factual or not, to justify ongoing actions, even such basic actions as spending and investing. Stories motivate and connect activities to deeply felt values and needs. Narratives \"go viral\" and spread far, even worldwide, with economic impact. The 1920-1921 Depression, the Great Depression of the 1930s, the so-called Great Recession of 2007-2009, and the contentious political-economic situation of today are considered as the results of the popular narratives of their respective times. Though these narratives are deeply human phenomena that are difficult to study in a scientific manner, quantitative analysis may help us gain a better understanding of these epidemics in the future."}, {"e:author": ["Tri Vi Dang", "Gary Gorton", "Bengt Holmström", "Guillermo Ordoñez"], "e:volume": "107", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=Y3nSUM4OoPuM5pcHoBFauD8hvv8k_x4N", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1005-29", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=Y3nSUM4OoPuM5pcHoBFauD8hvv8k_x4N", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "Banks as Secret Keepers", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "Banks produce short-term debt for transactions and storing value. The value of this debt must not vary over time so agents can easily trade it at par like money. To produce money-like safe liquidity, banks keep detailed information about their loans secret, reducing liquidity if needed to prevent agents from producing costly private information about the banks' loans.

We then show that a microfounded model that features policy uncertainty accounts for these stylized facts.

As information aggregates in the market, these errors amplify and crowd out the information content of stock prices. When prices reflect less information, the conditional variance of stock returns rises, causing an increase in uncertainty and costly distortions in consumption, capital accumulation, and labor supply."}, {"e:author": ["Jeremy Lise", "Jean-Marc Robin"], "e:volume": "107", "e:url": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=pJl-vqO7qcyMfOWGwRc-7b_nu-8gyVbR", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1104-35", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=pJl-vqO7qcyMfOWGwRc-7b_nu-8gyVbR", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "The Macrodynamics of Sorting between Workers and Firms", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "We develop an equilibrium model of on-the-job search with ex ante heterogeneous workers and firms, aggregate uncertainty, and vacancy creation.

This result means the model is tractable and can be estimated. We illustrate the quantitative implications of the model by fitting to US aggregate labor market data from 1951-2012. The model has rich implications for the cyclical dynamics of the distribution of skills of the unemployed, the distribution of types of vacancies posted, and sorting between heterogeneous workers and firms."}, {"e:author": ["Sabrina T.
