Powerful groups dynamically interact via a fiscal process that effectively allows open access to the aggregate capital stock. In equilibrium, this leads to slow economic growth and a 'voracity effect,' by which a shock, such as a terms of trade windfall, perversely generates a more-than-proportionate increase in fiscal redistribution and reduces growth. The authors also show that a dilution in the concentration of power leads to faster growth and a less procyclical response to shocks."}, {"e:author": ["Huw Lloyd-Ellis"], "e:volume": "89", "e:url": "http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.89.1.47", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "47-77", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.89.1.47", "e:year": 1999, "e:title": "Endogenous Technological Change and Wage Inequality", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "Although microeconomic studies find a positive relationship between R&D and skill premia, much of the recent rise in U.S. wage inequality was accompanied by slowing labor-productivity growth and relatively slow introduction of new technologies. These conflicting observations are consistent with the effects of a skewed distribution of 'absorptive capacities'--the rate at which technology-specific skills can be acquired--in a model of endogenous technological change. The framework is used to assess whether the productivity slowdown and the rise in wage inequality can be jointly accounted for by the contemporaneous decline in the growth rate of labor quality."}, {"e:author": ["Francesco Caselli"], "e:volume": "89", "e:url": "http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.89.1.78", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "78-102", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.89.1.78", "e:year": 1999, "e:title": "Technological Revolutions", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "In skill-biased (deskilling) technological revolutions, learning investments required by new machines are greater (smaller) than those required by preexisting machines.

The model of skill-biased (deskilling) revolutions provides insight into developments since the mid-1970s (in the 1910s). The empirical work documents a large increase in the interindustry dispersion of capital-labor ratios since 1975.

Naive people procrastinate immediate-cost activities and preproperate--do too soon--immediate-reward activities. Sophistication mitigates procrastination but exacerbates preproperation. Moreover, with immediate costs, a small present bias can severely harm only naive people, whereas with immediate rewards it can severely harm only sophisticated people.

A rule is a fixed mapping from a subset of states into actions. Rules are compared by averaging over past experiences. This can lead to favoring rules which are only applicable in good states. Correcting this good state bias requires solving the dynamic program. The authors provide a general framework and characterize the asymptotic properties.

In a 'standard setting' context, in which every competitor suffers losses until a standard is chosen, even after giving up on its own preferred alternative, each firm's exit time is independent both of K and of other players' actions.

This paper examines two potential benefits of a multilateral trade institution: first, verifying violations of the agreements and informing third parties, thus facilitating multilateral reputation mechanisms; second, promoting multilateral trade negotiations rather than a web of bilateral negotiations.

Using this general framework, the authors establish that GATT's principles of reciprocity and nondiscrimination can be viewed as simple rules that assist governments in their effort to implement efficient trade agreements.
