Recent empirical evidence suggests that this correlation holds largely because high growth leads to high saving, not the other way around. This evidence is difficult to reconcile with standard growth models, since forward-looking consumers with standard utility should save less in a fast-growing economy because they know they will be richer in the future than they are today. We show that if utility depends partly on how consumption compares to a \"habit stock\" determined by past consumption, an otherwise-standard growth model can imply that increases in growth can cause increased saving."}, {"e:author": ["Harald Uhlig", "Lars Ljungqvist"], "e:volume": "90", "e:url": "http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.90.3.356", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "356-366", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.90.3.356", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Tax Policy and Aggregate Demand Management under Catching Up with the Joneses", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "This paper examines the role for tax policies in productivity-shock driven economies with catching-up-with-the-Joneses utility functions. The optimal tax policy is shown to affect the economy countercyclically via procyclical taxes, i.e., \"cooling down\" the economy with higher taxes when it is \"overheating\" in booms and \"stimulating\" the economy with lower taxes in recessions to keep consumption up. Thus, models with catching-up-with-the-Joneses utility functions call for traditional Keynesian demand-management policies but for rather unorthodox reasons."}, {"e:author": ["Jeffrey C.

The empirical tests developed in the paper show that one can reject the hypothesis of no habit formation with tremendous confidence, largely because the habit-formation model captures the gradual hump-shaped response of real spending to various shocks. The paper then embeds the habit-consumption specification in a monetary-policy model and finds that the responses of both spending and inflation to monetary-policy actions are significantly improved by this modification."}, {"e:author": ["Karen E.

When the condition is estimated with food consumption data from the Panel Study on Income Dynamics (PSID), the results yield no evidence of habit formation at the annual frequency.

If individuals display aversion to incompatibility, standardization never fails to happen eventually, but societies sometimes end up picking inferior standards. In this case, official action can be useful to quickly achieve sensible standardization.
