Using data from actual auditions, in an individual fixed-effects framework, we find that the screen increases the probability a woman will be advanced and hired. Although some of our estimates have large standard errors and there is one persistent effect in the opposite direction, the weight of the evidence suggests that the blind audition procedure fostered impartiality in hiring and increased the proportion women in symphony orchestras."}, {"e:author": ["Raymond Robertson"], "e:volume": "90", "e:url": "http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.90.4.742", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "742-764", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.90.4.742", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Wage Shocks and North American Labor-Market Integration", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "This study uses household-level data from the United States and Mexico to examine labor-market integration.
