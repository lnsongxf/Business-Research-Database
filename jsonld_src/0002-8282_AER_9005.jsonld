An important feature of the model is deviations from purchasing-power parity, caused by rigid price setting in buyers' currency. In a benchmark model with separable preferences and only monetary shocks, trade is unaffected by the exchange-rate system, consistent with most evidence. In general, both trade and welfare can be higher under either exchange-rate system, depending on preferences and on the monetary-policy rules followed under each system. There is no one-to-one relationship between the levels of trade and welfare across exchange-rate systems."}, {"e:author": ["Cormac O Grada", "Morgan Kelly"], "e:volume": "90", "e:url": "http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.90.5.1110", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1110-1124", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.90.5.1110", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Market Contagion: Evidence from the Panics of 1854 and 1857", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "To test a model of contagion--where individuals hear some bad news and communicate it to their acquaintances, who then pass it on, leading to a market panic--requires a knowledge of the information networks of participants, something hitherto unavailable.

As recent immigrants, their social network was determined largely by their place of origin in Ireland, and where they lived in New York.

The model is calibrated to quantify the strength of the effect of schooling on growth by using evidence from the labor literature on Mincerian returns to education. The upshot is that the impact of schooling on growth explains less than one-third of the empirical cross-country relationship.

International openness thickens the market, facilitating leaner, less integrated firms, thus providing gains from international openness quite different from those that are familiar from trade theory.
