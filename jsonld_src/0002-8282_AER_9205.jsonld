To do so, we examine the distribution of regional population in Japan from the Stone Age to the modern era. We also consider the Allied bombing of Japanese cities in WWII as a shock to relative city sizes. Our results support a hybrid theory in which locational fundamentals establish the spatial pattern of relative regional densities, but increasing returns help to determine the degree of spatial differentiation. Long-run city size is robust even to large temporary shocks."}, {"e:author": ["Jan Eeckhout", "Boyan Jovanovic"], "e:volume": "92", "e:url": "http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/000282802762024511", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1290-1307", "e:issn": "0002-8282", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/000282802762024511", "e:year": 2002, "e:title": "Knowledge Spillovers and Inequality", "e:journal": "American Economic Review", "e:abstract": "We develop a dynamic model with knowledge spillovers in production.

Not only is children's health positively related to household income, but the relationship between household income and children's health becomes more pronounced as children age. Part of the relationship can be explained by the arrival and impact of chronic conditions. Children from lowerincome households with chronic conditions have worse health than do those from higher-income households. The adverse health effects of lower income accumulate over children's lives.

The analysis shows that when an airport is dominated by a monopolist, congestion is fully internalized, yielding no role for congestion pricing under monopoly conditions. Under a Cournot oligopoly, however, carriers are shown to internalize only the congestion they impose on themselves. A toll that captures the uninternalized portion of congestion may then improve the allocation of traffic.
