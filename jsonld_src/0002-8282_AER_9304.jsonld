We develop a framework to empirically test for misallocation. The methodology compares consumption patterns for demographic subgroups in rent-controlled and free-market places. We find that in New York City, which is rent-controlled, an economically and statistically significant fraction of apartments appears to be misallocated across demographic subgroups.

However, the effects on aggregate investment, long-term capital values, and the utility of young savers hinges on assumptions about technology.

While both factors impact congestion, we find that the hubbing effect dominates empirically.

Non-hub flights at the same hub airports operate with minimal additional travel time.
