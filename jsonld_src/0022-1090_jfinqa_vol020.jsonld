They will not, as has been suggested, include stock in their portfolios for diversification purposes when they can alternatively purchase securities that simulate forward contracts. It is also shown that firms that can sell synthetic forward positions on their own stock can essentially guarantee that sufficient funds will be available to meet their bond obligations.

This analysis explores the power of various investment selection criteria to identify efficient portfolios from investment strategies involving call options and treasury bills, stocks, and covered option writing. The preference structure for strategies incorporating options is compared to traditional stock-fixed income investments, and the importance of options to investor utility maximization is illustrated. This study reveals that rules of stochastic dominance that place few restrictions on investor preference functions and asset return distribution are appropriate criteria by which to rank portfolios containing options and other assets.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "435-450", "e:issn": "0022-1090", "e:doi": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000011807", "e:year": 1985, "e:title": "Efficiency Analysis and Option Portfolio Selection", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "e:issue": "04"}, {"e:author": ["Phillip E.

In contrast to the work of Jensen [8] and Grant ([4], [5], and [6]), the results specifically consider and measure the attractiveness to a risk-averse investor of the positively skewed distribution of portfolio returns expected from a market-timed portfolio. The usual mean and variance characterization of a risky portfolio is not sufficient in the case of a markettimed portfolio, and a simple utility model is employed to measure the incremental value of a market-timing strategy. The results are given as a function of the relative volatility of the market, the quality of available forecasts, and the risk attitude of the investor.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "451-459", "e:issn": "0022-1090", "e:doi": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000011819", "e:year": 1985, "e:title": "Market Timing and Risk Reduction", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "e:issue": "04"}, {"e:author": ["Ralph A.

Increased ownership of target firm shares by the bidder also increases the probability of success. Variables that impede the tendering of shares (such as target management opposition or a competing bid) decrease the probability of success.

Thus, there must be an equality between the market values of real assets and the values of optimally levered firms. The standard measure of the advantage to leverage compares the values of levered and unlevered assets, and can be misleading and difficult to interpret. We show that a meaningful measure of the advantage to debt is the extra rate of return, net of a market premium for bankruptcy risk, earned by a levered firm relative to an otherwise-identical unlevered firm. We construct an option valuation model to calculate such a measure and present extensive simulation results. We use this model to compute optimal debt maturities, show how this approach can be used for capital budgeting, and discuss its implications for the comparison of bankruptcy costs versus tax shields.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "479-499", "e:issn": "0022-1090", "e:doi": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000011832", "e:year": 1985, "e:title": "Debt Policy and the Rate of Return Premium to Leverage", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "e:issue": "04"}, {"e:author": ["James R.
