The approach involves an extension of the lattice binomial approach developed by Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein to value options on a single asset. Details are given on how the jump probabilities and jump amplitudes may be obtained when there are two state variables. This procedure can be used to price any contingent claim whose payoff is a piece-wise linear function of two underlying state variables, provided these two variables have a bivariate lognormal distribution. The accuracy of the method is illustrated by valuing options on the maximum and minimum of two assets and comparing the results for cases in which an exact solution has been obtained for European options. One advantage of the lattice approach is that it handles the early exercise feature of American options. In addition, it should be possible to use this approach to value a number of financial instruments that have been created in recent years.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1-12", "e:issn": "0022-1090", "e:doi": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000012874", "e:year": 1988, "e:title": "A Lattice Framework for Option Pricing with Two State Variables", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "e:issue": "01"}, {"e:author": ["Edward C.

Further, we demonstrate that recent attempts to link liquidation costs to capital structure are without merit. If the firm is to be liquidated on the basis of a rule other than one that maximizes the total value of all the claimants, arbitrage profits arise, and informal reorganization will discipline management to follow the liquidation rule that is optimal for existing securityholders. Also, we find that the pure market solution is not readily generalizable to other classes of agency problems, particularly the risk incentive problem.
