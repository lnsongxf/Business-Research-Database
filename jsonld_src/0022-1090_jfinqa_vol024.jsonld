For the class of isoelastic utility functions with constant relative risk averson less than one, the optimal investment approaches a constant proportion of wealth. The limiting proportion is the same as the proportion put up by the most optimistic individual when the investment opportunity is offered only once.

The formulas highlight the role of the correlation between the unanticipated returns on the underlying security and the changes in the short-term rate in determining the options value. Our numerical analysis indicates that option prices predicted by the proposed formula differ from those predicted by the Black and Scholes formula when this correlation is relatively large and the short-term rate's instantaneous variance is relatively large as well. Moreover, the proposed formula predicts higher (lower) stock option prices than those predicted by the Black and Scholes formula for correlation values that are lower (higher) than some positive critical value.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "447-457", "e:issn": "0022-1090", "e:doi": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000013661", "e:year": 1989, "e:title": "Pricing Stock and Bond Options when the Default-Free Rate is Stochastic", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "e:issue": "04"}, {"e:author": ["Wilbur Lewellen", "Claudio Loderer", "Ahron Rosenfeld"], "e:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000013673", "e:volume": "24", "e:abstract": "Among the possible consequences of agency problems between corporate owners and managers is a tendency by managers to make investment decisions for their firms that are deliberately aimed at reducing firm risk, as a means to control managers‚Äô personal wealth risk.
