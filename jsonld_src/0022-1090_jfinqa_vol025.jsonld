These findings may partially explain why several recent studies fail to detect a significant non-January risk premium in the stock market, but this evidence is only suggestive since theoretical and statistical difficulties prevent precise interpretations of specific pricing relations in the Chen, Roll, Ross model.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "517-533", "e:issn": "0022-1090", "e:doi": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000007365", "e:year": 1990, "e:title": "Stock Market Seasonals and Prespecified Multifactor Pricing Relations", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "e:issue": "04"}, {"e:author": ["Allen B.

We show that these results are obtained only if returns preceding the call dates are used for market model parameter estimation. Returns preceding calls tend to be positive and unusually large. This means that predicted post-call returns, based on pre-call parameter estimates, are biased upward. Consequently, the corresponding abnormal returns are biased downward.
