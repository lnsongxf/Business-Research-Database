Hence, a multi-period project is priced as if it offers a single payment. The formula uses a set of assumptions that is slightly more restrictive than the minimum set Constantinides (1980) uses to produce the multi-period version of the CAPM.

Specifically, we find that both spot and forward exchange rates for the U.K., Germany, Japan, and Canada have unit roots and are cointegrated. We also find that the co-integrating parameter in the regression of realized spot on forward rates for each currency is approximately one, implying that researchers who use this specification to test the UFRH may falsely accept the hypothesis simply because of the specification used in the test. Using an alternative error correction specification, we find that the UFRH is resoundingly rejected for all currencies and that the coefficients in this specification exhibit temporal instability. More importantly, we find that the evolution of the estimated parameters is becoming increasingly inconsistent with the UFRH with the passage of time.

Two theories of contract choice–Benveniste and Spindt (1989) and Ritter's (1987) extension of Rock (1986)–offer predictions about the role of these contract features. We find that the 1977–1982 evidence is consistent with Benveniste and Spindt (1989). The evidence is less supportive of the Ritter (1987) hypothesis that minimum sales constraints serve to reduce the winner's curse of the riskier issuers.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "497-518", "e:issn": "0022-1090", "e:doi": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000007791", "e:year": 1991, "e:title": "An Empirical Examination of Models of Contract Choice in Initial Public Offerings", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "e:issue": "04"}, {"e:author": ["Hendrik Bessembinder"], "e:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000007808", "e:volume": "26", "e:abstract": "Corporate risk hedging with forward contracts increases value by reducing incentives to underinvest. This occurs because the hedge decreases the sensitivity of senior claim value to incremental investment, allowing equity holders to capture a larger portion of the incremental benefit from new investment. Hedging also allows the firm to credibly commit to meet obligations in states where it otherwise could not, which improves contract terms the firm can negotiate with customers, creditors, and managers.
