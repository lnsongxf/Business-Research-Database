It identifies situations where option interactions can be small or large, negative or positive. Interactions generally depend on the type, separation, degree of being “in the money,” and the order of the options involved. The paper illustrates, through a generic example, the importance of properly accounting for interactions among the options to defer, abandon, contract or expand investment, and switch use. It is shown that the incremental value of an additional option, in the presence of other options, is generally less than its value in isolation, and declines as more options are present. Therefore, valuation errors from ignoring a particular option may be small. However, configurations of real options exhibiting precisely the opposite behavior are identified. Comparative statics results confirm that the value of flexibility, despite interactions, manifests familiar option properties.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1-20", "e:issn": "0022-1090", "e:doi": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000008334", "e:year": 1993, "e:title": "The Nature of Option Interactions and the Valuation of Investments with Multiple Real Options", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "e:issue": "01"}, {"e:author": ["Hendrik Bessembinder", "Paul J.

The assigned expected returns are shown to be linear in their associated factor betas. However, the factor betas and prices of assets differ from those under complete information. Specifically, risky assets with high (low) information are priced relatively higher (lower). On the other hand, factor betas of high (low) information assets are relatively lower (higher). The analysis has econometric implications for testing the APT. In this paper's framework, maximum likelihood estimates of factor betas, which are based on normality assumptions, are too high (low) for high (low) information assets.

This paper presents a theoretical analysis of spin-offs.

The trade-off specifies the optimal leverage for a firm. Within this framework, the paper considers whether and under what circumstances firm value could be enhanced by a spin-off. It is shown that a spin-off in which parent company debt is optimally allocated between the post-spin-off firms increases value by reducing agency costs and increasing the value of tax shields when the component firm cash flows are positively correlated. The optimal allocation is characterized in terms of the parameters of the technologies of the component firms. When the component cash flows are negatively correlated, under the sufficient conditions developed, a combined firm operation dominates spin-offs.

In contrast, day-of-the-week effects in seven European countries and in Canada and Hong Kong are robust to individual sample size or error term adjustments, and day-of-the-week effects in five European countries survive the simultaneous imposition of both types of adjustments. In most countries where day-of-the-week effects are robust, however, the effects are statistically significant in not more than two weeks out of the month. These findings are inconsistent with explanations of the day-of-the-week effect based on institutional differences or on the arrival of new information. Thus, in the absence of other potential explanations already dismissed by Jaffe and Westerfield (1985), evidence in this study further complicates the international day-of-the-week effect puzzle.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "497-513", "e:issn": "0022-1090", "e:doi": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S002210900000867X", "e:year": 1993, "e:title": "International Evidence on the Robustness of the Day-of-the-Week Effect", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "e:issue": "04"}, {"e:author": ["Daniel Friedman"], "e:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000008681", "e:volume": "28", "e:abstract": "The 39 experiments reported here examine the impact on trading profits and on market performance of awarding special trading privileges to some traders and not others.

Both within-sample comparisons and out-of-sample comparisons reveal that the proposed model provides greater risk reduction than the conventional models.

On the other hand, the increase in agency costs of such an organizational change should decrease the wealth of shareholders.

Call option values computed with the Bayesian procedure generally improve prediction accuracy for market prices of call options relative to those computed using implied volatility, standard historical volatility, or even the actual ex post volatility that occurred during each option's life.
