Dividend process is modeled as the sum of a permanent component and a temporary component. By using the stock price valuation (present value) model, the two components are related to stock prices. The stock market responds significantly not only to permanent shocks to dividends, but also to temporary shocks to dividends. Furthermore, initial responses of stock prices to the temporary shocks are as strong as those to the permanent shocks. As a result, substantial variation in stock prices is due to the temporary shocks. This finding provides empirical support for the imperfect information hypothesis that emphasizes the failure of investors to clearly distinguish between the two components of dividends, and also suggests that the observed mean-reverting behavior of stock returns should be explained by incorporating a significant temporary component into stockprices. The price-dividend spreads are primarily accounted for by the temporary shocks to dividends, and respond strongly to them, suggesting that, in response to the temporary shocks to dividends, stock prices respond excessively relative to dividends.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1-22", "e:issn": "0022-1090", "e:doi": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000000089", "e:year": 1995, "e:title": "The Response of Stock Prices to Permanent and Temporary Shocks to Dividends", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "e:issue": "01"}, {"e:author": ["Robin J.

With intraday data, major portions of the pricing anomaly can be explained by: a nonsynchronous matching of trades; a difference in the settlement procedures (labeled time value of money in Choi and Strong (1983)); a mismatching of market purchases with market sales (first proposed by Lamoureux and Wansley (1989)); and a higher frequency of market purchases relative to market sales. In addition, the small remaining portion of the anomaly cannot be arbitraged. The remaining premium is attributed to a lower level of limit order competition and an order imbalance in the when-issued shares.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "441-454", "e:issn": "0022-1090", "e:doi": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000000314", "e:year": 1995, "e:title": "A Bias in Closing Prices: The Case of the When-Issued Pricing Anomaly", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "e:issue": "03"}, {"e:author": ["Esa Jokivuolle"], "e:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000000326", "e:volume": "30", "e:abstract": "Based on the Beveridge-Nelson (1981) decomposition of an ARIMA process, I present a measure of true stock index value that is not directly observable due to infrequent trading of stocks.

An important problem in interpreting these results is that these studies all investigate American options.

Therefore, it is not possible to conclude from these studies whether, or to what extent, observed put-call parity violations are due to market inefficiency or due to the value of early exercise. We avoid the early exercise problem by testing put-call parity using European options. We find violations that are much less frequent and smaller than the studies using American options.

We find that the optimal time between replacements is increasing in the volatility of cost, the purchase price of a new asset, and the corporate tax rate; and is decreasing in the systematic risk of cost, the salvage value of the asset, and the investment tax credit. The optimal time between replacements can either increase or decrease with an increase in the depreciation rate. Extensions of the model to examine the effects of technological and tax policy uncertainty on replacement investment decisions give intuitive, but striking results. Uncertainty about the arrival of a technological innovation that would decrease maintenance and operation cost results in a significant decrease in replacement investment. Uncertainty in a tax law change that would encourage investment decreases current investment; and uncertainty in a tax law change that would discourage investment increases current investment.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "581-605", "e:issn": "0022-1090", "e:doi": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000000387", "e:year": 1995, "e:title": "Investment under Uncertainty: The Case of Replacement Investment Decisions", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "e:issue": "04"}, {"e:author": ["David R.
