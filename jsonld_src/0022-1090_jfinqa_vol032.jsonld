Unlike extant analysis, such as De Long et al. (1990a), a classical equilibrium exists in our analysis, e.g., a riskless perpetuity is priced by arbitrage and its price does not vary with noise. A unique noisy equilibrium exists only when i) noise traders' beliefs are rational regarding volatility and irrational regarding expected returns, and ii) noise traders can hold infinite positions. In the absence of these strong assumptions, multiple noisy equilibria can coexist with the classical equilibrium, but these equilibria exhibit conflicting comparative statics. Furthermore, the price of a long-lived asset with risky cash flows can vary with noise even when investors are not myopic. One conclusion is that myopia is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for noisy prices.

Regardless of the presence of firm size, book-to-market equity, and earnings-price ratios, betas have significant explanatory power for average stock returns. In particular, firm size is barely significant using monthly returns, but no longer significant using quarterly returns. However, book-to-market equity still has significant explanatory power for average stock returns, even though the EIV bias is corrected.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "463-489", "e:issn": "0022-1090", "e:doi": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000000739", "e:year": 1997, "e:title": "A Reexamination of Firm Size, Book-to-Market, and Earnings Price in the Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "e:issue": "04"}, {"e:author": ["Victoria B.

The stock price reaction to antitakeover amendments is more negative when the board is dominated by inside and affiliated outside board members. Further, for firms in which the CEO also chairs the board, the reaction becomes increasingly negative as inside and affiliated outside board members increase their ownership stake in the firm and proportional representation on the board. In contrast, board composition and ownership structure have little power to explain the stock price reaction when the CEO does not chair the board. We conclude that monitoring by outside independent board members is important particularly when the CEO is also the board chair.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "491-505", "e:issn": "0022-1090", "e:doi": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109000000740", "e:year": 1997, "e:title": "Board Monitoring and Antitakeover Amendments", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "e:issue": "04"}, {"e:author": ["Sok Tae Kim", "Ji-Chai Lin", "Myron B.
