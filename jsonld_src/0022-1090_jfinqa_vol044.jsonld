We find that the demand for art by Japanese collectors is positively correlated with art prices and Japanese stock prices. This correlation is magnified during the “bubble period” of the Japanese economy (the mid-1980s to the early 1990s) and gains even further strength for works of art typically favored by Japanese collectors. Our results suggest that Japanese investors (or Japanese asset markets) indeed affect international art prices—especially during the bubble period and its aftermath.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1489-1514", "e:issn": "0022-1090", "e:doi": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109009990366", "e:year": 2009, "e:title": "How Did Japanese Investments Influence International Art Prices?", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "e:issue": "06"}, {"e:author": ["Paul Brockman", "Dennis Y.

Our empirical results show that block ownership takes potential trading activity off the table relative to a diffuse ownership structure and impairs the firm’s market liquidity. These adverse liquidity effects disappear, however, once we control for trading activity. Our findings suggest that block ownership is detrimental to the firm’s market liquidity because of its adverse impact on trading activity—a real friction effect. After controlling for this real friction effect, we find little evidence that block ownership has a negative impact on informational friction. Our results suggest that the relative lack of trading, and not the threat of informed trading, explains the inverse relation between block ownership and market liquidity.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1403-1426", "e:issn": "0022-1090", "e:doi": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109009990378", "e:year": 2009, "e:title": "Block Ownership, Trading Activity, and Market Liquidity", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "e:issue": "06"}, {"e:author": ["Menachem Brenner", "Paolo Pasquariello", "Marti Subrahmanyam"], "e:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S002210900999038X", "e:volume": "44", "e:abstract": "The objective of this paper is to provide a deeper insight into the links between financial markets and the real economy. To that end, we study the short-term anticipation and response of U.S. stock, Treasury, and corporate bond markets to the first release of surprise U.S. macroeconomic information. Specifically, we focus on the impact of these announcements not only on the level, but also on the volatility and comovement of those assets’ returns. We do so by estimating several extensions of the parsimonious multivariate GARCH-DCC model of Engle (2002) for the excess holding-period returns on seven portfolios of these asset classes. We find that both the process of price formation in each of those financial markets and their interaction appear to be driven by fundamentals. Yet our analysis reveals a statistically and economically significant dichotomy between the reaction of the stock and bond markets to the arrival of unexpected fundamental information. We also show that the conditional mean, volatility, and comovement among stock, Treasury, and corporate bond returns react asymmetrically to the information content of these surprise announcements. Overall, the above results shed new light on the mechanisms by which new information is incorporated into prices within and across U.S. financial markets.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1265-1289", "e:issn": "0022-1090", "e:doi": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S002210900999038X", "e:year": 2009, "e:title": "On the Volatility and Comovement of U.S. Financial Markets around Macroeconomic News Announcements", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "e:issue": "06"}, {"e:author": ["Paolo Fulghieri", "Merih Sevilir"], "e:url": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109009990391", "e:volume": "44", "e:abstract": "This paper examines the impact of competition on the optimal organization and financing structures in innovation-intensive industries. We show that as an optimal response to competition, firms may choose external organization structures established in collaboration with specialized start-ups where they provide start-up financing from their own resources. As the intensity of the competition to innovate increases, firms move from internal to external organization of projects to increase the speed of product innovation and to obtain a competitive advantage with respect to rival firms in their industry. We also show that as the level of competition increases, firms provide a higher level of financing for externally organized projects in the form of corporate venture capital (CVC).

We find that low current trading activity, wide spreads, and higher information asymmetry increase the attractiveness of contracted liquidity provision.
