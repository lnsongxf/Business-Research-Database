Downside cash flow premia mainly occur for small stocks, while large stocks are compensated for symmetric cash-flow-related risk.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1279-1301", "e:issn": "0022-1090", "e:doi": "http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022109012000567", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Cash Flow and Discount Rate Risk in Up and Down Markets: What Is Actually Priced?", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis", "e:issue": "06"}]
