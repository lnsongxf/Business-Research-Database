We assume that there is a trade-off between child labor and the accumulation of human capital. Even if parents are altruistic and child labor is socially inefficient, it may arise in equilibrium because parents fail to fully internalize its negative effects. This occurs when bequests are zero or when capital markets are imperfect. We also study the effects of a simple ban on child labor and derive conditions under which it may be Pareto improving in general equilibrium. We show that the implications of child labor for fertility are ambiguous.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "663-679", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/316097", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Is Child Labor Inefficient?", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "4"}, {"e:author": ["Stephen L.

In particular, we study the extent to which one can account for international income differences with differences in policies that distort capital accumulation.

Hence these models can generate larger differences in output than standard models for a given policy differential. We also show how the welfare implications change when we incorporate home production.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "680-687", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/316102", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Homework in Development Economics: Household Production and the Wealth of Nations", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "4"}, {"e:author": ["Stefan Dercon", "Pramila Krishnan"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/316098", "e:volume": "108", "e:abstract": "Much of the literature on consumption smoothing and on risk sharing has focused on the ability of the household as a unit to protect its consumption. Little is known about the ability of individual members of the household to keep consumption smooth over time or relative to other members of the household. We use data on adult nutrition in Ethiopia to investigate whether individuals are able to smooth their consumption over time and within the household. We find that poorer households are not able to do so. Furthermore, poor southern households do not engage in complete risk sharing; women in these households bear the brunt of adverse shocks. This result implies that the collective model of household organization, which imposes Pareto efficiency on allocations, is rejected for these households. Finally, we obtain estimates of the relative Pareto weights in household allocation. We find that a wife's relative position is better if customary laws on settlements at divorce are favorable or if she comes from a relatively wealthy background and that poor southern women have lower Pareto weights in allocation.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "688-727", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/316098", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "In Sickness and in Health: Risk Sharing within Households in Rural Ethiopia", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "4"}, {"e:author": ["Steven Klepper", "Kenneth L.

In particular, we focus on a recent policy in France in which the governments of Balladur and Jupp&eacute; subsidized the replacement of old cars with new ones. To study this policy, we construct a dynamic stochastic discrete choice model of car ownership at the household level. The resulting decision rules and equilibrium conditions are used to estimate the underlying parameters of the model using aggregate data. These policy functions are used to evaluate the short- and long-run effects of the French policies. We find that these policies do stimulate the automobile sector in the short run but, through the induced changes in the cross-sectional distribution of car ages, create the basis for subsequent low activity. Further, while these policies increase government revenues in the short run, revenues in the long run are lower relative to a baseline without intervention.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "778-806", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/316096", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Balladurette and Juppette: A Discrete Analysis of Scrapping Subsidies", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "4"}, {"e:author": ["John Laitner"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/316101", "e:volume": "108", "e:abstract": "To offer a possible interpretation for recent empirical findings on earnings growth, this paper constructs a simple model with endogenous human capital investment, a distribution of natural abilities, and unbiased technological progress.

Pharmacy heterogeneity accounts for at most one-third of the observed price dispersion. The empirical analysis hinges on the observation that consumers' incentives to price-shop depend on characteristics of the drug therapy. Cross-sectional patterns in price distributions across drugs are consistent with the predictions of a search model: prices for repeatedly purchased prescriptions (for which the expected benefits of search are highest) exhibit significant reductions in both dispersion and price-cost margins.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "833-862", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/316103", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Equilibrium Price Dispersion in Retail Markets for Prescription Drugs", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "4"}]
