Paralleling these findings is the disappointing performance of the q theory of investment: even though marginal q should summarize the effects of all factors relevant to the investment decision, cash flow still matters. We examine whether this failure is due to error in measuring marginal q. Using measurement errorconsistent generalized method of moments estimators, we find that most of the stylized facts produced by investment-q cash flow regressions are artifacts of measurement error. Cash flow does not matter, even for financially constrained firms, and despite its simple structure, q theory has good explanatory power once purged of measurement error.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1027-1057", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/317670", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Measurement Error and the Relationship between Investment and q", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "5"}, {"e:author": ["Hao Li", "Wing Suen"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/317675", "e:volume": "108", "e:abstract": "In an assignment market with uncertainty regarding productive ability of participants, early contracting can occur as participants balance risk sharing and sorting efficiency.

Voters have single-peaked preferences along a single policy dimension. There are two levels of government, federal and local. The federal level can constrain local policy by mandating a minimum (or maximum) policy. Localities are free to adopt any policy satisfying the constraint imposed by the federal mandate. We show that voters choose federal mandates that are too strict, which leads to excessively severe mandates. We show that similar results can obtain when federal provision of the public-provided good is more efficient than local provision.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "905-927", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/317669", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Federal Mandates by Popular Demand", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "5"}, {"e:author": ["Simon Gilchrist", "John C.

We show that the key variable governing the adoption decision is the product of the interest rate times the total amount of assets. This implies that the interest elasticity of household money demand at low interest rates can be estimated from the variation in asset holdings in a cross section of households rather than historical interest rate variations. We do so with the 1989 Survey of Consumer Finances. We find that (a) the elasticity of money demand is very small when the interest rate is small, (b) the probability that a household holds any amount of interest-bearing assets is positively related to the level of financial assets, and (c) the cost of adopting financial technologies is negatively related to participation in a pension program. At interest rates of 5 percent, roughly one-half of the elasticity can be attributed to the Allais-Baumol-Tobin or intensive margin and half to the new adopters or extensive margin. The intensive margin is less important at lower interest rates and more important at higher interest rates. Finally, we argue that ignoring extensive margins may lead to an empirically important overestimation of the cost of inflation at low interest rates.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "961-991", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/317676", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Extensive Margins and the Demand for Money at Low Interest Rates", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "5"}, {"e:author": ["Martin Gaynor", "Deborah Haas-Wilson", "William B.
