Thus she has a current incentive to truthfully reveal her information. But if the decision maker thinks that the advisor might be biased in favor of one decision and the advisor does not wish to be thought to be biased, the advisor has a reputational incentive to lie. If the advisor is sufficiently concerned about her reputation, no information is conveyed in equilibrium. In a repeated version of this game, the advisor will care (instrumentally) about her reputation simply because she wants her valuable and unbiased advice to have an impact on future decisions.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "231-265", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/319554", "e:year": 2001, "e:title": "Political Correctness", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "2"}, {"e:author": ["Bruce A.

Building on work in psychology and sociology, this paper emphasizes the importance of child-rearing practices, which vary with income.

My model generates a positive relationship between parental income and children's outcomes especially at low incomes and endogenously produces a relationship between parental income and child-rearing practices.

Consequently, if the relationship lender needs funds before the loan matures, she may demand to liquidate early, or require a return premium, when she lends directly. Borrowers also risk losing funding. The costs of illiquidity are avoided if the relationship lender is a bank with a fragile capital structure, subject to runs. Fragility commits banks to creating liquidity, enabling depositors to withdraw when needed, while buffering borrowers from depositors' liquidity needs.
