Four main themes are developed. (1) Microeconometricians developed new tools to respond to econometric problems raised by the analysis of the new sources of micro data produced after the Second World War. (2) Microeconometrics improved on aggregate time-series methods by building models that linked economic models for individuals to data on individual behavior. (3) An important empirical regularity detected by the field is the diversity and heterogeneity of behavior. This heterogeneity has profound consequences for economic theory and for econometric practice. (4) Microeconometrics has contributed substantially to the scientific evaluation of public policy.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "673-748", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/322086", "e:year": 2001, "e:title": "Micro Data, Heterogeneity, and the Evaluation of Public Policy: Nobel Lecture", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "4"}, {"e:author": ["Kelly Bedard"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/322089", "e:volume": "109", "e:abstract": "Under the educational sorting hypothesis, an environment in which some individuals are constrained from entering university will be characterized by increased pooling at the high school graduation level, as compared to an environment with greater university access. This results because some potential high school dropouts and university enrollees choose the high school graduate designation in order to take advantage of high-ability individuals who are constrained from entering university. This is in stark contrast to human capital theory, which predicts higher university enrollment but identical high school dropout rates in regions with greater university access. I test the contradictory high school dropout predictions of the human capital and signaling models using NLSYM and NLSYW education data from the late 1960s and early 1970s. I find that labor markets that contain universities have higher high school dropout rates. This result is consistent with a signaling model and inconsistent with a pure human capital model.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "749-775", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/322089", "e:year": 2001, "e:title": "Human Capital versus Signaling Models: University Access and High School Dropouts", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "4"}, {"e:author": ["Gregory D.

Our exploration suggests that neither hypothesis is true. The desire of incumbent leaders with unfavorable economic performance to hold on to power generates an incentive to initiate conflict and salvage their positionwith some probability. An equilibrium with positive war frequency is sustained even if all nations were to adopt representative democratic institutions and even in the absence of an appropriative motive for war.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "776-810", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/322085", "e:year": 2001, "e:title": "War and Democracy", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "4"}, {"e:author": ["Joshua D.

These returns are particularly strong among funds that are small and old, focus on few holdings, and operate out of remote areas. Furthermore, we find that while the average fund exhibits only a modest bias toward local stocks, certain funds strongly bias their holdings locally and exhibit even greater local performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the extent to which a firm is held by nearby investors is positively related to its future expected return. Our results suggest that investors trade local securities at an informational advantage and point toward a link between such trading and asset prices.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "811-841", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/322088", "e:year": 2001, "e:title": "The Geography of Investment: Informed Trading and Asset Prices", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "4"}, {"e:author": ["Gianni De Fraja", "Jozsef Sakovics"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/322087", "e:volume": "109", "e:abstract": "We extend the standard analysis of decentralized markets to allow for the possibility that traders interact simultaneously with more than one trader on the opposite side of the market.
