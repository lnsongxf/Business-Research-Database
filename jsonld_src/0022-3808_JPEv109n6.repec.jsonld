The expectation that these future deficits would be at least partially financed by seigniorage revenues or an inflation tax on outstanding nominal debt led to a collapse of the fixed exchange rate regimes in Asia. We articulate this view using a simple model whose key feature is that a speculative attack is inevitable once the present value of future government deficits rises.

The key to our identification strategy is a hidden richness inherent in two-car crashes.

The externality per mile driven by a drunk driver is at least 30 cents. At current enforcement rates the punishment per arrest for drunk driving that internalizes this externality would be equivalent to a fine of $8,000.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1198-1237", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/323281", "e:year": 2001, "e:title": "How Dangerous Are Drinking Drivers?", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "6"}, {"e:author": ["Martin Lettau", "Sydney Ludvigson"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/323282", "e:volume": "109", "e:abstract": "This paper explores the ability of conditional versions of the CAPM and the consumption CAPMjointly the (C)CAPMto explain the cross section of average stock returns.

Each buyer is privately informed about his own valuation. Thus all players are imperfectly informed about market demand. We study the monopolist's pricing behavior as players' uncertainty regarding demand vanishes in the limit. In the limit, players are perfectly informed about the downward-sloping demand. We show that in all games belonging to a fixed and open neighborhood of the limit game there exists a generically unique equilibrium outcome that exhibits Coasian dynamics and in which play lasts for at most two periods. A laboratory experiment shows that, consistent with our theory, outcomes in the Certain and Uncertain Demand treatments are the same. Median opening prices in both treatments are roughly at the level predicted and considerably below the monopoly price. Consistent with Coasian dynamics, these prices are lower for higher discount factors. Demand withholding, however, leads to more trading periods than predicted.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1311-1354", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/323272", "e:year": 2001, "e:title": "Durable Goods, Coasian Dynamics, and Uncertainty: Theory and Experiments", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "6"}, {"e:author": ["Debraj Ray", "Rajiv Vohra"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/323275", "e:volume": "109", "e:abstract": "We study the provision of public goods when all agents have complete information and can write binding agreements. This framework is in deliberate contrast to a traditional view of the free-rider problem based on hidden information or voluntary provision. We focus on coalition formation as a potential source of inefficiency. To this end, we develop a notion of an equilibrium coalition structure, based on the assumption that each coalition that forms does so under a rational prediction of the society-wide coalition structure. In a simple model, we characterize the (unique) equilibrium coalition structure. Only in some cases does the equilibrium involve full cooperation, resulting in efficient provision of the public good. In other cases, the equilibrium consists of several coalitions and inefficient provision.
