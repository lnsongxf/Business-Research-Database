Despite its prominence and importance, this central tenet of economic federalism has never been empirically evaluated. This paper presents the first formal test of the link between preference heterogeneity and endogenous policy decentralization using as a case study liquor control in the United States over the period 193470. The results are reassuring: States with more heterogeneous preferences are more likely to decentralize liquor control and allow for local government decision making.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1-36", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/324393", "e:year": 2002, "e:title": "Endogenous Policy Decentralization: Testing the Central Tenet of Economic Federalism", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "1"}, {"e:author": ["Igal Hendel", "Alessandro Lizzeri"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/324387", "e:volume": "110", "e:abstract": "Leasing contracts are extensively used in durable goods markets. These contracts specify a rental rate and an option price at which the used good can be bought on termination of the lease. This option price cannot be controlled when the car is sold. We show that in a world in which quality is observable, this additional control variable is ineffective. Under adverse selection instead, leasing contracts affect equilibrium allocations in a way that matches observed behavior in the car market. Consistent with the data, our model predicts that leased cars have a higher turnover and that off-lease used cars are of higher quality. Moreover, the model predicts that the recent increase in leasing can be explained by the observed increase in car durability. We show that leasing contracts can improve welfare but that they are imperfect tools. We also show that a producer with market power can benefit from leasing contracts for two reasons: market segmentation and better pricing of the option. Moreover, despite the fact that lessors could structure contracts to prevent adverse selection, we show that this is not in their interest.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "113-143", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/324387", "e:year": 2002, "e:title": "The Role of Leasing under Adverse Selection", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "1"}, {"e:author": ["Philip DeCicca", "Donald Kenkel", "Alan Mathios"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/324386", "e:volume": "110", "e:abstract": "This paper reexamines whether higher cigarette taxes will substantially reduce youth smoking.

In our approach, the sex ratio in the marriage market and the rules governing divorce are examples of \"distribution factors.\" These factors are defined as variables that affect the household members' bargaining position but not preferences or the joint budget set. We extend the collective labor supply model developed by Chiappori to allow for distribution factors. We show that our model imposes new restrictions on the labor supply functions and eases the identification of individual preferences and the intrahousehold decision process. The model is estimated using PSID data for the year 1988. Our results do not reject the restrictions imposed by the model.
