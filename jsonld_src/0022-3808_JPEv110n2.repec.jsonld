Theoretically, the net impact of tenancy reform is shown to be a combination of two effects: a bargaining power effect and a security of tenure effect. Analysis of evidence on how contracts and productivity changed after a tenancy reform program was implemented in the Indian state of West Bengal in the late 1970s suggests that tenancy reform had a positive effect on agricultural productivity there.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "239-280", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/338744", "e:year": 2002, "e:title": "Empowerment and Efficiency: Tenancy Reform in West Bengal", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "2"}, {"e:author": ["Simon J.

Since versions of both theories can predict this equation, we tackle the model identification problem by conditioning bilateral trade relations on factor endowment differences and on the share of intraindustry trade. Only for large differences in factor endowments does the Heckscher-Ohlin model predict perfect production specialization in different countries as well as the gravity equation, and trade is purely in goods produced with different factor intensities. Our empirical analysis yields three findings. First, the predictions of the perfect specialization versions of both theories are rejected by the data and so are unlikely explanations for the empirical success of the gravity equation. Second, a model of imperfect specialization that includes both increasing returns and factor endowments as sources of trade has a mixed performance: it correctly predicts production of more differentiated goods when the level of intraindustry trade is greater; however, the predicted link to factor proportions is tenuous. Third, the predictions of a model with imperfect specialization that relies solely on differences in factor endowments find support in the data. These results suggest that factor endowments and increasing returns explain different components of the international variation of production patterns and trade volumes.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "281-316", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/338746", "e:year": 2002, "e:title": "On Theories Explaining the Success of the Gravity Equation", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "2"}, {"e:author": ["Orazio P.

Our data set contains information on average currency, deposits, and other interest-bearing assets; the number of trips to the bank; the size of withdrawals; and ownership and use of ATM cards. We model the demand for currency accounting for adoption of new transaction technologies and the decision to hold interest-bearing assets. The interest rate and expenditure flow elasticities of the demand for currency are close to the theoretical values implied by standard inventory models. However, we find significant differences between individuals with an ATM card and those without. The estimates of the demand for currency allow us to calculate a measure of the welfare cost of inflation analogous to Bailey's triangle, but based on a rigorous microeconometric framework. The welfare cost of inflation varies considerably within the population but never turns out to be very large (about 0.1 percent of consumption or less). Our results are robust to various changes in the econometric specification. In addition to the main results based on the average stock of currency, the model receives further support from the analysis of the number of trips to and average withdrawals from the bank and the ATM.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "317-351", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/338743", "e:year": 2002, "e:title": "The Demand for Money, Financial Innovation, and the Welfare Cost of Inflation: An Analysis with Household Data", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "2"}, {"e:author": ["Daniel F.

First, we document that bidders vary their prices, bid dispersion, and the quantity demanded in response to increased uncertainty at the time of bidding. Second, we find that bid shading can be explained by a winner's cursedriven model in which each bidder submits only one bid, despite the fact that the bidders in our data set use much richer bidding strategies. Third, we explore the extent to which the received theories of multiunit auctions are able to offer insights into the bidder behavior we observe. Our empirical evidence is consistent with some of the predictions of the models of auctions that emphasize private information, the winner's curse and the champion's plague.

The theoretical analysis shows that in an economy with an infinitely large number of donors, impurely altruistic preferences lead to either asymptotically zero or complete crowd-out. The paper then establishes conditions on preferences that are sufficient to yield zero crowd-out in the limit. These conditions are fairly weak and quite plausible. An empirical representation of the model is estimated using a new 198692 panel of donations and government funding from the United States to 125 international relief and development organizations. Besides directly linking sources of public and private support, the econometric analysis controls for unobserved institution-specific factors, institution-specific changes in leadership, year-to-year changes in need, and expenditures by related organizations. The estimates show little evidence of crowd-out from either direct public or related private sources. Thus, at the margin, donations to these organizations appear to be motivated solely by joy-of-giving preferences. In addition to addressing the basic question of motives behind charitable giving, the results help explain the existing disparity between econometric and experimental crowd-out estimates.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "425-457", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/338750", "e:year": 2002, "e:title": "Altruistic and Joy-of-Giving Motivations in Charitable Behavior", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "2"}, {"e:author": ["Douglas Gollin"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/338747", "e:volume": "110", "e:abstract": "Many widely used economic models implicitly assume that income shares should be identical across time and space.
