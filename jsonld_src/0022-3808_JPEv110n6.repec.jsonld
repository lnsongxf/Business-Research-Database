Emitters of the controlled pollutants in nonattainment counties were subject to greater regulatory oversight than emitters in attainment counties. The preferred statistical model for plant-level growth includes plant fixed effects, industry by period fixed effects, and county by period fixed effects. The estimates from this model suggest that in the first 15 years in which the Clean Air Act was in force (197287), nonattainment counties (relative to attainment ones) lost approximately 590,000 jobs, $37 billion in capital stock, and $75 billion (1987 dollars) of output in pollution-intensive industries. These findings are robust across many specifications, and the effects are apparent in many polluting industries.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1175-1219", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/342808", "e:year": 2002, "e:title": "The Impacts of Environmental Regulations on Industrial Activity: Evidence from the 1970 and 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments and the Census of Manufactures", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "6"}, {"e:author": ["S.

To recover a version of Barro's random walk tax-smoothing outcome, we modify Lucas and Stokey's economy to permit only risk-free debt. Having only risk-free debt confronts the Ramsey planner with additional constraints on equilibrium allocations beyond one imposed by Lucas and Stokey's assumption of complete markets. The Ramsey outcome blends features of Barro's model with Lucas and Stokey's. In our model, the contemporaneous effects of exogenous government expenditures on the government deficit and taxes resemble those in Lucas and Stokey's model, but incomplete markets put a nearunit root component into government debt and taxes, an outcome like Barro's. However, we show that without ad hoc limits on the government's asset holdings, outcomes can diverge in important ways from Barro's. Our results use and extend recent advances in the consumption-smoothing literature.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1220-1254", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/343744", "e:year": 2002, "e:title": "Optimal Taxation without State-Contingent Debt", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "6"}, {"e:author": ["Yeung Lewis Chan", "Leonid Kogan"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/342806", "e:volume": "110", "e:abstract": "We analyze a general equilibrium exchange economy with a continuum of agents who have \"catching up with the Joneses\" preferences and differ only with respect to the curvature of their utility functions.

We show that both the conditional risk premium and the return volatility are negatively related to the level of stock prices.

However, there is very little experience with applying incentives in schools. This paper provides evidence on the causal effects of two programs: the first provided the school and its teachers with monetary performance incentives and the second with additional conventional resources. The assignment of schools to the two programs was not random; therefore, identification is a central issue in the empirical analysis. The empirical results suggest that schools' and teachers' group monetary incentives caused significant gains in many dimensions of students' outcomes. Endowing schools with more resources also led to improvement in student performance. However, the comparison based on cost equivalency suggests that the teachers' incentive intervention is much more cost effective.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1286-1317", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/342810", "e:year": 2002, "e:title": "Evaluating the Effect of Teachers' Group Performance Incentives on Pupil Achievement", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "6"}, {"e:author": ["Reza Baqir"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/342804", "e:volume": "110", "e:abstract": "Theories of government spending driven by a common-pool problem in the fiscal revenues pool predict that greater districting of a political jurisdiction raises the scale of government.

At the same time, stable monthly earnings for minimum-wage earners were mandated. We show that workers employed 40 hours and above in March 1981 were more likely to lose their jobs between 1981 and 1982 than workers employed 3639 hours in March 1981. Moreover, many workers were still working 40 hours after February. These workers were also strongly affected by this reduction.
