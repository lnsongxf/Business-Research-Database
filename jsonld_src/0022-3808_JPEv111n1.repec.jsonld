Rather than relying on one stylized model to provide an exact interpretation of the data, we explore an incomplete model based on two simple assumptions: bidders neither bid more than their valuations nor let an opponent win at a price they would be willing to beat. Focusing on the symmetric independent private values paradigm, we show that this limited structure enables construction of informative bounds on the distribution function characterizing bidder demand, on the optimal reserve price, and on the effects of observable covariates on bidder valuations. If the standard theoretical model happens to be the true model, our bounds collapse to the true features of interest. In contrast, when the true data‚Äêgenerating process deviates in seemingly small ways from that implied by equilibrium in the standard theoretical model, existing methods can yield misleading results that need not even lie within our bounds. We report results from Monte Carlo experiments illustrating the performance of our approach and comparing it to others. We apply our approach to U.S. Forest Service timber auctions to evaluate reserve price policy.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1-51", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/344801", "e:year": 2003, "e:title": "Inference with an Incomplete Model of English Auctions", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "1"}, {"e:author": ["James Peck", "Karl Shell"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/344803", "e:volume": "111", "e:abstract": "We analyze a banking system in which the class of feasible deposit contracts, or mechanisms, is broad. The mechanisms must satisfy a sequential service constraint, but partial or full suspension of convertibility is allowed. Consumers must be willing to deposit, ex ante. We show, by examples, that under the so-called \"optimal contract,\" the postdeposit game can have a run equilibrium. Given a propensity to run, triggered by sunspots, the optimal contract for the full predeposit game can be consistent with runs that occur with positive probability. Thus the Diamond-Dybvig framework can explain bank runs as emerging in equilibrium under the optimal deposit contract.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "103-123", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/344803", "e:year": 2003, "e:title": "Equilibrium Bank Runs", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "1"}, {"e:author": ["Matthew J.

Tenure regimes are the result of interactions between those seeking to defend claims to land and those seeking to infringe on those claims. The model highlights the dependence of land ownership on ecological parameters, such as resource density and predictability, and allows for situational ownership, in which the nature of ownership changes as realized ecological conditions change.

This paper rationalizes the apparent effectiveness of this argument in both direct and indirect democracies. In direct democracies, a small degree of voter altruism leads to protection in the specific factors model when the import-competing sector earns little. Similarly, voter altruism creates an incentive in representative democracies for self-interested parties to present evidence to legislators on the income of import-competing factors. This leads to a theory in which campaign contributions buy access to legislators rather than buy votes.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "174-201", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/344804", "e:year": 2003, "e:title": "Commercial Policy with Altruistic Voters", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "1"}, {"e:author": ["Pravin Krishna"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/344802", "e:volume": "111", "e:abstract": "A central statement of the theory of natural trading partners is that preferential trading with regional trading partners is less likely to be trade diverting and therefore geographically proximate partners are to be considered \"natural\" partners for preferential arrangements. This paper examines this question empirically. The analytical framework involves a general equilibrium model of preferential trade and an econometric model with tight links to this theory. This framework is used to implement tests of the natural trading partners hypothesis using U.S. trade data for the years 196495: Welfare changes that would result from preferential tariff reductions by the United States against various trading partners are first estimated, and correlations with bilateral \"distance\" measures (with and without controls for income levels) are then examined. Since the argument for \"natural\" trading partners is based on the greater likelihood of geographically proximate countries to be more significant trading partners, correlations between the welfare change estimates and bilateral trade volume are examined as well. Both geographic proximity and trade volume are found to have no effect. Thus this paper is unable to find any support for the natural trading partners theory in U.S. data.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "202-231", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/344802", "e:year": 2003, "e:title": "Are Regional Trading Partners \"Natural\"?", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "1"}, {"e:author": ["Kei-Mu Yi"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/344805", "e:volume": "111", "e:abstract": "The striking growth in the trade share of output is one of the most important developments in the world economy since World War II. Two features of this growth present challenges to the standard trade models. First, the growth is generally thought to have been generated by falling tariff barriers worldwide. But tariff barriers have decreased by only about 11 percentage points since the early 1960s; the standard models cannot explain the growth of trade without assuming counterfactually large elasticities of substitution between goods. Second, tariff declines were much larger prior to the mid 1980s than after, and yet, trade growth was smaller in the earlier period than in the later period. The standard models have difficulty generating this nonlinear feature. This paper develops a two-country dynamic Ricardian trade model that offers a resolution of these two puzzles. The key idea embedded in this model is vertical specialization, which occurs when countries specialize only in particular stages of a good's production sequence. The model generates a nonlinear trade response to tariff reductions and can explain over 50 percent of the growth of trade. Finally, the model has important implications for the gains from trade.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "52-102", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/344805", "e:year": 2003, "e:title": "Can Vertical Specialization Explain the Growth of World Trade?", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "1"}]
