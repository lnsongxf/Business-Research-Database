The adoption of teams at the plant improved worker productivity by 14 percent on average. Productivity improvement was greatest for the earliest teams and diminished as more workers engaged in team production, providing support for the view that teams utilize collaborative skills, which are less valuable in individual production. High-productivity workers tended to join teams first, despite a loss in earnings in many cases, suggesting nonpecuniary benefits associated with teamwork. Finally, more heterogeneous teams were more productive, with average ability held constant, which is consistent with explanations emphasizing mutual team learning and intrateam bargaining.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "465-497", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/374182", "e:year": 2003, "e:title": "Team Incentives and Worker Heterogeneity: An Empirical Analysis of the Impact of Teams on Productivity and Participation", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "3"}, {"e:author": ["Andrew Schotter", "Barry Sopher"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/374187", "e:volume": "111", "e:abstract": "We investigate the creation and evolution of conventions of behavior in \"intergenerational games\" or games in which a sequence of nonoverlapping \"generations\" of players play a stage game for a finite number of periods and are then replaced by other agents who continue the game in their role for an identical length of time.

Among forward-looking, expected-utility-maximizing consumers who face liquidity constraints and earnings uncertainty, economic theory predicts that the incentive to conserve should be strongest among families with the youngest children. We test this prediction using data from Florida's Family Transition Program, a randomized welfare reform experiment. Our estimates generally exhibit the predicted age dependence, which suggests that time limits affect welfare use before they become binding. Our estimates indicate that, in the absence of other reforms that increased welfare use, FTP's time limit would have reduced welfare receipt by 16 percent.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "530-554", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/374181", "e:year": 2003, "e:title": "Welfare Dynamics under Time Limits", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "3"}, {"e:author": ["David Dranove", "Daniel Kessler", "Mark McClellan", "Mark Satterthwaite"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/374180", "e:volume": "111", "e:abstract": "Health care report cards' public disclosure of patient health outcomes at the level of the individual physician or hospital or bothmay address important informational asymmetries in markets for health care, but they may also give doctors and hospitals incentives to decline to treat more difficult, severely ill patients. Whether report cards are good for patients and for society depends on whether their financial and health benefits outweigh their costs in terms of the quantity, quality, and appropriateness of medical treatment that they induce. Using national data on Medicare patients at risk for cardiac surgery, we find that cardiac surgery report cards in New York and Pennsylvania led both to selection behavior by providers and to improved matching of patients with hospitals. On net, this led to higher levels of resource use and to worse health outcomes, particularly for sicker patients.
