Stock returns in the model are completely characterized by a conditional capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Size and book-to-market are correlated with the true conditional market beta and therefore appear to predict stock returns. The cross-sectional relations between firm characteristics and returns can subsist even after one controls for typical empirical estimates of beta. These findings suggest that the empirical success of size and book-to-market can be consistent with a single-factor conditional CAPM model.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "693-732", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/375379", "e:year": 2003, "e:title": "Equilibrium Cross Section of Returns", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "4"}, {"e:author": ["B.
