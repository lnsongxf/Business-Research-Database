The main conclusion is that the decline in income inequality that took place during the first half of the century was mostly accidental. In France, and possibly in a number of other countries as well, wage inequality has been extremely stable in the long run, and the secular decline in income inequality is for the most part a capital income phenomenon. Holders of large fortunes were badly hurt by major shocks during the 191445 period, and they were never able to fully recover from these shocks, probably because of the dynamic effects of progressive taxation on capital accumulation and pretax income inequality.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1004-1042", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/376955", "e:year": 2003, "e:title": "Income Inequality in France, 1901-1998", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "5"}, {"e:author": ["Marianne Bertrand", "Sendhil Mullainathan"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/376950", "e:volume": "111", "e:abstract": "Much of our understanding of corporations builds on the idea that managers, when they are not closely monitored, will pursue goals that are not in shareholders' interests. But what goals would managers pursue? This paper uses variation in corporate governance generated by state adoption of antitakeover laws to empirically map out managerial preferences. We use plant-level data and exploit a unique feature of corporate law that allows us to deal with possible biases associated with the timing of the laws. We find that when managers are insulated from takeovers, worker wages (especially those of white-collar workers) rise. The destruction of old plants falls, but the creation of new plants also falls. Finally, overall productivity and profitability decline in response to these laws. Our results suggest that active empire building may not be the norm and that managers may instead prefer to enjoy the quiet life.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1043-1075", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/376950", "e:year": 2003, "e:title": "Enjoying the Quiet Life?

As a consequence, the commission fee from selling a house will differ dramatically across cities depending on the average price of housing, although the effort necessary to match buyers and sellers may not be that different. We use a simple economic model to show that if barriers to entry are low, the entry of real estate agents in cities with high housing prices is socially inefficient. Consistent with our model, we find that when the average price of land in a city increases, (1) the fraction of real estate brokers in a city increases, (2) the productivity of an average real estate agent (houses sold per hour worked) falls, and (3) the real wage of a typical real estate agent remains unchanged. We cannot completely rule out the alternative explanation that these results reflect unmeasured differences in the quality of broker services. However, we present evidence that as the average price of housing in a city increases, there is only a small increase in the amount of time a buyer spends searching for a house, and the average time a house for sale stays on the market falls.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1076-1122", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/376953", "e:year": 2003, "e:title": "Can Free Entry Be Inefficient?

In the absence of these groups, the policy maker's desire for reelection guarantees that good policies are implemented for every realization of the shock. When pressure groups can harass the policy maker, good policies will be chosen for only a subset of states of nature. Hence, honest and able leaders might implement bad policies, and needed reforms could be delayed. In order to make good policies more likely, the public will want to increase the cost of exerting pressure for \"nasty groups\" and provide rents to those in power. This last result can be used to explain the existence of political parties. They play a role resembling that of the supervisor in the literature on collusion in hierarchical agency. A rational public may also choose to ignore negative media reports on a politician's personal life and, in general, elect \"strong\" political leaders. The prevalence of coercive methods of influence helps explain why countries may get to be governed by \"inept politicians.\"", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1123-1152", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/376951", "e:year": 2003, "e:title": "Capture by Threat", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "5"}, {"e:author": ["Canice Prendergast"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/376956", "e:volume": "111", "e:abstract": "Bureaucracies tend to be used when consumers cannot be trusted to choose outcomes efficiently.
