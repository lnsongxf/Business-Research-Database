While time-varying risk preferences induce the standard positive relation between the dividend yield and expected returns, time-varying expected dividend growth induces a negative relation between them. These offsetting effects reduce the ability of the dividend yield to forecast returns and eliminate its ability to forecast dividend growth, as observed in the data. The model links the predictability of returns to that of dividend growth, suggesting specific changes to standard linear predictive regressions for both. The model's predictions are confirmed empirically.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1-47", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/379934", "e:year": 2004, "e:title": "Understanding Predictability", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "1"}, {"e:author": ["Ivo Welch"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/379933", "e:volume": "112", "e:abstract": "U.S. corporations do not issue and repurchase debt and equity to counteract the mechanistic effects of stock returns on their debt-equity ratios. Thus over one- to five-year horizons, stock returns can explain about 40 percent of debt ratio dynamics. Although corporate net issuing activity is lively and although it can explain 60 percent of debt ratio dynamics (long-term debt issuing activity being most capital structurerelevant), corporate issuing motives remain largely a mystery.

Empirical identification of borrowing constraints is secured by the economic prediction that opportunity costs and direct costs of schooling affect borrowing-constrained and unconstrained persons differently. Direct costs need to be financed during school and impose a larger burden on credit-constrained students. By contrast, gross forgone earnings do not have to be financed. We explore the implications of this idea using four methodologies: schooling attainment models, instrumental variable wage regressions, and two structural economic models that integrate both schooling choices and schooling returns into a unified framework. None of the methods produces evidence that borrowing constraints generate inefficiencies in the market for schooling in the current policy environment. We conclude that, on the margin, additional policies aimed at improving credit access will have little impact on schooling attainment.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "132-182", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/379937", "e:year": 2004, "e:title": "Estimation of Educational Borrowing Constraints Using Returns to Schooling", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "1"}, {"e:author": ["Amy Finkelstein", "James Poterba"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/379936", "e:volume": "112", "e:abstract": "We use a unique data set of annuities in the United Kingdom to test for adverse selection. We find systematic relationships between ex post mortality and annuity characteristics, such as the timing of payments and the possibility of payments to the annuitant's estate. These patterns are consistent with the presence of asymmetric information. However, we find no evidence of substantive mortality differences by annuity size.
