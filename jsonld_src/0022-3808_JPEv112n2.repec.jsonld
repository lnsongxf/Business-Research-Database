We consider whether a long, contentious strike and the hiring of replacement workers at Bridgestone/Firestone's Decatur, Illinois, plant in the mid-1990s contributed to the production of defective tires. Using several independent data sources and looking before and after the strike and across plants, we find that labor strife at the Decatur plant closely coincided with lower product quality. Monthly data suggest that defects were particularly high around the time concessions were demanded and when large numbers of replacement workers and returning strikers worked side by side.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "253-289", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/381479", "e:year": 2004, "e:title": "Strikes, Scabs, and Tread Separations: Labor Strife and the Production of Defective Bridgestone/Firestone Tires", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "2"}, {"e:author": ["Gregory D.

Love, however, can complicate the picture. If love is fleeting or the resolution of agents' income uncertainty occurs predominantly later in life, then marriages with good economic matches last longer. In contrast, if love is persistent and the resolution of uncertainty to agents' income occurs early, then marriages with good economic matches are more likely to be caught short with too little love to save a marriage. Consequently, once married, the partners will be more likely to divorce. Evidence is provided to distinguish between these alternative scenarios.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "290-318", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/381477", "e:year": 2004, "e:title": "Marriage and Consumption Insurance: What's Love Got to Do with It?", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "2"}, {"e:author": ["Erik Hurst", "Annamaria Lusardi"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/381478", "e:volume": "112", "e:abstract": "The propensity to become a business owner is a nonlinear function of wealth. The relationship between wealth and entry into entrepreneurship is essentially flat over the majority of the wealth distribution. It is only at the top of the wealth distributionafter the ninety-fifth percentilethat a positive relationship can be found. Segmenting businesses into industries with high and lowstarting capital requirements, we find no evidence that wealth matters more for businesses requiring higher initial capital. When using inheritances as an instrument for wealth, we find that both past and future inheritances predict current business entry, showing that inheritances capture more than simply liquidity. We further exploit the regional variation in house prices and find that households that lived in regions in which housing prices appreciated strongly were no more likely to start a business than households in other regions.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "319-347", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/381478", "e:year": 2004, "e:title": "Liquidity Constraints, Household Wealth, and Entrepreneurship", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "2"}, {"e:author": ["Alberto Alesina", "Reza Baqir", "Caroline Hoxby"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/381474", "e:volume": "112", "e:abstract": "We investigate whether political jurisdictions form in response to the trade-off between economies of scale and the costs of a heterogeneous population.

We resolve this long-standing question using new empirical methods applied to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the Survey of Consumer Finances, and the Consumer Expenditure Survey. We find a strong positive relationship between saving rates and lifetime income and a weaker but still positive relationship between the marginal propensity to save and lifetime income. There is little support for theories that seek to explain these positive correlations by relying solely on time preference rates, nonhomothetic preferences, or variations in Social Security benefits. There is more support for models emphasizing uncertainty with respect to income and health expenses, bequest motives, and asset-based means testing or behavioral factors causing minimal saving rates among low-income households.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "397-444", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/381475", "e:year": 2004, "e:title": "Do the Rich Save More?", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "2"}, {"e:author": ["Rafael La Porta", "Florencio Lopez-de-Silanes", "Cristian Pop-Eleches", "Andrei Shleifer"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/381480", "e:volume": "112", "e:abstract": "In the Anglo-American constitutional tradition, judicial checks and balances are often seen as crucial guarantees of freedom. Hayek distinguishes two ways in which the judiciary provides such checks and balances: judicial independence and constitutional review.

We find strong support for the proposition that both judicial independence and constitutional review are associated with greater freedom. Consistent with theory, judicial independence accounts for some of the positive effect of common-law legal origin on measures of economic freedom.

We quantify the effects of tax rates on tax evasion by examining the relationship in China between the tariff schedule and the \"evasion gap,\" which we define as the difference between Hong Kong's reported exports to China at the product level and China's reported imports from Hong Kong. Our results imply that a one-percentage-point increase in the tax rate is associated with a 3 percent increase in evasion. Furthermore, the evasion gap is negatively correlated with tax rates on closely related products, suggesting that evasion takes place partly through misclassification of imports from higher-taxed categories to lower-taxed ones, in addition to underreporting the value of imports.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "471-500", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/381476", "e:year": 2004, "e:title": "Tax Rates and Tax Evasion: Evidence from \"Missing Imports\" in China", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "2"}]
