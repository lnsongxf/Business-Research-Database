[{"e:author": ["Emily Oster"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/498588", "e:volume": "113", "e:abstract": "In many Asian countries the ratio of male to female population is higher than in the West: as high as 1.07 in China and India, and even higher in Pakistan. A number of authors (most notably Amartya Sen) have suggested that this imbalance reflects excess female mortality and have argued that as many as 100 million women are \"missing.\" This paper proposes an explanation for some of the observed overrepresentation of men: the hepatitis B virus. I present new evidence, consistent with an existing scientific literature, that carriers of the hepatitis B virus have offspring sex ratios around 1.50 boys for each girl. This evidence includes both cross-country analyses and a natural experiment based on recent vaccination campaigns. Hepatitis B is common in many Asian countries, especially China, where some 10&ndash;15 percent of the population is infected. Using data on prevalence of the virus by country and estimates of the effect of hepatitis on the sex ratio, I argue that hepatitis B can account for about 45 percent of the \"missing women\": around 75 percent in China, between 20 and 50 percent in Egypt and western Asia, and under 20 percent in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1163-1216", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/498588", "e:year": 2005, "e:title": "Hepatitis B and the Case of the Missing Women", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "6"}, {"e:author": ["Mathias Dewatripont", "Jean Tirole"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/497999", "e:volume": "113", "e:abstract": "The paper develops a theory of costly communication in which the sender's and receiver's motivations and abilities endogenously determine the communication mode and the transfer of knowledge.

We generalize Rosen's first stage to account for product characteristics that are not observed and to allow the hedonic pricing function to have a general nonseparable form. We take an alternative semiparametric approach to Rosen's second stage in which we assume that the parametric form of utility is known, but we place no restrictions on the aggregate distribution of utility parameters. If there are only a small number of products, we show how to construct bounds on individuals' utility parameters, as well as other economic objects such as aggregate demand and consumer surplus.

Comparing wages with population, however, suggests that the break from the technological stagnation of the Malthusian era came around 1640, long before the classic Industrial Revolution, and even before the arrival of modern democracy in 1689. Building wages also conflict with human capital interpretations of the Industrial Revolution, as modeled by Gary Becker, Kevin Murphy, and Robert Tamura; Oded Galor and David Weil; and Robert Lucas.

It is also the poorest region of the world. In this paper I ask whether banning polygyny could play any role for development. Using a quantitative model of polygyny, I find that enforcing monogamy lowers fertility, shrinks the spousal age gap, and reverses the direction of marriage payments. Polygyny leads to high bride-prices to \"ration\" women, which makes buying wives and selling daughters a good investment, thus crowding out investment in physical assets. For reasonable parameter values, I find that banning polygyny decreases fertility by 40 percent, increases savings by 70 percent, and increases output per capita by 170 percent.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1341-1370", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/498049", "e:year": 2005, "e:title": "Polygyny, Fertility, and Savings", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "6"}]
