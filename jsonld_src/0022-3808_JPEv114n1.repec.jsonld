This study designs a field experiment that is explicitly linked to a controlled laboratory experiment to examine whether, and to what extent, social preferences influence outcomes in actual market transactions. While agents drawn from a well-functioning marketplace behave in accord with social preference models in tightly controlled laboratory experiments, when they are observed in their naturally occurring settings, their behavior approaches what is predicted by self-interest theory. In the limit, much of the observed behavior in the marketplace that is consistent with social preferences is due to reputational concerns: suppliers who expect to have future interactions with buyers provide higher product quality only when the buyer can verify quality via a third-party certifier. The data also speak to theories of how reputation effects enhance market performance. In particular, reputation and the monitoring of quality are found to be complements, and findings suggest that the private market can solve the lemons problem through third-party verification.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1-37", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/498587", "e:year": 2006, "e:title": "The Behavioralist Meets the Market: Measuring Social Preferences and Reputation Effects in Actual Transactions", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "1"}, {"e:author": ["Anna L.

We use illegal drugs as a prominent example. We show that the more inelastic either demand for or supply of a good is, the greater the increase in social cost from further reducing its production by greater enforcement efforts. So optimal public expenditures on apprehension and conviction of illegal suppliers depend not only on the difference between the social and private values from consumption but also on these elasticities. When demand and supply are not too elastic, it does not pay to enforce any prohibition unless the social value is negative. We also show that a monetary tax could cause a greater reduction in output and increase in price than optimal enforcement against the same good would if it were illegal, even though some producers may go underground to avoid a monetary tax. When enforcement is costly, excise taxes and quantity restrictions are not equivalent.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "38-60", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/498918", "e:year": 2006, "e:title": "The Market for Illegal Goods: The Case of Drugs", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "1"}, {"e:author": ["J.
