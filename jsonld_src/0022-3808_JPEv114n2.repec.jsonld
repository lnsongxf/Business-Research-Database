This paper proposes a simple test for placebo effects. Instead of comparing the treatment and control arms of a single trial, one should compare the treatment arms of two trials with different probabilities of assignment to treatment. If there are placebo effects, patients in the higher-probability trial will experience better outcomes simply because they believe that there is a greater chance of receiving treatment. This paper finds evidence of placebo effects in trials of antiulcer and cholesterol-lowering drugs.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "236-256", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/500279", "e:year": 2006, "e:title": "Identifying Placebo Effects with Data from Clinical Trials", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "2"}, {"e:author": ["Mikhail Golosov", "Aleh Tsyvinski"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/500549", "e:volume": "114", "e:abstract": "We analyze an implementation of an optimal disability insurance system as a competitive equilibrium with taxes. An optimum is implemented by an asset-tested disability system in which a disability transfer is paid only if an agent has assets below a specified maximum. The logic behind this result is that an agent who plans to falsely claim disability (a) finds doing so unattractive if he does not adjust his savings and (b) cannot collect disability insurance if he does adjust his savings in the desired direction (upward). For a calibrated economy, we find that welfare gains from asset testing are significant.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "257-279", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/500549", "e:year": 2006, "e:title": "Designing Optimal Disability Insurance: A Case for Asset Testing", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "2"}, {"e:author": ["Matthew Gentzkow", "Jesse M.

We use this fact to build a model of media bias in which firms slant their reports toward the prior beliefs of their customers in order to build a reputation for quality. Bias emerges in our model even though it can make all market participants worse off. The model predicts that bias will be less severe when consumers receive independent evidence on the true state of the world and that competition between independently owned news outlets can reduce bias. We present a variety of empirical evidence consistent with these predictions.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "280-316", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/499414", "e:year": 2006, "e:title": "Media Bias and Reputation", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "2"}, {"e:author": ["Salvador Barbera", "Matthew O.
