The real equipment price, crucial for identifying the investment shocks, experiences an abrupt increase in its average rate of decline in 1982, so the analysis is based on a split sample. On the basis of the preferred specification, the two technology shocks account for 73 percent of hours' and 44 percent of output's business cycle variation before 1982, and 38 percent and 80 percent afterward. The shocks also account for more than 40 percent of hours' and 58 percent of output's forecast errors over a three- to eight-year horizon in both samples. The majority of these effects are driven by the investment shocks.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "413-451", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/505048", "e:year": 2006, "e:title": "The Dynamic Effects of Neutral and Investment-Specific Technology Shocks", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "3"}, {"e:author": ["George-Marios Angeletos", "Christian Hellwig", "Alessandro Pavan"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/504901", "e:volume": "114", "e:abstract": "This paper introduces signaling in a global game so as to examine the informational role of policy in coordination environments such as currency crises and bank runs. While exogenous asymmetric information has been shown to select a unique equilibrium, we show that the endogenous information generated by policy interventions leads to multiple equilibria. The policy maker is thus trapped into a position in which self-fulfilling expectations dictate not only the coordination outcome but also the optimal policy. This result does not rely on the freedom to choose out-of-equilibrium beliefs, nor on the policy being a public signal; it may obtain even if the policy is observed with idiosyncratic noise.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "452-484", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/504901", "e:year": 2006, "e:title": "Signaling in a Global Game: Coordination and Policy Traps", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "3"}, {"e:author": ["Alberto Bisin", "Piero Gottardi"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/503754", "e:volume": "114", "e:abstract": "Do Walrasian markets function orderly in the presence of adverse selection? In particular, is their outcome efficient when exclusive contracts are enforceable? This paper addresses these questions in the context of a Rothschild-Stiglitz insurance economy. We identify an externality associated with the presence of adverse selection as a special form of consumption externality. Consequently, we show that competitive equilibria always exist but are not typically incentive efficient. However, as markets for pollution rights can internalize environmental externalities, markets for consumption rights can be designed to internalize the consumption externality due to adverse selection. With such markets competitive equilibria exist and incentive-constrained versions of the first and second welfare theorems hold.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "485-516", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/503754", "e:year": 2006, "e:title": "Efficient Competitive Equilibria with Adverse Selection", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "3"}, {"e:author": ["M.

We show that capuchins react rationally to both price and wealth shocks but display several hallmark biases when faced with gambles, including reference dependence and loss aversion. Given our capuchins' inexperience with money and trade, these results suggest that loss aversion extends beyond humans and may be innate rather than learned.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "517-537", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/503550", "e:year": 2006, "e:title": "How Basic Are Behavioral Biases?

This paper highlights a way in which underdevelopment exacerbates productivity risk. Productivity shocks cause larger changes in the wage when workers are poorer, less able to migrate, and more credit-constrained because of such workers' inelastic labor supply. This equilibrium wage effect hurts workers. In contrast, it acts as insurance for landowners. Agricultural wage data for 257 districts in India for 1956&ndash;87 are used to test the predictions, with rainfall as an instrument for agricultural productivity. In districts with fewer banks or higher migration costs, the wage is much more responsive to fluctuations in productivity.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "538-575", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/503579", "e:year": 2006, "e:title": "Selling Labor Low: Wage Responses to Productivity Shocks in Developing Countries", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "3"}, {"e:author": ["Karsten Jeske"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/503755", "e:volume": "114", "e:abstract": "The risk of repudiation plays a central role in determining the size of international capital flows.
