With optimal decision rules, we compare, household by household, wealth predictions from the life cycle model using a nationally representative sample. We find, making use of household-specific earnings histories, that the model accounts for more than 80 percent of the 1992 cross-sectional variation in wealth. Fewer than 20 percent of households have less wealth than their optimal targets, and the wealth deficit of those who are undersaving is generally small.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "607-643", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/506335", "e:year": 2006, "e:title": "Are Americans Saving \"Optimally\" for Retirement?", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "4"}, {"e:author": ["Edward Simpson Prescott", "Robert M.

The traded commodities are multiagent contracts that include a description of the individual's job, effort level, and state-contingent consumption. These contracts are club goods. The competitive equilibrium and the Pareto program are formulated. The contracts are identified with firms, so the market determines which firms exist and who is assigned to which firm in what capacity. An example is provided in which the internal organization of firms and the distribution of firm classes vary with the aggregate capital endowment and its distribution across agents. A simplex-based algorithm for solving the Pareto program is developed.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "644-671", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/505231", "e:year": 2006, "e:title": "Firms as Clubs in Walrasian Markets with Private Information", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "4"}, {"e:author": ["In Utero"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/507154", "e:volume": "114", "e:abstract": "This paper uses the 1918 influenza pandemic as a natural experiment for testing the fetal origins hypothesis.

I use evidence from Romania, where in 1966 dictator Nicolae Ceauescu declared abortion and family planning illegal. Birth rates doubled in 1967 because formerly abortion had been the primary method of birth control. Children born after the abortion ban attained more years of schooling and greater labor market success. The reason is that urban, educated women were more likely to have abortions prior to the policy change, and the relative number of children born to this type of woman increased after the ban. However, when I control for composition using observable background variables, children born after the ban on abortions had worse educational and labor market achievements as adults.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "744-773", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/506336", "e:year": 2006, "e:title": "The Impact of an Abortion Ban on Socioeconomic Outcomes of Children: Evidence from Romania", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "4"}, {"e:author": ["Peter M.

Without commitment, the problem is similar to durable goods monopoly: the share price today depends on expected future trades. We show that the large shareholder ultimately trades to the competitive price-taking allocation, even though it entails inefficient monitoring. With continuous trading, the large shareholder trades immediately to this allocation if moral hazard is weak enough that her private valuation of a share is decreasing in her stake. Otherwise, the large shareholder adjusts her stake gradually.
