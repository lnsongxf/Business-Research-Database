We study the optimal reward policy when the quality of the ideas and their subsequent development effort are private information. Monopoly power is a scarce resource to be allocated across innovators who arrive at various times. The optimal assignment of property rights must counterbalance the incentives of current and future innovators. The resulting mechanism resembles a menu of patents that have infinite duration and fixed scope. This optimal patent menu can be implemented with a simple buyout scheme: The innovator commits at the outset to a price ceiling at which he will sell his rights to a future inventor. When a larger fee is paid initially, a higher price ceiling is obtained. Any subsequent innovator must pay this price and purchase his own buyout fee contract. We relate this mechanism to the proposed compulsory licensing schemes.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1041-1068", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/510562", "e:year": 2006, "e:title": "Rewarding Sequential Innovators: Prizes, Patents, and Buyouts", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "6"}, {"e:author": ["Matthias Doepke", "Martin Schneider"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/508379", "e:volume": "114", "e:abstract": "This study quantitatively assesses the effects of inflation through changes in the value of nominal assets. It documents nominal asset positions in the United States across sectors and groups of households and estimates the wealth redistribution caused by a moderate inflation episode. The main losers from inflation are rich, old households, the major bondholders in the economy. The main winners are young, middle-class households with fixed-rate mortgage debt. Besides transferring resources from the old to the young, inflation is a boon for the government and a tax on foreigners. Lately, the amount of U.S. nominal assets held by foreigners has grown dramatically, increasing the potential for a large inflation-induced wealth transfer from foreigners to domestic households.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1069-1097", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/508379", "e:year": 2006, "e:title": "Inflation and the Redistribution of Nominal Wealth", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "6"}, {"e:author": ["Claudio Michelacci", "Javier Suarez"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/509816", "e:volume": "114", "e:abstract": "We consider a directed search model in which workers differ in productivity. Productivity becomes observable to firms after assessing their workers on the job, but it is not verifiable. Firms with vacancies choose between posting a noncontingent wage and leaving wages subject to bargaining with the worker. Under wage bargaining, firms cannot optimize the trade-off between paying higher wages and having a larger probability of filling vacancies. But wage bargaining makes wages increasing in worker productivity and so may allow firms to attract better workers into the vacancy. When workers' heterogeneity is large and bargaining powers come close to satisfying Hosios's rule, firms opt for bargaining. Yet, equilibria with bargaining fail to maximize aggregate net income and sometimes are not constrained Pareto optimal.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1098-1123", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/509816", "e:year": 2006, "e:title": "Incomplete Wage Posting", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "6"}, {"e:author": ["Lones Smith"], "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/510440", "e:volume": "114", "e:abstract": "Consider a heterogeneous agent matching model in which the payoff of each matched individual is a fixed function of both partners' types.

Matching is positively assortative&mdash;higher types match with higher sets of types&mdash;when the proportionate gains from having better partners rise in one's type.

We analyze an influential AIDS clinical trial, ACTG 175, and show that for many subjects, AZT yields the highest level of utility despite having the smallest impact on the publicly observed outcome because of mild side effects. Moreover, although subjects enter the experiment uncertain of treatment effectiveness (and often the treatment received), the learning process implies that early dropout in ACTG 175 is primarily driven by side effects, whereas later attrition reflects declining treatment effectiveness.", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "997-1040", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/508239", "e:year": 2006, "e:title": "Learning, Private Information, and the Economic Evaluation of Randomized Experiments", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "6"}]
