Consequently, the cash flows and stock returns of durable&hyphen;good producers are exposed to higher systematic risk. Using the benchmark input&hyphen;output accounts of the National Income and Product Accounts, we construct portfolios of durable&hyphen;good, nondurable&hyphen;good, and service producers. In the cross section, an investment strategy that is long on the durable&hyphen;good portfolio and short on the service portfolio earns a risk premium exceeding 4 percent annually. In the time series, an investment strategy that is long on the durable&hyphen;good portfolio and short on the market portfolio earns a countercyclical risk premium. We explain these findings in a general equilibrium asset&hyphen;pricing model with endogenous production."}, {"e:volume": "117", "e:author": ["Philipp Kircher"], "e:issue": "5", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/644791", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "861-913", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/644791", "e:year": 2009, "e:title": "Efficiency of Simultaneous Search", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:volume": "117", "e:author": ["Yeon-Koo Che", "Navin Kartik"], "e:issue": "5", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/648432", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "815-860", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/648432", "e:year": 2009, "e:title": "Opinions as Incentives", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:volume": "117", "e:author": ["Edward P.
