The receiver observes only a signal provided by the sender and accepts the prospect if his Bayesian inference about the prospect's relevance exceeds his opportunity cost. The sender's profits are typically maximized by partial information disclosure, whereby the receiver is induced to accept less relevant but more profitable prospects (\"switches\") by pooling them with more relevant but less profitable ones (\"baits\"). Extensions include maximizing a weighted sum of sender profits and receiver surplus and allowing the sender to use monetary incentives."}, {"e:author": ["Manuel Amador", "Pierre-Olivier Weill"], "e:volume": "118", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/657923", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "866 - 907", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/657923", "e:year": 2010, "e:title": "Learning from Prices: Public Communication and Welfare", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We study the effect of releasing public information about productivity or monetary shocks using a micro-founded macroeconomic model in which agents learn from the distribution of nominal prices. While a public release has the direct beneficial effect of providing new information, it also has the indirect adverse effect of reducing the informational efficiency of the price system. We show that the negative indirect effect can dominate. Thus, the public information release may increase uncertainty about the monetary shock and reduce welfare. We find that the optimal communication policy is always to release either all or none of the information."}, {"e:author": ["Ali Horta&#x000E7;su", "David McAdams"], "e:volume": "118", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/657948", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "833 - 865", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/657948", "e:year": 2010, "e:title": "Mechanism Choice and Strategic Bidding in Divisible Good Auctions: An Empirical Analysis of the Turkish Treasury Auction Market", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We propose an estimation method to bound bidders' marginal valuations in discriminatory auctions using individual bid-level data and apply the method to data from the Turkish Treasury auction market. Using estimated bounds on marginal values, we compute an upper bound on the inefficiency of realized allocations as well as bounds on how much additional revenue could have been realized in a counterfactual uniform price or Vickrey auction. We conclude that switching from a discriminatory auction to a uniform price or Vickrey auction would not significantly increase revenue. Moreover, such a switch would increase bidder expected surplus by at most 0.02 percent."}, {"e:author": ["Emmanuel Farhi"], "e:volume": "118", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/657996", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "908 - 948", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/657996", "e:year": 2010, "e:title": "Capital Taxation and Ownership When Markets Are Incomplete", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "This paper is a normative investigation of the properties of optimal capital taxation in the neoclassical growth model with aggregate shocks and incomplete markets. The model features a representative-agent economy with linear taxes on labor and capital. I first allow the government to trade only a real risk-free bond. Optimal policy has the following features: labor taxes fluctuate very little, capital taxes are volatile and feature a positive (negative) spike after a negative (positive) shock to the government budget, and capital taxes average to roughly zero across periods. I then consider the implications of allowing the government to trade capital."}, {"e:author": ["Paul Beaudry", "Mark Doms", "Ethan Lewis"], "e:volume": "118", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/658371", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "988 - 1036", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/658371", "e:year": 2010, "e:title": "Should the Personal Computer Be Considered a Technological Revolution? Evidence from U.S. Metropolitan Areas", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "The introduction and diffusion of personal computers are widely viewed as a technological revolution. Using U.S. metropolitan area-level panel data, this paper asks whether links between PC adoption, educational attainment, and the return to skill conform to a model of technological revolutions in which the speed and extent of adoption are endogenous. The model implies that cities will adjust differently to the arrival of a more skill-intensive means of production, with the returns to skill increasing most where skill is abundant and its return is low. We show that the cross-city data fit many of the predictions of the model during the period 1980-2000, the PC diffusion era."}]
