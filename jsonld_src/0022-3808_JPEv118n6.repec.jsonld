A firm enters a market if it is profitable to incur the marginal cost to reach a single consumer. It then faces an increasing marginal penetration cost to access additional consumers. The model, therefore, can reconcile the observed positive relationship between entry and market size with the existence of many small exporters in each exporting market. Comparative statics of trade liberalization predict a large increase in trade for goods with positive but low volumes of previous trade."}, {"e:author": ["Daron Acemoglu"], "e:volume": "118", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/658160", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1037 - 1078", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1086/658160", "e:year": 2010, "e:title": "When Does Labor Scarcity Encourage Innovation?", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "This paper studies whether labor scarcity encourages technological advances, that is, technology adoption or innovation, for example, as claimed by Habakkuk in the context of nineteenth-century United States. I define technology as strongly labor saving if technological advances reduce the marginal product of labor and as strongly labor complementary if they increase it. I show that labor scarcity encourages technological advances if technology is strongly labor saving and will discourage them if technology is strongly labor complementary. I also show that technology can be strongly labor saving in plausible environments but not in many canonical macroeconomic models."}, {"e:author": ["Volker Nocke", "Michael D.

Approving a currently proposed merger may affect the profitability and welfare effects of potential future mergers, whose characteristics may not yet be known. We identify conditions under which discounted expected consumer surplus is maximized by using a completely myopic merger review policy that approves a merger if and only if it does not lower consumer surplus given the current market structure. We also discuss a number of extensions as well as factors that undermine the optimality of myopic merger review policies."}, {"e:author": ["Brian Knight", "Nathan Schiff"], "e:volume": "118", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/658372", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1110 - 1150", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1086/658372", "e:year": 2010, "e:title": "Momentum and Social Learning in Presidential Primaries", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "This paper investigates social learning in sequential voting systems. In the econometric model, candidates experience momentum effects when their performance in early states exceeds expectations. The empirical application uses daily polling data from the 2004 presidential primary. We find that Kerry benefited from surprising wins in early states and took votes away from Dean. Owing to these momentum effects, early voters had up to five times the influence of late voters in the selection of candidates, and this helps to explain the distribution of advertising expenditures. Finally, we use the estimated model to conduct two counterfactual experiments."}, {"e:author": ["Timothy Erickson", "Toni M.

We analyze a model with moral hazard and a two-sided lack of commitment. After agents have chosen their work, firms can modify contracts and agents can switch firms. If the ex post market outcome satisfies a weak notion of competitiveness and sufficiently separates individuals, it is Pareto superior to a government's allocation with a complete breakdown of incentives. Moreover, competitive markets without commitment implement more effort in equilibrium under general conditions."}]
