We conduct an empirical analysis of our model, which combines cross-country-correlated long-run risk with Epstein and Zin preferences, using U.S. and U.K. data, and show that it successfully reconciles international prices and quantities, thereby solving the international equity premium puzzle. These results provide evidence suggesting a link between common long-run growth perspectives and exchange rate movements."}, {"e:author": ["Andrew T. Foerster", "Pierre-Daniel G. Sarte", "Mark W.

An approximate factor model finds that nearly all of IP variability is associated with common factors. We then use a multisector growth model to adjust for the effects of input-output linkages in the factor analysis. Thus, a structural factor analysis indicates that the Great Moderation was characterized by a fall in the importance of aggregate shocks while the volatility of sectoral shocks was essentially unchanged. Consequently, the role of idiosyncratic shocks increased considerably after the mid-1980s, explaining half of the quarterly variation in IP."}, {"e:author": ["Lawrence Christiano", "Martin Eichenbaum", "Sergio Rebelo"], "e:volume": "119", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/659312", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "78 - 121", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1086/659312", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "When Is the Government Spending Multiplier Large?", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We argue that the government-spending multiplier can be much larger than one when the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate binds. The larger the fraction of government spending that occurs while the nominal interest rate is zero, the larger the value of the multiplier. After providing intuition for these results, we investigate the size of the multiplier in a dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium model. In this model the multiplier effect is substantially larger than one when the zero bound binds. Our model is consistent with the behavior of key macro aggregates during the recent financial crisis."}, {"e:author": ["Ralph Ossa"], "e:volume": "119", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/659371", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "122 - 152", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1086/659371", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "A \"New Trade\" Theory of GATT/WTO Negotiations", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "I suggest a novel theory of GATT/WTO negotiations based on Krugman's \"new trade\" model.

At the end of 2 years of the program, students in incentive schools performed significantly better than those in control schools by 0.27 and 0.17 standard deviations in math and language tests, respectively. We find no evidence of any adverse consequences of the program. The program was highly cost effective, and incentive schools performed significantly better than other randomly chosen schools that received additional schooling inputs of a similar value."}]
