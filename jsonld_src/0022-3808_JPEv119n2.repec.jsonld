Using a 12-year county-level panel, we find that a 10 percent increase in births that occur in hospitals with EMRs reduces neonatal mortality by 16 deaths per 100,000 live births. This is driven by a reduction of deaths from conditions requiring careful monitoring. We also find a strong decrease in mortality when we instrument for EMR adoption using variation in state medical privacy laws. Rough cost-effectiveness calculations suggest that EMRs are associated with a cost of $531,000 per baby's life saved."}, {"e:author": ["Lucas W.

We demonstrate the empirical importance of this allocative cost for the U.S. residential market for natural gas, which was subject to price ceilings during 1954-89. Using a household-level, discrete-continuous model of natural gas demand, we estimate that the allocative cost in this market averaged $3.6 billion annually, nearly tripling previous estimates of the net welfare loss to U.S. consumers."}, {"e:author": ["Nicola Persico", "Jos&#x000E9; C.

Before elections, factions compete to direct local public goods to their local constituencies. The model of factional competition delivers a rich set of implications relating the internal organization of the party to the allocation of resources. In doing so, the model provides a unified explanation of two prominent features of public resource allocations: the persistence of (possibly inefficient) policies and the tendency of public spending to favor incumbent party strongholds over swing constituencies."}, {"e:author": ["Alessandro Gavazza"], "e:volume": "119", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/660730", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "325 - 377", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1086/660730", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Leasing and Secondary Markets: Theory and Evidence from Commercial Aircraft", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "I develop a model of costly capital reallocation to understand how leasing reduces trading frictions. Leased assets trade more frequently and produce more output than owned assets because (1) high-volatility firms are more likely to lease than low-volatility firms and (2) firms shed leased asssets faster than owned assets amid productivity shocks because of lower transaction costs. Commercial aircraft data show that leased aircraft have holding durations 38 percent shorter and fly 6.5 percent more hours than owned aircraft. These differences arise primarily because when profitability declines, carriers keep owned aircraft and return leased aircraft, which lessors redeploy to more productive operators."}, {"e:author": ["Vijay Krishna", "John Morgan"], "e:volume": "119", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/660731", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "183 - 211", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1086/660731", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Overcoming Ideological Bias in Elections", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We study a model in which voters choose between two candidates on the basis of both ideology and competence. While the ideology of the candidates is commonly known, voters are imperfectly informed about competence. Voter preferences, however, are such that ideology alone determines voting. When voting is compulsory, the candidate of the majority ideology prevails, and this may not be optimal from a social perspective. However, when voting is voluntary and costly, we show that turnout adjusts endogenously so that the outcome of a large election is always first-best."}]
