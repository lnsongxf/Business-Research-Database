The Economics of Counterinsurgency in Iraq", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We develop and test an economic theory of insurgency motivated by the informal literature and by recent military doctrine. We model a three-way contest between violent rebels, a government seeking to minimize violence by mixing service provision and coercion, and civilians deciding whether to share information about insurgents. We test the model using panel data from Iraq on violence against Coalition and Iraqi forces, reconstruction spending, and community characteristics (sectarian status, socioeconomic grievances, and natural resource endowments). Our results support the theory's predictions: improved service provision reduces insurgent violence, particularly for smaller projects and since the \"surge\" began in 2007."}, {"e:author": ["Dimitris Papanikolaou"], "e:volume": "119", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/662221", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "639 - 685", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1086/662221", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Investment Shocks and Asset Prices", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "I explore the implications for asset prices and macroeconomic dynamics of shocks that improve real investment opportunities and thus affect the representative household's marginal utility. These investment shocks generate differences in risk premia due to their heterogeneous impact on firms: they benefit firms producing investment relative to firms producing consumption goods and increase the value of growth opportunities relative to the value of existing assets. Using data on asset returns, I find that a positive investment shock leads to high marginal utility states. A general equilibrium model with investment shocks matches key features of macroeconomic quantities and asset prices."}, {"e:author": ["Sergiu Hart"], "e:volume": "119", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/662222", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "617 - 638", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1086/662222", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Comparing Risks by Acceptance and Rejection", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Stochastic dominance is a partial order on risky assets (\"gambles\") that is based on the uniform preference--of all decision-makers in an appropriate class--for one gamble over another. We modify this requirement, first, by taking into account the status quo (given by the current wealth) and the possibility of rejecting gambles, and second, by comparing rejections that are substantive (i.e., uniform over wealth levels or over utilities). This yields two new stochastic orders: \"wealth-uniform dominance\" and \"utility-uniform dominance.\" Unlike stochastic dominance, these two orders are complete: any two gambles can be compared. Moreover, they are equivalent to the orders induced by, respectively, the Aumann-Serrano index of riskiness and the Foster-Hart measure of riskiness."}, {"e:author": ["Paul Niehaus"], "e:volume": "119", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/662627", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "686 - 720", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1086/662627", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Filtered Social Learning", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Knowledge sharing is economically important but also typically incomplete: we \"filter\" our communication. This paper analyzes the consequences of filtering. In the model, homogeneous agents share knowledge with their peers whenever the private benefits exceed communication costs. The welfare implications of this transmission mechanism hinge on whether units of knowledge complement, substitute for, or are independent of each other. Both substitutability and complementarity generate externalities; cheaper communication eliminates externalities in the former case but not necessarily in the latter. Complementary basic skills such as numeracy catalyze technology adoption, and adoption may be path dependent even when payoffs are certain and independent across agents."}, {"e:author": ["Pablo Fajgelbaum", "Gene M.

In our model, consumers with heterogeneous incomes and tastes purchase a homogeneous good and make a discrete choice of quality and variety of a differentiated product. The distribution of preferences generates a nested-logit demand structure such that the fraction of consumers who buy a higher-quality product rises with income. The model features a home-market effect that helps to explain why richer countries export higher-quality goods. It provides a tractable tool for studying the welfare consequences of trade and trade policy for different income groups in an economy."}]
