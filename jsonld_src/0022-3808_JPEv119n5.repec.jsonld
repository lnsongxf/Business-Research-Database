Standard risk-sharing regressions assume that any variation in households' risk preferences is uncorrelated with variation in the cyclicality of income. I combine administrative and survey data to show that this assumption is questionable: Risk-tolerant workers hold jobs in which earnings carry more aggregate risk. The correlation makes risk-sharing regressions in the previous literature too pessimistic. I derive techniques that eliminate the bias, apply them to U.S. data, and find that the effect of idiosyncratic income shocks on consumption is practically small and statistically difficult to distinguish from zero."}, {"e:author": ["Emeric Henry", "Carlos J.

Imitators may \"enter\" the market by imitating the innovation at a cost or by buying from the inventor the knowledge necessary to reproduce and use the invention. The possibility of contracting dramatically affects the need for patent protection. Our results show that (i) imitators wait to enter the market and the inventor becomes a temporary monopolist; (ii) the inventor sells knowledge through contracts that allow resale by the imitators; and (iii) under certain conditions, the inventor's payoff increases with the number of imitators."}, {"e:author": ["Mark Carlson", "Kris James Mitchener", "Gary Richardson"], "e:volume": "119", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/662961", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "889 - 924", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/662961", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Arresting Banking Panics: Federal Reserve Liquidity Provision and the Forgotten Panic of 1929", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Scholars differ on whether central bank intervention mitigates banking panics. In April 1929, a fruit fly infestation in Florida forced the U.S. government to quarantine fruit shipments from the state and destroy infested groves. In July, depositors panicked in Tampa and surrounding cities. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta rushed currency to member banks beset by runs. We show that this intervention arrested the panic and estimate that bank failures would have been twice as high without the Federal Reserve's intervention. Our results suggest that similar interventions may have reduced bank failures during the Great Depression."}, {"e:author": ["Daniel Aaronson", "Bhashkar Mazumder"], "e:volume": "119", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/662962", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "821 - 888", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/662962", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "The Impact of Rosenwald Schools on Black Achievement", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "The black-white gap in schooling among southern-born men narrowed sharply between the world wars. From 1914 to 1931, nearly 5,000 schools were constructed as part of the Rosenwald Rural Schools Initiative. Using census data and World War II records, we find that the Rosenwald program accounts for a sizable portion of the educational gains of rural southern blacks. We find significant effects on school attendance, literacy, years of schooling, cognitive test scores, and northern migration. The gains are highest in the most disadvantaged counties, suggesting that schooling treatments have the largest impact among those with limited access to education."}, {"e:author": ["Jennifer Brown"], "e:volume": "119", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/663306", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "982 - 1013", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/663306", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Quitters Never Win: The (Adverse) Incentive Effects of Competing with Superstars", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Internal competition may motivate worker effort, yet the benefits of competition may depend critically on workers' relative abilities: large skill differences may reduce efforts. I use panel data from professional golf tournaments and find that the presence of a superstar is associated with lower performance. On average, golfers' first-round scores are approximately 0.2 strokes worse when Tiger Woods participates relative to when Woods is absent. The overall tournament effect is 0.8 strokes. The adverse superstar effect varies with the quality of Woods's play. There is no evidence that reduced performance is attributable to media attention intensity or risky strategy adoption."}]
