The main technical result is an existence theorem for approximate CEEI. The mechanism is approximately efficient, satisfies two new criteria of outcome fairness, and is strategyproof in large markets. Its performance is explored on real data, and it is compared to alternatives from theory and practice: all other known mechanisms are either unfair ex post or manipulable even in large markets, and most are both manipulable and unfair."}, {"e:author": ["Louis Kaplow"], "e:volume": "119", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/664614", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1104 - 1140", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1086/664614", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "On the Optimal Burden of Proof", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "The burden of proof, a central feature of adjudication and other decision-making contexts, constitutes an important but largely unappreciated policy instrument. The optimal strength of the burden of proof, as well as optimal enforcement effort and sanctions, involves trading off deterrence and the chilling of desirable behavior, the latter being absent in previous work. The character of the optimum differs markedly from prior results and from conventional understandings of proof burdens. There are important divergences across models in which enforcement involves monitoring, investigation, and auditing. A number of extensions are analyzed, in one instance nullifying key results in prior work."}, {"e:author": ["Ronald L. Goettler", "Brett R.

Firms make dynamic pricing and investment decisions while consumers make dynamic upgrade decisions, anticipating product improvements and price declines. Consistent with Schumpeter, we find that the rate of innovation in product quality would be 4.2 percent higher without AMD present, though higher prices would reduce consumer surplus by $12 billion per year. Comparative statics illustrate the role of product durability and provide implications of the model for other industries."}, {"e:author": ["Lauren Cohen", "Joshua Coval", "Christopher Malloy"], "e:volume": "119", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/664820", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1015 - 1060", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1086/664820", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Do Powerful Politicians Cause Corporate Downsizing?", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "This paper employs a new empirical approach for identifying the impact of government spending on the private sector. Our key innovation is to use changes in congressional committee chairmanships as a source of exogenous variation in state-level federal expenditures. We show that fiscal spending shocks appear to significantly dampen corporate investment activity. This retrenchment occurs within large and small states and is most pronounced among geographically concentrated firms. The effects are economically meaningful, and the mechanism--entirely distinct from interest rate and tax channels--suggests new considerations in assessing the impact of government spending on private-sector economic activity."}, {"e:author": ["Federico Echenique", "Sangmok Lee", "Matthew Shum"], "e:volume": "119", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/665011", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1201 - 1223", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1086/665011", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "The Money Pump as a Measure of Revealed Preference Violations", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We introduce a measure of the severity of violations of the revealed preference axioms, the money pump index (MPI). The MPI is the amount of money one can extract from a consumer who violates the axioms. It is also a statistical test for the hypothesis that a consumer is rational when behavior is observed with error. We present an application using a panel data set of food expenditures. The data exhibit many violations of the axioms. Mostly, the MPI for these violations is small. The MPI indicates that the hypothesis of consumer rationality cannot be rejected."}]
