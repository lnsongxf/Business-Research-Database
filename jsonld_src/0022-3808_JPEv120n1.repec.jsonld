A Case for Supply-Side Environmental Policy", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Free-riding is at the core of environmental problems. If a climate coalition reduces its emissions, world prices change and nonparticipants typically emit more; they may also extract the dirtiest type of fossil fuel and invest too little in green technology. The coalition's second-best policy distorts trade and is not time consistent. However, suppose that the countries can trade the rights to exploit fossil-fuel deposits: As soon as the market clears, the above-mentioned problems vanish and the first-best is implemented. In short, the coalition's best policy is to simply buy foreign deposits and conserve them."}, {"e:author": ["Thomas J.

Therefore, large debts accumulated during the US War for Independence traded at deep discounts. That situation framed a US fiscal crisis in the 1780s. A political revolution--for that was what scuttling the Articles of Confederation in favor of the Constitution of the United States of America was--solved the fiscal crisis by transferring authority to levy tariffs from the states to the federal government. The Constitution and acts of the First Congress of the United States in August 1790 gave Congress authority to raise enough revenues to service a big government debt. In 1790, the Congress carried out a comprehensive bailout of state governments' debts, part of a grand bargain that made creditors of the states become advocates of ample federal taxes. That bailout created expectations about future federal bailouts that a costly episode in the early 1840s proved to be unwarranted."}, {"e:author": ["Jeremy Bulow", "Paul Klemperer"], "e:volume": "120", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/665416", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "160 - 186", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1086/665416", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Regulated Prices, Rent Seeking, and Consumer Surplus", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Price controls lead to misallocation of goods and encourage rent seeking. The misallocation effect alone ensures that a price control always reduces consumer surplus in an otherwise-competitive market with convex demand if supply is more elastic than demand or with log-convex demand (e.g., constant elasticity) even if supply is inelastic. The same results apply whether rationed goods are allocated by costless lottery or whether costly rent seeking and/or partial decontrol mitigates the inefficiency. Our analysis exploits the observation that in any market, consumer surplus equals the area between the demand curve and the industry marginal revenue curve."}, {"e:author": ["Olivier Coibion", "Yuriy Gorodnichenko"], "e:volume": "120", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/665662", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "116 - 159", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1086/665662", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "What Can Survey Forecasts Tell Us about Information Rigidities?", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "A lot. We derive common and conflicting predictions from models in which agents face information constraints and then assess their validity using surveys of consumers, firms, central bankers, and professional forecasters. We document that mean forecasts fail to completely adjust on impact to shocks, leading to statistically and economically significant deviations from the null of full information. The dynamics of forecast errors after shocks are consistent with the predictions of models with information rigidities. The conditional responses of forecast errors and disagreement among agents can also be used to differentiate between some of the most prominent models of information rigidities."}, {"e:author": ["Matz Dahlberg", "Karin Edmark", "Hel&#x000E9;ne Lundqvist"], "e:volume": "120", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/665800", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "41 - 76", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1086/665800", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Ethnic Diversity and Preferences for Redistribution", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "This paper investigates the causal link between the ethnic diversity in a society and its inhabitants' preferences for redistribution. We exploit exogenous variation in immigrant shares stemming from a nationwide program placing refugees in municipalities throughout Sweden during 1985-94 and match data on refugee placement to panel survey data on inhabitants of the receiving municipalities. We find significant, negative effects of increased immigration on the support for redistribution. The effect is especially pronounced among high-income earners. We also establish that estimates from earlier studies failing to identify causal effects are likely to be positively biased (i.e., less negative)."}]
