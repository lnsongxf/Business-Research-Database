Economic expansions induce higher entry rates by prospective entrants subject to sunk investment costs. The sluggish response of the number of producers generates a new and potentially important endogenous propagation mechanism for business cycle models. The return to investment determines household saving decisions, producer entry, and the allocation of labor across sectors. Our framework replicates several features of business cycles and predicts procyclical profits even for preference specifications that imply countercyclical markups."}, {"e:author": ["Arvind Krishnamurthy", "Annette Vissing-Jorgensen"], "e:volume": "120", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/666526", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "233 - 267", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1086/666526", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "The Aggregate Demand for Treasury Debt", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Investors value the liquidity and safety of US Treasuries. We document this by showing that changes in Treasury supply have large effects on a variety of yield spreads. As a result, Treasury yields are reduced by 73 basis points, on average, from 1926 to 2008. Both the liquidity and safety attributes of Treasuries are driving this phenomenon. We document this by analyzing the spread between assets with different liquidity (but similar safety) and those with different safety (but similar liquidity). The low yield on Treasuries due to their extreme safety and liquidity suggests that Treasuries in important respects are similar to money."}, {"e:author": ["Ian Martin"], "e:volume": "120", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/666527", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "346 - 358", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1086/666527", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "On the Valuation of Long-Dated Assets", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "I show that the pricing of a broad class of long-dated assets is driven by the possibility of extraordinarily bad news. This result does not depend on any assumptions about the existence of disasters, nor does it apply only to assets that hedge bad outcomes; indeed, it applies even to long-dated claims on the market in a lognormal world if the market's Sharpe ratio is higher than its volatility, as appears to be the case in practice."}, {"e:author": ["Cristina Arellano", "Ananth Ramanarayanan"], "e:volume": "120", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/666589", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "187 - 232", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1086/666589", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Default and the Maturity Structure in Sovereign Bonds", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "This paper studies the maturity composition and the term structure of interest rate spreads of government debt in emerging markets. In the data, when interest rate spreads rise, debt maturity shortens and the spread on short-term bonds rises more than the spread on long-term bonds. We build a dynamic model of international borrowing with endogenous default and multiple debt maturities. Long-term debt provides a hedge against future fluctuations in spreads, whereas short-term debt is more effective at providing incentives to repay. The trade-off between these hedging and incentive benefits is quantitatively important for understanding the maturity structure in emerging markets."}, {"e:author": ["Lars Lefgren", "Matthew J.

We show how a particular set of instrumental variables could separately identify the money and human capital transmission effects. Using data from a 35 percent sample of Swedish sons and their fathers, we show that only a minority of the intergenerational income elasticity can be plausibly attributed to the causal effect of fathers' financial resources."}]
