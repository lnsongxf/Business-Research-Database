Using monthly panel data, I document an empirical relationship among coresidence, individual labor market events, and subsequent earnings growth. I estimate the parameters of a dynamic game between youths and parents to show that the option to live at home can account for features of aggregate data for low-skilled young workers: small consumption responses to shocks, high labor elasticities, and low savings rates."}, {"e:author": ["Scott Baker", "Claudio Mezzetti"], "e:volume": "120", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/666655", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "513 - 551", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1086/666655", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "A Theory of Rational Jurisprudence", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We examine a dynamic model of up-or-down problem solving. A decision maker can either spend resources investigating a new problem before deciding what to do or decide on the basis of similarity with precedent problems. Over time, a decision-making framework, or jurisprudence, develops. We focus on the model's application to judge-made law. We show that judges summarily apply precedent in some cases. The law may converge to efficient or inefficient rules. With positive probability, identical cases are treated differently. As the court learns over time, inconsistencies become less likely. We discuss the existing empirical evidence and the model's testable implications."}, {"e:author": ["Douglas W. Diamond", "Raghuram G.

Authorities may not want to stand by and watch banks collapse. However, unconstrained direct bailouts undermine the disciplinary role of deposits. Moreover, competition forces banks to promise depositors more, increasing intervention and making the system worse off. By contrast, constrained central bank intervention to lower rates maintains private discipline, while offsetting contractual rigidity. It may still lead banks to make excessive liquidity promises. Anticipating this, central banks should raise rates in normal times to offset distortions from reducing rates in adverse times."}, {"e:author": ["Leonardo Bursztyn", "Lucas C.

We elicit parents' choices between monthly government transfers conditional on their adolescent child attending school and guaranteed, unconditional transfers of varying sizes. In the baseline treatment, an overwhelming majority of parents prefer conditional transfers to larger unconditional transfers. However, few parents prefer conditional payments if they are offered text message notifications whenever their child misses school. These findings suggest important intergenerational conflicts in these schooling decisions, a lack of parental control and observability of school attendance, and an additional rationale for conditional cash transfer programs--the monitoring they provide."}, {"e:author": ["Emmanuel Farhi", "Iv&#x000E1;n Werning"], "e:volume": "120", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/666747", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "000 - 000", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1086/666747", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Capital Taxation: Quantitative Explorations of the Inverse Euler Equation", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Economies with private information provide a rationale for capital taxation. In this paper we ask what the welfare gains from following this prescription are. We develop a method to answer this question in standard general equilibrium models with idiosyncratic uncertainty and incomplete markets. We find that general equilibrium forces are important and greatly reduce the welfare gains. Once these effects are taken into account, the gains are relatively small in our benchmark calibration. These results do not imply that dynamic aspects of social insurance design are unimportant, but they do suggest that capital taxation may play a modest role."}]
