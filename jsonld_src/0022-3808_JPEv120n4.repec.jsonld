We show that, under testable assumptions, these indices are ordinally identified and that the male and female trade-offs between their partners' characteristics are overidentified. Using PSID data on married couples, we recover the marginal rates of substitution between body mass index (BMI) and wages or education: men may compensate 1.3 additional units of BMI with a 1 percent increase in wages, whereas women may compensate two BMI units with 1 year of education."}, {"e:author": ["&#x0013D;ubo&#x00161; P&#x000E1;stor", "Robert F.

Our explanation features decreasing returns to scale: As the industry's size increases, every manager's ability to outperform passive benchmarks declines. The poor track record occurred before the growth of indexing modestly reduced the share of active management to its current size. At this size, better performance is expected by investors who believe in decreasing returns to scale. Such beliefs persist because persistence in industry size causes learning about returns to scale to be slow. The industry should shrink only moderately if its underperformance continues."}, {"e:author": ["Alessandra Casella", "Aniol Llorente-Saguer", "Thomas R.

Before voting on a binary issue, individuals may buy and sell their votes with each other. We define the concept of ex ante vote-trading equilibrium and show by construction that an equilibrium exists. The equilibrium we characterize always results in dictatorship if there is any trade, and the market for votes generates welfare losses, relative to simple majority voting, if the committee is large enough or the distribution of values is not very skewed. We test the theoretical implications in the laboratory using a continuous open-book multiunit double auction."}, {"e:author": ["Alwyn Young"], "e:volume": "120", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/668501", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "696 - 739", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1086/668501", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "The African Growth Miracle", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Measures of real consumption based on the ownership of durable goods, the quality of housing, the health and mortality of children, the education of youths, and the allocation of female time in the household indicate that sub-Saharan living standards have, for the past two decades, been growing about 3.4-3.7 percent per year, that is, three and a half to four times the rate indicated in international data sets."}, {"e:author": ["Christos Genakos", "Mario Pagliero"], "e:volume": "120", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/668502", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "782 - 813", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1086/668502", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Interim Rank, Risk Taking, and Performance in Dynamic Tournaments", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We empirically study the impact of interim rank on risk taking and performance using data on professionals competing in tournaments for large rewards. As we observe both the intended action and the performance of each participant, we can measure risk taking and performance separately. We present two key findings. First, risk taking exhibits an inverted-U relationship with interim rank. Revealing information on relative performance induces individuals trailing just behind the interim leaders to take greater risks. Second, competitors systematically underperform when ranked closer to the top, despite higher incentives to perform well. Disclosing information on relative ranking hinders interim leaders."}]
