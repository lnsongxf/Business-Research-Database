Shocks to managerial productivity are anticipated at the time of contracting but privately observed by the managers. Our key positive result shows that the firm's optimal retention decisions become more permissive with time. Our key normative result shows that, compared to what is efficient, the firm's contract induces either excessive retention at all tenure levels or excessive firing at the early stages of the relationship, followed by excessive retention after sufficiently long tenure."}, {"e:author": ["David M.

In a calibrated matching model that generates empirically relevant labor market fluctuations conditional on exogenous fiscal policy, the Ramsey-optimal policy calls for extreme labor tax rate volatility. Purposeful tax volatility induces dramatically smaller, but efficient, fluctuations of labor markets by keeping distortions constant over the business cycle. We relate the results to standard Ramsey theory by developing welfare-relevant concepts of efficiency and distortions based on primitive matching frictions. Although the basic Ramsey principles of \"wedge smoothing\" and zero intertemporal distortions hold, tax smoothing depends on whether wages are set efficiently."}, {"e:author": ["John Morgan", "Felix Vrdy"], "e:volume": "120", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/668838", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "986 - 1026", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/668838", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Mixed Motives and the Optimal Size of Voting Bodies", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We study a Condorcet jury model where voters are driven by instrumental and expressive motives. We show that arbitrarily small amounts of expressive motives significantly affect equilibrium behavior and the optimal size of voting bodies. Enlarging voting bodies always reduces accuracy over some region. Unless conflict between expressive and instrumental preferences is very low, information does not aggregate in the limit, and large voting bodies perform no better than a coin flip in selecting the correct outcome. Thus, even when adding informed voters is costless, smaller voting bodies often produce better decisions."}, {"e:author": ["Roger B.

Financial agents or bankers must earn moral-hazard rents, but the cost of these rents can be efficiently spread over an agent's entire career by promising large late-career rewards if the agent has a consistently successful record. Dynamic interactions among different generations of financial agents can create credit cycles with repeated booms and recessions. In recessions, a scarcity of trusted financial intermediaries limits investment and reduces employment. Under such conditions, taxing workers to subsidize bankers may increase employment enough to make the workers better off."}, {"e:author": ["Yiting Li", "Guillaume Rocheteau", "Pierre-Olivier Weill"], "e:volume": "120", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/668864", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "000 - 000", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/668864", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Liquidity and the Threat of Fraudulent Assets", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We study an over-the-counter (OTC) market in which the usefulness of assets as a means of payment or collateral is limited by the threat of fraudulent practices. Agents can produce fraudulent assets at a positive cost, which generates upper bounds on the quantity of each asset that can be traded in the OTC market. Each of these endogenous, asset-specific, resalability constraints depends on the cost of fraud, on the frequency of trade, and on the asset price. In equilibrium, assets are partitioned into three liquidity tiers, which differ in their resalability, prices, haircuts, sensitivity to shocks, and responses to policies."}]
