A listener first announces and commits to a codex (i.e., a set of conditions). The speaker then presents a (not necessarily true) profile that must satisfy the codex in order for the listener to be persuaded. The speaker is boundedly rational in the sense that his ability to come up with a persuasive profile is limited and depends on the true profile and the content and framing of the codex. The circumstances under which the listener can design a codex that will implement his goal are fully characterized."}, {"e:author": ["Julian di Giovanni", "Andrei A.

We study a model with heterogeneous firms that are subject to idiosyncratic firm-specific shocks, calibrated to data for the 50 largest economies in the world. When the firm size distribution follows a power law with an exponent close to minus one, idiosyncratic shocks to large firms have an impact on aggregate volatility. Smaller countries have fewer firms and, thus, higher volatility. Trade opening makes the large firms more important, thus raising macroeconomic volatility. Trade can increase aggregate volatility by 15-20 percent in some small open economies."}, {"e:author": ["Jan Stoop", "Charles N.

Group earnings are greater when group members catch fewer fish. Consistent with classical economic theory, though in contrast to prior results from laboratory experiments, we find no cooperation. A series of additional treatments identifies causes of the difference. We rule out the subject pool and the laboratory setting as potential causes and identify the type of activity involved as the source of the lack of cooperation in our field experiment. When cooperation requires reducing fishing effort, individuals are not cooperative."}, {"e:author": ["Andrew Sweeting"], "e:volume": "120", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/669254", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1133 - 1172", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1086/669254", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Dynamic Pricing Behavior in Perishable Goods Markets: Evidence from Secondary Markets for Major League Baseball Tickets", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Sellers of perishable goods increasingly use dynamic pricing strategies as technology makes it easier to change prices and track inventory. This paper tests how accurately theoretical models of dynamic pricing describe sellers' behavior in secondary markets for event tickets, a classic example of a perishable good. It shows that the simplest dynamic pricing models describe very accurately both the pricing problem faced by sellers and how they behave, explaining why sellers cut prices dramatically, by 40 percent or more, as an event approaches. The estimates also imply that dynamic pricing is valuable, raising the average seller's expected payoff by around 16 percent."}, {"e:author": ["Gautam Gowrisankaran", "Marc Rysman"], "e:volume": "120", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/669540", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1173 - 1219", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1086/669540", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Dynamics of Consumer Demand for New Durable Goods", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Most new consumer durable goods experience rapid prices declines and quality improvements, suggesting the importance of modeling dynamics. This paper specifies a dynamic model of consumer preferences for new durable goods with persistently heterogeneous consumer tastes, rational expectations, and repeat purchases over time. We estimate the model on the digital camcorder industry using panel data on prices, sales, and characteristics. We find that the 1-year elasticity in response to a transitory industrywide price shock is about 25 percent less than the 1-month elasticity. Standard cost-of-living indices overstate welfare gain in later periods due to a changing composition of buyers."}]
