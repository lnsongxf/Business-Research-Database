We present a model that captures key dimensions of the interaction between these two flows: trade and MP are competing ways to serve a foreign market, MP relies on imports of intermediate goods from the home country, and foreign affiliates of multinationals can export part of their output. The calibrated model implies that the gains from trade can be twice as high as the gains calculated in trade-only models, while the gains from MP are slightly lower than the gains computed in MP-only models."}, {"e:author": ["Ethan Bueno de Mesquita"], "e:volume": "121", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/670137", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "323 - 357", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1086/670137", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Rebel Tactics", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "I study a model of mobilization and rebel tactical choice. Rebel leaders choose between conventional tactics that are heavily reliant on mobilization, irregular tactics that are less so, and withdrawal from conflict. The model yields the following results, among others. Increased nonviolent opportunity has a nonmonotone effect on the use of irregular tactics. Conflict has option value, so irregular campaigns last longer than the rebels' short-term interest dictates, especially in volatile military environments. By demonstrating lack of rebel capacity and diminishing mobilization, successful counterinsurgencies may increase irregular violence. Conflict begets conflict by eroding outside options, thereby increasing mobilization."}, {"e:author": ["Bruce Wydick", "Paul Glewwe", "Laine Rutledge"], "e:volume": "121", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/670138", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "393 - 436", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1086/670138", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Does International Child Sponsorship Work? A Six-Country Study of Impacts on Adult Life Outcomes", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Child sponsorship is a leading form of direct aid from wealthy country households to children in developing countries. Over 9 million children are supported through international sponsorship organizations. Using data from six countries, we estimate impacts on several outcomes from sponsorship through Compassion International, a leading child sponsorship organization. To identify program effects, we utilize an age-eligibility rule implemented when programs began in new villages. We find large, statistically significant impacts on years of schooling; primary, secondary, and tertiary school completion; and the probability and quality of employment. Early evidence suggests that these impacts are due, in part, to increases in children's aspirations."}, {"e:author": ["Francisco J.

Our model economy with financial frictions converges to the new steady state slowly after a reform triggers efficient reallocation of resources; the transition speed is half that of the conventional neoclassical model. Furthermore, in the model economy, investment rates and total factor productivity are initially low and increase over time. We present data from the so-called miracle economies on the evolution of macro aggregates, factor reallocation, and establishment size distribution that support the aggregate and micro-level implications of our theory."}, {"e:author": ["Timothy J.

Using a panel of 1,900 country pairs, we find that increased trade of these \"least-traded goods\" is an important factor in trade growth. This extensive margin accounts for 10 percent of the growth in trade for NAFTA country pairs, for example, and 26 percent in trade between the United States and Chile, China, and Korea. Looking at country pairs with no major trade policy change or structural change, however, we find little change in the extensive margin."}]
