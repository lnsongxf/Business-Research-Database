High returns make the VCs more selective and eager to terminate nonperforming ventures because they can move on to new ones. The scarcity of VCs enables them to internalize their social value, and the competitive equilibrium is socially optimal. Moreover, the bilaterally efficient contract is a simple equity contract. We estimate the model for the period 1989-2001 and compute the excess return to venture capital, which turns out to be 8.6 percent. Finally, we back out the return of solo entrepreneurs, which is increasing in their wealth and ranges between zero and 3.5 percent."}, {"e:author": ["Yukio Koriyama", "Jean-Fran&#x000E7;ois Laslier", "Antonin Mac&#x000E9;", "Rafael Treibich"], "e:volume": "121", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/670380", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "584 - 608", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1086/670380", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Optimal Apportionment", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "This paper provides a theoretical foundation that supports the degressive proportionality principle in apportionment problems, such as the allocation of seats in a federal parliament. The utility assigned by an individual to a constitutional rule is a function of the frequency with which each collective decision matches the individual's own will. The core of the argument is that, if the function is concave, then classical utilitarianism at the social level recommends decision rules that exhibit degressive proportionality with respect to the population size."}, {"e:author": ["E.

The principles cover (1) the independence of physical and economic incidence, the (2) qualitative and (3) quantitative manner in which taxes are split between consumers and producers, (4) the determinants of tax pass-through, and (5) the integration of local incidence to determine the overall division of surplus. We show how these principles can be used to simplify and generalize the analysis of a range of economic questions such as the optimal procurement of new markets and the welfare effects of third-degree price discrimination."}, {"e:author": ["Mark Aguiar", "Erik Hurst"], "e:volume": "121", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/670740", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "437 - 492", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1086/670740", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Deconstructing Life Cycle Expenditure", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We revisit two well-known facts regarding life cycle expenditures: the \"hump\"-shaped profile of nondurable expenditures and the increase in cross-household consumption inequality. We document that the behavior of total nondurables masks surprising heterogeneity in the life cycle profile of individual consumption subcomponents. We provide evidence that the categories driving life cycle consumption either are inputs into market work or are amenable to home production. Using a quantitative model, we document that the disaggregated life cycle consumption profiles imply a level of uninsurable permanent income risk that is substantially lower than that implied by a model using a composite consumption good."}, {"e:author": ["Gregory K.

With agriculture, such stratification tends to become more pronounced. We develop a model to explain the associations among productivity, population, property rights, and inequality. Using Malthusian dynamics, we show that regional productivity growth leads to enclosure of the best sites first, creating inequality between insiders and outsiders. Hereditary elite and commoner classes subsequently arise at the best sites. Food consumption becomes more unequal and commoners become poorer. These predictions are consistent with a wide range of archaeological evidence."}]
