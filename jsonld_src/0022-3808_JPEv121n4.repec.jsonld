We focus on the acquisition, aggregation, transmission, and embodiment of the knowledge stock built through learning. We find that most knowledge was not retained by plant workers despite their importance as a learning conduit. This is consistent with the plant's systems for productivity measurement and improvement. We further explore how learning at the hundreds of processes along the production line undergirds plantwide productivity. Our results shed light on how productivity gains accrue at the plant level and how firms apply managerial inputs to expand production."}, {"e:author": ["Costis Skiadas"], "e:volume": "121", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/671179", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "000 - 000", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1086/671179", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Smooth Ambiguity Aversion toward Small Risks and Continuous-Time Recursive Utility", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": ["Roland G.

A model is proposed in which heterogeneous agents, distinguished by skill level and social identity, purchase productive opportunities in a competitive market. We analyze policies designed to raise the status of a disadvantaged identity group. When agent identity is contractible, efficient policy grants preferred access to slots but offers no direct assistance for acquiring skills. When identity is not contractible, efficient policy provides universal subsidies to skill development when the fraction of the disadvantaged group at the skill development margin is larger than their share at the slot assignment margin."}, {"e:author": ["Alexander David", "Pietro Veronesi"], "e:volume": "121", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/671799", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "682 - 746", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1086/671799", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "What Ties Return Volatilities to Price Valuations and Fundamentals?", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Stock and Treasury bond comovement, volatilities, and their relations to their price valuations and fundamentals change stochastically over time, in both magnitude and direction. These stochastic changes are explained by a general equilibrium model in which agents learn about composite economic and inflation regimes. We estimate our model using both fundamentals and asset prices and find that inflation news signal either positive or negative future real economic growth depending on the times, thereby affecting the direction of stock-bond comovement. The learning dynamics generate strong nonlinearities between volatilities and price valuations. We find empirical support for numerous predictions of the model."}, {"e:author": ["Neil Wallace"], "e:volume": "121", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/672370", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "793 - 795", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/672370", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Comment on \"Moneyspots: Extraneous Attributes and the Coexistence of Money and Interest-Bearing Nominal Bonds\" by Ricardo Lagos", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "4"}, {"e:author": ["Ricardo Lagos"], "e:volume": "121", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/673166", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "796 - 801", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/673166", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Moneyspots and Coexistence in the Pure Theory of Money: A Reply to Neil Wallace", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "4"}]
