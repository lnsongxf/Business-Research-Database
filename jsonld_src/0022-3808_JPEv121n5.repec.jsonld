We find that when continuous transfers are allowed and utilities are quasi-linear, the full substitutability of preferences is sufficient to guarantee the existence of stable outcomes for any underlying network structure. Furthermore, the set of stable outcomes is essentially equivalent to the set of competitive equilibria, and all stable outcomes are in the core and are efficient. By contrast, for any domain of preferences strictly larger than that of full substitutability, the existence of stable outcomes and competitive equilibria cannot be guaranteed."}, {"e:author": ["Chao Gu", "Fabrizio Mattesini", "Cyril Monnet", "Randall Wright"], "e:volume": "121", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/673472", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "940 - 965", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/673472", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Endogenous Credit Cycles", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "This paper studies models of credit with limited commitment and, therefore, endogenous debt limits. There are multiple stationary equilibria plus nonstationary equilibria in which credit conditions change simply because of beliefs. There can be equilibria in which debt limits display deterministic cyclic or chaotic dynamics, as well as stochastic (sunspot) equilibria in which they fluctuate randomly, even though fundamentals are deterministic and time invariant. Examples and applications are discussed. We also consider different mechanisms for determining the terms of trade and compare the setup to other credit models in the literature."}, {"e:author": ["John K.-H.

This paper provides a general method to analyze this question, allowing stochastic and managed cash flows, stochastic discount rates, and time inconsistency and including arbitrary learning and payoff or utility processes. We show that some of these features can lead to counterintuitive answers (e.g., \"a more patient agent stops earlier\"), but we also establish, under simple conditions, theorems yielding robust predictions concerning the impact of discount rates on control and stopping decisions and on valuations. We apply our theory to models of search, experimentation, bankruptcy, optimal growth, investment, and social learning."}, {"e:author": ["Pedro Bordalo", "Nicola Gennaioli", "Andrei Shleifer"], "e:volume": "121", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/673885", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "803 - 843", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/673885", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Salience and Consumer Choice", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We present a theory of context-dependent choice in which a consumer's attention is drawn to salient attributes of goods, such as quality or price. An attribute is salient for a good when it stands out among the good's attributes relative to that attribute's average level in the choice set (or, more broadly, the choice context). Consumers attach disproportionately high weight to salient attributes, and their choices are tilted toward goods with higher quality/price ratios. The model accounts for a variety of disparate evidence, including decoy effects and context-dependent willingness to pay. It also suggests a novel theory of misleading sales."}, {"e:author": ["Guillermo Ordo&#x000F1;ez"], "e:volume": "121", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/673886", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "844 - 895", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/673886", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "The Asymmetric Effects of Financial Frictions", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Economic variables move asymmetrically over the business cycle: quickly during crises but slowly during recoveries. I show that this asymmetry is stronger in countries with less developed financial systems and greater financial frictions. Then I explain this fact using a learning model with endogenous information about economic conditions. Financial frictions, which I capture by higher bankruptcy costs, magnify the reaction of lending rates and economic activity to negative shocks and then delay their recovery by restricting information after the crisis. Empirical evidence and a quantitative exploration of the model show that this explanation is consistent with the data."}]
