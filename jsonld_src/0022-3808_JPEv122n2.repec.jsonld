The seller has reserve prices. The auctioneer announces a current price for every bundle of goods and a supply set of goods, every bidder responds with a set of goods demanded at these prices, and the auctioneer adjusts prices. We prove that even when bidders can exercise their market power strategically, this dynamic auction always induces them to bid truthfully, resulting in an efficient allocation, its supporting Walrasian equilibrium price for every bundle of goods, and a generalized Vickrey-Clarke-Groves payment for every bidder."}, {"e:author": ["Thomas J.

Standard theories attribute such size differences to productivity differences. This paper develops an alternative theory in which industries are made up of large plants producing standardized goods and small plants making custom or specialty goods. It uses confidential census data to estimate the parameters of the model. The model fits the data well. In particular, the predictions of the model regarding the effect of a surge of imports from China are consistent with what happened over the period 1997-2007."}, {"e:author": ["Daron Acemoglu", "Tristan Reed", "James A.

A paramount chief in Sierra Leone must come from a ruling family originally recognized by British colonial authorities. In chiefdoms with fewer ruling families, chiefs face less political competition, and development outcomes are significantly worse today. Variation in the security of property rights over land is a potential mechanism. Paradoxically, with fewer ruling families, the institutions of chiefs' authority are more highly respected, and measured social capital is higher. We argue that these results reflect the capture of civil society organizations by chiefs."}, {"e:author": ["Damon Clark", "Paco Martorell"], "e:volume": "122", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/675238", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "282 - 318", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1086/675238", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "The Signaling Value of a High School Diploma", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "This paper distinguishes between the human capital and signaling theories by estimating the earnings return to a high school diploma. Unlike most indicators of education (e.g., a year of school), a diploma is essentially a piece of paper and, hence, by itself cannot affect productivity. Any earnings return to holding a diploma must therefore reflect the diploma's signaling value. Using regression discontinuity methods to compare the earnings of workers who barely passed and barely failed high school exit exams--standardized tests that students must pass to earn a high school diploma--we find little evidence of diploma signaling effects."}, {"e:author": ["Chao Fu"], "e:volume": "122", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/675503", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "225 - 281", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1086/675503", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Equilibrium Tuition, Applications, Admissions, and Enrollment in the College Market", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "I develop and estimate a structural equilibrium model of the college market. Students, having heterogeneous abilities and preferences, make application decisions subject to uncertainty and application costs. Colleges, observing noisy measures of student ability, choose tuition and admissions policies to compete for better students. Tuition, applications, admissions, and enrollment are joint equilibrium outcomes. I estimate the model using the NLSY97 via a three-step procedure to deal with potential multiple equilibria. I use the model to examine the extent to which college enrollment can be increased by expanding college supply and to assess the importance of various measures of student ability."}]
