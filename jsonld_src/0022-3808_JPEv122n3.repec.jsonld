This higher productivity may occur because more talented individuals sort into large cities, because large cities select more productive entrepreneurs and firms, or because of agglomeration economies. We develop a model of systems of cities that combines all three elements and suggests interesting complementarities between them. The model can replicate stylized facts about sorting, agglomeration, and selection in cities. It also generates Zipf's law for cities under empirically plausible parameter values. Finally, it provides a useful framework within which to reinterpret extant empirical evidence."}, {"e:author": ["Fatih Guvenen", "Serdar Ozkan", "Jae Song"], "e:volume": "122", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/675535", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "621 - 660", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1086/675535", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "The Nature of Countercyclical Income Risk", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We study business cycle variation in individual earnings risk using a confidential and very large data set from the US Social Security Administration. Contrary to past research, we find that the variance of idiosyncratic shocks is not countercyclical. Instead, it is the left-skewness of shocks that is strongly countercyclical: during recessions, large upward earnings movements become less likely, whereas large drops in earnings become more likely. Second, we find that the fortunes during recessions are predictable by observable characteristics before the recession. Finally, the cyclicality of earnings risk is dramatically different for the top 1 percent compared with the rest of the population."}, {"e:author": ["David H. Autor", "Christopher J.

Pooling data on the universe of assessed values and transacted prices of Cambridge residential properties between 1988 and 2005, we find that rent decontrol generated substantial, robust price appreciation at decontrolled units and nearby never-controlled units, accounting for a quarter of the $7.8 billion in Cambridge residential property appreciation during this period. The majority of this contribution stems from induced appreciation of never-controlled properties. Residential investment explains only a small fraction of the total."}, {"e:author": ["Ran Abramitzky", "Leah Platt Boustan", "Katherine Eriksson"], "e:volume": "122", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/675805", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "467 - 506", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1086/675805", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "A Nation of Immigrants: Assimilation and Economic Outcomes in the Age of Mass Migration", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "During the Age of Mass Migration (1850-1913), the United States maintained an open border, absorbing 30 million European immigrants. Prior cross-sectional work finds that immigrants initially held lower-paid occupations than natives but converged over time. In newly assembled panel data, we show that, in fact, the average immigrant did not face a substantial occupation-based earnings penalty upon first arrival and experienced occupational advancement at the same rate as natives. Cross-sectional patterns are driven by biases from declining arrival cohort skill level and departures of negatively selected return migrants. We show that assimilation patterns vary substantially across sending countries and persist in the second generation."}, {"e:author": ["Jan Eeckhout", "Roberto Pinheiro", "Kurt Schmidheiny"], "e:volume": "122", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/676141", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "554 - 620", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1086/676141", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Spatial Sorting", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We investigate the role of skill complementarities in production and mobility across cities. The nature of the complementarities determines the equilibrium skill distribution across cities. With extreme-skill complementarity, the skill distribution has thicker tails in large cities; with top-skill complementarity, there is first-order stochastic dominance. Using wage and housing price data, we find robust evidence of thick tails in large cities: large cities disproportionately attract both high- and low-skilled workers, while average skills are constant across city size. This pattern of spatial sorting is consistent with extreme-skill complementarity, where the productivity of high-skilled workers and of the providers of low-skilled services are mutually enhanced."}]
