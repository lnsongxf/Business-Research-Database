However, prior research has focused almost entirely on the polar cases of complete specialization and complete diversity. This paper develops a model that can also generate the intermediate case of cities that feature the coagglomeration of some but not all industries, thus giving theoretical foundations to the analysis of business clusters. The analysis sharply challenges the conventional wisdom that the size and composition of cities are necessarily driven primarily by agglomerative efficiencies."}, {"e:author": ["Ilan Kremer", "Yishay Mansour", "Motty Perry"], "e:volume": "122", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/676597", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "988 - 1012", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/676597", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Implementing the \"Wisdom of the Crowd\"", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We study a novel mechanism design model in which agents each arrive sequentially and choose one action from a set of actions with unknown rewards.

A principal contracts with multiple agents each supplying a one-dimensional good at a privately known cost. We characterize optimal mechanisms subject to incentive and communication constraints, without imposing arbitrary restrictions on the number of communication rounds. We show that mechanisms that centralize production decisions are strictly dominated by those that decentralize decision-making authority to agents, and optimal communication mechanisms maximize information exchanged directly among agents. Conditions are provided for these to involve gradual release of information over multiple rounds either simultaneously or sequentially."}, {"e:author": ["J&#x000E9;r&#x000F4;me Adda", "Brendon McConnell", "Imran Rasul"], "e:volume": "122", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/676932", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1130 - 1202", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/676932", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Crime and the Depenalization of Cannabis Possession: Evidence from a Policing Experiment", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We evaluate the impact on crime of a localized policing experiment that depenalized the possession of small quantities of cannabis in the London borough of Lambeth. We find that depenalization policy caused the police to reallocate effort toward nondrug crime. Despite the overall fall in crime attributable to the policy, we find that the total welfare of local residents likely fell, as measured by house prices. We shed light on what would be the impacts on crime of a citywide depenalization policy by developing and calibrating a structural model of the market for cannabis and crime."}, {"e:author": ["John Asker", "Allan Collard-Wexler", "Jan De Loecker"], "e:volume": "122", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/677072", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1013 - 1063", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/677072", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Dynamic Inputs and Resource (Mis)Allocation", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We investigate the role of dynamic production inputs and their associated adjustment costs in shaping the dispersion of static measures of capital misallocation within industries (and countries). Across nine data sets spanning 40 countries, we find that industries exhibiting greater time-series volatility of productivity have greater cross-sectional dispersion of the marginal revenue product of capital. We use a standard investment model with adjustment costs to show that variation in the volatility of productivity across these industries and economies can explain a large share (80-90 percent) of the cross-industry (and cross-country) variation in the dispersion of the marginal revenue product of capital."}, {"e:author": ["Lars Peter Hansen"], "e:volume": "122", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/678456", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "945 - 987", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/678456", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Nobel Lecture: Uncertainty Outside and Inside Economic Models", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "5"}]
