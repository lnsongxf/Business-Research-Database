In our model, heterogeneous households select from mortgages with different down payments and choose whether to default given income and housing shocks. The use of low-down payment loans is initially limited by payment-to-income requirements but becomes unrestricted during the boom. The model approximates key housing and mortgage market facts before and after the crisis. A counterfactual experiment suggests that the increased number of high-leverage loans originated prior to the crisis can explain over 60 percent of the rise in foreclosure rates."}, {"e:author": ["Jeffrey Ely", "Alexander Frankel", "Emir Kamenica"], "e:volume": "123", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/677350", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "215 - 260", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1086/677350", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Suspense and Surprise", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We model demand for noninstrumental information, drawing on the idea that people derive entertainment utility from suspense and surprise. A period has more suspense if the variance of the next period's beliefs is greater. A period has more surprise if the current belief is further from the last period's belief. Under these definitions, we analyze the optimal way to reveal information over time so as to maximize expected suspense or surprise experienced by a Bayesian audience. We apply our results to the design of mystery novels, political primaries, casinos, game shows, auctions, and sports."}, {"e:author": ["Joseph J. Doyle Jr.", "John A.

Using Medicare data from 2002-10 on assignment across ambulance companies and New York State data from 2000-6 on assignment across area boundaries, we find that patients who are brought to higher-cost hospitals achieve better outcomes. Our estimates imply that a one standard deviation increase in Medicare reimbursement leads to a 4 percentage point (or 10 percent) reduction in mortality; the implied cost per at least 1 year of life saved is approximately $80,000."}, {"e:author": ["Elena Asparouhova", "Peter Bossaerts", "Jon Eguia", "William Zame"], "e:volume": "123", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/679283", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "66 - 122", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1086/679283", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Asset Pricing and Asymmetric Reasoning", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We present a theory and experimental evidence on pricing and portfolio choices under asymmetric reasoning. We show that under asymmetric reasoning, prices do not reflect all (types of) reasoning. Some agents who observe prices that cannot be reconciled with their reasoning switch from perceiving the environment as risky to perceiving it as ambiguous. If they are ambiguity-averse, these agents become price-insensitive. Results from an experiment show that, consistent with the theory, (i) without aggregate risk, mispricing decreases as the fraction of price-sensitive agents increases; and (ii) with aggregate risk, price-insensitive agents trade to more balanced portfolios."}, {"e:author": ["Henrik Cronqvist", "Stephan Siegel"], "e:volume": "123", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/679284", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "123 - 169", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1086/679284", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "The Origins of Savings Behavior", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Analyzing the savings behavior of a large sample of identical and fraternal twins, we find that genetic differences explain about 33 percent of the variation in savings propensities across individuals. Individuals are born with a persistent genetic predisposition to a specific savings behavior. Parenting contributes to the variation in savings rates among younger individuals, but its effect decays over time. The environment when growing up (e.g., parents' wealth) moderates genetic effects. Finally, savings behavior is genetically correlated with income growth, smoking, and obesity, suggesting that the genetic component of savings behavior reflects genetic variation in time preferences or self-control."}]
