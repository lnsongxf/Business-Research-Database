Treatment 1 provides individual incentives for performance on curriculum-based mathematics tests to students only, treatment 2 to teachers only, and treatment 3 gives both individual and group incentives to students, teachers, and school administrators. Program impact estimates reveal the largest average effects for treatment 3, smaller impacts for treatment 1, and no impact for treatment 2."}, {"e:author": ["Lawrence E. Blume", "William A.

This is a theoretical and econometric exercise as the analysis is linked to a rigorously delineated model of interdependent decisions. We develop an incomplete information game for individual choice under social influences that nests standard models as special cases. We consider identification of both endogenous and contextual social effects under alternative assumptions regarding an analyst's a priori knowledge of social structure or access to individual-level or aggregate data. Finally, we discuss potential ramifications for identification of endogenous formation of social structure."}, {"e:author": ["Joseph G. Altonji", "Ching-I Huang", "Christopher R.

The \"cream skimming\" effect is increasing in the degree of heterogeneity within schools, the school choice take-up rate of strong students relative to weak students, and the dependence of school outcomes on student body quality. We use the formula to investigate the cream skimming effect of hypothetical voucher programs on the high school graduation rate and other outcomes of the students who would remain in public school. We find small effects across a wide variety of model specifications and types of modest voucher programs."}, {"e:author": ["Philipp Eisenhauer", "James J.

Proponents of these policies contend that employment impacts are negligible and suggest that consumers pay for higher labor costs through imperceptible increases in goods prices. Adopting this empirical scenario, the analysis demonstrates that an increase in the national minimum wage produces a value-added tax effect on consumer prices that is more regressive than a typical state sales tax and allocates benefits as higher earnings nearly evenly across the income distribution. These income-transfer outcomes sharply contradict portraying an increase in the minimum wage as an antipoverty initiative."}, {"e:author": ["Pedro Carneiro", "Katrine V. L&#x000F8;ken", "Kjell G.

Maternity Leave Benefits and Long-Run Outcomes of Children", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We study a change in maternity leave entitlements in Norway. Mothers giving birth before July 1, 1977, were eligible for 12 weeks of unpaid leave, while those giving birth after that date were entitled to 4 months of paid leave and 12 months of unpaid leave. The increased time spent with the child led to a 2 percentage point decline in high school dropout rates and a 5 percent increase in wages at age 30. These effects were larger for the children of mothers who, in the absence of the reform, would have taken very low levels of unpaid leave."}, {"e:author": ["Fl&#x000E1;vio Cunha", "Petra Todd"], "e:volume": "123", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/680415", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "263 - 265", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/680415", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Preface", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "2"}]
