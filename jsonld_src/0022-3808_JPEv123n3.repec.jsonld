This framework contains models of saving and capital accumulation with incomplete markets in the spirit of works by Bewley, Aiyagari, and Huggett; models of entry, exit, and industry dynamics in the spirit of Hopenhayn's work; and dynamic models of occupational choice and search models as special cases. Robust and easy-to-apply comparative statics results are established with respect to exogenous parameters as well as various kinds of changes in the Markov processes governing the law of motion of the idiosyncratic shocks."}, {"e:author": ["Pablo Casas-Arce", "Albert Saiz"], "e:volume": "123", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/680686", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "641 - 669", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1086/680686", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Women and Power: Unpopular, Unwilling, or Held Back?", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We use Spain's Equality Law to test for the existence of agency problems between party leaders and their constituents. The law mandates a 40 percent female quota on electoral lists in towns with populations above 5,000. Using pre- and postquota data by party and municipality, we implement a triple-difference design. We find that female quotas resulted in slightly better electoral results for the parties that were most affected by the quota. Our evidence shows that party leaders were not maximizing electoral results prior to the quota, suggesting the existence of agency problems that hinder female representation in political institutions."}, {"e:author": ["Paulina Oliva"], "e:volume": "123", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/680936", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "686 - 724", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1086/680936", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Environmental Regulations and Corruption: Automobile Emissions in Mexico City", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Emission regulations become more prevalent in developing countries, but they may be compromised by corruption. This paper documents the prevalence of corruption and the effectiveness of vehicle emission regulations in Mexico City. I develop a statistical test for identifying a specific type of cheating that involves bribing center technicians. I also estimate a structural model of car owner retesting and cheating decisions. Results suggest that 9.6 percent of car owners paid US$20 to circumvent the regulation. Eliminating cheating and increasing the cost of retests would reduce emissions by 3,708 tons at a high cost for vehicle owners."}, {"e:author": ["Josh Lerner", "Jean Tirole"], "e:volume": "123", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/680995", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "547 - 586", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1086/680995", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Standard-Essential Patents", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "A major policy issue in standard setting is that patents that are ex ante not that important, by being included into a standard, may become standard-essential patents. In an attempt to curb the monopoly power that they create, most standard-setting organizations require the owners of patents covered by the standard to make a loose commitment to grant licenses on reasonable terms. Such commitments unsurprisingly are conducive to litigation. This paper builds a framework for the analysis of these patents, identifies several types of inefficiencies attached to the lack of price commitments, and shows how structured price commitments restore competition and why such commitments may not arise spontaneously in the marketplace."}, {"e:author": ["Nicolae G&#x000E2;rleanu", "Stavros Panageas"], "e:volume": "123", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/680996", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "670 - 685", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1086/680996", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Young, Old, Conservative, and Bold: The Implications of Heterogeneity and Finite Lives for Asset Pricing", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We study the implications of preference heterogeneity for asset pricing. We use recursive preferences in order to separate heterogeneity in risk aversion from heterogeneity in the intertemporal elasticity of substitution and an overlapping-generations framework to obtain a nondegenerate stationary equilibrium. We solve the model explicitly up to the solutions of ordinary differential equations and highlight the effects of overlapping generations and each dimension of preference heterogeneity on the market price of risk, interest rates, and the volatility of stock returns. We find that separating intertemporal elasticity of substitution and risk aversion heterogeneity can have a substantive impact on the model's (qualitative and quantitative) ability to address some key asset-pricing issues."}]
