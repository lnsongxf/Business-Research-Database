This implicitly assumes a criterion that tests beliefs against the observed outcomes generated by the model. We formalize this requirement in stationary environments. We show that there is a tension between requiring that beliefs can be tested against systematic errors and allowing agents to disagree or be uncertain about the long-run fundamentals. We discuss the application of our analysis to asset pricing, Markov perfect equilibria, and dynamic games."}, {"e:author": ["Carola Frydman", "Eric Hilt", "Lily Y.

The Panic of 1907 originated in the shadow banks of the time, New York's trust companies. The runs were caused by a shock unrelated to the trust companies' nonfinancial corporate clients. In the years following the panic, corporations affiliated with the worst-affected trusts made fewer capital investments, paid lower dividends, and suffered lower profitability and higher borrowing costs relative to firms without such connections. The shock to New York's trust companies accounted for at least 18.4 percent of the decline in corporate investment in the United States in 1908."}, {"e:author": ["Pol Antr&#x000E0;s", "C.

The choice of trade finance terms balances the risk that an importer defaults on an exporter and the possibility that an exporter does not deliver goods as specified. Analysis of transaction-level data from a US exporter reveals that importers located in countries with weak enforcement of contracts typically finance transactions, but these firms are able to overcome the constraints of such environments if they can establish a relationship with the exporter. Furthermore, the manner in which trade is financed shapes the impact of crises."}, {"e:author": ["Roozbeh Hosseini"], "e:volume": "123", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/681593", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "941 - 984", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1086/681593", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Adverse Selection in the Annuity Market and the Role for Social Security", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "I study the role of social security in providing insurance when there is adverse selection in the annuity market. I calculate welfare gain from mandatory annuitization in the social security system relative to a laissez-faire benchmark, using a model in which individuals have private information about their mortality. I estimate large heterogeneity in mortality using the Health and Retirement Study. Despite that, I find small welfare gain from mandatory annuitization. Social security has a large effect on annuity prices because it crowds out demand by high-mortality individuals. Welfare gain would have been significantly larger in the absence of this effect."}, {"e:author": ["Lorenzo Caliendo", "Ferdinando Monte", "Esteban Rossi-Hansberg"], "e:volume": "123", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/681641", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "809 - 852", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1086/681641", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "The Anatomy of French Production Hierarchies", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We study the internal organization of French manufacturing firms. We divide the employees of each firm into \"layers\" using occupational categories. Layers are hierarchical in that the typical worker in a higher layer earns more, and the typical firm occupies less of them. The probability of adding/dropping a layer is positively/negatively correlated with value added. Reorganization, through changes in layers, is essential to understanding how firms grow. Firms that expand substantially add layers and pay lower average wages in all preexisting layers. In contrast, firms that expand little and do not reorganize pay higher average wages in all preexisting layers."}, {"e:author": ["Lawrence E. Blume", "Steven N.
