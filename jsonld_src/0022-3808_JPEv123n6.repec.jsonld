Findings from a year-long field experiment with full-time data entry workers support this idea. First, workers increase output by voluntarily choosing dominated contracts (which penalize low output but give no additional rewards for high output). Second, effort increases closer to (randomly assigned) paydays. Third, the contract and payday effects are strongly correlated within workers, and this correlation grows with experience. We suggest that workplace features such as high-powered incentives or effort monitoring may provide self-control benefits."}, {"e:author": ["Charles Sprenger"], "e:volume": "123", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/683836", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1456 - 1499", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1086/683836", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "An Endowment Effect for Risk: Experimental Tests of Stochastic Reference Points", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Recent models of reference-dependent preferences indicate that expectations may play a prominent role in the presence of behavioral anomalies. A subset of such expectations-based models predicts an \"endowment effect for risk\": that risk attitudes differ when reference points change from certain to stochastic. In two purposefully simple risk preference experiments, eliminating often-discussed confounds, I demonstrate both between and within subjects such an endowment effect for risk. These results provide needed separation between expectations-based reference-dependent models, allow for evaluation of recent theoretical extensions, and may help to close a long-standing debate in decision science on inconsistency between utility elicitation methodologies."}, {"e:author": ["Jose Apesteguia", "Miguel A.

Specifically, the paper looks at English securities traded in both London and Amsterdam. Private information reached Amsterdam through sailing boats that sailed only twice a week and in adverse weather could not sail at all. Results are consistent with a Kyle model in which informed agents trade strategically. Most importantly, the speed of information revelation in Amsterdam depended on the expected time until the private signal would become public."}, {"e:author": ["Michael Carlos Best", "Anne Brockmeyer", "Henrik Jacobsen Kleven", "Johannes Spinnewijn", "Mazhar Waseem"], "e:volume": "123", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/683849", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1311 - 1355", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1086/683849", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Production versus Revenue Efficiency with Limited Tax Capacity: Theory and Evidence from Pakistan", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "To fight evasion, many developing countries use production-inefficient tax policies. This includes minimum tax schemes whereby firms are taxed on either profits or turnover, depending on which tax liability is larger. Such schemes create nonstandard kink points, which allow for eliciting evasion responses to switches between profit and turnover taxes using a bunching approach. Using administrative data on corporations in Pakistan, we estimate that turnover taxes reduce evasion by up to 60-70 percent of corporate income. Incorporating this in a calibrated optimal tax model, we find that switching from profit to turnover taxation increases revenue by 74 percent without reducing aggregate profits."}, {"e:author": ["Solomon W.
