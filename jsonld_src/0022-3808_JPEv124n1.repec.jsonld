If complete contracts are feasible, participants eliminate the holdup problem associated with their investments; however, most countries prefer to free ride rather than participate. If investments are noncontractible, countries face a holdup problem every time they negotiate; but the free-rider problem can be mitigated and significant participation is feasible. Participation becomes attractive because only large coalitions commit to long-term agreements that circumvent the holdup problem. Under well-specified conditions even the first-best outcome is possible when the contract is incomplete."}, {"e:author": ["Meredith Fowlie", "Mar Reguant", "Stephen P.

Our results highlight two countervailing market distortions. First, emissions regulation exacerbates distortions associated with the exercise of market power in the domestic cement market. Second, emissions \"leakage\" in trade-exposed markets offsets domestic emissions reductions. Taken together, these forces can result in social welfare losses under policy regimes that fully internalize the emissions externality. Market-based policies that incorporate design features to mitigate the exercise of market power and emissions leakage deliver welfare gains when damages from carbon emissions are high."}, {"e:author": ["Daron Acemoglu", "Ufuk Akcigit", "Douglas Hanley", "William Kerr"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/684511", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "52 - 104", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1086/684511", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Transition to Clean Technology", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We develop an endogenous growth model in which clean and dirty technologies compete in production. Research can be directed to either technology. If dirty technologies are more advanced, the transition to clean technology can be difficult. Carbon taxes and research subsidies may encourage production and innovation in clean technologies, though the transition will typically be slow. We estimate the model using microdata from the US energy sector. We then characterize the optimal policy path that heavily relies on both subsidies and taxes. Finally, we evaluate various alternative policies. Relying only on carbon taxes or delaying intervention has significant welfare costs."}, {"e:author": ["Philippe Aghion", "Antoine Dechezlepr&#x000EA;tre", "David H&#x000E9;mous", "Ralf Martin", "John Van Reenen"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/684581", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1 - 51", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1086/684581", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Carbon Taxes, Path Dependency, and Directed Technical Change: Evidence from the Auto Industry", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Can directed technical change be used to combat climate change? We construct new firm-level panel data on auto industry innovation distinguishing between \"dirty\" (internal combustion engine) and \"clean\" (e.g., electric, hybrid, and hydrogen) patents across 80 countries over several decades. We show that firms tend to innovate more in clean (and less in dirty) technologies when they face higher tax-inclusive fuel prices. Furthermore, there is path dependence in the type of innovation (clean/dirty) both from aggregate spillovers and from the firm's own innovation history. We simulate the increases in carbon taxes needed to allow clean technologies to overtake dirty technologies."}, {"e:author": ["Alan Barreca", "Karen Clay", "Olivier Deschenes", "Michael Greenstone", "Joseph S.

There are three primary findings. First, the mortality impact of days with mean temperature exceeding 80&#x000B0;F declined by 75 percent. Almost the entire decline occurred after 1960. Second, the diffusion of residential air conditioning explains essentially the entire decline in hot day-related fatalities. Third, using Dubin and McFadden's discrete-continuous model, the present value of US consumer surplus from the introduction of residential air conditioning is estimated to be $85-$185 billion (2012 dollars)."}, {"e:author": ["Arnaud Costinot", "Dave Donaldson", "Cory Smith"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/684719", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "205 - 248", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1086/684719", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Evolving Comparative Advantage and the Impact of Climate Change in Agricultural Markets: Evidence from 1.7 Million Fields around the World", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "A large agronomic literature models the implications of climate change for a variety of crops and locations around the world. The goal of the present paper is to quantify the macro-level consequences of these micro-level shocks. Using an extremely rich micro-level data set that contains information about the productivity--both before and after climate change--of each of 10 crops for each of 1.7 million fields covering the surface of the earth, we find that the impact of climate change on these agricultural markets would amount to a 0.26 percent reduction in global GDP when trade and production patterns are allowed to adjust. Since the value of output in our 10 crops is equal to 1.8 percent of world GDP, this corresponds to about one-sixth of total crop value."}, {"e:author": ["Michael Carlos Best", "Anne Brockmeyer", "Henrik Jacobsen Kleven", "Johannes Spinnewijn", "Mazhar Waseem"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/685753", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "303 - 303", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:doi": "10.1086/685753", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Erratum: Production versus Revenue Efficiency with Limited Tax Capacity: Theory and Evidence from Pakistan", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:issue": "1"}]
