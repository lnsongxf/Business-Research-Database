I argue that in the retail trade sector, developing countries rationally choose technologies with low measured labor productivity. My theory is that the adoption of modern retail technologies is optimal only when household ownership of complementary durable goods, such as cars, is widespread. Because income is low in the developing world, households own few such durables. The theory implies that policies that increase measured retail productivity do not necessarily increase welfare."}, {"e:author": ["Charles I.

Others threaten lives&#x02014;pollution, nuclear accidents, global warming, and the rapid global transmission of disease. How is growth theory altered when technologies involve life and death instead of just higher consumption? This paper shows that taking life into account has first-order consequences. Under standard preferences, the value of life may rise faster than consumption, leading society to value safety over consumption growth. As a result, the optimal rate of consumption growth may be substantially lower than what is feasible, in some cases falling all the way to zero."}, {"e:author": ["Roland B&#xe9;nabou", "Jean Tirole"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/684853", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "305 - 370", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1086/684853", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Bonus Culture: Competitive Pay, Screening, and Multitasking", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "To analyze the impact of labor market competition on the structure of compensation, we embed multitasking and screening within a Hotelling framework. Competition for talent leads to an escalation of performance pay, shifting effort away from long-term investments, risk management, and cooperation. Efficiency losses can exceed those from a single principal, who dulls incentives to extract rents. As competition intensifies, monopsonistic underincentivization of low-skill agents first decreases and then gives way to growing overincentivization of high-skill ones. Aggregate welfare is thus hill-shaped, while inequality tends to rise monotonically. Bonus caps can help restore balance in incentives but may generate other distortions."}, {"e:author": ["Vivi Alatas", "Abhijit Banerjee", "Rema Hanna", "Benjamin A.

Our village-level experiment in Indonesia finds that requiring beneficiaries to apply for benefits results in substantially poorer beneficiaries than automatic enrollment using the same asset test. Marginally increasing application costs on an experimental basis does not further improve targeting. Estimating a model of the application decision implies that the results are largely driven by the nonpoor, who make up the bulk of the population, forecasting that they are unlikely to pass the asset test and therefore not bothering to apply."}, {"e:author": ["Alberto Alesina", "Stelios Michalopoulos", "Elias Papaioannou"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/685300", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "428 - 488", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1086/685300", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Ethnic Inequality", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "This study explores the consequences and origins of between-ethnicity inequality for a large sample of countries. First, combining satellite images of nighttime luminosity with the homelands of ethnolinguistic groups, we construct measures of ethnic inequality. Second, we uncover a strong inverse association between ethnic inequality and contemporary development above and beyond its relationship with cross-region and cross&#x02013;administrative unit inequality. Third, we establish that differences in geographic endowments across ethnic homelands explain a sizable fraction of the variation in economic disparities across groups. Fourth, we show that inequality in geographic endowments across ethnic homelands is a negative correlate of development."}, {"e:author": ["Fr&#xe9;d&#xe9;ric Boissay", "Fabrice Collard", "Frank Smets"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/685475", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "489 - 538", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1086/685475", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Booms and Banking Crises", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Banking crises are rare events that break out in the midst of credit-intensive booms and bring about deep and long-lasting recessions. This paper presents a textbook dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model to explain these phenomena. The model features a nontrivial banking sector, where bank heterogeneity gives rise to an interbank market. Moral hazard and asymmetric information in this market may lead to sudden market freezes, banking crises, credit crunches, and severe \"financial\" recessions. Those recessions follow credit booms and are not necessarily triggered by large exogenous adverse shocks."}]
