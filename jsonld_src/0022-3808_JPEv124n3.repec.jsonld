When a firm increases its workforce, it raises demand and weakens competition facing other firms, as employed workers spend more and have less time to search for low prices than unemployed workers. These effects induce other firms to hire more labor in order to scale up their presence in the product market. The feedback between employment and product market conditions generates multiple equilibria&#x02014;and the possibility of self-fulfilling fluctuations&#x02014;if differences in shopping behavior between employed and unemployed are large enough. Evidence on spending, shopping, and prices suggests that this is the case."}, {"e:author": ["David C.

I study two organizational systems differing in the extent to which physicians may mutually manage work: Physicians are assigned patients in a &#x0201C;nurse-managed&#x0201D; system but divide patients between themselves in a &#x0201C;self-managed&#x0201D; system. The self-managed system increases throughput productivity by reducing a &#x0201C;foot-dragging&#x0201D; moral hazard, in which physicians prolong patient stays as expected future work increases. I find evidence that physicians in the same location have better information about each other and that, in the self-managed system, they use this information to assign patients."}, {"e:author": ["Yann Algan", "Camille H&#x000E9;met", "David D.

Housing Survey data reveal that diversity induces social anomie. Through the channel of anomie, diversity accounts for the inability of residents to sanction others for vandalism and to act collectively to demand proper building maintenance. However, anomie also lowers opportunities for violent confrontations, which are not related to diversity."}, {"e:author": ["John Sutton", "Daniel Trefler"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/686034", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "826 - 878", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1086/686034", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Capabilities, Wealth, and Trade", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We explore the relation between a country's income and the mix of products it exports. Both are simultaneously determined by countries' capabilities, that is, by countries' productivity and quality levels for each good. Our theoretical setup has two features. (1) Some goods have fewer high-quality producers/countries than others, meaning that there is comparative advantage. (2) Imperfect competition allows high- and low-quality producers to coexist. These two features generate an inverted-U, general equilibrium relationship between a country's export mix and its GDP per capita. We show that this inverted-U permeates the international data on trade and GDP per capita."}, {"e:author": ["Stefania Albanesi", "Claudia Olivetti"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/686035", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "650 - 695", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1086/686035", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Gender Roles and Medical Progress", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Maternal mortality was the second-largest cause of death for women in childbearing years until the mid-1930s in the United States. For each death, 20 times as many mothers suffered pregnancy-related conditions, which made it hard for them to engage in market work. Between 1930 and 1960 there was a remarkable improvement in maternal health. We argue that this development, by enabling women to reconcile work and motherhood, was essential for the joint rise in women&#x02019;s labor force participation and fertility over this period. We also show that the diffusion of infant formula played an important auxiliary role."}, {"e:author": ["Christopher Jepsen", "Peter Mueser", "Kenneth Troske"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/686245", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "621 - 649", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1086/686245", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Labor Market Returns to the GED Using Regression Discontinuity Analysis", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We evaluate returns to General Educational Development (GED) certification for high school dropouts using state administrative data. We apply a fuzzy regression discontinuity method to account for test takers retaking the test. For women we find that GED certification has no statistically significant effect on either employment or earnings. For men we find a significant increase in earnings in the second year after taking the test but no impact in subsequent years. GED certification increases postsecondary school enrollment by 4-8 percentage points. Our results differ from regression discontinuity approaches that fail to account for test retaking."}]
