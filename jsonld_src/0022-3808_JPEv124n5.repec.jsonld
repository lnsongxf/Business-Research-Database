The model departs from the Gale and Shapley model by assuming that a finite number of agents on one side (colleges) are matched to a continuum of agents on the other side (students). We show that stable matchings correspond to solutions of supply and demand equations, with the selectivity of each college playing a role similar to that of prices. We apply the model to an analysis of how competition induced by school choice gives schools incentives to invest in quality and to asymptotics of school choice mechanisms."}, {"e:author": ["Juan Carlos Hatchondo", "Leonardo Martinez", "C&#x000E9;sar Sosa-Padilla"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/688081", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1383 - 1422", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/688081", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Debt Dilution and Sovereign Default Risk", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We measure the effects of debt dilution on sovereign default risk and study debt covenants that could mitigate these effects. We calibrate a baseline model with endogenous debt duration and default risk (in which debt can be diluted) using data from Spain. We find that debt dilution accounts for 78 percent of the default risk in the baseline economy and that eliminating dilution increases the optimal duration of sovereign debt by almost 2 years. Eliminating dilution also increases consumption volatility but still produces welfare gains. The debt covenants we study could help enforcing fiscal rules."}, {"e:author": ["Yeon-Koo Che", "Youngwoo Koh"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/688082", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1295 - 1338", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/688082", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Decentralized College Admissions", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We study decentralized college admissions with uncertain student preferences. Colleges strategically admit students likely to be overlooked by competitors. Highly ranked students may receive fewer admissions or have a higher chance of receiving no admissions than those ranked below. When students&#x02019; attributes are multidimensional, colleges avoid head-on competition by placing excessive weight on school-specific attributes such as essays. Restricting the number of applications or wait-listing alleviates enrollment uncertainty, but the outcomes are inefficient and unfair. A centralized matching via Gale and Shapley&#x02019;s deferred acceptance algorithm attains efficiency and fairness but may make some colleges worse off than under decentralized matching."}, {"e:author": ["Stephanie Schmitt-Groh&#x000E9;", "Mart&#x000ED;n Uribe"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/688175", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1466 - 1514", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/688175", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Downward Nominal Wage Rigidity, Currency Pegs, and Involuntary Unemployment", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "This paper analyzes the inefficiencies arising from the combination of fixed exchange rates, nominal rigidity, and free capital mobility. We document that nominal wages are downwardly rigid in emerging countries. We develop an open-economy model that incorporates this friction. The model predicts that the combination of a currency peg and free capital mobility creates a negative externality that causes overborrowing during booms and high unemployment during contractions. Optimal capital controls are shown to be prudential. For plausible calibrations, they reduce unemployment by around 5 percentage points. The optimal exchange rate policy eliminates unemployment and calls for large devaluations during crises."}, {"e:author": ["Gerard Hoberg", "Gordon Phillips"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/688176", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1423 - 1465", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/688176", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Text-Based Network Industries and Endogenous Product Differentiation", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We study how firms differ from their competitors using new time-varying measures of product similarity based on text-based analysis of firm 10-K product descriptions. This year-by-year set of product similarity measures allows us to generate a new set of industries in which firms can have their own distinct set of competitors. Our new sets of competitors explain specific discussion of high competition, rivals identified by managers as peer firms, and changes to industry competitors following exogenous industry shocks. We also find evidence that firm R&#38;D and advertising are associated with subsequent differentiation from competitors, consistent with theories of endogenous product differentiation."}, {"e:author": ["Duncan Sheppard Gilchrist", "Emily Glassberg Sands"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/688177", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1339 - 1382", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/688177", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Something to Talk About: Social Spillovers in Movie Consumption", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "We exploit the randomness of weather and the relationship between weather and moviegoing to quantify social spillovers in movie consumption. Instrumenting for early viewership with plausibly exogenous weather shocks captured in LASSO-chosen instruments, we find that shocks to opening weekend viewership are doubled over the following five weekends. Our estimated momentum arises almost exclusively at the local level, and we find no evidence that it varies with either ex post movie quality or the precision of ex ante information about movie quality, suggesting that the observed momentum is driven in part by a preference for shared experience, and not only by social learning."}, {"e:author": ["Manuel Bagues", "Berta Esteve-Volart"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/688178", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1269 - 1294", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1086/688178", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Politicians&#x02019; Luck of the Draw: Evidence from the Spanish Christmas Lottery", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Incumbent politicians tend to receive more votes when economic conditions are good. In this paper we explore the source of this correlation, exploiting the exceptional evidence provided by the Spanish Christmas Lottery. Because winning tickets are typically sold by one lottery outlet, winners tend to be geographically clustered. This allows us to study the impact of exogenous good economic conditions on voting behavior. We find that incumbents receive significantly more votes in winning provinces. The evidence is consistent with a temporary increase in happiness making voters more lenient toward the incumbent, or with a stronger preference for the status quo."}]
