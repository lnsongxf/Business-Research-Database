We find that more cognitively able subjects choose numbers closer to equilibrium, earn more, and converge more frequently to equilibrium play. We estimate a structural model of learning based on level k reasoning and find a positive relationship between cognitive ability and levels. Furthermore, the average level of more cognitively able subjects responds positively to the cognitive ability of their opponents. More agreeable and emotionally stable subjects also learn faster, although the effect of cognitive ability is stronger than that of personality."}, {"e:author": ["Amanda Pallais", "Emily Glassberg Sands"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/688850", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1793 - 1828", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1086/688850", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Why the Referential Treatment? Evidence from Field Experiments on Referrals", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Referred workers are more likely than nonreferred workers to be hired, all else equal. In three field experiments in an online labor market, we examine why. We find that referrals contain positive information about worker performance and persistence that is not contained in workers' observable characteristics. We also find that referrals perform particularly well when working directly with their referrers. However, we do not find evidence that referrals exert more effort because they believe their performance will affect their relationship with their referrer or their referrer's position at the firm."}, {"e:author": ["Johannes H&#x000F6;rner", "Andrzej Skrzypacz"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/688874", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1515 - 1562", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1086/688874", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Selling Information", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "A firm considers hiring an agent who may be competent for a potential project or not. The agent can prove her competence but faces a holdup problem. We propose a model of persuasion and show how gradualism helps mitigate the holdup problem. We show when it is optimal to give away part of the information at the beginning of the bargaining and sell the remainder in dribs and drabs. The agent can appropriate only part of the value of information. Introducing a third party allows her to extract the maximum surplus."}, {"e:author": ["Tobias J.

The improvement was achieved by reducing strategic bias in buyer ratings. It led to a significant increase in buyer satisfaction with seller performance, but not to an increase in seller exit. When sellers had the choice between exiting--a reduction in adverse selection--and staying but improving behavior--a reduction in moral hazard--they preferred the latter. Increasing market transparency led to better market outcomes."}, {"e:author": ["Gabriel Chodorow-Reich", "Loukas Karabarbounis"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/688876", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1563 - 1618", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1086/688876", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "The Cyclicality of the Opportunity Cost of Employment", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "The flow opportunity cost of moving from unemployment to employment consists of forgone public benefits and the forgone consumption value of nonworking time. We construct a time series of the opportunity cost of employment using detailed microdata and administrative or national accounts data to estimate benefits levels, eligibility, take-up, consumption by labor force status, hours, taxes, and preference parameters. The opportunity cost is procyclical and volatile over the business cycle. The estimated cyclicality implies far less unemployment volatility in leading models of the labor market than that observed in the data, irrespective of the level of the opportunity cost."}, {"e:author": ["Suresh Naidu", "Yaw Nyarko", "Shing-Yi Wang"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/688877", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1735 - 1792", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1086/688877", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Monopsony Power in Migrant Labor Markets: Evidence from the United Arab Emirates", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "By exploiting a reform in the United Arab Emirates that relaxed restrictions on employer transitions, we provide new estimates of the monopsony power of firms over migrant workers. Our results show that the reform increased incumbent migrants' earnings and firm retention. This occurs despite an increase in employer transitions and is driven by a fall in country exits. While the outcomes of incumbents improved, the reform decreased demand for new migrants and lowered their earnings. These results are consistent with a model of monopsony in which firms face upward-sloping labor supply curves for both new recruits in source countries and incumbent migrants."}, {"e:author": ["David Mitch"], "e:volume": "124", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/688878", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1714 - 1734", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1086/688878", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "A Year of Transition: Faculty Recruiting", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "The year 1946 has been seen as a pivotal year of transition by historians of the Chicago Economics Department, in large part as a result of the arrival of Milton Friedman that year. This essay examines new evidence on department deliberations on faculty hiring in February of 1946. It argues that Friedman's recruitment reflected a compromise between Frank Knight and his followers on the one hand and those associated with the Cowles Commission on the other."}]
