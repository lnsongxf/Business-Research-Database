This allows us to understand the trade-off between occupational choice and desired fertility, as well as sorting both into the labor market and across occupations. We quantify the life cycle career costs associated with children, how they decompose into loss of skills during interruptions, lost earnings opportunities, and selection into more child-friendly occupations. We analyze the long-run effects of policies that encourage fertility and show that they are considerably smaller than short-run effects."}, {"e:author": ["Annamaria Lusardi", "Pierre-Carl Michaud", "Olivia S.

Moreover, because of how the US social insurance system works, better-educated individuals have most to gain from investing in financial knowledge. Our parsimonious specification generates substantial wealth inequality relative to a one-asset saving model and one in which returns on wealth depend on portfolio composition alone. We estimate that 30&#x02013;40 percent of retirement wealth inequality is accounted for by financial knowledge."}, {"e:author": ["Manisha Shah", "Bryce Millett Steinberg"], "e:volume": "125", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/690828", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "527 - 561", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1086/690828", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "Drought of Opportunities: Contemporaneous and Long-Term Impacts of Rainfall Shocks on Human Capital", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Higher wages are generally thought to increase human capital production, particularly in the developing world. We introduce a simple model of human capital production in which investments and time allocation differ by age. Using data on test scores and schooling from rural India, we show that higher wages increase human capital investment in early life (in utero to age 2) but decrease human capital from age 5 to 16. Children switch out of school into productive work when rainfall is higher. The opportunity cost of schooling, even for fairly young children, is an important factor in determining overall human capital investment."}, {"e:author": ["Alex Solis"], "e:volume": "125", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/690829", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "562 - 622", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1086/690829", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "Credit Access and College Enrollment", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Does access to credit explain the gap in schooling attainment between children from richer and poorer families? I present new evidence on this important question based on the causal effects of two college loan programs in Chile that are available to students scoring above a threshold on the national college admission test, enabling a regression discontinuity design. I find that credit access leads to a 100 percent increase in immediate college enrollment and a 50 percent increase in the probability of ever enrolling. Moreover, access to loans effectively eliminates the income gap in enrollment and number of years of college attainment."}, {"e:author": ["Arnaud Chevalier", "Olivier Marie"], "e:volume": "125", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/690830", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "393 - 430", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1086/690830", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "Economic Uncertainty, Parental Selection, and Children&#x02019;s Educational Outcomes", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "After the fall of the Berlin Wall, East Germany experienced an unprecedented temporary drop in fertility driven by economic uncertainty. We show that the children born during this transition period performed worse on a range of educational outcomes from an early age onward. The mothers of these children exhibit personal characteristics and family structures consistent with negative parental selection. Investigating the underlying mechanisms reveals that parental educational input and emotional attachment were also lower for these children. Finally, our ability to compare siblings means that we can reject that our results stem from a time of birth effect."}, {"e:author": ["Shanker Satyanath", "Nico Voigtl&#xe4;nder", "Hans-Joachim Voth"], "e:volume": "125", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/690949", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "478 - 526", "e:issn": "0022-3808", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1086/690949", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "Bowling for Fascism: Social Capital and the Rise of the Nazi Party", "e:journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "e:abstract": "Using newly collected data on association density in 229 towns and cities in interwar Germany, we show that denser social networks were associated with faster entry into the Nazi Party. The effect is large: one standard deviation higher association density is associated with at least 15 percent faster Nazi Party entry. Party membership, in turn, predicts electoral success. Social networks thus aided the rise of the Nazis that destroyed Germany's first democracy. The effects of social capital depended on the political context: in federal states with more stable governments, higher association density was not correlated with faster Nazi Party entry."}, {"e:author": ["Davide Cantoni", "Yuyu Chen", "David Y.

The sharp, staggered introduction of the new curriculum across provinces allows us to identify its causal effects. We examine government documents articulating desired consequences of the reform and identify changes in textbooks reflecting these aims. A survey we conducted reveals that the reform was often successful in shaping attitudes, while evidence on behavior is mixed. Studying the new curriculum led to more positive views of China&#x02019;s governance, changed views on democracy, and increased skepticism toward free markets."}]
