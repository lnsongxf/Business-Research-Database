The product of probability times value summed over all the possible outcomes is the expected value, or simply the <i>expectation</i>. The course of action which leads to the highest expectation is the indicated choice of the decision. Decision means preference, and preference can be expressed only between like quantities.

The purpose is to examine some of the implications arising from the assumption that a piece of complex equipment fails when, and only when, one of its component parts fails. The equipment is assumed made up of many individual parts, each of which is liable to prime failure independent of all other parts. Two different initial conditions are assumed at the beginning of observation or operation: (a) all components are new; (b) the equipment has been operating for a long time, components that have failed having been replaced by new ones at the time of failure. We consider the probability of failure of the equipment as a function of time and of the survival curve of individual components, and the possible improvement of reliability of equipment by replacement of components at a given age.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984."}, {"e:author": ["J.

On the other hand, it is quite possible to obtain useful estimates of the reliability of the whole missile from the results of a flight-test program. Since this technique will come close to duplicating the environmental stress encountered in tactical flight, a simple ratio of successful flights to total flights will itself yield considerable information. This figure can be refined through the use of moving averages, and reliability estimates can be further validated by presenting the results in terms of confidence belts instead of point estimates.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984."}, {"e:author": ["W.

A method is developed which results in a numerical measure of the effect of order types on speed and storage efficiency. This method and considerations of equipment cost are applied to a company payroll calculation in order to determine which of two specific order types is preferable.

An example is the line formed by messages awaiting transmission over a crowded communication channel in which urgent messages may take precedence over routine ones. With the passage of time a given unit may move forward in the line owing to the servicing of units at the front of the line or may move back owing to the arrival of units holding higher priorities. Though it does not provide a complete description of this process, the average elapsed time between the arrival in the line of a unit of a given priority and its admission to the facility for servicing is useful in evaluating the procedure by which priority assignments are made. Expressions for this quantity are derived for two cases---the single-channel system in which the unit servicing times are arbitrarily distributed (Eq. 3) and the multiple-channel system in which the servicing times are exponentially distributed (Eq. 6). In both cases it is assumed that arrivals occur at random.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984."}, {"e:author": ["Thornton Page"], "e:volume": "2", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.2.1.86", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "86-88", "e:issn": "0030-364X", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1287/opre.2.1.86", "e:year": 1954, "e:title": "Letter to the Editor---Operations Research as Defined in this Journal", "e:journal": "Operations Research", "e:abstract": "When a man sits down to write a letter to himself he is seldom troubled by semantics, but this letter is an exception, since the topic, in my opinion, is entirely semantic and hinges on what we mean by the word ‘definition.’ At the last two Society meetings there have been lengthy discussions aimed at a formal definition of operations research, and a number of potential authors threaten to submit long articles on this subject for publication.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984."}, {"e:author": ["A.

More than 250 traffic officers are utilized, and the payroll costs exceed a million dollars annually. In staffing its toll plazas the Port Authority attempts to handle traffic with a minimum number of toll collectors consistent with uniformly good service to the public and properly spaced relief periods for the toll collectors. This requires finding the level of traffic delays that gives the best compromise between the conflicting objectives of economy and service. In the past the number of toll collectors provided for operating a toll plaza was determined by judgment based on experience and a rule-of-thumb work standard which had not been related to service. Judgment was likewise used to allocate manpower and control the number of toll booths opened at any time. This method resulted in patron delays observed to vary from 2 to 50 sec. The tools of probability theory provide methods for dealing with the problem in quantitative terms. They enable determination of the relations between traffic volumes, number of toll booths, and grade of service. With this knowledge the optimum grade of service can be established in a logical manner and the number of toll booths required at any time of day can be specified in advance. Use of this method permitted savings in toll collection expenses and better service.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984."}, {"e:author": ["Donald P.

The relation holds for a large class of the servicing-time distributions that occur in practice, in particular the cases of constant, exponential, and Type III Pearson servicing times. The derivation takes into account changes in the magnitude of demand from customer to customer, changes that may exist in many of the situations in which the theory is likely to be applied.

The present author (Flood, Merrill M. 1953. On the Hitchcock distribution problem. <i>Pacific J.

Centralized nets are shown to learn to do as well as the net permits fairly rapidly but to be characterized by high minimum-action.

For example, in the analysis and evaluation of intelligence and military reports, preparation and analysis of tactical methods and principles, complex logical nonnumerical problems often arise more frequently than do problems of a numerical nature. Consequently there is the need for a systematic method of analyzing and solving propositional functions and equations. The purpose of this paper is to present the systematic rules of an “arithmetic” for handling propositional functions and equations, formulated in a manner amenable to easy computation and mechanization. Among the important results given are: (a) a simple method of expressing a propositional calculus in terms of the shortest digitalized words possible, (b) a systematic method for generating the simplest and absolute simplest forms for Boolean functions, (c) a method for systematically generating all true and false implications of given propositions, (d) a method for systematically generating all possible changes of variables (i.e., substitution of new variables) that can be made on a propositional calculus while preserving the logical meaning, and (e) the systematic generation of all solutions to any number of simultaneous propositional equations in any number of unknowns. The solution of this latter problem implies the ability to perform manipulations with propositional variables in a manner analogous to manipulations of ordinary algebraic equations. A number of illustrative applications to military situations are given, including an analysis of certain propositions and conclusions of Clausewitz.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984."}, {"e:author": ["Richard Bellman"], "e:volume": "2", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.2.3.275", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "275-288", "e:issn": "0030-364X", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1287/opre.2.3.275", "e:year": 1954, "e:title": "Some Applications of the Theory of Dynamic Programming---A Review", "e:journal": "Operations Research", "e:abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to provide an expository account of the theory of dynamic programming.

In what proportions? How many? The suggested criteria provided for equating the marginal cost-effect ratios of two or more weapon systems. Suboptimization criteria for approaching this ideal were suggested. In this first approximation, it was assumed that the alternative weapons systems could be delivered within the period under consideration. The present paper treats the case in which it is not possible, in the time specified by the program, to obtain the quantity of a weapon system required by the optimum solution given by the static equilibrium analysis. This situation arises when some resource cannot be made available in the stated time, regardless of cost. Criteria for allocating resources under this constraint are suggested, using a model based on experience in past periods of mobilization, and one believed to be consistent with what may be expected to occur in a future mobilization.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984."}, {"e:author": ["Thomas Saaty", "Saul Gass"], "e:volume": "2", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.2.3.316", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "316-319", "e:issn": "0030-364X", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1287/opre.2.3.316", "e:year": 1954, "e:title": "Parametric Objective Function (Part 1)", "e:journal": "Operations Research", "e:abstract": "In the linear programming problem where there is a linear function to be optimized (called the objective function), it is desirable to study the behaviour of solutions when the (cost) coefficients in the objective function are parametrized.

One possible approach to the analysis of man-machine systems is to consider the implications of such experimental knowledge for the design of man-machine systems. The functions performed by human operators in these systems are primarily those of control of the energy resources of the system. Control functions involve, by their very nature, the availability of relevant information and the opportunity to transmit control decisions reached on the basis of this information. It is important not only that enough information be available to an operator in order to carry out his control responsibilities, but also that these tasks be not complicated unnecessarily by the provision of too much or irrelevant information. Moreover, in applying an informational analysis to control tasks, it is essential that consideration be given as to what sorts of categories are perceptually possible for operators since any analysis which does not take into account certain perceptual limitations of humans is likely to be invalid. Following this point of view it is suggested that intelligent design of man-machine systems involves compatibility between the control requirements of a system and the capabilities of the men in the system.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984."}, {"e:author": ["T.

Current U.S. doctrine is conservative. The techniques of game theory permit analysis of the risk involved if the commander deviates from current doctrine to base his decision on his estimate of what his enemy intends to do rather than on what his enemy is capable of doing.

The activity discussed is the flying of planes at a base, the subactivities being the supply of spare parts. The first problem of the base is how many of each part to order. This has been satisfactorily solved by existing literature. The second problem is when to order, if the lack of any one of many different parts can ground an aircraft. It is this problem which the present paper solves. Consistent with stated assumptions, formulas are derived that yield minimum routine supply cost sets of reorder points (one reorder point for each part). Each set gives some specified protection against a plane being grounded because the base lacks one or more parts, at minimum cost, ignoring costs which arise from grounding of planes. Taking into account the costs that arise from the grounding of planes, such as the cost of rush requisitions and the need for additional aircraft and other considerations, a procedure is developed for choosing one set among all minimum cost sets which is optimum in an over-all sense. The solution is put in a form which can be used on a decentralized basis and under changing conditions. The use of the model under dynamic conditions is discussed. A variant of the main model is described which should be extremely useful for combat situations.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984."}, {"e:author": ["William Miehle"], "e:volume": "2", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.2.4.433", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "433-440", "e:issn": "0030-364X", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1287/opre.2.4.433", "e:year": 1954, "e:title": "Numerical Solution of the Problem of Optimum Distribution of Effort", "e:journal": "Operations Research", "e:abstract": "This paper is an extension of previously published work by Bernard O.

These results are valid if the target size and vulnerability are not too large compared to the round dispersion, and the other assumptions adopted are those ordinarily used for problems of this type. These expressions show that, for the two-dimensional situations considered, a salvo kill probability can be approximately stated as an explicit function of four parameters. These parameters are the number of ammunition rounds, the average target vulnerability times the target size, the salvo aiming error dispersion, and a function of the round dispersion and two dispersion type terms which depend on the target size, shape, and vulnerability. Thus the target properties are condensed into three numbers. Also the resulting probability expressions are of a form which permits direct examination of the effects of changes in the salvo-aiming system (fire-control system), the number and properties of the ammunition rounds, and the properties of the target.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984."}, {"e:author": ["Acheson J.

In the Lincoln Tunnel in New York City, the Port Authority has established minimum speed limits, banned slow under-powered trucks from the tunnel, and erected a number of signs to influence motorists to maintain a specified distance behind preceding vehicles. All of these traffic control devices are directed toward an optimizing of vehicular speeds and spacings, and have resulted in significant increases in maximum hourly traffic volumes accommodated by the tunnel.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984."}, {"e:author": ["Bertram Klein"], "e:volume": "3", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.3.2.168", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "168-175", "e:issn": "0030-364X", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1287/opre.3.2.168", "e:year": 1955, "e:title": "Direct Use of Extremal Principles in Solving Certain Optimizing Problems Involving Inequalities", "e:journal": "Operations Research", "e:abstract": "It is shown how extremal principles may be used in their rigorous sense to solve certain optimizing problems involving inequalities.

Very frequently for these problems the quantity of interest can be stated in terms of the probabilities of specified numbers of “successes” for the group of binomial events considered. The evaluation of these probabilities can be greatly simplified if it is known that they can be approximated by a Poisson distribution. For the special case where each event has the same “success” probability and the events are statistically independent, the binomial probability distribution is applicable. It is well known that the Poisson distribution approximates the binomial distribution if the number of events is large and the probability of “success” is small (see, e.g., Hoel, P. G. 1947. <i>Introduction to Mathematical Statistics</i>. Wiley, 50.). In Koopman [Koopman, B. O. 1950. Necessary and sufficient conditions for Poisson's distribution. <i>Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.</i> <b>1</b> 813--823.] this result was extended to the case of independent binomial events with possibly different probabilities for “success.” This paper presents a further extension in which an event is not required to be statistically independent of all the other events. These results indicate that the Poisson distribution often is applicable to operations-research problems dealing with large numbers of binomial events that have small “success” probabilities.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984."}, {"e:author": ["H.

These evaluations are generally based upon the computed performance of the various weapons systems in a typical combat situation. The computation of this performance invariably involves the specification of certain tactics which are relatively easy to change by either combatant. It is reasonable to assume that these combatants would be “rational” in the game-theoretic sense.Although the specific type of weapons systems discussed here are those of individual aircraft, the concepts are directly applicable to other systems. However, for clarity of exposition we shall not refer to any of these generalizations.This paper was prepared for, and portions were presented at the First Annual Meeting of the Operations Research Society in Cleveland, Ohio, May 16, 1953.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984."}, {"e:author": ["Georges Brigham"], "e:volume": "3", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.3.4.412", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "412-428", "e:issn": "0030-364X", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1287/opre.3.4.412", "e:year": 1955, "e:title": "On a Congestion Problem in an Aircraft Factory", "e:journal": "Operations Research", "e:abstract": "This is a study of the optimum number of clerks to be placed behind service counters. It involves queuing theory and was solved in two parts: First, we considered the counter from the customers' side, the “obverse” queue. Observational data showed that arrivals at the counter occur at random, the order of serving was random, and the distribution of the service times was exponential, so that Erlang's “C” formula for the probability that a customer has to wait applied. A formula is derived and graphed that shows the optimum number of clerks to be used behind the counter and the over-all minimum cost caused by waiting on the part of the customers and the clerks as a function of the queue input and the ratio of the cost of the customers' time to that of the clerks'. Second, the queue from the clerks' side was considered, that is, from the “reverse” queue. Clerks' time spent waiting for customers to appear is not altogether lost, if they can do work behind the counter. What happens to the clerks is governed by the characteristics of the “obverse” queue. From that is derived the probability distribution of the clerks' waiting time, considering the clerks to form a queue, as customers do. With this we calculate the saving in clerks' time that can be effected subject to the limitations of the shortest free period and the total length of time that can be used productively. This saving can then be subtracted from the cost computed in the first part of the study. The results obtained are applicable to any queuing operation which has the same characteristics.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984."}, {"e:author": ["Sheldon B.

Greater complexity is inevitable as we attempt analyses to aid decisions affecting more distant time periods: growth in number of relevant variables, compounding of uncertainties; increased importance of enemy reactions; complications of time phasing, the need for a broader concept of criteria Techniques available to the systems analyst for dealing with these complexities are less than satisfactory. “Factoring” is inevitable. All routine or mechanistic approaches are deficient; e.g., expected value and minimax criteria. Design and criteria problems are of dominant importance. The systems analyst may have to be content with better rather than optimal solutions, or with devising and costing sensible methods of hedging; or merely with discovering critical sensitivities. He has an important role as inventor of systems. The difficulties of systems analysis are rooted in the nature of the military problems. Other methods---e.g, piecemeal analysis or intuition---do not escape them and have limitations of their own. Military systems analysis provides a framework for combining the knowledge of experts in many fields to reach solutions which transcend any individual expert's judgment.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984."}, {"e:author": ["Richard B.

These vehicles break down for such various reasons as flat tires, overheating, no gasoline, and mechanical failures. The stoppages are particularly troublesome in peak traffic periods when the full capacity of the tunnel may be badly needed. Subaqueous tunnels consist of two-lane tubes, so that a stoppage in one lane immediately reduces the capacity of the tube affected by one-half. Actually, the reduction in capacity is even greater than one-half, since the movement of traffic in the unstopped lane is reduced by the operations necessary to remove the disabled vehicle.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984."}, {"e:author": ["Frederick V.
