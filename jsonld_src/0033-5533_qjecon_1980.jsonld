Two major characteristics of the trade were periodic attempts at cartelization by producers and the existence of a substantial per unit tax on the commodity. In order to measure the relative quantitative impact of market structure and tax policy, a linear supply and demand model is estimated using two-stage least squares. The major arguments of the paper are that the cartels were ineffective in restricting supply, that the tax on coal raised its price significantly, and that final consumers bore the greatest share of the tax burden.

The paper analyzes the effect on private demands of various exogenous balanced budget changes in the path of public expenditure: temporary, permanent, and countercyclical. The effects of temporary and countercyclical changes depend upon whether public and private goods are complements or substitutes and whether public goods are over- or undersupplied. The largest impact comes from countercyclical changes in undersupplied complementary public goods. Permanent changes tend to have a smaller impact but are harder to specify, since the results crucially depend upon the third derivatives of utility functions."}, {"e:volume": "95", "e:author": ["James L.

S. corporations. The facts presented indicate that while, within grade levels, there is a strong positive association between experience and relative earnings, there is either no association or a negative association between experience and relative rated performance. If we are correct that the performance ratings given to managerial and professional employees in any grade level adequately reflect those employees' relative productivity in the year of assessment, the results imply that the human capital on-the-job training model cannot explain a substantial part of the observed return to labor market experience."}, {"e:volume": "95", "e:author": ["Edwin Mansfield", "Anthony Romeo"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/1885489", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "737-750", "e:issn": "0033-5533", "e:doi": "10.2307/1885489", "e:year": 1980, "e:title": "Technology Transfer to Overseas Subsidiaries by U.

We modify the basic model of the incidence of payroll taxes with variable factor supply to include dynamic adjustments. We find that, under reasonable assumptions about the magnitudes of the lags in adjustment, it takes several years before half of the distance to a new equilibrium in wages and employment is reached. Thus, even if payroll taxes are borne by labor in the long run, a large part of any increase in the tax will be borne by capital for some time. For purposes of policy, the effects of payroll tax increases must be analyzed as if part of their effect is on profits, regardless of the long-run distribution of the burden."}, {"e:volume": "95", "e:author": ["Bengt Holmstrom"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/1885491", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "765-773", "e:issn": "0033-5533", "e:doi": "10.2307/1885491", "e:year": 1980, "e:title": "The Cost of Capital in Nonmarketed Firms", "e:journal": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:volume": "95", "e:author": ["Jagdish N.
