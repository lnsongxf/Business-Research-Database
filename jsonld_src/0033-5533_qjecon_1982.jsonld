For example, the slope of the aggregate supply curve and the rationally formed expectations in the asset markets can respond dramatically to the government's choice of exchange-rate regime.

We measure the opportunity cost of female headship and the effects of welfare benefits and women's work in the market on female headship and poverty. We find that if welfare benefits were reduced, there would be small reductions in the proportion of women heading households for whites and nonwhites, but a substantial increase in poverty for nonwhites. We also find that wives' work in the market reduces poverty and female headship for nonwhites, and reduces poverty, but increases headship for whites."}, {"e:volume": "97", "e:author": ["Boyan Jovanovic"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/1885876", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "535-539", "e:issn": "0033-5533", "e:doi": "10.2307/1885876", "e:year": 1982, "e:title": "Favorable Selection with Asymmetric Information", "e:journal": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:volume": "97", "e:author": ["Conway L.

Because they are based on cross-section data, however, these estimates cannot distinguish between permanent responses to tax rate changes and the timing of realizations to take advantage of the normal fluctuations in any individual's tax rates over time. The purpose of this paper is to distinguish transitory from permanent tax effects by analyzing panel data for taxpayers. Controlling for permanent and transitory income and other variables, the estimates suggest both transitory and permanent effects, although the permanent tax rate effect is not significant in all cases."}, {"e:volume": "97", "e:author": ["Timothy J.

In large part the insignificance of relative asset supply effects associated with Federal debt-management policy may result from the use of unrestricted reduced-form models of interest rate determination. Using a disaggregated structural model of the markets for corporate bonds, equities, and four distinct maturity classes of Treasury securities, Federal debt-management policy is found to affect Treasury and private security yields significantly. Furthermore, the yields on corporate bonds and equities are influenced disproportionately."}, {"e:volume": "97", "e:author": ["Paulina Beato"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/1885105", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "669-688", "e:issn": "0033-5533", "e:doi": "10.2307/1885105", "e:year": 1982, "e:title": "The Existence of Marginal Cost Pricing Equilibria with Increasing Returns", "e:journal": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "e:abstract": "The competitive mechanism fails in economies with nonconvex technologies. Competitive equilibria do not exist in general, and Pareto optima are no longer equilibria.

Modern economic theory has returned to the foundations of marginal cost pricing theory in a general equilibrium framework. The existence of equilibria with marginal cost pricing in economies with increasing returns and a more general type of nonconvexities is analyzed in this paper. The case of differentiable economies where all production sets are limited by smooth surfaces is developed.
