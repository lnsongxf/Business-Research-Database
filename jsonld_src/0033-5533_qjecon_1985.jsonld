In some plausible situations, such taxes can increase efficiency. The explanation for these surprising results is that the government, by taxing capital income, absorbs a certain fraction of both the expected return and the uncertainty in the return. While investors as a result receive a lower expected return, they also bear less risk when they invest, and these two effects are largely offsetting."}, {"e:volume": "100", "e:author": ["James D.

Under static expectations about real interest rates and for some class of utility functions, consumption, which is a distributed lag function of current and past expenditure, follows a martingale. Main empirical results are (i) the durability of commodities usually classified as services is substantial, (ii) the hypothesis applies to about 85 percent of the population consisting of wage earners, and (iii) income changes explain only a small fraction of the movements in expenditure."}, {"e:volume": "100", "e:author": ["Ian M.

Equilibrium is shown to exist and is characterized in both cases, but monopoly has a significant effect on the equilibrium only in the latter.

This paper formalizes an idea often found in the historical literature in loosely specified form which argues that the institutional structure of the southern plantation economy caused this technological inertia. In particular, the Institutional Hypothesis argues that the annual labor contracts used to secure plantation labor discouraged partial mechanization and inventive activity by redirecting the impact of higher labor costs away from the development and adoption of labor saving machinery and toward the adoption of small unmechanizable tenancies. This hypothesis is modeled, and supporting evidence is presented.

This paper investigates the stability of solutions in the disequilibrium sense of whether, given a small deviation of expectations functions from some rational expectations equilibrium, the system returns to that solution under a natural revision rule. Weak and strong local stability are distinguished. Stability conditions are calculated for a simple general linear model and applied to two macroeconomic examples. In some cases there is a unique stable equilibrium. In other cases a continuum of equilibria forms a weakly but not strongly stable class."}, {"e:volume": "100", "e:author": ["Robert A.
