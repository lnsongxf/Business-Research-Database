That is, we analyze the relationship between the set of produced goods in equilibrium when fixed costs are small and the set of produced goods by a social planner when fixed costs equal zero. It is shown that if all of the goods are substitutes, there are never too few varieties, and there may be too many. Conversely, if the goods are all complementary, there are never too many, and there may be too few."}, {"e:volume": "102", "e:author": ["David Dollar"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/1884220", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "615-632", "e:issn": "0033-5533", "e:doi": "10.2307/1884220", "e:year": 1987, "e:title": "Import Quotas and the Product Cycle", "e:journal": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "e:abstract": "This paper uses a dynamic general equilibrium model of the product cycle in North-South trade to analyze the short-run and long-run effects of import quotas imposed in the North on manufactured goods from the South.

The long-run effect of the protection is to unambiguously reduce real wages in the North because the quotas artificially increase production costs in the North relative to the South, accelerating the transfer of technology and capital from North to South."}, {"e:volume": "102", "e:author": ["Dani Rodrik"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/1884221", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "633-650", "e:issn": "0033-5533", "e:doi": "10.2307/1884221", "e:year": 1987, "e:title": "The Economics of Export-Performance Requirements", "e:journal": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "e:abstract": "This paper analyzes the resource-allocation and welfare effects of export-performance requirements imposed on foreign investors.

When the investment in job training is endogenous, inefficient turnover again occurs, and the investment in specific skills is inefficiently high.
