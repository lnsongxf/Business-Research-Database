The direct favorable effects of cheaper imports on consumer prices, on the prices of imported inputs, on wage demands, and on the demand for money may be outweighed by the unemployment caused by the trade deficit. Second, the effects of wage indexation on the costs of disinflation are reexamined. Ex ante indexation speeds up disinflation.

Since prices are flexible, the multiplier of manufacturing output with respect to autonomous demand changes may or may not exceed unity: demand changes lead to price effects as well as income effects that work opposite each other. Nevertheless, there always exist government policies that achieve Pareto improvements by switching demand toward the manufacturing sector.
