When the repeated nature of the wage bargaining process is considered, the equilibria are neither as inefficient as the monopoly union model predicts nor as fully efficient. Rather, the two models can be regarded as particular cases with certain discount rates. We apply our model to issues such as the endgame interpretation of the U.

We extend their framework by allowing employment to vary over time, at equidistant intervals. When both parties can precommit ex ante not to renegotiate the contract, this replicates the Grossman-Hart outcome each subperiod. When precommitment is not possible, information revealed through the contract can create Pareto-improving renegotiation opportunities, and the issue of optimal information revelation arises. The paper analyzes the impact of ex post Pareto-improving renegotiations on the optimal contract."}, {"e:volume": "104", "e:author": ["Arthur Lewbel"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2937813", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "621-633", "e:issn": "0033-5533", "e:doi": "10.2307/2937813", "e:year": 1989, "e:title": "Exact Aggregation and a Representative Consumer", "e:journal": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:volume": "104", "e:author": ["Richard Baldwin", "Paul Krugman"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2937860", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "635-654", "e:issn": "0033-5533", "e:doi": "10.2307/2937860", "e:year": 1989, "e:title": "Persistent Trade Effects of Large Exchange Rate Shocks", "e:journal": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "e:abstract": "This paper presents a theoretical basis for the argument that large exchange rate shocks—such as the 1980s dollar cycle—may have persistent effects on trade flows and the equilibrium exchange rate itself. We begin with a partial-equilibrium model in which large exchange rate fluctuations lead to entry or exit decisions that are not reversed when the currency returns to its previous level. Then we develop a simple model of the feedback from hysteresis in trade to the exchange rate itself. Here we see that a large capital inflow, which leads to an initial appreciation, can result in a persistent reduction in the exchange rate consistent with trade balance."}, {"e:volume": "104", "e:author": ["Jeremy C.

In equilibrium the market is efficient and is not fooled: it correctly conjectures that there will be earnings inflation, and adjusts for this in making inferences. Nonetheless, managers, who take the market's conjectures as fixed, continue to behave myopically. The model is useful in assessing evidence that has been presented in che \"myopia\" debate.

The monopolist trades the objectives of exploiting past customers and attracting new ones. In a period with many new potential customers, the monopolist gives more weight to attracting and lowers its markup.
