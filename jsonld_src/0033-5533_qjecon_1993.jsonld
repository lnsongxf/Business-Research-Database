I find that demand shocks induce positive covariation between price and quantity for 16 out of 26 sample industries, controlling for observable cost shift variables. When sample industries are pooled, I estimate that a demand shock which initially raises industry output by 1 percent generates a price increase of 0.182 percent within one year. I find that input-output instruments detect upward sloping supply curves more readily than least squares or other commonly used demand-shift instruments."}, {"e:volume": "108", "e:author": ["Alan B.
