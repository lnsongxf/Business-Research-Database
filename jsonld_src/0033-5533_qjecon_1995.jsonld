Therefore, aggregate inflation depends on the distribution of relative-price changes: inflation rises when the distribution is skewed to the right, and falls when the distribution is skewed to the left.

At high transport costs all countries have some manufacturing, but when transport costs fall below a critical value, a core-periphery spontaneously forms, and nations that find themselves in the periphery suffer a decline in real income. At still lower transport costs there is convergence of real incomes, in which peripheral nations gain and core nations may lose."}, {"e:volume": "110", "e:author": ["Sukkoo Kim"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2946643", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "881-908", "e:issn": "0033-5533", "e:doi": "10.2307/2946643", "e:year": 1995, "e:title": "Expansion of Markets and the Geographic Distribution of Economic Activities: The Trends in U.

The analysis of the long-run trends in U.

Increasing the income limit for Medicaid resulted in a decrease in AFDC participation and an increase in labor force participation among these women.

In sharp contrast to the literature, we find substantial evidence of a link between monetary policy and exchange rates. Specifically, according to our results a contractionary shock to U. S. monetary policy leads to (i) persistent, significant appreciations in U.

The size of this differential payment is a function of the probability that a vote is pivotal in a control contest and the magnitude of the private benefits obtainable by controlling the company. Simple proxies for these two factors explain up to 30 percent of the variation of the voting premium across companies and through time. My findings also suggest that the value of managerial perquisites are, at least partially, reflected in the price of votes."}, {"e:volume": "110", "e:author": ["George J. Borjas", "Valerie A.
