Full-price retailers are compensated for a higher probability of unsold inventories by a higher retail price when they sell.

Bundling can be profitable if this beneficial effect of reduced rent dissipation outweighs the negative effect of intensified price competition.

The cancellation provides exogenous variation in eligibility for the subsidy that is uncorrelated with householdspecific heterogeneity in saving behavior. The empirical analysis suggests that the subsidy had a substantial impact on saving: each dollar contributed to the program represented 56-93 and 20-57 cents of new household and national saving, respectively."}]
