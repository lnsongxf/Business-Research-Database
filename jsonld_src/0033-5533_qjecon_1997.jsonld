Buffer-stock behavior emerges if consumers with important income uncertainty are sufficiently impatient. In the traditional model, consumption growth is determined solely by tastes. In contrast, buffer-stock consumers set average consumption growth equal to average labor income growth, regardless of tastes. The model can explain three empirical puzzles: the \"consumption/income parallel\" documented by Carroll and Summers; the \"consumption/income divergence\" first documented in the 1930s; and the stability of the household age/wealth profile over time despite the unpredictability of idiosyncratic wealth changes."}, {"e:volume": "112", "e:author": ["Jaume Ventura"], "e:issue": "1", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1162/003355397555127", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "57-84", "e:issn": "0033-5533", "e:doi": "10.1162/003355397555127", "e:year": 1997, "e:title": "Growth and Interdependence", "e:journal": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "e:abstract": "Two of the most interesting facts of the postwar international growth experience are (1) the conditional convergence finding that, after controlling for measures of education and government policies, poor countries tend to grow faster than rich ones; and (2) a small group of export-oriented economies in East Asia have been able to grow at rates that are so high that they defy historical comparisons.

We show that changing prices in these establishments is a complex process, requiring dozens of steps and a nontrivial amount of resources. The menu costs average $105,887/year per store, comprising 0.70 percent of revenues, 35.2 percent of net margins, and $0.52/price change. These menu costs may be forming a barrier to price changes. Specifically, (1) a supermarket chain facing higher menu costs (due to item pricing laws that require a separate price tag on each item) changes prices two and one-half times less frequently than the other four chains; (2) within this chain the prices of products exempt from the law are changed over three times more frequently than the products subject to the law. \"In principle, fixed costs of changing prices can be observed and measured. In practice, such costs take disparate forms in different firms, and we have no data on their magnitude. So the theory can be tested at best indirectly, at worst not at all\" [Alan Blinder 1991, p. 90]."}, {"e:volume": "112", "e:author": ["David M. Cutler", "Edward L.

This paper asks what determines privatization prices using firm-level data for all 236 Mexican companies privatized between 1983 and 1992. There are three main reasons why net pricesâauction prices net of the cost of prior restructuring measuresâare low, averaging 54 cents per dollar of assets. First, privatization prices are very sensitive to the level of competition in the auction and restrictions often limited participation. Second, the privatization process took too long, and lengthier privatizations are associated with lower premiums. Third, firm prior restructuring measures absorbed an average of 33 percent of the auction price. Most restructuring measures do not increase price and delay privatization further. Net prices would have increased by 71 cents per dollar of assets if the government had emphasized speed, succeeding in divesting assets in one year less than the average, and firing the CEO were the only restructuring step taken."}, {"e:volume": "112", "e:author": ["Alberto Alesina", "Enrico Spolaore"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1162/003355300555411", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1027-1056", "e:issn": "0033-5533", "e:doi": "10.1162/003355300555411", "e:year": 1997, "e:title": "On the Number and Size of Nations", "e:journal": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "e:abstract": "This paper studies the equilibrium determination of the number of countries in different political regimes, and in different economic environments, with more or less economic integration.
