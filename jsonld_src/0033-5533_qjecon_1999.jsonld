We assume that to live off one's own work is a social norm, and that the larger the population share adhering to this norm, the more intensely it is felt by the individual. Individuals face two choices: one economic, whether to work or live off public transfers; and one political, how large the transfer should be. The size of the transfer and the intensity of the social norm are determined endogenously in equilibrium."}, {"e:volume": "114", "e:author": ["Matthew Rabin", "Joel L.

Evidence from the NLSY suggests similar results among full-time workers between 1988 and 1996. Between 1973 and 1991 the disamenity of evening/night work was increasingly borne by low-wage male workers. Changing earnings inequality has understated changing inequality in the returns to work.

Where privatization is effective, the effect on revenue performance is very pronounced, but there is no comparable effect on cost reduction. Overlooking the strong revenue effect of privatization to outsider owners leads to a substantial overstatement of potential employment losses from postprivatization restructuring."}, {"e:volume": "114", "e:author": ["Rafael La Porta", "Florencio López-de-Silanes"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1162/003355399556250", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1193-1242", "e:issn": "0033-5533", "e:doi": "10.1162/003355399556250", "e:year": 1999, "e:title": "The Benefits of Privatization: Evidence from Mexico", "e:journal": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "e:abstract": "Critics of privatization argue that the increased profitability of privatized companies comes at the expense of society.

Using a hazard model, we find that interest group factors related to the relative strength of potential winners (large banks and small, bank-dependent firms) and losers (small banks and the rival insurance firms) can explain the timing of branching deregulation across states during the last quarter century. The same factors also explain congressional voting on interstate branching deregulation. While we find some support for each theory, the private interest approach provides the most compelling overall explanation of our results."}]
