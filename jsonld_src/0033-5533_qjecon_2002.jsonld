In a frictional labor market, this force translates into higher wage dispersion even among ex ante equal workers. With vintage-human capital, the acceleration reduces workers' capacity to transfer skills from old to new machines, generating a rise in the cross-sectional variance of skills, and therefore of wages. Through calibration, the paper shows that this mechanism can account for 30 percent of the surge in residual inequality in the U. S. economy (or for most of its transitory component).

This demand for self-serving beliefs (which can also arise from hedonic or signaling motives) must be weighed against the risks of overconfidence. On the supply side, we develop a model of self-deception through endogenous memory that reconciles the motivated and rational features of human cognition. The resulting intrapersonal game of strategic communication typically leads to multiple equilibria. While \"positive thinking\" can improve welfare, it can also be self-defeating (and nonetheless pursued)."}, {"e:volume": "117", "e:author": ["Lena Edlund", "Rohini Pande"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1162/003355302760193922", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "917-961", "e:issn": "0033-5533", "e:doi": "10.1162/003355302760193922", "e:year": 2002, "e:title": "Why Have Women Become Left-Wing?

But the observed association between sex ratios and social and economic conditions may be confounded by omitted variables and reverse causality. This paper uses variation in immigrant flows as a natural experiment to study the effect of sex ratios on the children and grandchildren of immigrants. The flow of immigrants affected the second-generation marriage market because second-generation marriages were mostly endogamous, i.e., to members of the same ethnic group. The empirical results suggest that high sex ratios had a large positive effect on the likelihood of female marriage, and a large negative effect on female labor force participation. Perhaps surprisingly, the marriage rates of second-generation men appear to be a slightly increasing function of immigrant sex ratios. Higher sex ratios also appear to have raised male earnings and the incomes of parents with young children. The empirical results are broadly consistent with theories where higher sex ratios increase female bargaining power in the marriage market."}, {"e:volume": "117", "e:author": ["Emmanuel Saez"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1162/003355302760193959", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1039-1073", "e:issn": "0033-5533", "e:doi": "10.1162/003355302760193959", "e:year": 2002, "e:title": "Optimal Income Transfer Programs: Intensive versus Extensive Labor Supply Responses", "e:journal": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "e:abstract": "This paper analyzes optimal income transfers for low incomes.

The European intervention appears to have created an \"institutional reversal\" among these societies, meaning that Europeans were more likely to introduce institutions encouraging investment in regions that were previously poor. This institutional reversal accounts for the reversal in relative incomes.
