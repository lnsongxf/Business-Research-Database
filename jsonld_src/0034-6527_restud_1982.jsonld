In this model, firms had a choice whether to set up or not. One feature of the model was that free entry of firms was not assumed. Barriers to entry were captured by assuming that there was a large (generally, infinite) set of potential firms F. Corresponding to each f ∊ F, there was a firm (called \"firm f\") with a production set Y(f). Each firm had a set-up cost associated with it. Only very weak conditions were placed on the set F and the production set mapping Y(·), so that in particular the case where different firms could produce a commodity on different terms was allowed for. The economy was made large by replicating the consumer sector, keeping the production sector, i.e. the set of potential firms F, fixed. The number of operating firms in equilibrium generally increased, however, since in view of the set-up costs there was \"room\" for more firms in a large economy. Unfortunately, it turns out that this procedure, while correct, does not capture quite what was intended. In particular, while in the resulting monopolistically competitive equlibrium, some firms will earn supernormal profits, it can be shown that, for any η &gt; 0, the per capita number of firms earning profits in excess of η tends to zero as the size of the consumer sector tends to infinity (see Corollary 6 in the Appendix to Hart (1979)). In other words, in per capita terms, almost all firms earn approximately zero profits in a large economy. Thus while barriers to entry may be significant in absolute terms, in per capita terms they are negligible. The way round this difficulty is to drop the assumption that the set of potential firms is fixed. Instead substitute the assumption that the set of potential firms in the economy rE, where the consumer sector is replicated r times, is given bywhere F is as before. That is, one replicates the set of potential firms at the same time as the consumer sector. Then the theorems of Hart (1979) continue to hold. Corollary 6 in the Appendix must be modified as follows. Corollary 6′. There exists h &gt; 0 such thatfor all f ∊ F. Corollary 6′ is proved below. Otherwise the proofs of Theorem 1 and Proposition 2 are unchanged (one no longer sets h = 1 after Corollary 6). As an example, F might consist of one firm with an efficient technology for producing some commodity and one firm with an inefficient technology. Then in the economy rE, there will be r potential firms with the efficient technology and r potential firms with the inefficient technology. It is easy to construct cases where both types of firms operate in the monopolistically competitive equilibrium in rE and the efficient firms earn supernormal profits which are bounded away from zero as r → ∞. Thus barriers to entry which are significant in per capita terms are now allowed for. A justification for replicating F along with the consumer sector can be given. In the above example, the efficient firms may owe their superior technology to the fact that they are situated on good land, say, of which there is a scarcity (thus the supernormal profits are just rents on the land). When one replicates the economy, it is natural to replicate the scarce land and hence the number of firms which are situated on it, so as to keep everything constant except for scale. Note finally that it may be possible to generalize the analysis to the case where the set of potential firms in the economy rE is given by rF, where 1F, 2F are exogenously specified sets and rF is not necessarily the r-fold union of some set F. We have not investigated this, however. Proof of Corollary 6′. Suppose not. Then for each h &gt; 0, we can find f ∊ F with . By Lemma 5 (2), rπf &gt; h for all r ≧ some r*. But in rE there are r firms identical to firm f and so each of these firms makes profit in excess of h in the monopolistically competitive equilibrium when r ≧ r*. Hence total per capita profits of all firms exceed h in equilibrium when r ≧ r*. It follows that, letting h → ∞, we can find a subsequence of the economies rE such that total per capita profits tend to infinity along the subsequence. However, applying Corollary 4 and an argument similar to that in (A.30)–(A.32), we see that ʃArp(a)drY1(a) is bounded. Hence so are per capita profits, ʃArp(a)drY1(a) + rY0.

The incentive-insurance problem is defined to consist of two parts: the choice of an information system and the design of a sharing rule based on the information system. A generalized agency model is formulated to analyse this problem. The agency models of Ross (1973a, b), Wilson (1968), Stiglitz (1974), Mirrlees (1976), Harris and Raviv (1979), Holmström (1979) a.o. appear as special cases of the generalized model. The analysis focuses on the value of information in the agency information problem. The set of information systems which are valuable—i.e. improve risk sharing and incentives in a Pareto sense—is characterized. A problem-independent ranking of information systems for the agency information problem is then characterized under the assumption that the agent's preferences are additive in money and actions. The ranking may be viewed as a generalization of Blackwell's ranking of information systems for decision problems, to this particular game. When the agent's risk preferences depend on his choice of action, on the other hand, it is shown that the Blackwell ranking may be invalid.

The less favourable mix of unemployment and rate of change of inflation (which we call stagflation) is explained by a fall in the feasible rate of growth of real wages unmatched by a reduction in the constant term in Phillips curve. To investigate this mechanism, conventional wage and price equations are estimated for 19 countries and then used for simulation. Stagflation has been caused in roughly equal amounts by rising relative import prices and by the fall in the rate of productivity growth. In the basic model the Phillips curve is assumed not to adapt to falls in feasible real wage growth, but in a final section an adaptive wage equation is estimated, which confirms that the process of adaptation is slow."}, {"e:volume": "49", "e:author": ["Martyn Andrews", "Stephen Nickell"], "e:issue": "5", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2297187", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "731-759", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.2307/2297187", "e:year": 1982, "e:title": "Unemployment in the United Kingdom Since the War", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "In this paper, we first present a competitive macroeconomic model of an open economy which is suitable for estimation and contrast this with a non-competitive model. We then derive unemployment equations from the various models and estimate them over annual data from 1948–1979. We draw the following conclusions. (i) The competitive model of the labour market does not fit the facts. (ii) The non-competitive model generates an equation for the constant inflation rate of unemployment which reveals how, at certain times such as the mid 1970s, a combination of factors conspired to raise this level forcing the government into a deflationary stance to prevent inflation rising drastically. (iii) A number of factors have raised the level of unemployment in a secular fashion since the war, in particular the increase in the variation of relative prices, the increase in the benefit to income ratio, the introduction of employment protection legislation and the rise in the intersectoral shifts of the labour force."}, {"e:volume": "49", "e:author": ["Orley Ashenfelter", "David Card"], "e:issue": "5", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2297188", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "761-782", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.2307/2297188", "e:year": 1982, "e:title": "Time Series Representations of Economic Variables and Alternative Models of the Labour Market", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "Accepting the hypothesis that the time-series \"facts\" of the aggregate labour market may be summarized by the linear autoregressive and moving average representations of wages, prices, unemployment, and interest rates implies that a useful theory ought to lead to predictions about these representations.

First, log-linear equations for labour supply and unemployment are estimated using a forecasting model to measure wage and price expectations. Second, a utility function is used to derive and estimate an equation for labour supply as a function of the current real wage and consumption. The influence of expected future real wages and interest rates is captured by the consumption variable.

We find little evidence that timing effects play an important role in labour market dynamics. The evidence suggests that views emphasizing persistence are more accurate, and that previous employment tends to raise the probability of subsequent employment."}, {"e:volume": "49", "e:author": ["Michael Bruno", "Jeffrey Sachs"], "e:issue": "5", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2297191", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "845-859", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.2307/2297191", "e:year": 1982, "e:title": "Energy and Resource Allocation: A Dynamic Model of the \"Dutch Disease\"", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "It is well known that a domestic resource discovery gives rise to wealth effects that cause a squeeze of the tradeable good sector of an open economy.

The model is solved by numerical simulation."}]
