Further, such a choice function will decompose into a product of one-dimensional mechanisms in the sense that each coordinate of the chosen point depends only on the respective coordinate of the voters' ideal points. Each coordinate function will also be non-manipulable and respect unanimity. Such one-dimensional mechanisms are uncompromising in the sense that voters cannot take an extreme position to influence the choice to their advantage. Two characterizations of uncompromising choice functions are presented. One is in terms of a continuity condition, the other in terms of \"phantom voters\" i.e. those points which are chosen which are not any voter's ideal point.

Demand is random one period earlier and independently distributed in both periods and entry corresponds to an irreversible capacity choice, made under certain demand. All other production decisions take place after demand has been revealed. Risk-neutrality is assumed on both sides. If entry occurs then there is a Cournot duopoly in the second period. It is shown that concurrently with this Cournot production game, there is a separate Stackelberg-type game with capacities as decision variables.

It is shown that the optimal pricing policy of a monopolistic firm with non-convex costs of price adjustment is (S, s) in its real-price, i.e. its nominal price relative to the price level. A basic certainty-equivalence result is proved: i.e. the firm behaves as if it faces a certain and fixed rate of inflation, higher than the actual expected rate, the difference between the two rates being a risk premium which depends on the real interest rate and the parameters of the stochastic process. One can thus apply previous results from the case of certainty (Sheshinski and Weiss, The Review of Economic Studies, 1977) to obtain comparative static results.

The analysis focuses on a market for a product that can be produced at different quality levels. All consumers prefer higher to lower quality, but they may differ in their willingness to pay for quality. Producers can produce any quality they like, but higher qualities are more costly to produce. The information in this market is imperfect in the sense that the exact quality chosen by a firm is known only to the firm itself; some information about the quality of a firm's product will, however, reach its potential customers, even if they do not make any special effort to acquire it. Within the framework suggested here, two conclusions are drawn. First, prices may serve as signals which exactly differentiate the available quality levels. That is, there exists a fulfilledexpectations equilibrium at which each price signals a unique quality level. Second, the pricesignals are not arbitrary. Each price-signal exceeds the marginal cost of producing the quality it signals. Such a mark-up depends on the nature of the product-specific information received by consumers—the poorer the information, the higher the mark-up."}, {"e:volume": "50", "e:author": ["Peter B.
