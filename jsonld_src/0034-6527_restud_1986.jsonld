If these efforts lead to fewer quits among better workers, the stream of job changers should be composed disproportionately of less able ones. This will inhibit turnover in two ways. First, firms should be unwilling to hire from the job-changing pool except at low wages.

This test extends previous such work with micro data by simultaneously allowing for intertemporal substitution, uncertainty and endogenous unemployment. Using the standard specification of intertemporal labour supply behaviour, I find strong evidence against this interpretation of unemployment. There are two possible interpretations of the test results. The first is that it is necessary to turn to alternative models of the labour market in which unemployed workers are off a supply function. The second is that the test results indicate the necessity of moving to more complex models of intertemporal substitution.

The last few years have witnessed a substantial growth in the literature on econometric evaluation techniques, but despite important improvements in formalising evaluation procedures and their increased scope, formidable problems confront any investigation of a high dimensional, non-linear, stochastic, dynamic structure. Since system characteristics are the prime concern of economy-wide models, it might be the case that the validity of every individual component is not essential to adequate overall performance. While this viewpoint is debatable it does draw attention to the need for system evaluation procedures, at which point data limitations pose serious constraints on formal tests.
