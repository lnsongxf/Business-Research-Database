This paper examines the concept of transfer sensitivity in detail and proposes a new definition that can be usefully applied in general contexts. The definition is based on the notion of \"favourable composite transfers\" which involve a regressive transfer combined with a simultaneous progressive transfer at a lower income level. The paper proceeds to identify when one distribution can be obtained from another using a sequence of progressive transfers and favourable composite transfers, and hence when all transfer sensitive Pigou-Dalton indices agree on their pairwise inequality ranking. Since agreement occurs in some situations when Pigou-Dalton indices are not unanimous, transfer sensitivity adds power to the \"unambiguous\" inequality judgements based on the Pigou-Dalton condition and, in particular, enables distributions whose Lorenz curves intersect to be conclusively ranked."}, {"e:volume": "54", "e:author": ["Alfred Lorn Norman"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2297572", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "499-517", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.2307/2297572", "e:year": 1987, "e:title": "A Theory of Monetary Exchange", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "The transactions cost for alternative exchange mechanisms for the household exchange problem can be characterized by the computational complexity of the exchange process.

The main findings are that the true sizes of the asymptotic non-nested tests can differ considerably from their nominal sizes, the Lagrange multiplier test's sizes are reasonably accurate and the point optimal test is generally more powerful than the other tests when appropriate critical values are used.
