At the time of trading they each privately know their value s and cost r respectively, but these are not known when the contract is drawn up. The contract specifies a Bayesian revelation mechanism for implementing a trading rule and prices, as functions of their types s and r. An optimal (second-best) contract balances the goal of efficient trading and risk sharing against the need to provide the agents with incentives to reveal their type truthfully. An optimal contract is characterized. First, it is efficient to have some insurance from a third party: even though neither the buyer nor the seller will be fully insured, there is no need for the buyer to be exposed to the seller's risk or vice versa. Second, there will be less than first-best trade (underproduction). Third, once they have privately learnt their type—but before they have played the mechanism—both the buyer and the seller prefer that the final outcome will be trade rather than no trade. Fourth, although the trade prices increase with s and r, the rest of the contract need not be monotonic. This lack of monotonicity means that the standard methodology fails: it is not enough simply to appeal to local incentive compatibility, since global incentive constraints may bind.

The analysis is then confined to portfolios in which the distributions of assets differ by either a first-degree stochastic dominance shift or by a mean-preserving shift. Examples are provided to show that under some conditions a risk averter may invest a smaller proportion of his wealth in the dominating asset than in the dominated asset. The paper then provides conditions that are necessary and sufficient for a risk averter to invest more in the dominating asset."}, {"e:volume": "55", "e:author": ["Geir B.

We analyse this situation first by supposing that the parties can sign a sequence of short-term contracts; and secondly by supposing that they can sign a long-term contract, but cannot commit not to renegotiate it later.

In (ii), we show by two examples that typically there are multiple equilibria if the principal merely offers a set of optimal sharing rules.
