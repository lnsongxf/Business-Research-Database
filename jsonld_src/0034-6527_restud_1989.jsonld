We investigate the role of two fundamental parameters in the existence of an equilibrium: the market size, given by the number n of competitors, and the degree of substitutability. We prove that: (a) For a given number of n ≦ 2 of competitors, a sufficiently large but finite degree of substitutability entails nonexistence. This thus generalizes the Bertrand-Edgeworth nonexistence result, which applies only to perfect substitutes, (b) Conversely for a given upper bound on the degree of substitutability, a sufficiently large number of competitors ensures existence, which thus introduces a significant role for market size in models of imperfect competition.

If it is impossible for the firm and workers to sign long-term binding contracts on wages and employment, then the firm will wish to invest in a capital stock below the efficient level; by organising in separate unions the firm will be induced to raise its level of investment, to ensure it has enough capacity with each union to make a threat to switch production to another union credible.

Such constraints are illustrated by the economic restrictions of homogeneity and symmetry, and the functional form restrictions of additivity and linearity. The proposed tests are based on estimates of regression coefficients, that statistically characterize the departures from the constraint exhibited by the data. The coefficients are based on weighted-average derivatives, that are reformulated in terms of derivatives of the density of x. Coefficient estimators are proposed that use nonparametric kernel estimators of the density and its derivatives. These statistics are shown to be √N consistent and asymptotically normal, and thus are comparable to estimators based on a (correctly specified) parametric model of g(x)."}, {"e:volume": "56", "e:author": ["Murray Frank", "Thanasis Stengos"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2297500", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "553-567", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.2307/2297500", "e:year": 1989, "e:title": "Measuring the Strangeness of Gold and Silver Rates of Return", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "The predictability of rates of return on gold and silver are examined.

In equilibrium, the economy converges from an initial distribution of knowledge over agents to the steady-state distribution, which is unique. Because of the public good aspect of information, too little learning takes place, and ideas are implemented too early. The key difference between earlier formulations of search externalities by Diamond, Mortensen, and Spence on the one hand, and our own on the other, is that here spillovers of knowledge depend not only on how hard people are trying, but also on the differences in what they know: if all of us know the same thing, we cannot learn from each other.

This view is in contrast to the results in the literature on full implementation where it is shown that (under certain conditions) games exist which only have efficient equilibria. The games usually used to demonstrate existence are quite complex and seem \"unnatural\" possibly leading to the perception that implementation requires a central authority to choose and impose the game. In a simple public goods setting, we show that a very natural game—similar to one often used elsewhere in the literature to model private provision—in fact fully implements the core of this economy in undominated perfect equilibria. More specifically, we consider a complete information economy with one private good and two possible social decisions. Agents voluntarily contribute any non-negative amount of the private good they choose and the social decision is to provide the public good iff contributions are sufficient to pay for it. The contributions are refunded otherwise. The set of undominated perfect equilibrium outcomes of this game is exactly the core of the economy. We give some extensions of this result, discuss the role of perfection and alternative equilibrium notions, and discuss the intuition and implications of the results."}, {"e:volume": "56", "e:author": ["Andrew Postlewaite", "David Wettstein"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2297503", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "603-611", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.2307/2297503", "e:year": 1989, "e:title": "Feasible and Continuous Implementation", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "There has been a great deal of research in recent years investigating the question of whether or not there exist institutions (game forms) for which the set of equilibria will coincide with the set of Walrasian equilibria.
