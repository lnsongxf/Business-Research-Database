Omnibus tests based on an unrestricted reduced form and instrumental variables tests based on differencing are consistent with conventional models. Tests based on comparing those who enter and leave union coverage provide evidence against the usual model. We find evidence for interactions between union status and other variables even after controlling for person effects."}, {"e:volume": "58", "e:author": ["Dilip Mookherjee", "Debraj Ray"], "e:issue": "5", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2297948", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "993-1009", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.2307/2297948", "e:year": 1991, "e:title": "Collusive Market Structure Under Learning-By-Doing and Increasing Returns", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "Learning-by-doing and increasing returns are often perceived to have similar implications for market structure and conduct. We analyse this in the context of an infinite-horizon price-setting game. Learning is shown to not reduce the viability of market-sharing collusion between a given number of firms, whereas intra-period increasing returns invariably does. We subsequently develop a model where the number of active firms is determined endogenously, under the assumption that the post-entry game is collusive. In this model, learning has no effect on concentration, while scale economies increase concentration."}, {"e:volume": "58", "e:author": ["James Peck", "Karl Shell"], "e:issue": "5", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2297949", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1011-1029", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.2307/2297949", "e:year": 1991, "e:title": "Market Uncertainty: Correlated and Sunspot Equilibria in Imperfectly Competitive Economies", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "An imperfectly competitive economy is very prone to market uncertainty, including uncertainty about the liquidity (or \"thickness\") of markets. We show, in particular, that there exist stochastic equilibrium outcomes in nonstochastic market games if (and only if) the endowments are not Pareto optimal. We also provide a link between extrinsic uncertainty arising in games (e.g. correlated equilibria) and extrinsic uncertainty in market economies (e.g. sunspot equilibria). A correlated equilibria to the market game is either a sunspot equilibrium or a non-sunspot equilibrium to the related securities games, but the converse is not true in general."}, {"e:volume": "58", "e:author": ["Tai-Yeong Chung"], "e:issue": "5", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2297950", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1031-1042", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.2307/2297950", "e:year": 1991, "e:title": "Incomplete Contracts, Specific Investments, and Risk Sharing", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "An optimal contract design problem is considered. Contracts which are incomplete and simple are used to investigate the extent to which constrained revisions can mitigate inefficiencies resulting from contractual incompleteness. An optimal contract is characterized in two cases. First, when a contract is being used to facilitate trade between two risk-neutral parties who must make relationship-specific investments, it is possible to implement the first-best by a simple contract. Second, when a contract is being used to share risk, it is generally not possible to implement the first-best. When one party is risk neutral, however, it is possible to implement the first-best by assigning all the ex post decision rights to that party."}]
