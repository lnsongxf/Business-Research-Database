A member's current incentives are affected by his past behaviour and, because his track record is observed only with noise, by the group's past behaviour as well. The paper thus studies the joint dynamics of individual and collective reputations and derives the existence of stereotypes from history dependence rather than from a multiplicity of equilibria or from the existence of a common trait as is usually done in the literature. It shows that new members of an organization may suffer from an original sin of their elders long after the latter are gone, and it derives necessary and sufficient conditions under which group reputations can be rebuilt.

Trade occurs as a result of equilibrium actions in a Bayesian game, where uncertainty is captured by a finite state space and information is represented by partitions on this space. In the benchmark case of trade with common knowledge of endowments, the two mechanisms deliver virtually identical outcomes. However, with differential information, the dealership market has strictly higher trading volume, and yields an efficient post-trade allocation in most states. In contrast, the decentralized market suffers from suboptimal trading volume. The reason for this poor performance is the vulnerability of the decentralized market to higher-order uncertainty concerning the fundamentals of the market. Traders may know that mutually beneficial trade is feasible, and perhaps know that they know, and yet a failure of common knowledge that this is so precludes efficient trade.

The requirement of ex post participation constraints for the firm limits the set of subsidies which can be offered to the firm.

According to the standard representative agent paradigm, a small open economy should smooth consumption by borrowing from (lending to) the rest of the world when its income increases (declines) over time. The simple model of this paper delivers exactly the same predictions in the absence of income dispersion. When income distribution is not degenerate, however, the same model gives rise to a surprising wealth of results. In particular, poor economies with high inequality may exhibit completely counter-intuitive patterns of fiscal policy and external borrowing. The country's production path declines over time, because the more mobile agents leave the country to escape taxation; yet, the country might end up having a budget deficit and borrowing from abroad, thereby reinforcing rather than smoothing the asymmetry in consumption between the two periods. An important feature of this outcome is that it is backed by both the poor and the rich, who gain from the fiscal system at the expense of the middle class."}, {"e:volume": "63", "e:author": ["Pierre Perron", "Serena Ng"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2297890", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "435-463", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.2307/2297890", "e:year": 1996, "e:title": "Useful Modifications to some Unit Root Tests with Dependent Errors and their Local Asymptotic Properties", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "Many unit root tests have distorted sizes when the root of the error process is close to the unit circle.

We study a one-sector growth model where investment can be subsidized at either a positive rate or not subsidized at all. We find that the lack of persistence in policies per se need not be welfare reducing and that it is likely to decrease growth. Higher variability implies more frequent changes in consumption and investment. But, by creating a stronger intertemporal link across regimes, variability reduces the fluctuation in investment rates, thus decreasing the magnitude of changes in consumption and increasing welfare."}, {"e:volume": "63", "e:author": ["Shouyong Shi"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2297797", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "627-652", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.2307/2297797", "e:year": 1996, "e:title": "Credit and Money in a Search Model with Divisible Commodities", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "This paper examines the competition between money and credit in a search model with divisible commodities. It is shown that fiat money can be valuable even though it yields a lower rate of return than the coexisting credit. The competition between money and credit increases efficiency. The monetary equilibrium with credit Pareto dominates the monetary equilibrium without credit whenever the two coexist. When a credit is repaid with money, the competition also bounds the purchasing power of money from below by that of credit and so eliminates the weak inefficient monetary equilibrium found in previous search models. With numerical examples, three different monetary equilibria are ranked and the properties of the interest rate are examined."}, {"e:volume": "63", "e:author": ["Byoung Jun", "Xavier Vives"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2297798", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "653-674", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.2307/2297798", "e:year": 1996, "e:title": "Learning and Convergence to a Full-Information Equilibrium are not Equivalent", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "Convergence to a full-information equilibrium (FIE) in the presence of persistent shocks and asymmetric information about an unknown payoff-relevant parameter θ is established in a classical infinite-horizon partial equilibrium linear model. It is found that, under the usual stability assumptions on the autoregressive process of shocks, convergence occurs at the rate n−1/2, where n is the number of rounds of trade, and that the asymptotic variance of the discrepancy of the full-information price and the market price is independent of the degree of autocorrelation of the shocks. This is so even though the speed of learning θ from prices becomes arbitrarily slow as autocorrelation approaches a unit root level. It follows then that learning the unknown parameter θ and convergence of the equilibrium process to the FIE are not equivalent. Moreover, allowing for non-stationary processes of shocks, the distinction takes a more stark form. Learning θ is neither necessary nor sufficient for convergence to the FIE. When the process of shocks has a unit root, convergence to the FIE occurs but θ can not be learned. When the process is sufficiently explosive and there is a positive mass of perfectly informed agents, θ is learned quickly but convergence to the FIE does not occur."}]
