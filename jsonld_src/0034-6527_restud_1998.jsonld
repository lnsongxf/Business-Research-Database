However, bureaucracy makes mistakes by rejecting promising projects and delays innovation, and the efficiency loss due to soft financial constraints increases as prior knowledge becomes worse and as research stage investment requirements become lower.

For both perfect Bayesian equilibrium and a rationalizability-style notion, I characterize the set of expected payoffs which may arise in the game. I also construct bounds on agreements that may be made. The set of expected payoffs is easy to compute and incorporate into applied models. My main result is a full characterization of the set of perfect Bayesian equilibrium payoffs for games in which the distribution over the players' discount rates is of wide support, yet is in a weak sense close to a point mass distribution. I prove a lopsided convergence result: each player cannot gain from a slight chance that she is a strong type, but the player can suffer greatly if there is a slight chance that she is a weak type."}, {"e:volume": "65", "e:author": ["Venkatesh Bala", "Sanjeev Goyal"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/1467-937X.00059", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "595-621", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.1111/1467-937X.00059", "e:year": 1998, "e:title": "Learning from Neighbours", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "When payoffs from different actions are unknown, agents use their own past experience as well as the experience of their neighbours to guide their decision making.

We show that, in a connected society, local learning ensures that all agents obtain the same payoffs in the long run. Thus, if actions have different payoffs, then all agents choose the same action, and social conformism obtains. We develop conditions on the distribution of prior beliefs, the structure of neighbourhoods and the informativeness of actions under which this action is optimal. In particular, we identify a property of neighbourhood structures—local independence—which greatly facilitates social learning.

There is a modern sector, where productivity is high but information asymmetries are large, and a traditional sector where productivity is low but information asymmetries are small. Consequently, agency costs in the modern sector make consumption lending difficult, while such lending is readily done in the traditional sector. The resulting trade-off between credit availability and productivity implies that not everyone will move to the modern sector. In fact, the laissez-faire level of modernization may fail to maximize net social surplus. This situation may also hold in the long run: in a dynamic version of the model, a \"trickle-down\" effect links the process of modernization with reduction in modern sector agency costs. This effect may be too weak and the economy may get stuck in a trap and never fully modernize. The two-sector structure also yields a natural theoretical testing ground for the Kuznets inverted-U hypothesis: we show that even within the \"sectoral shifting\" class of models, this phenomenon is not robust to small changes in model specification."}, {"e:volume": "65", "e:author": ["Jay Pil Choi"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/1467-937X.00063", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "655-669", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.1111/1467-937X.00063", "e:year": 1998, "e:title": "Brand Extension as Informational Leverage", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "The marketing literature refers to the concept of brand capital and provides empirical evidence that firms with a large stock of well-established brands have an advantage in introducing new products.

The paper first characterizes the optimal trading strategy of the agent which constitute the unique equilibrium. Further properties of the price sequence are obtained using the concepts of informational cascade and informational avalanche. The results are applied to the explanation of market crashes. In particular, the dynamics of market crashes are illustrated as evolving through the following four phases: (1) boom; (2) euphoria; (3) trigger; and (4) panic; where the euphoria corresponds to the informational cascade and the panic corresponds to the informational avalanche."}, {"e:volume": "65", "e:author": ["Robin P.

In general, this preference relation need not satisfy either independence or transitivity; we state conditions on imitation necessary for it to do so. For decisions over three or more options, the long-run tendency is for options that are maximally preferred in terms of SSB preferences to be chosen.

Surprisingly, there does not exist a labour contract based model that is consistent with predictions (a) and (b). In fact, the standard results in the literature are if leisure is a normal good then there will be too much employment in essentially all states of the world and the welfare of the worker declines as the state of the world improves. In this paper a labour contracting model is constructed that is consistent with the above mentioned predictions. Two necessary ingredients in the model are the possibility of financial distress in low demand states and \"partial provability\" in contracting. Financial distress can be viewed as frustrating renegotiation and, thus, inefficient outcomes are possible in equilibrium. Partial provability—the ability of an informed player to make verifiable claims or statements to an uninformed player—eliminates certain kinds of inefficient outcomes. In particular, it eliminates the possibility that, in equilibrium, there is too much employment. This last result is interesting in itself because it is commonly believed that normality of leisure necessarily implies that labour contracting models will generate employment levels that are too high from an efficiency perspective."}, {"e:volume": "65", "e:author": ["Ethan Ligon"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/1467-937X.00071", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "847-864", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.1111/1467-937X.00071", "e:year": 1998, "e:title": "Risk Sharing and Information in Village Economies", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "Arrangements for achieving efficient risk-sharing vary depending on the information available to agents in the economy. The usual Euler equation restricts efficient allocations in an economy which obeys the permanent income hypothesis, while efficient allocations in an economy with private information and long-term contracts satisfy a symmetric restriction, but not the Euler equation. Full insurance arrangements are unique in that they satisfy both restrictions. We look at an environment in which it seems likely that long-term contracts play a role in mitigating the effects of private information: three village economies in South India. The evidence that consumption allocations satisfy the private information restriction is quite strong for households in two of the three villages; the evidence for the third village suggests that while consumption for some households satisfies the private information restrictions, other households' consumption obey the permanent income hypothesis."}]
