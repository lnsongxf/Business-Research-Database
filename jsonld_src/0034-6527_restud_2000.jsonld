The minimal sufficient networks for coordination can be interpreted as placing people into a hierarchy of social roles or \"stages\": \"initial adopters\", then \"followers\", and so on down to \"late adopters\". A communication network helps coordination in exactly two ways: by informing each stage about earlier stages, and by creating common knowledge within each stage. We then consider two examples: first we show that \"low dimensional\" networks can be better for coordination even though they have far fewer links than \"high dimensional\" networks; second we show that wide dispersion of \"insurgents\", people predisposed toward participation, can be good for coordination but too much dispersion can be bad."}, {"e:volume": "67", "e:author": ["Glenn Ellison"], "e:issue": "1", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/1467-937X.00119", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "17-45", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.1111/1467-937X.00119", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Basins of Attraction, Long-Run Stochastic Stability, and the Speed of Step-by-Step Evolution", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "The paper examines the behaviour of \"evolutionary\" models with ɛ-noise like those which have been used recently to discuss the evolution of social conventions. The paper is built around two main observations: that the \"long run stochastic stability\" of a convention is related to the speed with which evolution toward and away from the convention occurs, and that evolution is more rapid (and hence more powerful) when it may proceed via a series of small steps between intermediate steady states. The formal analysis uses two new measures, the radius and modified coradius, to characterize the long run stochastically stable set of an evolutionary model and to bound the speed with which evolutionary change occurs. Though not universally powerful, the result can be used to make many previous analyses more transparent and extends them by providing results on waiting times. A number of applications are also discussed. The selection of the risk dominant equilibrium in 2 × 2 games is generalized to the selection of ½-dominant equilibria in arbitrary games.

The model produces new economic insights beyond the well-known bilateral model of Krugman (1991), which is obtained as a special case. The paper also introduces a new class of stochastic processes in economics, namely multidimensional reflected diffusion processes. Two main features characterize the economics of exchange rates in a multilateral target zone. (i) The restrictions on interventions imposed by cross-currency constraints: when one country changes its money supply, say because its exchange rate with a second country has hit its band, all exchange rates involving the currency of that particular country will be affected, regardless of their position within their respective bands, (ii) Cooperation in sharing the intervention burden: in general, the exchange rate between any two countries will depend on the fundamentals of third countries in a multilateral target zone. This is because if the monetary authorities intervene together, a shock in the fundamentals of any country will induce a revision of the expectation of future interventions of other countries. The model reverts the counterfactual predictions of the bilateral model that the exchange rate steady-state density should be U-shaped and that its volatility should be a decreasing function of the distance of the exchange rate to the limits of its band.

Second, we demonstrate that optimal auctions are qualitatively distinct from monopoly sales of multiple products. Because of uncertainty about the values of other consumers, two products are bundled probabilistically in an optimal auction for a customer who is willing to buy both of them.

We show that when the agent cannot commit to future consumption and learning decisions, incomplete learning may occur on a Markov perfect equilibrium path of the resulting intra-personal game. In such a case, each agent's incarnation stops learning for some values of the posterior distribution of beliefs and acts under self-restricted information. This conduct is interpreted as strategic ignorance. All equilibria featuring this property strictly Pareto dominate the complete learning equilibrium for any posterior distribution of beliefs."}, {"e:volume": "67", "e:author": ["John Laitner"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/1467-937X.00143", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "545-561", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.1111/1467-937X.00143", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Structural Change and Economic Growth", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "This paper presents a model in which a country's measured average propensity to save endogenously rises when its economy industrializes. The model has agricultural and manufacturing sectors. Only agriculture uses land. If at early dates income per capita is low, agricultural consumption is important, land is valuable, and capital gains on land may constitute most wealth accumulation, leaving the country's NIPA APS low. If exogenous technological progress raises incomes over time, Engel's law shifts demand to manufactured goods. Then land's portfolio importance relative to reproducible capital diminishes and the national income and products account saving rate can rise."}, {"e:volume": "67", "e:author": ["José M.

We analyse a simple security design model in which the number and payoff of securities are endogenous. Agents have rational expectations and differ in information, endowments, and attitudes toward risk. When markets are incomplete, equilibrium prices are typically partially revealing, while full relevation is attained with complete markets. The optimality of complete or incomplete markets depends on whether the adverse selection effect (the unwillingness of agents to trade risks when they are informationally disadvantaged) is stronger or weaker than the Hirshleifer effect (the impossibility of trading risks that have already been resolved), as new securities are issued and prices reveal more information. When the Hirshleifer effect dominates, an incomplete set of securities is preferred by all agents, and generates a higher volume of trade."}, {"e:volume": "67", "e:author": ["Mark Armstrong", "Orazio Attanasio", "James Dow", "Michael Woodford"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/1467-937X.00145", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "581", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.1111/1467-937X.00145", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Symposium on Optimal Monetary Policy", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:volume": "67", "e:author": ["Mark Armstrong", "Orazio Attanasio", "James Dow"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/restud/67.4.i", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "i", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.1111/restud/67.4.i", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Editorial Announcement", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:volume": "67", "e:author": ["Daron Acemoglu", "Robert Shimer"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/1467-937X.00146", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "585-607", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.1111/1467-937X.00146", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Wage and Technology Dispersion", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "This paper explains why firms with identical opportunities may use different technologies and offer different wages. Our key assumption is that workers must engage in costly search in order to gather information about jobs (Stigler (1961)). In equilibrium, some firms adopt high fixed cost, high productivity technologies, offer high wages, and fill job openings quickly. Other firms adopt less capital-intensive technologies and offer low wages, hiring mostly uninformed workers. In equilibrium, the amount of wage dispersion leaves workers indifferent about whether to gather information, and the fraction of informed workers leaves firms indifferent about their wage and technology choice. We show that worker search, which would appear to be a rent-seeking activity in partial equilibrium, may be efficiency-enhancing in general equilibrium."}, {"e:volume": "67", "e:author": ["Stephen G.

We show that a large part of the changes in the U.K. can be summarized quite simply as increases in eduction differentials and a decline of growth of entry level wages which persist subsequently. This fact we interpret as cohort effects. We also show that, like in the U.S., an important aspect of rising wage inequality is increased within-group wage dispersion.

As in the case of risk neutrality, the agency costs of external funds provided to an intermediary are relatively small if the intermediary is financing many entrepreneurs with independent returns. Even though the intermediary is adding rather than subdividing risks, the underlying large-numbers argument is not invalidated by the presence of risk aversion. With risk aversion of entrepreneurs as well as the intermediary, financial intermediation provides insurance as well as finance. In contrast to earlier results on optimal intermediation policies under risk neutrality, the paper shows that when an intermediary is financing many entrepreneurs with independent returns, optimal intermediation policies must shift return risks away from risk averse entrepreneurs and impose them on the intermediary or on final investors."}, {"e:volume": "67", "e:author": ["Kiminori Matsuyama"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/1467-937X.00152", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "743-759", "e:issn": "0034-6527", "e:doi": "10.1111/1467-937X.00152", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Endogenous Inequality", "e:journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "e:abstract": "Does the market economy exacerbate inequality across households?

The model focuses on the role of the credit market, which determines the joint evolution of the distribution of wealth and the interest rate. A complete characterization of the steady states is provided. Under some configurations of the parameter values, the model predicts an endogenous and permanent separation of the population into the rich and the poor, where the rich maintains a high level of wealth partially due to the presence of the poor.

We conduct a laboratory investigation of a model that predicts risk-neutral expected utility maximizers will participate in lotteries when they recognize that lotteries are being used to finance public goods. As predicted by the model, we find that public goods provision is higher when financed by lottery proceeds than when financed by voluntary contributions. We also find support for other comparative static predictions of the model. In particular we find that ticket purchases vary with the size of the fixed prize and with the return from the public good: lotteries with large prizes are more effective, and ticket purchases drop dramatically when the public good is not valued by subjects."}]
