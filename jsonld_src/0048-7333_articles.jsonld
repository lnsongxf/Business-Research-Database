Studies based on data generated by offices of technology transfer, suggest a paucity of entrepreneurial activity from university scientists in the form on new startups. There are, however, compelling reasons to suspect that the TTO generated data may not measure all, or even most of scientist entrepreneurship. Rather than relying on measures of scientist entrepreneurship reported by the TTO and compiled by AUTM, this study instead develops alternative measures based on the commercialization activities reported by scientists. In particular, the purpose of this paper is to provide a measure of scientist entrepreneurship and identify which factors are conducive to scientist entrepreneurship and which factors inhibit scientist entrepreneurship. This enables us to compare how scientist entrepreneurship differs from that which has been established in the literature for the more general population. We do this by developing a new database measuring the propensity of scientists funded by grants from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to commercialize their research as well as the mode of commercialization. We then subject this new university scientist-based data set to empirical scrutiny to ascertain which factors influence both the propensity for scientists to become an entrepreneur.

Understanding the effects of changes in IPR regulations on academic patenting is a complex issue, and parallels with the US case can be misleading. First, despite the general trend towards institutional ownership, university IPR regulations in Europe remain extremely differentiated and there is no one-to-one mapping to the US system. Second, it is difficult to disentangle the quantitative and qualitative effects of changes in IPR ownership regulations on academic patenting activities from the effects of concurrent transformations in the institutional, cultural and organizational landscape surrounding academic knowledge transfer. The article proposes a review and typological classification of national university IPR ownership systems on the basis of their development since 2000, and uses it to analyze the aggregate dynamics of academic patent ownership in several European countries. The analysis of patterns of ownership of academic patents shows that there has been a general increase in university patenting since 1990, with a significant slowdown (and even reduction in some countries) after early 2000s accompanied by a switch in academic patents ownership in favor of university ownership though preserving the European specificity of high company ownership of academic invented patents."}, {"e:volume": "40", "e:author": ["Jerry G.

We find suggestive evidence that inventor ownership universities can be more efficient in generating spin-offs on both per faculty and per R&D dollar expended perspective.

In this paper we focus on an important but neglected aspect of knowledge transfer from academic research involving the indirect flow to entrepreneurship by individuals with a university education background who become involved in new venture creation by means of corporate spinoffs (CSO) after gaining industrial experience, rather than leaving university employment to found a new venture as an academic spinoff. We argue that the commercial knowledge gained by industry experience is potentially more valuable for entrepreneurial performance compared to the academic knowledge gained by additional research experience at a university. This leads us to posit that the average performance of CSOs will be higher than comparable USOs, but the gains from founder's prior experiences will be relatively higher among USOs whose founders lack the corporate context. We investigate these propositions in a comparative study tracking the complete population of USOs and CSOs among the Swedish knowledge-intensive sectors between 1994 and 2002."}, {"e:author": ["Ben R.

Most authors have focused on linkages among academic researchers, measuring productivity by the number of papers published in ISI journals. In contrast, the impact of interactions between academic researchers and the business sector on research productivity has been less analyzed. The aim of this paper is to analyze how broadly defined research productivity (papers, new recommendations and new techniques) in agriculture-related fields is affected by the nature of academy-farmers interactions. This latter was approached through two dimensions: the breadth of linkages and their intensity, measured by the duration, in two different modalities (R&D activities and consultancy). Based on original micro data obtained through a survey of researchers working in universities and PRCs in agriculture-related fields, we built three models, one per output, to identify the effect of the nature of interactions on research productivity. The models were estimated with a negative binomial distribution using Maximum Likelihood estimators. We found a positive relationship between interaction with farmers and publishing of papers when interactions are carried out through the R&D modality. We also found that the impact of the nature of interactions on research productivity differs according to the type of research output. The impact is broader in the case of new recommendations than in the other outputs. The production of new recommendations is positively influenced by both the breadth of linkages and their duration through both modalities of interaction (R&D and consultancy)."}, {"e:volume": "40", "e:author": ["Theodore A.

Using a sample of 11,593 patents produced by 256 biotechnology firms from 1985 to 2006, we find that prior joint invention experience diversifies the capabilities of the firm and broadens its strategic options. In uncovering an inverted 'U' relationship, we also find that capabilities evolve differently according to the firm's unique joint invention experiences. Moreover, firms that continue to engage in more joint invention experiences develop broader capabilities than firms that retreat from this strategy and pursue solo inventions, whereby more specialized capabilities develop.

From research that has been conducted for the purpose of finding such an indicator to show the value of individual patents (that is, research to identify the characteristics of valuable patents), many kinds of value indicators have been proposed. Nevertheless, research hitherto has focused primarily on business or private value derived from the possession of patents, and little attention has been paid to value in terms of technical knowledge or social value. In a survey of inventors conducted by RIETI in 2007, terminology describing broad concepts was used when questioning inventors about the value of individual patents, and this has provided an excellent opportunity to analyze the multiple factors lying behind the value of patents and how they impact one another. The purpose of this research is to use data from the RIETI survey of inventors and structural equation modeling methods to elucidate the relationships between the technological and business value of patents, and the latent factors that influence them. The findings show that a scientific-technological motive for inventors would have a positive effect on both the business and technological value, meanwhile, the monetary or promotion motive would not have any direct effects on the value of a patent. The model also suggests that academic linkage would have a strong positive effect on the technological value but a weak negative effect on the business value.

For this purpose we consider a 10-year longitudinal data set for 538 Italian NTBFs, most of which are privately held. The sample includes both VC-backed and non-VC-backed firms. We estimate Gibrat-law-type dynamic panel-data models augmented with time-varying variables that capture the VC status of firms. To control for the endogeneity of VC investments we use several GMM estimators. The econometric results strongly support the view that VC investments positively influence firm growth. The treatment effect of VC investments is of large economic magnitude, especially on growth of employment. Most of it is obtained immediately after the first round of VC finance. Conversely, the selection effect of VC appears to be negligible in the Italian context."}, {"e:volume": "40", "e:author": ["Jakob Edler", "Heide Fier", "Christoph Grimpe"], "e:issue": "6", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311000382", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "791-805", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311000382", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "International scientist mobility and the locus of knowledge and technology transfer", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "Despite the growing interest of scholars and policymakers to better understand the determinants for researchers in public science to transfer knowledge and technology to firms, little is known how temporary international mobility of scientists affects both their propensity to engage in knowledge and technology transfer (KTT) as well as the locus of such transfer.

In this paper, we conduct the first quantitative exploration of the importance of services innovation by users, focusing on the field of commercial and retail banking services. We find that 55% of today's computerized commercial banking services were first developed and implemented by non-bank firms for their own use, and 44% of today's computerized retail banking services were first developed and implemented by individual service users rather than by commercial financial service providers. Manual precursors to these services - manual procedures that carried out functions similar to computerized services in our sample - were almost always developed by users as self-services. Our empirical findings differ significantly from prevalent producer-centered views of service development. We speculate that the patterns we have observed in banking with respect to the major role of users in service development will prove to be quite general. If so, this will be an important matter: on the order of 75% of GDP in advanced economies today is derived from services.

This paper examines whether this pattern is consistent over time and, more importantly, which sectors drive the aggregate patterns. Based on an investigation of the entire Swedish economy 1985-2001, there is clear evidence that the paradox occurs only in fast-growing manufacturing and service sectors. Fast-growing sectors show an increasing gap between R&D and value-added growth, while the slow-growing sectors do not. This paradox is not interpreted as a sign of failure of the national innovation system, as the largest gap would then be for the slow-growing sectors, failing to transform R&D to economic growth. The gap between R&D and GDP is consistent with the idea of diminishing marginal returns to R&D investment in high-investing sectors. The evidence does not rule out, however, that rendering the innovation system more effective could yield better outcomes. As the findings of a gap are quite consistent over time, it seems fair to conclude that businesses have good reasons for their high R&D investments, despite not being on par with their production growth."}, {"e:volume": "40", "e:author": ["Philip Kappen"], "e:issue": "5", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004873331100031X", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "673-686", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004873331100031X", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Competence-creating overlaps and subsidiary technological evolution in the multinational corporation", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This paper explores overlapping competence-creating activities within the boundaries of the multinational corporation by investigating how foreign greenfield subsidiaries' technological evolution is affected by the addition of an acquired unit in the same location.

Furthermore, both literatures propose firm level arguments but test them on the basis of macro- rather than micro-level indicators.

And, if so, do RPI, IPI, and PI firms need to employ scientists in combination with a workforce having the respective qualifications, or is it sufficient if scientists or employees alone are adequately qualified. Quantitative analyses indicate that a particular mix of scientific knowledge combined with employee skills facilitate RPI, IPI, and PI strategies.

Using the experiences of CSOs in Indonesia, as a latecomer economy, these concerns are explored through the analysis of two related empirical issues: (i) the links between innovation and organisational performance and (ii) the construction of innovation diffusion and impacts in organisations that define those links."}, {"e:volume": "40", "e:author": ["Chris Hendry", "Paul Harborne"], "e:issue": "5", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311000369", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "778-789", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311000369", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Changing the view of wind power development: More than \"bricolage\"", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "Understanding innovation depends at root on good qualitative descriptions.

More specifically, we argue here that in cases of therapeutic innovation where a new medical technology is involved the advance in medical practice is driven largely by the ability to develop and use effective medical artifacts and the interactive sequence among these interdependent pathways often starts with what is learned in practice and not in science. While we state this argument in general, we develop it in detail in a longitudinal and contextual case study of the emergence and evolution of a treatment for advanced heart failure based on an implantable device, the Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD). Our findings show that an essential aspect of the evolution of the LVAD therapy is collective and cumulative learning that requires experience that only can be gained through the actual use of LVADs.

We hypothesise that the relationship between faculty quality and industry engagement differs across disciplines, depending on complementarities between industrial and academic work, and resource requirements. Using a dataset covering all UK universities, we find that in technology-oriented disciplines, departmental faculty quality is positively related to industry involvement. In the medical and biological sciences we find a positive effect of departmental faculty quality but establish that this does not apply to star scientists. In the social sciences, we find some support for a negative relationship between faculty quality and particularly the more applied forms of industry involvement.

More precisely, I demonstrate that, in the presence of strong ties, weak network architectures (structural holes or a peripheral network position) leverage the strength of strong ties in the creation of innovation. This implies that weak network architectures have no value without strong ties, whereas strong ties have some value without weak network architectures but are leveraged by this type of structure. The findings indicate that innovation research tends to overestimate the impact of weak network architectures in the creation of innovation.

The paper builds on the literature of the sociology of science as well as the work of Spence (1974) and Podolny (1993) and argues that the presence of a Nobel laureate affiliated with a firm making an IPO provides a signal of firm quality to potential investors. Moreover, and building on the work of Podolny and Scott Morton (1999) and Stuart et al. (1999) we hypothesize that the importance of status diminishes as other measures of firm quality become available. We test our hypothesis for two periods of initial public offerings in biotechnology. We document that there is a clear difference in \"maturity\" of the firms across the two windows on a number of metrics. Consistent with our hypothesis that Nobel laureates play an important role as a non-financial signal of firm quality, we find that first-window firms with a Nobel laureate affiliate realize greater IPO proceeds in the amount of $24 million. In the second window the amount of money raised is not significantly different between Nobel and non-Nobel firms. This finding is consistent with the signaling literature that argues that the importance of a signal is inversely related to the availability of cogent information on firm quality. Consistent with this view, we also find a change between the two windows in the importance of other non-financial metrics used to convey value. Our research is one of the first to examine the dynamic nature of signals. Because we are unable to distinguish the extent to which the reduction in uncertainty at the firm level is correlated with the reduction of uncertainty at the industry level, the question remains as to the extent to which the diminished importance of signals in our second period is due to a change in market uncertainty versus a change in firm uncertainty."}, {"e:volume": "40", "e:author": ["Henny A.

We trace how isolated Jatropha biofuel experiments developed since early 2005 towards a sectoral production and innovation system, and we investigate to what extent that system has been capable of developing and maintaining sustainable practices and producing sustainable outcomes. The application of evolutionary innovation theory allows us to view the developments in the sector as a result of evolutionary variation and selection on the one hand, and revolutionary contestation between different coalitions of stakeholders on the other. Both these processes constitute significant engines of change. While variation and selection are driven predominantly by localised technical and agronomic learning, the conflict-driven dynamics are highly globalised and occur primarily as a result of reflexive learning about problematic sustainability impacts. The sector is found to have moved some way towards a full sectoral innovation and production system, but it is impossible to predict whether a viable sector with a strong \"triple bottom line\" orientation will ultimate emerge, since many issues surrounding the social, environmental and financial sustainability still remain unresolved, especially relating to local and global governance."}, {"e:volume": "40", "e:author": ["Anneloes Roelofsen", "Wouter P.C.

Secondly, we contribute to understanding of how firms in transition economies build 'indigenous' capabilities for innovation by drawing attention to the interplay of foreign and domestic control of agents' innovation."}, {"e:volume": "40", "e:author": ["Igor Filatotchev", "Xiaohui Liu", "Jiangyong Lu", "Mike Wright"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(11)00012-6", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "453-462", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(11)00012-6", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Knowledge spillovers through human mobility across national borders: Evidence from Zhongguancun Science Park in China", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of returnee entrepreneurs and their knowledge spillovers on innovation in high-tech firms in China.

This data is merged with a linked employer-employee dataset that allow us to identify the employee composition of each firm.

Furthermore, we find a negative effect of age diversity and no significant effect of ethnicity on the firm's likelihood to innovate.

Our central research question is: How, when and why is normative contestation of existing regimes effective in influencing the orientation of transitions in the making? The conceptual framework enriches innovation studies and the multi-level perspective with insights from social movement theory (SMT) and political science. SMT is used to analyze the build up of normative pressure (through framing, resource mobilization, and political opportunity structures). From political science we use the notion of multiple streams, in our analysis a problem, regulatory, market and technology stream. The research design consists of a comparative case study of pig husbandry systems. One case analyses the sub-sector of pregnant sows where normative pressures, after several decades, led to the changes advocated by the contestants. The second case concerns the sub-sector of pig fattening where normative pressure was less successful. The difference is partly explained by the normative pressure for pregnant sows being larger than for fattening pigs. The other part of the explanation is that in the first case normative pressure aligned better with the three other streams (regulatory, market and technology) to lead to the changes desired by the contestants."}, {"e:volume": "40", "e:author": ["Mumin Dayan", "C.

We then derive hypotheses regarding team intuition, stress, environmental turbulence, and new product creativity, and test the hypotheses using data from a sample of 155 firms operating in Ankara and Istanbul, Turkey. We specifically test whether an inverted-U relationship exists between team intuition and new product creativity (that is, a balance of both intuitive and rational judgments is preferred), and whether this relationship is moderated by team experience and stress. Moreover, direct impact of turbulent conditions (i.e. market and technical turbulence) on intuition was also examined. The results of our empirical study with a sample of 310 new product/project developers and 155 project managers showed a positive and linear relation between turbulent conditions (both market and technical) and team intuition and an inverted U-shaped team intuition-new product creativity relation for teams with high experience and low stress.

Similarly, geographic proximate interaction is more likely to successfully contribute to R&D projects with short time to market.

This investigation relied on data regarding 1554 researchers funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. Contrary to prior studies which have examined complementarities and the determinants of knowledge transfer activities in separate models, this study relied on a multivariate path model to reflect the fact that in practice, academics consider simultaneously whether or not to undertake multiple knowledge transfer activities. Overall, the results point to the existence of three very different types of knowledge transfer portfolios of activities: a first portfolio made up of complementary activities which are interdependent and reinforce each other. This portfolio includes publications, patenting, spin-off creation, consulting and informal knowledge transfer. A second portfolio includes teaching activities and publication outputs which are substitute for each other. A third portfolio comprises teaching activities and other activities independent from teaching, namely, patenting, spin-off creation, consulting and informal knowledge transfer. Each of these three portfolios of knowledge transfer activities emerged under different conditions.

In this paper, by distinguishing subsidiaries according to their orientation to carry out creative vs. exploitation activities in the host economy, we are able to distinguish situations with positive and negative spillover effects, and we explain why they may be emerging.

Recently, these models have been compounded in the private-collective innovation model where innovators privately fund public goods innovations. Private-collective innovation is illustrated in the case of open source software development. This paper contributes to the work on this model by investigating incentives that motivate innovators to share their knowledge in an initial situation, before there is a community to support the innovation process. We use game theory to predict knowledge sharing behavior in private-collective innovation, and test these predictions in a laboratory setting. The results show that knowledge sharing is a coordination game with multiple equilibria, reflecting the fragility of knowledge sharing between innovators with conflicting interests. The experimental results demonstrate important asymmetries in the fragility of knowledge sharing and, in some situations, more knowledge sharing than theoretically predicted. A behavioral analysis suggests that knowledge sharing in private-collective innovation is not only affected by material incentives, but also by social preferences such as fairness.

Our findings support the relevance of considering a corporate governance view for explaining innovation outcomes. Empirically, we can show that TMT diversity has a strong impact on the strategic choice of firms to focus on innovation fields.

Second, it presents an empirical analysis that contributes to a differentiation of the concept of path dependence, distinguishing between innovative path dependence and technological path dependence. Third, the paper analyses the timing of constraints and path dependence. In the cases studied the innovation approach frames the innovation problem and constraints in relation to technologies have an impact on the innovation processes later, after new technologies have been thoroughly researched. The paper illustrates how the case firm is cognitively locked into an innovation path focused on generating ever-new product versions on different technological platforms, regardless of cannibalisation among the firm's different product versions. Despite the cognitive lock-in to an innovation path the firm is unconstrained in its choice of technological platforms and paths.

In the spirit of Schumpeter, we look at competition in this sector as depending upon this form of innovation, and we argue that, given the specific features of the industry, the development of new tariff plans is strongly related to the users' characteristics and behaviour. Our main point is that in a context of uncertainty, demand affects firms' innovative strategies in two ways: first, by providing information on user behaviour and by increasing the capability of market segmentation; and second, by providing the incentives to innovate. This argument is supported by an empirical analysis carried out on the basis of an original dataset which includes all the tariff plans on offer in the history of the Italian market between 1992 and 2005.

We extend this stream of research by investigating both formal protection strategies (e.g. patenting) as well as strategic ones (secrecy, lead time, complex design). We conceptualize the breadth of firm's knowledge protection strategies and relate it to the particular situation of MNC subsidiaries. Moreover, we argue that their approaches differ with regard to host country challenges and opportunities. We address these issues empirically, based on a harmonized survey of innovation activities of more than 1800 firms located in Portugal and Germany. We find evidence that MNCs prefer broader sets of knowledge protection strategies in a host country with fewer opportunities for knowledge sourcing (Portugal). In Germany, though, they opt for narrower sets of knowledge protection strategies if they invest in innovation activities themselves.

While indicators of patent value explain much of the variation in these patent value estimates, the values are only weakly correlated with the estimated renewal value of the patents. The distribution of patent value from these records is highly skew, with the vast majority of the returns earned by a select set of high valued patents, consistent with finding for other measures of patent value.

As domestic Chinese firms' ability to imitate foreign technology gains strength and competition between foreign firms intensifies in the Chinese market, such competitive threat creates an urgency for protecting intellectual property. Using a database that comprises China's State Intellectual Property Office patents and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office patents, I find strong support for the competitive threat hypothesis.

Yet quantitative justification of government AR funding is highly desirable. We therefore attempt to quantify one impact which can be directly and causally attributed to one country's funding: spin-off companies. We focus on AR in the non-medical natural sciences and engineering (NSExm) in a whole country, Canada. 'Applied' disciplines are sometimes assumed to be the most commercializable, so we also separately investigate an especially 'basic' science, physics. Using a novel methodology, we estimate the lifetime impacts of companies spun-off directly from AR performed in 1960-1998, and compare the impacts with all government funding, direct and indirect, over the same period. This picks up virtually all funding and most company-formation since WWII, up to 1998. Such long-term studies are rare but essential, since we show that successful spin-offs grow (often exponentially) over several decades. With very conservative assumptions, and allowing for the time value of money, the impacts exceed government funding by a substantial margin. Physics actually fares 30-60% better than the combined NSExm; this reflects more successful companies, rather than greater numbers, and therefore does not seem inconsistent with earlier studies on company numbers. Firm lifetimes are long, with Canadian impacts truncated primarily by some foreign acquisitions. We argue that the spin-off impacts represent incremental contributions to GDP, much larger (even on a time-discounted basis) than the government funding and directly attributable to it; governments will also receive more in additional tax than they spent. The impacts therefore provide a quantitative justification for the public investment, allowing the much more important (but less quantifiable) long-term benefits to be regarded as a 'free' bonus.

Our focus is on the U.S. Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. We argue that the innovative action of government - the innovative use of public resources through the SBIR program to target and support research in small firms - does lessen innovation barriers that cause small firms to underinvest in R&D. However, this government action is subject to entrepreneurial risk, namely the a priori uncertainty that the funded research will result in a commercialized product, process, or service. We quantify the uncertainty that the government accepts in the context of innovation supported by the SBIR program; or stated alternatively, we quantify the probability that a project funded by the SBIR program will fail to commercialize its results. Our empirical results show that the entrepreneurial risk that characterizes the SBIR program is, on average, somewhat more than the probability of failing to get heads on the toss of a fair coin. Importantly, however, our evidence shows that there is a large range in the entrepreneurial risk that the government accepts--across the projects, the predicted probability of failure covers essentially the entire range from 0 to 1.0."}, {"e:volume": "39", "e:author": ["Einar Rasmussen", "Odd Jarl Borch"], "e:issue": "5", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(10)00050-8", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "602-612", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(10)00050-8", "e:year": 2010, "e:title": "University capabilities in facilitating entrepreneurship: A longitudinal study of spin-off ventures at mid-range universities", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This paper investigated how universities facilitate the process of spin-off venture formation based on academic research.

This is in contrast to the results from the cases in European countries and reflects the significance of government policies in promoting IUG cooperation in latecomer economies. Second, with regard to the impact of IUG cooperation, we conspicuously find no significant impact on the innovation probability of firms when we control the possible endogeneity, such that already innovative firms would participate more at such cooperation modes. This implies that the IUG cooperation cannot guarantee the success of a firm in technological innovation. Rather, it may have an influence on the selection or direction of the research projects of a firm. When we limited the analysis to innovative firms, we do find a positive impact of the IUG cooperation on patents generated from new product innovation but find none in terms of volume of sales or labor productivity.

Second it introduces an emerging framework whose allure rests in its ability to capture the bigger picture: the multi-level perspective on socio-technical transitions (MLP). Whilst burgeoning researcher networks and literature suggests this policy-relevant theory is attractive, it is not without its challenges. The third purpose of this paper is to elaborate these challenges as areas for further research and development. We do this by drawing upon contributions to this special section and the wider literature."}, {"e:volume": "39", "e:author": ["Philipp Späth", "Harald Rohracher"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(10)00031-4", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "449-458", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(10)00031-4", "e:year": 2010, "e:title": "'Energy regions': The transformative power of regional discourses on socio-technical futures", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "'Guiding visions' play an important role in the transition management approach as a central means of mobilizing social actors and the co-ordination of dispersed agency. 'Energy regions' in Austria are an interesting example for the strategic promotion of such guiding visions in the context of regional development. We describe the case of Murau, an alpine district in which a strong actor network has been built around a vision of systematically exploiting renewable energy sources and at the same time saving the region from economic decay. The vision gained much authority and has been institutionalised at various levels of regional governance. It furthermore was supported by and played an important role for regime level attempts to influence socio-technical change. Development and social propagation of such visions are inherently political and contested processes involving much strategizing and anticipation of conflict. We describe particular discursive strategies applied in niches - such as the combination and translation of sentiments into localised visions and demonstrations of feasibility. These strategies can be understood as systematic attempts to support discursive shifts at regime level by means of local activities, and aim to modify rather durable power structures. We suggest ways to analyse such discursive practices in order to orient strategic action in the course of such processes: analysing 'guiding visions' and their interference with other emerging trends; extending analyses across spatial scales (e.g. translations) and across thematic fields (e.g. convergence of agendas); and focusing on processes of stabilisation, institutionalisation and mutually reinforcing developments."}, {"e:volume": "39", "e:author": ["Maurie J.

Because several prominent modes of transportation are widely regarded as systemically problematic, the notion of sustainable mobility has received considerable attention from the standpoint of system innovation. Sustainability though constitutes only one of many contemporary political objectives and public commitment to goals consistent with such a future is highly equivocal. A related challenge arises from the ambivalence that sustainability champions often harbor on an individual level. It is probable that efforts to facilitate sustainable mobility will need to be reconciled with rival societal aspirations such as the pursuit of faster and more convenient forms of travel.

With its starting point in the multi-level perspective of transition theory, this case study analyzes how the outcome of the WEEE directive is constituted in the interplay between the somewhat detached regimes of electronics and waste management.

The paper finds that the lower overall corporate R&D intensity for the EU is the result of sector specialisation (structural effect) - the US has a stronger sectoral specialisation in the high R&D intensity (especially ICT-related) sectors than the EU does, and also has a much larger population of R&D investing firms within these sectors.

First, some projects close to the market are well supported through credits, while basic research projects receive only selective support in the form of subsidies. Second, there is significant diversity in the selection and funding of technological areas. Third, regarding the explicit goal of fostering cooperation, the public agency selectively favours partnerships with universities and technology institutes through the award of subsidies.

Consistent with ecological arguments, plant failure rates were higher in agglomerations but this effect was attenuated and, in some cases, reversed in agglomerations with more locally headquartered plants. Moreover, only locally headquartered plants experienced such benefits; remotely headquartered plants failed at higher rates in agglomerations. Although more footwear manufacturing jobs were retained in agglomerations with many locally headquartered plants, such locales also exhibited lower manufacturing job growth in other industries.

Controlling for other determinants of firm survival, patenting is positively associated with survival. Quite different processes appear to govern exit via acquisition compared to exit via delisting from the exchange due to business failure.

However, few studies explore the effects of knowledge-based predictors on the comparative choice of employing acquisitions versus alliances for sourcing external knowledge. This study extends the limited existing research on this topic. It simultaneously examines the effects of knowledge domain attributes, seeker and source experience-based knowledge, and dyad knowledge similarity and digestibility on whether a firm chooses an acquisition or alliance when sourcing external knowledge. Data is comprised of 209 research-driven acquisitions and alliances of biotechnology firms based in North America. Our findings reveal that external knowledge sourcing through acquisition is more likely when the knowledge domain is more complex and valuable. Acquisition is also preferred when the seeker has greater acquisition experience and when the source has accumulated a moderate level of alliance experience. Alliance, in contrast, is the chosen mode for accessing external knowledge when the knowledge is high in specificity and when the seeker has prior alliance experience. In addition, increasing similarity and digestibility of the dyad's knowledge bases strengthen the relationship between knowledge value and the probability of acquisition versus alliance. These results extend understanding of how firms decide to augment their knowledge resources in a knowledge-intensive industry.

By focusing on three general issues in the context of industrial R&D - trust, coordination, and motivation - this article develops an argument for a more expansive government role. Two models of state intervention are at the center of the analysis: public production of R&D, and state sponsorship of inter-firm and inter-organizational networks. It is argued that both these models have distinct advantages, as well as weaknesses, in addressing common challenges to industrial R&D production. Informed by the positive experiences of different states that have moved in recent years from high technology industries' periphery to the center, this article explains how the two models of state intervention address the various problems associated with pure private production. It is concluded that while even advanced countries with well developed markets might find it advantageous to actively intervene in industrial R&D, the two models should especially be considered in cases of economies that suffer from weak market signals, low retention of value-added functions, limited professional capacities, and limited institutional thickness and networks."}, {"e:volume": "39", "e:author": ["Margherita Balconi", "Stefano Brusoni", "Luigi Orsenigo"], "e:issue": "1", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(09)00189-9", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1-13", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(09)00189-9", "e:year": 2010, "e:title": "In defence of the linear model: An essay", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This essay discusses the strength and weaknesses of the so-called linear model (LM) of innovation.

The aim of the present paper is to assess the contribution of Lave and Wenger's (1991) practice theory for educational and other learning social settings. In a schooling context, for instance, Lave and Wenger's (1991) account of learning would imply that what students learn at school is how to relate and belong to the school community. By reducing learning and knowing to participation, and by displacing cognition from individuals to anonymous practices, the practice-based epistemology ignores the significant corpus of content knowledge (such as curriculums) and ascribes too passive a role to individuals and glosses over their differentiated access to resources for changing practices and their differentiated efforts in their social and cognitive development.

Firstly, are the results (especially rankings) stable with respect to weights? Secondly, is there hope to define \"economically\" reasonable weights? In order to provide answers to these questions, we use data from the European Innovation Scoreboard 2005 (EIS 2005) to exemplify our reasoning. Concerning the first question, we give genuine evidence on the existence of immense variability, possibly invalidating the results. Further, we also show that even existing and well-accepted methods, like equal weighting, Benefit of the Doubt weighting (BoD) and principal component analysis weighting (PCA) may lead to drastically differing results. Concerning the second question we will demonstrate that by each composite indicator weighting a set of shadow prices is implied expressing one indicator in terms of another. Whether the weights are sensible should be evaluated on the basis of these shadow prices. It turns out that those implied by EIS 2005 contain strange peculiarities. After that we plead for more care in constructing composite indicators. Especially weights should be chosen on the basis of shadow prices, rather than, say, by equal weighting or other automatic methods.

To explain the mechanism through which behavioural additionality is obtained, we use organizational learning theory as a guide to formulate our hypotheses.

The new product development process has multiple stages, so two types of fuzzy front end impacts on the success of new product development were examined: (1) a direct impact and (2) an indirect impact by influencing the next stage of the new product development process, i.e. project execution. Furthermore, the degree of project newness, in accordance with contingency theory, was considered. We developed and tested a conceptual model of relationships among key variables related to the fuzzy front end, project execution, and project success. The structural equation model was tested with AMOS using information from 144 projects completed by German measurement and control technique firms. For the most part, the responses from these firms supported the hypothesized relationships and the frequently claimed importance of the fuzzy front end was confirmed. The results offer strong support for the importance of the early involvement of all departments in new product development to enhance communication and, ultimately, project success. This process can be advanced by initial planning prior to development. Furthermore, the firms' responses highlighted the importance of reducing market and technical uncertainty during the fuzzy front end, as both were found to negatively influence communication and increase deviations during project execution. The technical uncertainty remaining at the start of a project had a direct, negative influence on project efficiency and the most far-reaching implications regarding the success or failure of the project. With regard to contingency theory, the results indicated that efforts spent on the reduction of uncertainty to improve project execution and success may be influenced by the degree of newness of new product concepts.

This paper argues that the current university invention ownership model, in which universities maintain de jure ownership of inventions, is not optimal either in terms of economic efficiency or for advancing the social interest of rapidly commercializing technology and encouraging entrepreneurship. We argue that this model is plagued by ineffective incentives, information asymmetries, and contradictory motivations for the university, the inventors, potential licensees, and university technology licensing offices (TLOs). These structural uncertainties can lead to delays in licensing, misaligned incentives among parties, and obstacles to the flow of scientific information and the materials necessary for scientific progress. The institutional arrangements within which TLOs are embedded have encouraged some of them to become revenue maximizers, rather than facilitators of technology dissemination for the good of the entire society. We suggest two alternative invention commercialization models as superior alternatives. The first alternative is to vest ownership with the inventor, who could choose the commercialization path for the invention. For this privilege the inventor would provide the university an ownership stake in any returns to the invention.

The objective of this paper is to assess to what extent validation and renewal fees as well as translation costs affect the validation behavior of applicants. We rely on a gravity model that aims at explaining patent flows between inventor and target countries within the European patent system. The results show that the size of countries, their wealth and the distance between their capital cities are significant determinants of patent flows.

Most of the small firms examined here find informal means of protection, such as speed to market or secrecy, more important than patenting. Only firms with university cooperation--typically R&D intensive and science-based small firms--were likely to identify patents as the most important method of appropriating innovation returns in their field. Thus, the strategic choice for most small firms is between secrecy and speed to market. Firms that cooperate in innovation with horizontal partners or significantly depend on vertical partners tend to prefer speed, whereas process innovators with modest R&D investments or few cooperative R&D activities display a preference for trade secrets. Indeed, cooperation activities greatly influence the choice of intellectual property strategy for small firms. Earlier research has emphasized patents and trade secrets as key strategies of appropriation, yet these strategies do not appear to be very beneficial for small firms engaged in cooperative innovation.

Results show that obstacles to university patenting activity reduce to four dimensions: lack of support mechanisms (including insufficient reward for researchers, lack of a TTO, lack of funds to cover patenting costs), commercialisation problems, too heavy teaching and administrative duties, and personal/cultural problems (related to the scarce knowledge of institutional-level patent regulations and to the \"open science\" mentality of the university).

Using a unique dataset of German research units, this paper deals with the influence that NPM mechanisms have on research performance. Controlling for different university mission, it can be shown that both greater internal hierarchy (especially \"strong presidents\") as well as greater operative flexibility for the researchers themselves increase research performance. Some of the variables, including the presence of research councils, have a positive effect on research efficiency under some definitions of research output. On the other hand, the introduction of resource accounting systems has a negative impact. All in all, we conclude that the public science sector reforms implemented in most of the Western economies were heading into the right direction by providing greater performance incentives and increasing allocative efficiency in resource spending.

However, we find suggestive evidence that the Internet increases adoption rates both through access to increased information about new products (via online research) and through online shopping. We also find that the magnitude of the Internet's effect is strongly tied to diffusion rates, and especially familiarity rates. This finding is consistent with Internet access having the greatest impact on the adoption of products with more developed marketing strategies (i.e., more developed information sources and online markets). Our findings indicate that the Internet helps bolster demand for products early in their diffusion process, and they suggest that improved access to information and the convenience of online shopping are likely the primary drivers of this effect.

Specifically, it proposes a model of firm R&D and tests empirically its implications for the effect of being located in a cluster on firm R&D intensity. The key ideas underlying the theory are as follows: (1) due either to natural excludability or to a high degree of stickiness of R&D-opportunity-bearing technological knowledge, geographical proximity per se is limited in the (automatic) spillover of knowledge with promising R&D opportunities to nearby firms; (2) geographical proximity may, however, help enhance the effectiveness or efficiency of knowledge exchange through market mechanisms (e.g., through contract R&D, R&D collaboration); (3) potential advantages (or disadvantages) in firm R&D of being located in a cluster also depend on the degree of asymmetry in technological competence among firms located in the cluster. The key ideas are supported by an empirical analysis of a multi-industry, multi-country data set compiled by the World Bank. In particular, the results show that being located in a cluster per se actually has a negative effect on firm R&D intensity, which is in contrast to the conventional wisdom of pure or automatic localized knowledge spillovers, as far as firm R&D intensity is concerned."}, {"e:volume": "38", "e:author": ["Lucio Fuentelsaz", "Jaime Gómez", "Sergio Palomas"], "e:issue": "7", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(09)00096-1", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1172-1180", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(09)00096-1", "e:year": 2009, "e:title": "The effects of new technologies on productivity: An intrafirm diffusion-based assessment", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This paper studies the impact of new technologies on productivity from the perspective of the technological diffusion literature.

They typically adopt a hybrid role identity that comprises a focal academic self and a secondary commercial persona. We delineate two mechanisms - delegating and buffering - that these individuals deploy to facilitate such salience in their hybrid role identity.

Using accounting data on French innovative manufacturing firms, we implement appropriate difference-in-difference estimation techniques associated with a matching propensity score procedure. We find that the acquisitions of French firms by foreign companies boost R&D spending. There is a simultaneous rise in the external and in-house R&D expenditures of French acquired firms. R&D is more contracted out to local research providers, in particular to local public laboratories and universities. The increase in internal R&D spending benefits to development, but also basic and applied research. Finally, the growth of the R&D budget is not only financed by internal resources but also receives financing from external partners, especially parent companies. Thus, our results call into question the idea that foreign takeovers hamper the R&D development of target firms and are detrimental to the national innovation system of the host country. First, acquisitions appear to bring efficiency gains enough to counterbalance the various costs of integration and market power effects, pushing firms to invest more in R&D. Acquisitions do not seem to incite managers to take shorter term and more financial driven decisions at the expense of R&D. Second, when motivated by technology sourcing and overseas R&D development, acquisitions might be used to access the specific know-how of target firms and to tap into the knowledge of the national innovation system. Then, purchaser firms could be more likely to develop the innovative capability of target firms and to strengthen their linkages with local partners than to reduce them and relocate R&D abroad."}, {"e:volume": "38", "e:author": ["Fragkiskos Filippaios", "Marina Papanastassiou", "Robert Pearce", "Ruth Rama"], "e:issue": "6", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(09)00048-1", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1032-1043", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(09)00048-1", "e:year": 2009, "e:title": "New forms of organisation and R&D internationalisation among the world's 100 largest food and beverages multinationals", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This paper explores the strategic internationalisation of Research and Development (R&D) activities of the world's 100 largest food and beverages (F&B) multinationals (MNEs) in 1996 and 2000 with a sample of nearly 8000 affiliates for each period.

It is argued here that the second mover expands by relying upon accumulated organizational capabilities based on subcontracting manufacturing, hence implying likely path dependence in development. Thus, the strategy of choice for most will be upgrading subcontracting, cross-industry subcontracting, and then own-brand manufacturing, in that order. Among the structural factors affecting the firm's strategic choice, the industrial policy has been a crucial one. South Korea has produced some successful global brands, supported by the state's national champion policy and long-term commitment to the chaebol. The emerging China has also adopted a highly ambitious national champion strategy. The fact that the government in Taiwan has never adopted a national champion strategy helps to partly explain the evolutionary path of Taiwan's second movers, and attests to the importance of industrial policy.

The concept is based on two interrelated influencing factors. The first is the sectoral-specific transformative capacity of new technologies themselves, that is, their substantial or incremental impact on socioeconomic and institutional change in a given sectoral system. The second is the sectoral adaptability of socioeconomic structures, institutions, and actors confronted with the opportunities presented by new technologies. The first factor--the sectoral transformative capacity of new technologies--enables us to identify the technology-based pressure to change and adjust the structural, institutional, and organizational architectures of the sectoral system. The second, complementary factor--sectoral adaptability--helps us to discern the distinct social patterns of anticipating and adopting this technology-based pressure. The specific interplay between the two influencing factors creates distinguishable modes of sectoral transformation, ranging from anticipative and smooth adjustments to reactive and crisis-ridden patterns of change. Even processes of radical sectoral change continue over longer periods of mismatch and are characterized by numerous and mostly gradual organizational, structural and institutional transformations."}, {"e:author": ["Andrea Filippetti"], "e:volume": "38", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(09)00064-X", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1077-1078", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(09)00064-X", "e:year": 2009, "e:title": "J.

Three explanations for this apparent inconsistency with the demand-pull hypothesis played a role: (1) the rapid convergence on a single dominant design limited the market opportunity for non-incremental technical improvements; (2) even though the policies implemented were stringent enough to stimulate demand, uncertainty in their longevity dampened the incentives for inventions that were likely to take several years to pay off; and (3) alternative explanations, such as declining R&D funding and weakening presidential engagement on energy, appear to have been important."}, {"e:volume": "38", "e:author": ["Jay Inghwee Chok"], "e:issue": "5", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(09)00007-9", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "710-725", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(09)00007-9", "e:year": 2009, "e:title": "Regulatory dependence and Scientific Advisory Boards", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) uses scientific procedures to evaluate regulated firms' new product applications.

Our results are consistent with a conclusion that improvements to the IPR environment and greater commercialization of the seed industry can increase the benefits that farmers derive from new cotton technology."}, {"e:volume": "38", "e:author": ["Jian Cheng GUAN", "Richard C.M.

A key contribution of the paper is conceptual and methodological: the development of an original typology of knowledge network properties to trace out changes in the form of networks as they evolve over time. A second contribution consists in providing an example of the application of the typology by examining the emergence and development of a firm-centred knowledge network in the case of Petrobras, the Brazilian oil company over more than 30 years between the late 1960s and the early 2000s. This demonstrates that the properties of Petrobras' knowledge networks continuously evolved through a succession of stages towards (i) increasing intentionality in the management decision-making underlying network development, (ii) growing complexity and diversity in selected cognitive characteristics, and (iii) greater complementarity in the division of innovative labour between Petrobras and its network partners. These original results from applying the typology, in conjunction with retrospective historical methods, illustrate only one aspect of its potential value in the analysis of knowledge networks in late-industrialising economies: tracking out organisational evolution over long periods of time.

The differential effect of competitive market pressure on firm R&D, conditioned primarily by the level of firms' technological competence, is empirically supported by unique firm-level data from the World Bank.

The USSR developed a large research infrastructure but it lacked effective mechanisms for the commercialization of research results. The main aim of the transformation of R&D systems in the post-Soviet states in the 1990s and early 2000s was the re-orientation of scientific activities away from military and towards civilian goals. Analysis of statistical data at the macro-level suggests that this attempt was not particularly successful. Indeed, most newly independent states could not even preserve a 'critical mass' of scientific activities in order to remain among the list of significant producers of research results. In the post-Soviet countries (and in this paper we focus on Russia and Ukraine as the largest states of the region), inputs from the R&D system have failed to generate wealth-creating outputs because of a systemic inability to use the resources for generating commercially viable results effectively. All post-Soviet countries, including Russia and Ukraine, urgently need not only a major transformation within the R&D system, but also important changes in the wider 'environment'. It is important to stress that, in recent years, changes in R&D have been determined not only by the general economic situation itself but also by the general policy of the post-Soviet states. While Russia has expressed ambitions to regain its former influence as a great power and to use S&T to achieve this goal, Ukraine has no clearly determined objectives for the development of its national science system. However, both countries face certain common problems. The development of relevant institutes and the stimulation of demand for R&D results from the side of industry, broader involvement in the international division of scientific work, and the introduction of adequate legal protection for intellectual property rights are all of critical importance for S&T institutes and other research organizations in Russia and Ukraine. This paper shows that the reforms in the R&D sector have been relatively modest and rather unsystematic over the last one and a half decades. The key challenges, which relate to the inertia and the negative aspects of the previous period (for example, a extremely low level of replacement of aging manpower, largely outdated scientific equipment in research laboratories, and institutional mechanisms that are not relevant to the market economy), pose serious problems for the transformation of the R&D systems in both countries, despite new possibilities and a willingness to increase financial support for R&D."}, {"e:volume": "38", "e:author": ["Thomas Heinze", "Philip Shapira", "Juan D.

The politico-economic phenomenon of 'Europe' is partly constituted by regulatory regime-building, and new technologies are one of the major sites of regime-building. A constructionist social theory perspective shows that study of the conflictual processes of regulatory policymaking affords insights into the formation of the rules of engagement that constitute technology domains. Adopting the concept of emergent 'technological zone' in preference to industrial 'sector' or technoscientific network, the paper presents, using empirical research, a detailed account of the case of the debate and development of regulatory policy for therapeutic tissue engineering in the European Union's policy institutions and stakeholder networks. It describes how the jurisdiction of an emergent zone has been formed through such negotiations, providing a counter-example to the common view that regulation 'lags behind' innovation. The analysis takes account particularly of the part played by the malleability of the definition of the material technology itself in such constructive governance processes, and it also suggests various consequences for the array of producers of the technology, for market structuring and for the innovation pathways taken by tissue engineering technology. Concluding, the paper argues that there is conceptual advance to be made by bringing together constructionist social theory with innovation studies approaches that highlight the part played by non-firm, public institutions in shaping innovation ecologies."}, {"e:volume": "38", "e:author": ["David M.

However, the policy effectiveness of evolutionary approaches in cases in which radical or systemic changes are involved is not yet proven. In this paper we assess the theoretical rationale, instrumental aspects and the coping with policy constraints of three evolutionary policy approaches which have also been used in empirical studies: strategic niche management, transition management and time strategies. Each approach has its strengths and specific problems and all three have to be further developed and tested out but they hold promise for contributing to non-incremental change with economic and environmental benefits, by shaping processes of variation, selection and retention, with the outcomes feeding back into policy.

We find that firms that implemented a greater number of investment transactions in modernization achieved higher productivity, and these estimated quantitative effects are greater than the impact of standard innovation variables such as patents and R&D. Investment transactions in the information technology and digital monitoring devices imparted a particularly noticeable boost to productivity. These results are obtained after controlling for other firm-specific variables such as capital intensity or mergers and acquisitions. Thus, firms' decisions to undertake investments in modernization and incremental innovations appear to be critical for achieving gains in productivity, compounding to form meaningful differences in performance, productivity and competitive position across firms in the longer run.

The cross-industry sample allows analyzing the different consequences of these strategic parameters in low-, medium- and high-technology firms by considering technological intensity as a moderator. Our first finding is that the positive impact of technological aggressiveness is limited in low- and medium-technology companies. Secondly, technological diversification has a positive effect in high-technology firms and a negative effect in low-technology firms. Thirdly, patent portfolio size has a positive effect only in high-technology firms. Finally, patent portfolio quality has an equally positive influence on all firms' performance.

The 3-digit industrial classification seems to be the level at which MAR and Jacobs effects are undistinguishable from one another, and this is often exacerbated by a high level of geographical aggregation."}, {"e:volume": "38", "e:author": ["Xibao Li"], "e:issue": "2", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(08)00283-7", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "338-357", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(08)00283-7", "e:year": 2009, "e:title": "China's regional innovation capacity in transition: An empirical approach", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "Drawing upon regional innovation system literature, this paper estimates a stochastic frontier model to explain the increasing disparity in innovation performance between Chinese regions.

Second, we assess whether and to what extent value chain relationships are associated with the presence of multinationals and with their embeddedness in the host economy. Third, we take into account the capabilities of local firms to handle the technology as a factor influencing knowledge transfer through value chain relationships. Using data on 1385 firms active in Thailand in 2001-2003, we apply a multinomial logit model to test how the nature and intensity of multinational presence and the competencies of local firms affect the organization of international knowledge transfer. We find that knowledge intensive relationships, which are characterized by a significant transmission of technical and organizational competencies along the value chains, are positively associated with the presence of global buyers in the local market, with the efforts of MNCs to adapt technology to local contexts, and with the technical capabilities of domestic firms.

Using a novel dataset matching alliances and patent data for the European ICT industry, we show that alliances are complementary to prior collocation (at both national and sub-national regional level) of firm's R&D labs. In such an intra-industry, oligopolistic scenario, firms strategically use R&D alliances as a means to limit knowledge flows and protect competences, rather than to promote knowledge flows.

We analyzed prior art citations listed in all U.S. patents granted in 2001-2003, and found that examiners played a significant role in identifying prior art, adding 63% of citations on the average patent, and all citations on 40% of patents granted. An analysis of variance found that firm-specific variables explain most of the variation in examiner-citation shares. Using multivariate regression, we found that foreign applicants to the USPTO had the highest proportion of citations added by examiners. High-volume patent applicants had a greater proportion of examiner citations, and a substantial number of firms won patents without listing a single applicant citation.

First, companies using patents in the traditional way to protect their technological knowledge base receive a higher number of forward citations for their patents.

Antecedents of adoption include prior investments in AMT, developments in firms' manufacturing capabilities, technology strategy, absorptive capacity, and environmental pressures. Based on a sample of 87 Greek manufacturing SMEs, we find that AMT adoption follows an incremental, piecemeal progression from the least complicated through intermediate to integrated technologies. It is found that an increase in the firms' quality and flexibility capabilities induces them to adopt further AMT, whereas advances in low-cost, innovation, and delivery capabilities appear negatively related to further AMT adoption. Absorptive capacity, technology strategy and environmental pressures play a central role in decisions for additional investments in AMT.

This article examines the management of the final phases of the design process of an innovative product-related service.

Launch management strategies have thus to be adapted; (2) an analysis of the data collected confirms this difference by bringing to light great contrasts in these different aspects of learning; (3) this led us to identify a field that needs exploration by researchers in product and service innovation: the design of the sales process.

In addition, plants with a zero R&D stock experience significant one-off negative productivity effects.

Special attention is paid to policies supporting the emergence and development of the regional innovation system in this transition process.

A specialized hub refers to a node in a global value chain that mainly undertakes one or a few of the activities required for the production and development of a given good or service or serves a particular segment of the global market. In global value chains, firms in developing countries have traditionally been responsible for the lowest added-value activities. However, a few emerging regional innovation systems in developing countries are beginning to challenge this scenario by rapidly upgrading in the value chain. There is, however, still only a poorly developed understanding of how the system of innovation emerges and evolves to support this transition process and what the role of regional innovation policy is in building the regional conditions that support indigenous small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) in this transition process. This paper aims at reducing this omission by analyzing the co-evolution of the strategies of indigenous SMEs and the regional innovation system of Bangalore (India)."}, {"e:volume": "37", "e:author": ["David B.

Our findings indicate that successful exploration indeed seems to require a delicate balance between these two exploration tasks.

On the other hand, better access to sources of capital through the MNE and other subsidiaries may induce the subsidiary to invest more in R&D in comparison to domestic firms. We find that subsidiaries of foreign MNEs invest less in total R&D than domestic firms. The reason is that they invest less in external R&D than domestic firms; however, they have similar internal R&D investments compared to domestic firms. These findings support the notion that the transfer of technology and knowledge from other parts of the MNE acts as a substitute for the purchase of external R&D while internal R&D acts as a complement to the technology and knowledge transferred from other parts of the MNE."}, {"e:volume": "37", "e:author": ["Akihiro Hashimoto", "Shoko Haneda"], "e:issue": "10", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(08)00184-4", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1829-1836", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(08)00184-4", "e:year": 2008, "e:title": "Measuring the change in R&D efficiency of the Japanese pharmaceutical industry", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This paper presents a data envelopment analysis (DEA)/Malmquist index methodology for measuring the change in R&D efficiency at both firm and industry levels.

From interviews with 84 biological scientists at nine universities we find scientists view UIRRS and university intellectual property (IP) policies in complex and often conflicting ways.

This study measures GI and SI on a sample of SME entrepreneurs by using two different scales that are based on inventories extensively used in this field (i.e., the KAI [Kirton, J.M., 1976. Adaptors and innovators: a description and measure. Journal of Applied Psychology 61 (5), 622-629; Kirton, J.M., 2003. Adaption-Innovation in the Context of Diversity and Change.

Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science 19 (3), 209-222] inventories) and tests their effects on the entrepreneurs' intention to adopt innovations. Secondly, this study relates entrepreneurs' innovativeness (both GI and SI) to their basic personality traits as assessed through the Five-Factor Model of human personality (cf. [Digman, J.M., 1990. Personality structure: emergence of the five-factor model. Annual Review of Psychology 41 (1), 417-440; McCrae, R.R., John, O.P., 1992. An introduction to the five-factor model and its implications. Journal of Personality 60 (2), 1-26]). Finally, it compares the predictive power of both GI and SI on the entrepreneurs' intention to adopt innovations against that of a cognitive model that represents the framework of reference in this field (i.e., the Theory of Planned Behavior [Ajzen, I., 1991. The theory of planned behavior. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 50 (2), 179-211]).

It is the temporal capacity of these boundary objects that makes them points of juncture in a widely distributed memory system, enabling project-based firms to balance preservation and adaptation of knowledge.

We ask the question whether there are distinct disciplinary online communication patterns. In particular, we hypothesize that Mode 2 sciences have a higher use of Internet applications and address a greater variety of audiences with a greater variety of research outputs than Mode 1 sciences. Mode 2 was introduced as a descriptive and diagnostic characterization of transitions in knowledge production that are characterized by a range of features such as interdisciplinarity, reflexivity, focus on the context of application, heterogeneous actors, and a wide variety of types of output. This new mode of knowledge production has supposedly evolved out of the disciplinary and academic context of traditional ways in which knowledge was produced. It involves different mechanisms of generating and of communicating knowledge, more actors who come from different disciplines, and different sites in which knowledge is being produced. We analyze online communication patterns in eight scientific disciplines including four Mode 1 sciences (High Energy Physics, Astrophysics, Literature Studies, and Psychology) and four Mode 2 sciences (Genetics, Biotechnology, Computer Science, and Information Science). We collected data on several dimensions of online communications, which included the shared set of outlinks of the departments and the characteristics of the websites in terms of size and types of files. The results suggest that web-based communications play a role in obtaining informational and financial resources, the use and exchange of digital data, the dissemination of results to academic audiences, and the dissemination of (non-traditional) output. The Internet maintains the three Mode 2 aspects of knowledge production: the interaction with non-academic partners, the dissemination of non-traditional output (software tools, databases, etc.), and the use of digital data. However, these characteristics of Mode 2 can be traced in different web attributes in each field. There is no systematic relationship between the three Mode 2 elements and the web characteristics under study here across all fields.

Our results show that networking and career development are strongly related, but it is important to distinguish between different types of networks. Although networks on various levels (faculty, university, scientific, industrial) show strong correlations, we found three significant differences. First, networking within one's own faculty and with researchers from other universities stimulates careers, while interactions with industry do not. Second, during the course of an academic career a researcher's scientific network activity first rises, but then declines after about 20 years.

To add to our understanding of the linkages between product architecture, innovation, and industry structure we develop detailed product architecture measurements based on a previously proposed method [Fixson, S.K., 2005. Product architecture assessment: a tool to link product, process, and supply chain design decisions. Journal of Operations Management 23 (3/4), 345-369] and study an unusual case in which a firm - through decreasing its product modularity - turned its formerly competitive industry into a near-monopoly. Using this case study we explore how existing theories on modularity explain the observed phenomenon, and show that most consider technological change in rather long-term dimensions, and tend to focus on efficiency-related arguments to explain the resulting forces on competition. We add three critical aspects to the theory that connects technological change and industry dynamics. First, we suggest integrating as a new design operator to explain product architecture genesis. Second, we argue that a finer-grained analysis of the product architecture shows the existence of multiple linkages between product architecture and industry structure, and that these different linkages help explain the observed intra-industry heterogeneity across firms. Third, we propose that the firm boundary choice can also be a pre-condition of the origin of architectural innovation, not only an outcome of efficiency considerations."}, {"e:volume": "37", "e:author": ["Philipp Koellinger"], "e:issue": "8", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(08)00108-X", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "1317-1328", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(08)00108-X", "e:year": 2008, "e:title": "The relationship between technology, innovation, and firm performance--Empirical evidence from e-business in Europe", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This article analyzes the relationship between the usage of Internet-based technologies, different types of innovation, and performance at the firm level.

Each of these forms of knowledge sourcing also makes a positive contribution to innovation in both products and processes although public knowledge sources have only an indirect effect on innovation outputs. In the exploitation phase, innovation in both products and processes contribute positively to company growth, with product innovation having a short-term 'disruption' effect on labour productivity.

At low levels of R&D intensity, firms' propensity to integrate their activities is low, but increases with escalating levels of R&D intensity in order to avoid the misappropriation of value generated by technological knowledge. However, beyond a certain R&D intensity level, the propensity to integrate activities declines, since the level of technological knowledge is high enough to prevent imitation by third parties.

We find, as anticipated, that amongst other factors specialist knowledge providers are more likely to be engaged by firms with more open approaches to innovation, those with high levels of absorptive capacity, those with greater social capital and networking capabilities, as well as by those with deeper commitments to innovation. Overall, the use of specialist knowledge providers tends to complement firms' own internal innovation activities and to complement other external sources of knowledge. Moreover, the individual types of specialist knowledge providers tend to complement rather than substitute for one another. Beyond this we find significant differences in the types of specialist knowledge providers used by manufacturing and service firms. Although service firms are more likely than manufacturers to use specialist knowledge providers, they are more likely to engage consultants, whilst their links with research-based organisations, including the public science-base, are weaker.

Their respective knowledge contributions need to be integrated into a functioning whole. Two approaches provide insight into how this is achieved: the dominating cross-learning approach assumes that the specialists of different knowledge domains have to intensively learn from each other in order to be able to jointly develop the new product. This cross-learning implies that groups of specialists transfer their specific knowledge, which encompasses different concepts (theories), methods and world views, among each other. However, some researchers argue that intensive cross-learning between specialists is a considerable expense in time and effort and, therefore, inefficient. They insist that integration of specialists' knowledge is achieved through structural mechanisms that significantly reduce the need for cross-learning. This article is based on one of the latter approaches. We argue that the mechanisms of transactive memory, modularization and prototyping in combination can considerably reduce knowledge transfers. This assumption has found empirical support for incremental innovations. On the basis of a comparison between incremental and radical innovation projects in an electrotechnical company, we analyze whether the assumption that, on the basis of structural mechanisms, specialists can integrate their knowledge without having to intensively learn from each other, also holds for radical innovations."}, {"e:volume": "37", "e:author": ["Luciana D'Adderio"], "e:issue": "5", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(08)00027-9", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "769-789", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(08)00027-9", "e:year": 2008, "e:title": "The performativity of routines: Theorising the influence of artefacts and distributed agencies on routines dynamics", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "Drawing from advances in Organisational Studies and recent debates within Economic Sociology and the Sociology of Financial Markets, this paper proposes a theoretical framework that characterises the mutual adaptation between formal routines and rules, on one hand, and actual performances, on the other, as iterative cycles of framing, overflowing and reframing of knowledge inputs and actions.

The third is a form of organisational innovation, about which much less is known. Aside from identifying statistically these three modes of innovation, we show that firms of different sizes and in different sectors have different propensities to engage in each of them. High-technology firms are, for example, the most likely of all firms to engage in the product-research mode, whilst low-technology manufacturers are the most likely to engage in the process-technologies mode. Meanwhile, the organisational-cooperation mode, which involves supply-chain rather than research-based cooperative practices, is particularly prominent in services, especially in trade and distribution services.

Two approaches provide insight into how this is achieved: the dominating cross-learning approach assumes that the specialists of different knowledge domains have to intensively learn from each other in order to be able to jointly develop the new product. This cross-learning implies that groups of specialists transfer their specific knowledge, which encompasses different concepts (theories), methods and world views, among each other. However, some researchers argue that intensive cross-learning between specialists is a considerable expense in time and effort and, therefore, inefficient. They insist that integration of specialists' knowledge is achieved through structural mechanisms that significantly reduce the need for cross-learning. This article is based on one of the latter approaches. We argue that the mechanisms of transactive memory, modularization and prototyping in combination can considerably reduce knowledge transfers. This assumption has found empirical support for incremental innovations.

These channels include in-house R&D, foreign technology transfer, domestic technology transfer, and inter-industry R&D spillover. We have found evidence of an important role of inter-industry R&D spillover in shaping and improving industry performance in China, which has been neglected by previous empirical studies concerned with Chinese industrial firms. The empirical results indicate that inter-industry R&D spillover and foreign technology transfer make significant contributions to both labour productivity and the level of total factor productivity in Chinese manufacturing industries. We have also found that in-house R&D and inter-industry R&D spillover share a complementary relationship in shaping innovation performance and total factor productivity in Chinese industry, and that in-house R&D relates to foreign technology transfer as a complement for labour productivity. Finally, on the mixed results among existing literature in the context of developing countries, this article argues that the commonly followed strategy in technology development, combined with government regulations, will play an essential role in determining the relationship between in-house R&D and foreign technology transfer."}, {"e:volume": "37", "e:author": ["Elizabeth Garnsey", "Gianni Lorenzoni", "Simone Ferriani"], "e:issue": "2", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(07)00236-3", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "210-224", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048-7333(07)00236-3", "e:year": 2008, "e:title": "Speciation through entrepreneurial spin-off: The Acorn-ARM story", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "Can the concept of speciation explain evidence on how technologies branch and advance?

These questions are addressed through a case study of detailed processes enabling the shift of technology to new domains of application. An innovative IT firm developed its own semiconductor technology to remedy supplier deficiencies but it required a joint venture with a completely new business model to adapt and move the technology into new market domains. We propose the concept of techno-organizational speciation to delineate this phenomenon. Competing perspectives on speciation (compatibility, niche and lineage approaches) are found to illuminate the evidence, while complementarities between these conceptual dimensions are revealed by the case. Causal processes uncovered include the following: (1) Techno-organizational speciation through spin-off may be needed to launch a dominant technical standard, compatible with multiple applications. (2) This can be achieved through niche creation from which develops a new business ecosystem. (3) Inherited knowledge together with organizationally based learning foster the branching and renewal of technological lineages."}, {"e:volume": "37", "e:author": ["Mario I. Kafouros", "Peter J.

The study described here empirically examines this issue. The findings indicate that, depending on technological opportunities, firm size and competitive pressure, the net impact of R&D spillovers on productivity can be either positive or negative. Specifically, we find that although spillover effects are positively associated with the technological opportunities that a firm faces, this relationship is reversed when firm size is considered. Whilst external R&D affects large self-reliant firms negatively, its impact on the productivity of smaller firms (who usually introduce incremental innovations that are characterized by a strong reliance on external technologies) is positive, and even higher than that of their own R&D. We also demonstrate that the economic payoff for firms' own R&D is lower when they face intense competition.

Our main findings are: (i) public support significantly increases the chances that a firm will cooperate with a PRO, and (ii) public support also increases the likelihood that a firm will establish private partnerships, but to a smaller extent and only when firms have intangible knowledge assets.

We put particular emphasis on the impact of incoming academic spillovers on the probability to co-operate with these public R&D institutes. Based on data from Community Innovation Surveys we find that foreign firms in the Netherlands are less likely to co-operate with domestic public knowledge institutions than domestic firms, while in Finland no significant difference can be detected. Another result is that incoming knowledge spillovers are an important determinant for R&D collaboration with domestic public knowledge institutions in both countries. In case of foreign firms in Finland, incoming knowledge spillovers affect the probability to co-operate with public knowledge institutions more positively compared to domestic firms. For the Netherlands no substantial difference could be found in this respect. Further, innovating firms in Finland that require academic or basic knowledge do not co-operate significantly more with public knowledge institutions than those that need applied knowledge. At the same time they are willing to share knowledge with public R&D partners. In the Netherlands innovating firms that require relatively more basic than applied knowledge, increase the probability of co-operation with Dutch universities and public knowledge institutions but there is reluctance to share proprietary knowledge with public R&D partners. For both countries no significant difference between foreign and domestic firms with regard to academic knowledge requirements could be found.

On the basis of an extensive review of the available literature, the paper argues for the importance of differentiating between different varieties of knowing in action. The paper notes the differences - in organisation, spatial dynamics, innovation outcomes, and knowledge processes - between four modes: craft or task-based knowing; epistemic or high creativity knowing; professional knowing; and virtual knowing. The proposed typology is used to illustrate the insight gained from such analytical precision, through a discussion of the spatial configuration of knowing in action, long assumed to require spatial proximity.

This analysis reflects the frequently observed collaborations between pharma companies and biotechs, and an actual research contract is assessed to link theory to practice. The governance form refers to the allocation of control rights over the research process and property rights over research output(s), as determined by the initial contract; yet this contract is incomplete. The parties negotiate at a later stage from bargaining positions that depend on the initial choice of the governance, but they also contemplate the possibility that the collaboration will be terminated. By means of a simple model that captures the core aspects of the contractual environment, I answer a key research question: How should governance be designed in the shadow of potential termination to provide the research firm with the incentives to invest in the collaboration? First, it is in the company’s interest to choose a governance form that eliminates the possibility of termination and stabilizes the collaboration whenever possible. Second, if the collaboration cannot be stabilized, the company faces a trade-off between reducing the probability of termination and providing incentives, which is ultimately resolved by making the collaboration highly unstable. Third, property rights and control are substitutes in the governance design: If the company collects more property rights, it must relinquish more control rights."}, {"e:volume": "40", "e:author": ["Simon Smith", "Vicky Ward", "Allan House"], "e:issue": "10", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311001077", "e:keyword": ["Research evaluation", "Research assessment", "Impact", "Knowledge translation", "Academic autonomy", "Boundary-work"], "e:pages": "1369-1379", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311001077", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "‘Impact’ in the proposals for the UK's Research Excellence Framework: Shifting the boundaries of academic autonomy", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "Evaluation of university-based research already has a reasonably long tradition in the UK, but proposals to revise the framework for national evaluation aroused controversy in the academic community because they envisage assessing more explicitly than before the economic, social and cultural ‘impact’ of research as well as its scientific quality. Using data from the 2009 public consultation on the proposals for a Research Excellence Framework, this paper identifies three main lines of controversy: the threats to academic autonomy implied in the definition of expert review and the delimitation of reviewers, the scope for boundary-work in the construction of impact narratives and case studies, and the framing of knowledge translation by the stipulation that impact ‘builds on’ research. Given the behaviour-shaping effects of research evaluation, the paper demonstrates how the proposed changes could help embed impact considerations among the routine reflexive tools of university researchers and enhance rather than restrict academic autonomy at the level of research units. It also argues that the REF could constitute an important dialogical space for negotiating science–society relations in an era of increasing heteronomy between academia, state and industry. But the paper raises doubts about whether the proposed operationalisation of impact is adequate to evaluate the ways that research and knowledge translation are actually carried out."}, {"e:volume": "40", "e:author": ["Dirk Libaers", "Martin Meyer"], "e:issue": "10", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311001181", "e:keyword": ["Serial and non-serial innovator firms", "Industrial clustering", "Internationalization", "RBV", "Density dependence theory"], "e:pages": "1426-1437", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311001181", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Highly innovative small technology firms, industrial clusters and firm internationalization", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This study examines the role and differential impact of industrial clustering in the internationalization of small technology-based firms. Serial innovator firms are a set of small, long-lived technology-based firms with a stellar record of inventive success. In contrast, non-serial innovators are small technology-based firms with much weaker inventive capabilities. Using theoretical insights from the resource-based view and density dependence theory, we demonstrate that both serial and non-serial innovator firms benefit from rising levels of industrial clustering in their efforts to internationalize; however, non-serial innovators experience decreasing returns with increasing levels of clustering. In addition, our analysis indicates that overall serial innovator firms benefit more from industrial clustering in terms of internationalization than non-serial innovator firms. The underlying premise and contribution of this study is that all small technology-based firms are not the same and that serial innovators are more effective at leveraging cluster-based resources than non-serial innovators, even when they operate in the same industry.

Far from being simply technical in nature, such policies are often ideological innovations. This paper examines three economic policy innovations (privatization, central bank independence, and pension reform) and shows how the diffusion of these policies depended not only upon the mobility of American-trained Ph.D. economists to adopting countries, but also the state of agreement among economists on the value of these policy innovations. By estimating hazard models for adoption times, the effects of mobility and policy agreement are shown to explain the adoption patterns.

The study is based on 36 individual interviews and an on-line questionnaire survey of 735 scientists from five major UK research universities. It finds that there is a diversity of motivations for commercial engagement, and that many do so for reputational and intrinsic reasons and that financial rewards play a relatively small part. The paper draws on self-determination theory in social psychology to analyse the relationship between scientists’ value orientations with regard to commercial engagement and their personal motivations. It finds that those with traditional beliefs about the separation of science from commerce are more likely to be extrinsically motivated, using commercialization as a means to obtain resources to support their quest for the ‘ribbon’. In contrast, those identify closely with entrepreneurial norms are intrinsically motivated by the autonomy and ‘puzzle-solving’ involved in applied commercial research while also motivated by the ‘gold’. The study highlights the primacy of scientists’ self-motivation, and suggests that a fuller explanation of their commercial behaviour will need to consider a broader mix of motives to include the social and affective aspects of intrinsic motivation. In conclusion, the paper argues that policy to encourage commercial engagement should build on reputational and intrinsic rather than purely financial motivations."}, {"e:volume": "40", "e:author": ["John Baffes", "Athanasios Vamvakidis"], "e:issue": "10", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311001144", "e:keyword": ["Nobel Prize", "Nobel laureates", "Age Discrimination"], "e:pages": "1345-1353", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311001144", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Are you too young for the Nobel Prize?", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "Although age is not supposed to be a criterion for the award of the Nobel Prize, it is commonly believed that it does play a role.

The focus here is on two sets of research collaboration variables, numbers of collaborators and the collaboration strategies employed. The study uses questionnaire data from the U.S. National Survey of Academic Scientists (n=1714) and tests several hypotheses about collaboration numbers and strategies. Regression results indicate, counter to the core hypotheses and almost all published literature, that in a properly specified model, one taking into account such factors as tenure, discipline, family status and doctoral cohort, women actually have somewhat more collaborators on average than do men. For both men and women, those with more industrial interactions and those affiliated with university research centers have more collaborators. Men and women differ in their collaborator choice strategies. Men are more likely to be oriented to “instrumental,” and “experience” strategies, while both men and women are motivated by “mentoring” strategies.

The HGP was initiated as a public project funded by government agencies, starting at a moderate pace. The progressive introduction of different actors and the development of various interests catalyzed the project, which eventually became eminent both in the public and private sectors. The competition between the public and the private sector played greatly in favor of both: the financial burden as well as the horizon of the public project were significantly reduced, the private project(s) gained from the hype of the public project, yet had to play an active and collaborative role in order to remain in the game. This is at the core of the social bubble hypothesis. To further our argument, we present quantitative analysis of the development of the biotech sector within the financial stock market.

Yet the biotech industry has received substantial funding from venture-capital firms as well as from established companies through R&amp;D alliances. Why would money from venture capitalists and big pharma flow into an industry in which profits are so hard to come by? The purpose of this article is to work toward a solution of what might be called the “Pisano puzzle”, and in the process to provide a basis for analyzing the industrial and institutional conditions under which the growth of the US biopharmaceutical (BP) industry is sustainable. One part of the answer has been the willingness of stock-market investors to absorb the initial public offerings (IPOs) of a BP venture that has not yet generated a commercial product, and indeed may never do so. The other part of the answer is that the knowledge base that BP companies can tap to develop products comes much more from government investments and spending than from business finance. Indeed, we show that, through stock buybacks and dividends, established corporations in the BP industry have been distributing substantial sums of cash to shareholders that may be at the expense of R&amp;D. We use the framework that we have developed for analyzing the sustainability of the US BP business model to pose a number of key areas for future research and policy, with an emphasis on the implications of the financialization of this business model for the generation of safe and affordable BP drugs as well as the need for a theory of innovative enterprise."}, {"e:volume": "40", "e:author": ["Natália Barbosa", "Ana Paula Faria"], "e:issue": "9", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311000989", "e:keyword": ["Institutions", "Innovation", "European Union", "Instrumental variables"], "e:pages": "1157-1169", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311000989", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Innovation across Europe: How important are institutional differences?", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "By changing the level of competition and/or affecting the allocation of resources, institutions can play a very important role on innovation activity.

Within this framework we explore the evolving relationship between market failure and systems approaches to innovation policy in the case of Australia. Drawing on information and analysis collected for a major review of Australia's NIS, and the government's 10-year plan in response to it, we show how the free market trajectory of policy-making of past decades is being extended, complemented and refocused by new approaches to complex-evolutionary system thinking. These approaches are shown to emphasize the importance of systemic connectivity, evolving institutions and organizational capabilities. Nonetheless, despite the fact that there has been much progress in this direction in the Australian debate, the predominant logic behind policy choices still remains one of addressing market failure, and the primary focus of policy attention continues to be science and research rather than demand-led approaches.

We also confirmed that, even with this contribution controlled, UI joint research projects increased following the 1998 legislation to promote technology transfer from universities (the so-called TLO Act) and the 1999 legislation to allow universities to retain rights on their inventions made with government research funds (the so-called Japanese Bayh–Dole Act)."}, {"e:volume": "41", "e:author": ["Lori DiVito"], "e:issue": "5", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312000352", "e:keyword": ["Biotechnology", "National business systems", "National innovation systems", "Varieties of capitalism", "Institutional entrepreneurship"], "e:pages": "884-896", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312000352", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Institutional entrepreneurship in constructing alternative paths: A comparison of biotech hybrids", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This paper investigates how firms adapt their innovation strategies to cope with constraints in national institutional environments.

This paper brings together the views of these different disciplines and provides empirical insights on the drivers of eco-innovations based on a novel dataset of 1566 UK firms that responded to the Government Survey of Environmental Protection Expenditure by Industry in 2006. By applying the Heckman selection model, our findings indicate that demand factors affect the decision of the firm to undertake eco-innovations whilst these factors exhibit no impact upon the level of investments in eco-innovations. Hence, we suggest that firms initiate eco-innovations in order to satisfy the minimum customer and societal requirements, yet, increased investments in eco-innovations are stimulated by other factors such as cost savings, firms’ organisational capabilities, and stricter regulations.

This behavior implies that VCs are likely to spur invention according to an inverted U-shape over time. We empirically examine whether patent trajectories are consistent with this hypothesized inverted U-shape using a self-collected dataset containing 233 VC-backed firms and a large set of controls operating in Spain. We find that firms’ patenting activity increases after VC investments. This increase is substantially more pronounced the first two years following VC investments, i.e., patent trajectories follow an inverted U-shape over time. Our more demanding specifications suggest that the sharp increase in patenting right after VCs’ investments is caused by a positive treatment effect over and beyond any likely selection effect. Moreover, we defend that the increase in patenting is not just due to the fact that VCs give money so that firms can patent pre-VC inventions, but also to the fact that VCs fund the development of inventions."}, {"e:volume": "41", "e:author": ["Mario I.

Using a panel dataset of over 70 countries, we find that patent protection is an important determinant of innovation and that patentable innovations contribute to economic growth in developed countries, but not in developing. Instead, in developing economies, a minor form of intellectual property rights (IPRs) – namely utility models – is conducive to innovation and growth, controlling for other factors. Using Korean firm level data as a case study, we find that utility model innovations contribute to firm performance when firms are technologically lagging and that those minor innovations can be a learning device and thus a stepping stone for developing more patentable inventions later on. Upon reaching higher levels of technological capabilities, firms become more reliant upon patents and less on utility models. Thus the lesson here is that patent protection enhances innovation and economic growth in countries where the capacity to conduct innovative research exists. Where this capacity is weaker, a system that provides incentives to conduct minor, incremental inventions is more conducive to growth.

On an ad hoc basis, technological decisions are also affected by other factors, namely attitudes toward risk, politics, and (lack of) established standards. We reveal how a schedule-driven project framing creates an underlying boundary condition that constrains the longitudinal process of building a ‘whole collective’ with capacity to absorb new technologies. The innovation potential of mega projects is thus subjected to a fundamental, unifying tension: on the one hand, they offer a one-off opportunity to invest in cutting-edge technologies and innovate socio-technical systems; on the other hand, project stakeholders have limited time to develop capacity to absorb novel technologies and negotiate differences on assessments of profitability and risk.

We analyze the universe of peer-reviewed scientific articles retracted from the biomedical literature between 1972–2006 and comparing with a matched control sample in order to identify the correlates, timing, and causal impact of scientific retractions. This effort provides insight into the workings of a distributed, peer-based system for the governance of validity in scientific knowledge. Our findings suggest that attention is a key predictor of retraction – retracted articles arise most frequently among highly-cited articles. The retraction system is expeditious in uncovering knowledge that is ever determined to be false (the mean time to retraction is less than two years) and democratic (retraction is not systematically affected by author prominence). Lastly, retraction causes an immediate, severe, and long-lived decline in future citations.

It follows from the theory that such studies would need to focus more on the knowledge level than on the artifact level, raising questions on how to operationalize such phenomena. This study aims to fill this gap by applying network-based methodologies to knowledge networks, represented here by patents and patent citations. The rich technological history of telecommunications switches shows how engineers in the post-war period were confronted with huge challenges to meet drastically changing demands. This historical background is a starting point for an in-depth analysis of patents, in search of information about technological direction, technical bottlenecks, and engineering heuristics.

During the last 38 years, Portugal shows the highest growth rate in both indicators. We explore the temporal evolution of the co-authorship patterns within a sample of 12 Iberoamerican countries (responsible for 98% of the total regional publications between 1973 and 2010) with a group of 46 other different nations. We show that the scientific co-authorship among countries follows a power-law and behaves as a self-organizing scale-free network, where each country appears as a node and each co-publication as a link. We develop a mathematical model to study the temporal evolution of co-authorship networks, based on a preferential attachment strategy and we show that the number of co-publications among countries grows quadraticly against time. We empirically determine the quadratic growth constants for 352 different co-authorship networks within the period 1973–2006. We corroborate that the connectivity of Iberoamerican countries with larger scientific networks (hubs) is growing faster than that of other less connected countries. We determine the dates, t0, at which the co-authorship connectivities trigger the self-organizing scale-free network for each of the 352 cases. We find that the latter follows a normal distribution around year 1981.4±2.2 and we connect this effect with a brain-drain process generated during the previous decade. We show how the number of co-publications Pki(t) between country k and country i, against the coupling growth-coefficients aki, follows a power-law mathematical relation.

The IPR take up trends in these two countries are analyzed in detail, highlighting the structure of patent and trademark demand since 1990.

The insight reached finds that should both China and India sustain their current IPR growth rates, they will be able to catch up with the most advanced economies within the time span of a few decades."}, {"e:volume": "41", "e:author": ["Mei-Chih Hu"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311002083", "e:keyword": ["TFT-LCD", "Flat panel display", "Innovation capability", "Japan", "Korea", "Taiwan"], "e:pages": "541-555", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311002083", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Technological innovation capabilities in the thin film transistor-liquid crystal display industries of Japan, Korea, and Taiwan", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "The study described herein uses US Patent and Trademark Office data to assess variations in technological innovation capabilities, and their influence on market performance, among leading TFT-LCD producers in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.

The results also show that latecomers sought to expand production by selecting certain technological fields, but that they exploited these fields in different ways. Specifically, Korean conglomerates increased their scale of technology in order to improve their technological positions, while Taiwanese producers pursued innovations that strengthened their technological efficiency. While Japanese firms led the way in terms of both technology and market share during the 1990s, they then evolved to become merely technological leaders from 2000 onwards.

The present paper investigates the role played by personal relationships within networks, addressing the following research questions: how do different types of relationships existing in a network of SMEs favour the development of economic activities?

Innovation systems approaches stress the importance of improving innovation capabilities of firms and the institutional settings to support them, but they are less suited for dealing with the strategic challenges of transforming systems of innovation, production and consumption, and thus with long-term challenges such as climate change or resource depletion. It is therefore suggested to consider insights from transition studies more prominently in a policy framework that is based on the innovation systems approach and the associated notion of ‘failures’.

Our analysis identifies effective protection as having three properties in wider transition processes: shielding, nurturing and empowerment. Empowerment is considered the least developed in current niche literature. It can be understood as either processes that make niche innovations competitive within unchanged selection environments (fit-and-conform) or as processes that contribute to changes in mainstream selection environments in ways favourable to a path-breaking niche innovation (stretch-and-transform). Adopting a more constructivist perspective, we subsequently argue that analysis of these properties needs to be complemented with particular attention for the politics involved in their construction. Attention to empowerment confirms the view that niche actors need to link to wider processes of social change, and suggests how this arises.

Taking into account China's substantial regional variations in economic development, innovation capacity, and knowledge productivity, such notions as regional innovation system (RIS) and local innovative milieu may become more relevant to the study on relationships between China and its inward R&amp;D internationalization. Therefore, the key issue for this paper is what locational advantages of an RIS within a host country affect the network linkages and networking strategy of multinational corporations’ (MNCs’) offshore R&amp;D units. The paper aims to enrich the current understanding of R&amp;D internationalization in several ways. First, the paper attempts to examine the R&amp;D networking underlying R&amp;D internationalization by Taiwan-based firms in China, with particular reference to the sub-national level inside China. Second, the paper tries to establish a link between the literature of R&amp;D internationalization and that of RIS, with a modified version of Dunning's eclectic paradigm. Efforts are made to map the relationship between foreign subsidiaries’ local R&amp;D networks and their host RISs inside China. Third, the paper takes advantage of a government databank to adopt a quantitative approach, the Seemingly Unrelated Bivariate Probit Regression model, with foreign subsidiaries as the unit of analysis, to highlight the role played by some aspects of the RIS in determining the local R&amp;D networking of Taiwanese subsidiaries in China. Our evident shows that MNCs’ offshore R&amp;D units that purse home-based technology exploitation strategy, the mainstream strategy regarding the developing host country, tend to be located in a host region with a strong knowledge application and exploitation subsystem, while an RIS with a strong knowledge generation and diffusion subsystem, within such a developing country as China, may induce MNCs’ local R&amp;D units to pursue home-base technology augmenting strategy. On balance, not only the location choice but also the local R&amp;D linkages of MNCs’ offshore subsidiaries are related to appropriate fits between the RIS and the subsidiaries’ innovation network inside the host country."}, {"e:volume": "41", "e:author": ["John Hagedoorn", "Ning Wang"], "e:issue": "6", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312000558", "e:keyword": ["Complementarity", "Substitutability", "Internal R&amp", "D", "External R&amp", "D", "Innovative output", "Pharmaceutical industry", "Biotechnology patents"], "e:pages": "1072-1083", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312000558", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Is there complementarity or substitutability between internal and external R&amp;D strategies?", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "The various strands of extant empirical research are inconclusive about the complementarity or substitutability between different innovation mechanisms, such as internal and external R&amp;D.

The results from our study indicate that the level of in-house R&amp;D investments, which is characterized by decreasing marginal returns, is a contingency variable that critically influences the association between internal and external R&amp;D strategies.

However, transition analyses have often neglected where transitions take place, and the spatial configurations and dynamics of the networks within which transitions evolve. A more explicit spatial perspective on sustainability transitions contributes to the extant transitions literature in three ways. Firstly it provides a contextualization on the limited territorial sensitivity of existing literature. Secondly, it explicitly acknowledges and investigates diversity in transition processes, which follows from a ‘natural’ variety in institutional conditions, networks, actor strategies and resources across space. Thirdly, it encompasses not only greater emphasis but also an opportunity to connect to a body of literature geared to understanding the international, trans-local nature of transition dynamics. Concerned with the prevalent lack of attention for the spatial dimensions of sustainability transitions in most studies, this paper seeks to unpick and make explicit sustainability transition geographies from the vantage point of economic geography. The paper argues that there are two interrelated problems requiring attention: the institutional embeddedness of socio-technical development processes within specific territorial spaces, and an explicit multi-scalar conception of socio-technical trajectories.

This conceptual model is tested in the context of public hospital services in England.

Findings also suggest that specialist hospitals relying on a continuous stream of new products, services and processes to meet their strategic aspirations are better positioned to sustain science-based innovative search activities than their generalist counterparts. Similarly, results uncover a positive association between the availability of financial slack and hospitals’ ability to continuously engage in superior levels of science-based innovative search.

Employing the analytic categories of “description” and “enactment,” and distinguishing between “indicators” and “pathways,” I show how different measures reflect different activities and learning processes, and how they dramatically alter perceptions of active individuals, organizational reach, and timing and sequencing of activities. Building on these findings, I present a more complete model of university research production and diffusion, I discuss how alternative measures challenge certain assumptions in the literature, and I suggest concrete policy initiatives to improve our measurement and assessment of university research."}, {"e:volume": "41", "e:author": ["Brett Anitra Gilbert"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311002216", "e:keyword": ["Creative destruction", "Technological discontinuities", "Geographic clusters", "Political economy"], "e:pages": "734-742", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311002216", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Creative destruction: Identifying its geographic origins", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "The fate of regions and industries are often intertwined.

Although the concept of innovation efficiency is a simplification of the innovation process, it may be a useful tool for guiding policy decisions. We subsequently use a second-step partial least squares regression (PLSR) to examine the effects of policy-based institutional environment on innovation efficiency, considering statistical problems such as multicollinearity, small datasets and a small number of distribution assumptions. The hybrid two-step analytical procedure is used to consider 22 OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries. A significant rank difference, which indicates a non-coordinated relationship between upstream R&amp;D (research and development) efficiency and downstream commercialization efficiency, is identified for most countries. The evidence also indicates that the overall innovation efficiency of an NIS is mainly subject to downstream commercial efficiency performance and that improving commercial efficiency should thus be a primary consideration in future innovation policy-making in most OECD countries. Finally, the results obtained using PLSR show that the various factors chosen to represent the embedded policy-based institutional environment have a significant influence on the efficiency performance of the two individual component processes, confirming the impact of public policy interventions undertaken by the government on the innovation performance of NISs.

To fill this gap, we investigate the effect of the triple helix system and habitat on birth and death rates of U.S. firms at the state level. As expected, we find that industrial R&amp;D expenditure plays an important role in promoting regional firm birth. However, university and government R&amp;D also generate a synergistic effect that indirectly influences regional firm birth rates. In addition, we find that the synergy between university and industrial R&amp;D enhances the sustainability of firms, while the interactions between (1) university and government R&amp;D and (2) government and industrial R&amp;D are associated with an increase in firm death. Other factors linked to more favorable conditions for firm formation include higher educational attainment in a region, lower tax rate, and habitat factors affecting quality of life, such as lower housing prices and higher rates of health insurance coverage. In regions with high entrepreneurial activity, we find positive synergistic effects of the interactions between (1) university and government R&amp;D and (2) university and industrial R&amp;D on firm birth rate, suggesting that university R&amp;D plays an important role as an ‘entrepreneurial mediator’ among the three spheres in the triple helix system.

This is illustrated for a set of low-carbon energy technologies that were identified as key for meeting Europe's long-term energy and climate objectives by the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan. The paper finds that the aggregated R&amp;D investments dedicated to these technologies amounted to €3.3billion in the EU in 2007, including public funding from European Union Member States and at EU-level, and industrial research activities from companies with headquarters registered in the EU. The results allow conclusions on the European energy research policy to be drawn, such as the dominance of industrial funds, and have provided significant input to the European policy making in this field. The paper ends with suggestions on how to further enhance the accuracy of the approach and how to widen its application to other sectors."}, {"e:volume": "41", "e:author": ["Andrew A.

Based on these incentive structures, we hypothesise that the claims of essential patents are amended more often than those of comparable patents. Additionally, we argue that applicants have incentives to delay the grant decision. As a result, essential patents are hypothesised to have longer pendency times than comparable patents. This implies more possibilities for applicants to exploit the flexibility within the patent application process to amend the claims of pending patent applications. For empiric validation, we use procedural patent data from the European patent application process. We adopt a one-to-one matching approach, pairing essential patents in telecommunications with control patents on the matching criteria of technology class, filing date and applicant name. Additionally, we compare these essentials with patents from companies that do not hold standards-relevant patents. We detect higher numbers of claims and amendments to claims as well as other relevant characteristics for the essential patents. Using survival analysis, we show that the higher numbers of amendments and claims and the higher share of X references are responsible for higher pendency times, since they significantly decrease hazard rates in the survival analysis.

At both the country and industry level, it creates awareness and access to new knowledge therefore providing economic incentives or penalisations for evaluating certification. This effect competes and complements the deliberated efforts and policies in explaining diffusion of certification.

They are often characterized as relying on low-quality patents, an assessment that, if correct, would imply that eradicating such patents would effectively terminate the NPE business. In this paper, we shed light on this issue by empirically analyzing NPEs’ patent acquisitions. We draw on a unique dataset of 392 U.S. patents acquired by known NPEs between 1997 and 2006, which we compare to three control groups of 784 U.S. patents each acquired by practicing firms. We find that the probability that a traded patent is acquired by an NPE rather than a practicing entity increases in the scope of the patent, in the patent density of its technology field and, contrary to common belief, in the patent's technological quality. Our findings thus support recent theoretical propositions about the NPE business model, showing that NPEs procure patents that are more likely to be infringed, harder to substitute for, and robust to legal challenges. The fact that NPE-acquired patents are of significantly higher quality than those in the control group implies that elevating minimum patent quality will not put an end to the NPE business, and suggests that this business is sustainable in the long run. We furthermore discuss the fact that NPEs are peculiar players on markets for technology insofar as they are solely interested in the exclusion right, not in the underlying knowledge. We posit that transactions involving NPEs may only be the tip of the iceberg of “patent-only” transactions, a conjecture with strong implications for the efficiency and the study of markets for technologies.

The results further show that the different grants are not complementary, i.e. scientists specialise in certain grants.

We address this gap by shedding light on the question how the innovation effects of domestic and foreign demand-pull and technology-push policies differ. Using solar photovoltaic modules as a research case we conduct a panel analysis on 15 OECD countries over the period 1978 through 2005 with patent data. Three key findings emerged: First, our analyses find no evidence that domestic technology-push policies foster innovative output outside of national borders. Second, both domestic and foreign demand-pull policies trigger innovative output in a country. Third, we detect no indication that market growth induced by domestic demand-pull policies leads to more national innovative output than market growth induced by foreign demand-pull policies. Consequently, demand-pull policies create significant country-level innovation spillovers, which could disincentivize national policymakers to engage in domestic market creation.

However, our data also demonstrate that MO inertia is idiosyncratic in that it stems from distinct MO characteristics, particularly a culture of consensus and an elitist identity, which in turn reinforce MOs’ lack of champions, limited environmental intimacy, and protracted decision-making. We also find that inertial forces in MOs are partially offset by various enablers of change that are either anchored in a given MO's constitution or embedded in its routines.

The private clean innovation machine, left on its own, is not up to this challenge. It needs government intervention to address the combination of environmental and knowledge externalities and overcome path dependencies. The firm level evidence presented in this contribution on the motives of private sector firms for introducing clean innovations from the latest Flemish CIS eco-innovation survey confirms that firms are responsive to eco-policy demand interventions. At the same time, the high importance of demand pull from customers and voluntary codes of conduct or voluntary sector agreements as drivers for introducing clean innovations, is a reminder of the internal strength of the private innovation machine, which governments need to leverage.

We also consider the benefits of a “dynamic strategy”, i.e., the approach to change features of survey contacts over the survey life cycle. We explore these effects experimentally using a career survey sent to over 24,000 junior scientists and engineers. The results show that personalization increases the odds of responding by as much as 48%, while lottery incentives with a high payoff and a low chance of winning increase the odds of responding by 30%. Furthermore, changing the wording of reminders over the survey life cycle increases the odds of a response by over 30%, while changes in contact timing (day of the week or hour of the day) did not have significant benefits.

Although business models do not warrant formal intellectual property (IP) protection, their constituent components (e.g. business methods and brands) often do. Drawing on the profiting-from-innovation framework, we find that formal and strategic IP protection methods play complementary roles. Initially, formal IP rights are used primarily as a defensive strategy, as vehicles for packaging and trading know-how, and most importantly as a means of “buying time” to build specialised complementary assets. Long-term competitiveness, however, depends on whether the innovator builds a strong position in specialised complementary assets and is capable of reconfiguring them over time in line with changes in the market environment.

We find that an increase in cigarette tax levels had no discernible impact on the industry-wide rate of invention in smoking cessation products.

The framework can facilitate the structured planning, conducting and evaluating of management activities for large interdisciplinary projects. It can be a practical tool for project leaders and scientific administrators, but may also help to facilitate further academic discussion on interdisciplinary research management.

In quantitative terms, this is a yet unanswered question. The current study fills this major gap in the literature on industry studies. By taking a sectoral system perspective, this study is able to highlight the magnitude of innovation by intermediate user firms in a high technology sector: semiconductors. Using a combination of different datasets – patents, co-patents, R&amp;D alliances and new ventures in semiconductors – this study proposes a novel quantitative approach to assessing the magnitude of innovative activity by user firms. The study reaches several findings. First, the magnitude of innovation by user firms, as measured by patents, is high in both absolute and relative terms compared to semiconductor firms and other actors in the sector. Second, the distribution of patents among different demand segments is highly uneven. Third, innovative user firms are highly heterogeneous in terms of size, diversification and vertical integration. Fourth, collaboration in R&amp;D and co-patenting activity in semiconductors take place not just between user firms and semiconductor firms, but also among user firms themselves. Fifth, innovative user firms are quite active in entrepreneurial activity in semiconductors and their new ventures, on average, survive longer than spin-offs or other start-ups."}, {"e:volume": "42", "e:author": ["Shu-Chin Huang"], "e:issue": "1", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312001278", "e:keyword": ["Research and development", "Foreign direct investment", "Information and electronics", "Technology policy", "Long-term investment"], "e:pages": "245-260", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312001278", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Capital outflow and R&amp;D investment in the parent firm", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "Outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) from emerging countries to relatively low-wage countries has raised important questions about its impact on domestic technological development because of the small gap in terms of a technological lead.

These hypotheses are tested using available data from Taiwanese information and electronics firms for 1993–2008. The findings are that the R&amp;D growth is not only relevant to conventional factors, such as the knowledge stock, demand factors and institutions, but is also importantly explained by the firm's long-term investment in the home country and abroad, and the industry's OFDI and IFDI. This paper also shows that home R&amp;D growth is negatively relevant to the wage gap between the home and the host country, and changes in OFDI policies can significantly affect the R&amp;D growth.

Furthermore, formal and informal innovation protection mechanisms should not be seen as mutually exclusive, since several are employed jointly. Secrecy and lead time advantages over competitors are often combined with IPRs. Yet, a number of small firms use complexity of design as a substitute to patent protection. The relevance of each appropriation mode depends on such factors as the degree of innovativeness, the type of innovator and the general market environment, which implies that the importance of IPRs is limited to specific business contexts. Furthermore, regarding firm performance as measured by innovation effects, some evidence is found that choosing both IPR- and non-IPR-oriented appropriation strategies can prove to be effective in achieving company goals.

Finally, we estimate the macroeconomic impact of these grants in terms of R&amp;D employment. We conclude that (i) the policies are not subject to full crowding out, (ii) the treatments effects are stable over time, (iii) receiving subsidies from other sources in addition to the program under evaluation does not decrease the estimated treatment effect, and (iv) receiving grants repeatedly does not decrease the magnitude of the treatment effects either.

This article focuses – with the help of a survey of 136 research units worldwide supplemented by a number of case-studies – on the factors that influence the extent to which local mobilization efforts succeed. The research shows that universities provide the most fertile grounds for such research units, and that external support and support from the leadership of the university are important factors behind their establishment. In the longer term, however, attracting core (basic) finance is essential for the unit's ability to maintain cognitive control of its research program.

The field is increasingly formalized and anchored in a small set of intellectual bases, although there are also some signs of differentiation and fragmentation. Using an institutional theory perspective and drawing upon my experience in the field, I explore six forces creating the institutional infrastructure. First, social networking mechanisms have created a social structure facilitating connections between researchers. Second, publication opportunities have increased dramatically. Third, training and mentoring has moved to a collective rather than individual apprenticeship model. Fourth, major foundations and many other smaller funding sources have changed the scale and scope of entrepreneurship research. Fifth, new mechanisms have emerged that recognize and reward individual scholarship, reinforcing the identity of entrepreneurship research as a field and attracting new scholars into it.

However, proximities in other dimensions could intervene to attenuate that negative effect. The most salient finding is that central Ministries and local governments are two sources of institutional force that could impose or encourage university–industry collaborations without considering the geographic distance between them. The vertical and horizontal institutional proximities engendered by subordination to the same administrative unit significantly enhance the probability of collaboration, and those effects are more significant when the distance increases.

To this end, we conduct and analyze a series of discrete choice experiments with 319 managers within a leading international communications equipment company. As a result, we find the number of product-related patents to be complementary to the overall size of the patent portfolio and complementary—with an interesting exception—to contributions to open standards.

Evidence from 24 research groups in science and engineering departments in universities and public research organizations in Brazil provides preliminary empirical corroboration for the proposal that the contexts and role of university–industry collaboration in mature and emergent industries are diverse. Knowledge networks are underdeveloped in emerging industries, and public support for research projects is dispersed. This means that university research and development projects with firms in emergent industries are less likely than projects with firms in mature industries to be the result of academic initiatives and public calls for research projects, or to be wholly financed by major public research sponsors.

The early literature on the relocation of the most highly trained individuals from a developing nation to a developed nation viewed the phenomena as a “brain drain.” Since the 1990s, a new strand of thinking has suggested that for developing nations this was actually a positive phenomenon; as these expatriates studied and then worked abroad, they absorbed technical expertise, managerial, and entrepreneurial skills. These theories stipulated that these expatriates then returned home, and ignited a virtuous circle of technological entrepreneurship leading to rapid economic development. Much of this literature gives returnees a critical role in the home country's take-off period of the local information and communications technology (ICT) industry. This interpretative essay examines the evidence for three of the most prominent East Asian economic success stories – Taiwan, China and India – to determine the actual role played by returnees in their ICT industries’ growth. The key question is whether returnees were critical for the initial development period, or whether they played an important role only in the later, expansionary phase of the industry. We find, contrary to the current literature that returnees were not critical, in the initial formation of these countries’ ICT industries, but did play an active role in the secondary developmental phase after indigenous entrepreneurs and policy makers had laid the groundwork for the industry."}, {"e:volume": "42", "e:author": ["Stephan Manning"], "e:issue": "2", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312001606", "e:keyword": ["Knowledge services", "Geographic clusters", "Co-evolution", "Outsourcing", "Global value chains", "Global race for talent", "Global service delivery model", "Brain circulation", "Globalization of innovation and R&amp", "D"], "e:pages": "379-390", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312001606", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "New Silicon Valleys or a new species?

Based on prior research on clusters and services offshoring, and data from the Offshoring Research Network (ORN), major properties and contingencies of KSC growth are discussed and compared with both high-tech clusters and low-cost manufacturing clusters. Special emphasis is put on the ambivalent effect of commoditization of knowledge work on KSC growth: It is proposed that KSCs attract most client projects if service commoditization is medium, whereas higher or lower commoditization either increases global competitive pressure or lowers demand and economies of scale and scope. KSC attractiveness is further related to the perceived availability of skills at relatively low costs, and cluster connectedness with client economies through corporate networks and professional communities. Findings not only advance current debates on clusters, global services sourcing, and the geography of knowledge production, but also have important policy implications."}, {"e:volume": "42", "e:author": ["Koichiro Onishi"], "e:issue": "2", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312002090", "e:keyword": ["Employee invention", "Monetary incentive", "Patent productivity", "R&amp", "D"], "e:pages": "367-378", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312002090", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "The effects of compensation plans for employee inventions on R&amp;D productivity: New evidence from Japanese panel data", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This article reports the first results on how monetary compensation plans for employee inventions affect R&amp;D productivity, based on the notable panel data of Japanese firms.

Building on an inductive case study, this paper explores the mechanisms behind patent fencing within a novel class of drugs.

Although innovation is generally regarded as a means of improving the competitiveness of firms and their performance, this relationship has not been supported unambiguously by empirical work. This paper presents one of the first attempts to assess the drivers of the innovation process in two different institutional settings: mature market economies of Western Europe and advanced transition economies from Central and Eastern Europe. A multi-stage approach to innovation is applied to the firm level data from the fourth Community Innovation Survey (CIS4), covering some 90,000 firms. The findings reveal a positive relationship between innovation activities and productivity. Firms decide to engage in innovation and on how much to invest under pressure of competition. In making these decisions firms rely on the knowledge accumulated from previously abandoned innovations and cooperation with other firms and institutions and other members of their group. Subsidies lead to additional spending on innovation by firms but do not lead to additional innovation output. The results also show that larger firms are more likely to embark on innovation activities and invest more in innovation but innovation output decreases with firm size.

We show here that innovation in new emerging fields can occur in developing countries by diverse processes not yet discussed in the literature. We introduce the main types of actors in RM innovation, look at the interactions between users and producers, and discuss the advantages and challenges of innovating in RM that are faced by the emerging economies. We find that RM innovation in these countries is demand-driven and occurs under conditions unique to countries with lower-resources.

To shed more light on this important question, we conducted comparative case studies with a global sample of 9 firms producing solar photovoltaic (PV) modules, complemented by in-depth interviews with 16 leading PV industry experts. We propose that, on the one hand, policy-induced market growth serves as an important catalyst for innovative activity as it raises the absolute level of firm investments in technological exploration. On the other hand, however, deployment policies create an incentive for firms pursuing more mature technologies to shift their balance between exploitation and exploration toward exploitation. Firms focusing on less mature technologies cannot tap the potentials of exploitative learning to the same extent as those with more mature technologies. Therefore, stimulating strong market growth may raise the barrier to market entry for less mature technologies. We conclude that, when designing deployment policies, great care should be taken to avoid adverse effects on technological diversity and a premature lock-in into more established technologies."}, {"e:volume": "42", "e:author": ["Davide Antonioli", "Susanna Mancinelli", "Massimiliano Mazzanti"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733313000036", "e:keyword": ["Environmental innovations", "Complementarity", "HRM", "HPWP", "Training", "Innovation survey", "Manufacturing firms", "Porter hypothesis"], "e:pages": "975-988", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733313000036", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Is environmental innovation embedded within high-performance organisational changes?

Results show that sector specificity matter. The only case in which strict complementarity is observed in organisational change concerns CO2 abatement, a relatively complex type of EI, but this is true only when the sample is restricted to more polluting (and regulated) sectors. This evidence is coherent with the Porter hypothesis: complementarity-related adoption of EI is an element of organisational change in firms that are subject to more stringent environmental regulations. Nevertheless, the fact that strict complementarity is not a diffuse factor behind the adoption of all environmental innovation indeed does not come as a surprise. At this stage in the development of green strategies, the share of eco-firms is still limited, even in advanced countries that are seeking tools for a new competitiveness.

Specifically, we posit that participation in TCs that are central (low technological distance) to the company's existing product technologies and offerings will contribute to its competence-enhancing innovation whereas participation in TCs that are peripheral (high technological distance) to current technologies and offerings will contribute to its new-competence innovation.

For this purpose, we developed a theoretical framework to evaluate the “disruptive susceptibility” of value networks. Using the construct of disruptive susceptibility, we assess the potential market entry of new companies as sources of disruptive innovations and the market utilization of these innovations. We derived theoretical propositions from existing literature in the field of disruptive innovations with a focus on an ex ante analysis. Furthermore, we applied this preliminary theoretical framework using an in-depth and longitudinal case-study of the amateur photo camera market in Germany to analyze the propositions for disruptive susceptibility on a past disruptive innovation for consistency. Based on the insights of the case study, we refined our theoretical framework. Finally, the refined framework was used from an ex ante perspective to analyze the German electric car market. The results of both case studies indicate that the disruptive susceptibility of established value networks is closely related to the market and organizational maturity. Furthermore, we propose that the overshooting factor of customers might be a conditional but not an imperative factor influencing disruptive susceptibility. Our modified framework would indicate that if the overshooting of customers and other special market conditions are present simultaneously, then the disruptive susceptibility can reach a critical level, and potential disruptive innovations can be successfully introduced into an established value network. Moreover, in our framework, a high degree of disruptive susceptibility would suggest that a low-end market must be present before a disruptive innovation can successfully enter a market. Finally, we propose that the introduction of radical-sustaining innovations by the incumbents in an established value network is a good indicator for a high degree of disruptive susceptibility."}, {"e:volume": "42", "e:author": ["Christopher A.

In addition to the general benefit of allowing the use of taxonomical data and thus more accurately reflecting the theoretical complexity of any underlying phenomenon, this methodology offers a number of other benefits specific to the patent context. These include the ability to model technological space within fields, since it correctly uses USPTO subclass level data, as well as the ability to accurately analyze similarity at the patent-to-patent dyadic level, since it calculates conceptual overlaps at the lowest level of the classification taxonomy. I explore the performance of these methods in two research contexts: (1) a patent-to-patent level sample within a single technological field and (2) an organization-to-organization level sample across industries. The results show that taxonomical methods generate more meaningful distributions of similarity scores within both samples and that similarity scores calculated via taxonomical methods have a more consistent relationship with citation likelihood and number of citations.

We conclude that the differences in performance can be traced back to specialized complementary assets required for successful commercialization."}, {"e:volume": "42", "e:author": ["Teemu Makkonen"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312002296", "e:keyword": ["Economic crisis", "European Union", "Public R&amp", "D funding", "S&amp", "T budgets"], "e:pages": "817-822", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312002296", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Government science and technology budgets in times of crisis", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "Following a recent paper by Filippetti and Archibugi [Filippetti, A., Archibugi, D., 2011.

Using a panel dataset of 222 firms in biotechnology between 1990 and 2000, we show that bridging scientists have a positive and significant impact on patent performance relative to other scientists within the firm. Looking closer at bridging scientists, we draw a distinction between Pasteur bridging scientists and Edison bridging scientists, with the latter having less of an orientation towards fundamental research. We show that both types of bridging scientists complement the focal firm's R&amp;D alliances with other firms. However, Pasteur bridging scientists are substitutive with university R&amp;D alliances while Edison bridging scientists are complementary.

In the (Dutch) genomics landscape, in which such research regimes are embedded, increasingly dominant values and objectives exert pressures on researchers to collaborate with industrial partners and to valorize knowledge results. To assess how these pressures are actually taken up and transforming research regimes, a multi-level approach is developed and applied in two case studies in which regimes are characterized in terms of the identities of actors, the knowledge and products exchanged and the principles that coordinate these exchanges. We describe the dominant regime in a typical genomics research field (Alzheimer's disease) as compared to the regime in a typical clinical genetics research field (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy) and show whether and how these research regimes are transforming in response to landscape pressures. The analysis shows that the AD regime has not been transformed against the background of changing landscape expectations and that the DMD regime did change, but under the condition of maturation.

However, as of to date it remains unclear how such innovations are financed collectively under conditions characterised by extreme uncertainty. Hence we explore how financial resources within innovation networks are mobilised and allocated. This question is of particular importance to the development of system technologies that are viable only if all critical components are functional on time. We explore this issue by reviewing the development of a radically new system technology for mass manufacturing microchips in the semiconductor industry. In this industry, technological roadmaps allow actors to identify critical components that still need to be developed. These components are the so-called roadmap gaps. However, suppliers can be reluctant to develop the required components at their own expense because of the high uncertainties involved. In such cases, providing financial support to component suppliers is a central task of innovation networks. The empirical analysis shows that semiconductor manufacturers take both an individual and a collective approach to filling roadmap gaps. This study contributes to prior research on innovation networks and financial management not only by identifying and clarifying these two approaches, but also by revealing under which conditions they are used. The findings are particularly relevant to scholars interested in the innovations of complex product systems (CoPS)."}, {"e:volume": "42", "e:author": ["Yangao Xiao", "Andrew Tylecote", "Jiajia Liu"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312002600", "e:keyword": ["Late-comer firms", "Technological catch-up", "Intellectual property", "Corporate governance", "Chinese manufacturing"], "e:pages": "749-764", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312002600", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Why not greater catch-up by Chinese firms?

Much is to be gained from a better understanding of how, empirically, psychological variables and an organization's network interrelate (Burt et al., 1998; Kalish and Robins, 2006; Moch, 1980; Teigland and Wasko, 2009).

This study examines how motivation – extrinsic (expected organizational rewards, reciprocal benefits) and intrinsic (knowledge self-efficacy, enjoyment in helping others) – might explain how employees may be better connected in the full knowledge transfer network or might be engaged more in inter-unit knowledge transfer. Connectedness (closeness centrality) and inter-unit ties are well-known to contribute to knowledge transfer.

This trend has increased the interest toward product modularity as a tool to ease the integration of external sources of innovation but there is contradictory evidence concerning the benefits of modularity in inter-firm coordination in the automotive industry. Moreover, although modularity literature considers standard interfaces one of the constitutive elements of modularity and a means for easing design outsourcing, very few studies have analyzed the genesis and the micro-dynamics of the interfaces definition process. In order to fill this research gap, this paper focuses on how assemblers and suppliers define the component-vehicle interfaces in component co-development projects. This study adopts a “quasi-experimental design approach” comparing two similar vehicle component co-development projects carried out by the same first-tier supplier with two different automakers. Under the ceteris paribus conditions defined by the research design, the empirical evidence derived from the analysis of the two projects shows that, differently from what modularity theory claims: the interface definition process is neither technologically determined nor the mere result of product architectural choices; the OEMs and the supplier's capabilities, degree of vertical integration, knowledge and strategic focus drive the partitioning of the design and engineering tasks, the interfaces definition process, and the choice of the inter-firm coordination mechanisms.

Our empirical evidence suggests that researchers and strategists in laboratories experience responsibility at two levels. Firstly, they recognize responsibility as unproblematic if it relates to contexts characterized by low uncertainty of relations between action and impact. We argue that this is explainable by high congruency between the all three types of agency and the existence of strong, stable and homogenous professional identity. Secondly, responsibility is perceived as problematic and ambiguous if relations between action and impact are characterized by high uncertainty. If issues of responsibility challenge established criteria of what constitutes scientific excellence and these are no longer in the autonomous domain of agents who actively participate in the practices of science, their very professional identity becomes contested, and congruency between different types of agency is interrupted. We argue that members of research laboratories seek to develop new organizational capabilities such as collaboration with new stakeholders of science-driven innovation and learning a new discourse that enables better communication between different constituencies.

In one strand of the literature, the market failure rationale is considered as a valid although insufficient justification for policy intervention that therefore needs to be complemented by the arguments put forward by the systemic failure rationale. This perspective implicitly presents the systemic failure framework as a more general approach than the market failure perspective. On the other hand, a number of IS policy contributions explicitly reject the market failure approach and consider it a flawed argument for government intervention. In this theoretical view, the systemic failure approach is thus proposed as a more appropriate, alternative innovation policy rationale. Despite their relevance as the theoretical bases that currently underpin actual innovation policy design, an analysis of the robustness and conceptual coherence of these contrasting perspectives has not been provided so far.

This paper challenges these arguments. With detailed empirical analyses of the automotive and gas turbine industries, we demonstrate that these explanations overestimate the ability of new entrants to destroy and disrupt established industries and underestimate the capacity of incumbents to perceive the potential of new technologies and integrate them with existing capabilities. Moreover, we show how intense competition in the wake of technological discontinuities, driven entirely by incumbents, may instead result in late industry shakeouts. We develop and extend the notion of ‘creative accumulation’ as a way of conceptualizing the innovating capacity of the incumbents that appear to master such turbulence.

This study follows a two-stage empirical analysis using a sample of Spanish manufacturing firms for the period 1992–2005. By examining two inputs and two outputs of the innovation process in the first stage, we estimate technological innovation efficiency by means of an intertemporal data envelopment analysis (DEA) bootstrap and also observe the yearly efficiency changes based on a global Malmquist index.

Receipt of public subsidies by small NTBFs results in an increased investment rate and a reduced investment–cash flow sensitivity, in the immediately following year. We interpret these results as an indication of the relaxation of financial constraints. Moreover, while the increase in the investment rate does not persist in the long run, the dependence of investments on cash flow remains negligible after receipt of the first public subsidy.

The contribution of this study is to define six indicators of social capital (degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, prolific co-author count, team exploration, and publishing tenure) and investigate how these indicators interact and affect citations for publications. A total of 137 Information Systems scholars from the Social Science Citation Index database were selected to test the hypothesized relationships. The results show that betweenness centrality plays the most important role in taking advantage of non-redundant resources in a co-authorship network, thereby significantly affecting citations for publications. In addition, we found that prolific co-author count, team exploration, and publishing tenure all have indirect effects on citation count. Specifically, co-authoring with prolific scholars helps researchers develop centralities and, in turn, generate higher numbers of citations. Researchers with longer publishing tenure tend to have higher degree centrality. When they collaborate more with different scholars, they achieve more closeness and betweenness centralities, but risk being distrusted by prolific scholars and losing chances to co-author with them.

Our analysis is based on Irish plant-level panel data from manufacturing industry over the period 1994–2008. Based on instrumental variables regression models our results suggest that externalities of openness in innovation are significant and that they are positively associated with firms’ innovation performance. We find that these externality effects are unlikely to work through their effect on the spread of open innovation practices.

This analysis provides evidence that firms are more likely to adopt academic principles if they need to access scientific knowledge that is considered important for their innovation development, whereas the mere existence of collaborative links with academic institutions is not a strong determinant.

Our findings suggest that, at least in the case of the NNI, targeted government S&amp;T programs may increase the efficiency of university research, but potentially do so at a price."}, {"e:volume": "43", "e:author": ["Raghu Garud", "Joel Gehman", "Arvind Karunakaran"], "e:issue": "1", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733313001236", "e:keyword": ["Climate science policy", "Boundary work", "Scientific controversies", "Hybrid forums", "Boundary repair", "Boundary bridging"], "e:pages": "60-73", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733313001236", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Boundaries, breaches, and bridges: The case of Climategate", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "We examine the incident known as “Climategate” in which emails and other documents relating to climate scientists and their work were illegitimately accessed and posted to the Internet.

Small differences in initial departmental support from management and senior academics for gaining commercial experience and spending time exploring the commercial opportunity were seen to have a major impact upon the subsequent spin-off development path. Supported ventures gained momentum as the department helped develop entrepreneurial competencies and influenced how these competencies were developed from external actors outside the department. By contrast, a lack of departmental support for entrepreneurship severely constrained the evolution of spin-offs regardless of university level policies and practices.

Using data on over 1900 science and engineering PhD candidates about to enter the job market, we find that while some are unwilling to give up publishing at virtually any price, over one third of those most likely to seek positions in industrial research are willing to forego publishing for free. We develop a simple model of the “price” scientists assign to publishing in firms and explore potential sources of heterogeneity empirically. We find that the price of publishing increases with individuals’ preferences for various benefits from publishing such as peer recognition and contributing to society, but it decreases with their preference for money. Scientists who believe themselves to be of high ability and who train at top tier institutions have a higher price of publishing.

Making use of a rich dataset, we test and provide support for our hypotheses. In particular, we find that the propensity to invest in intangible assets increases with the firm's size, human capital, and historical intangible asset base. This points towards the existence of a cumulative process of intangible asset accumulation, which may account for most of the heterogeneity observed in the data.

This article discusses the origin of this line in the work of Arnold Toynbee and outlines its long-term influence on economic history, including contemporary debates on the question of why Europe outpaced China and India from the seventeenth century.

By analysing words co-located with innovation in Hansard, the UK's parliamentary record, both the stable and the changing uses of the word over the decades are examined. Considering the results in the light of ‘stylised facts’ in innovation policy studies reveals that use of the term innovation has increased over the period studied. It has entered a wide variety of policy domains and it has been used in an increasingly positive tone. It has been associated with both drivers and barriers to innovation, with greater emphasis on government as the driver of innovation, despite oscillations between the public and private sectors over the period.

Our results display the central role of the introduction of a logic of coordination by the EU; it created a breeding ground for a new generation of programs and, at the same time, allowed to make the integration model more flexible and acceptable to National States (as funding became only virtually integrated). Most newly created programs were characterized by largely symbolic commitments and very small budgets, while stronger commitments had to be constructed through successive steps of integration. This process was highly selective and dependent on the presence of strong interests from the research community; additional funding from the EU was critical to ensure stability of national commitments. Further, National States by large delegated to independent funding agencies the management of national participations: delegation allowed to achieve greater homogeneity among national participants, but also to decouple decisions to participate (driven by compliance to institutional pressures) from the level of resources to be committed (driven by national interests). While in the year 2000, the European Research Area (ERA) strategy of coordinating national research policies was largely an empty concept, our case study shows how in the following decade, it was filled in with specific experiences and practices, led to the redefinition of actors’ understanding of European integration and roles in European research policies and, ultimately, to the emergence of original models of integration."}, {"e:volume": "43", "e:author": ["Uwe Cantner", "Bastian Rake"], "e:issue": "2", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733313001959", "e:keyword": ["International cooperation", "Pharmaceuticals", "Research networks", "Network dynamics", "MRQAP"], "e:pages": "333-348", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733313001959", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "International research networks in pharmaceuticals: Structure and dynamics", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "Knowledge production and scientific research have become increasingly more collaborative and international, particularly in pharmaceuticals.

The TEF's theoretical logic draws on the adaptation-selection debate, which suggests that the co-evolution phenomenon can be approached from two angles. With regard to (population-level) selection theories, which highlight pressures on industries from external environments, the TEF accommodates insights from evolutionary economics, neo-institutional theory, and economic sociology. With regard to (firm-level) adaptation theories, the TEF accommodates insights from externally-oriented strategy schools (economic positioning strategy, innovation strategy, corporate political strategy, discursive strategy, issue management) and internally-oriented strategy approaches (linked to knowledge/capabilities and cognition/sensemaking).

Findings suggest that incumbent and entrepreneurial firms approach business model innovation in distinctive ways. Business model evolution shows a series of incremental changes that introduce service-based components, which were initially developed by entrepreneurial firms, to the product.

Drawing upon survey data from 218 inter-organizational projects in the German engineering industry, we propose and find empirically that potential and realized absorptive capacity have partially distinct antecedents.

The results show that patenting rates are higher in Japan, while industry funding is more common in the US. In addition, the overall level of publication secrecy is greater in Japan.

Our results suggest that Spanish firms are at a different stage, with Spain lagging behind the UK in terms of being able to benefit from R&amp;D. Thus in Spain, we find that public support is more important in promoting innovation activities; whereas linkages with international markets are more important for companies in the UK.

Using a data set of 296 robotic designs over 4 episodes of this design contest we find evidence for (a) escalating repertoire simplicity causing convergence in design configurations; and (b) hypothesized, but rarely tested, links between competition at the individual team level and technological evolution at the population level."}, {"e:volume": "43", "e:author": ["Giovanni Marin"], "e:issue": "2", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733313001947", "e:keyword": ["Patents", "CDM model", "Eco-innovation", "Crowding out"], "e:pages": "301-317", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733313001947", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Do eco-innovations harm productivity growth through crowding out?

This paper investigates ways in which contrasting processes ‘broadening out’ and ‘opening up’ TA can enhance both rigour and democratic accountability in technology policy, as well as facilitating social relevance and international cooperation. These methods allow TA to illuminate options, uncertainties and ambiguities and so inform wider political debates about how the contending questions, values and knowledges of different social interests often favour contrasting innovation pathways. In this way TA can foster both technical robustness and social legitimacy in subsequent policy-making. Drawing on three empirical case studies (at local, national and international levels), the paper discusses detailed cases and methods, where recent TA exercises have contributed to this ‘broadening out’ and ‘opening up’.

Over 20 years, the firm played different brokerage roles involving different actors at national and international levels. We find that if all brokerage roles involve transcoding functions, the ability to overcome transcoding obstacles, through the use of shared imprinting with receiving partners, could be useful for developing any brokerage role. Moreover, heterogeneity in the competences and industry experience of hired members of the management team could support the development of new brokerage roles, with differentiated effects on various brokers’ functions. If a brokerage role involves new actors with no previous allegiance, the status of the broker, signalled through network relations, can have significant impacts by indirectly communicating its superior knowledge.

This suggests that analyses carried out at the subsidiary or firm level disguise significant yet largely unexplored variation in the technological contributions made by individual members of these foreign units. To support this proposition, the paper draws upon an original data set that comprises all of the advanced foreign subsidiaries of 21 Swedish MNCs between 1893 and 2008, and follows their patenting activity in order to document the distribution of inventive activity, both across and within individual subsidiaries. The findings at the subsidiary level show that the distribution of technological activity and contribution to the overall multinational group is significantly skewed; the paper then empirically explores the assumption that a similar distribution also applies at the level of individual inventors. The results point to a pattern whereby most inventors make only occasional and limited technological contributions and, instead, more significant numbers of new technological discoveries are attributable to a select group of exceptionally inventive individuals. In the light of the results, we suggest the fruitfulness of applying a people-centric perspective on the sources of sustained competitive advantage of the MNC, the management of geographically dispersed capabilities in the multinational network, and the geographical sources of technological renewal in the MNC."}, {"e:volume": "43", "e:author": ["Lea Fuenfschilling", "Bernhard Truffer"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733313001893", "e:keyword": ["Sustainability transitions", "Multi-level perspective", "Socio-technical regime", "Institutionalization", "Institutional logics", "Australian urban water sector"], "e:pages": "772-791", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733313001893", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "The structuration of socio-technical regimes—Conceptual foundations from institutional theory", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "In recent years, socio-technical transitions literature has gained importance in addressing long-term, transformative change in various industries. In order to account for the inertia and path-dependency experienced in these sectors, the concept of the socio-technical regime has been formulated. Socio-technical regimes denote the paradigmatic core of a sector, which results from the co-evolution of institutions and technologies over time. Despite its widespread acceptance, the regime concept has repeatedly been criticized for lacking a clear operationalization. As a consequence, empirical applications tend to depict regimes as too ‘monolithic’ and ‘homogenous’, not adequately considering persistent institutional tensions and contradictions. These are however crucial for assessing transition dynamics. In this paper, we revisit two concepts from institutional theory that enable an explicit identification of socio-technical regimes and more generally a specification of the ‘semi-coherence’ of socio-technical systems. First, we will show that ‘levels of structuration’ can be conceptualized as degrees of institutionalization, thereby treating institutionalization as a variable with different effects on actors, the stability of the system and thus the potential for change. Secondly, we draw on the institutional logics approach to characterize the content of various structural elements present in a system and to trace conflicts and contradictions between them.

Second, in the spirit of the open innovation research, we concentrate on the mechanisms that OSS SMEs put in place to get access to the external resources of the OSS community. Econometric evidence on 100 European OSS SMEs shows that firm size is negatively associated to within-industry diversification, while OSS SMEs that have contributed to a larger number of OSS projects have a more diversified portfolio of software products.

Since the waiving of IPRs runs counter to common views on strategy and competition and to engrained practices, this is a non-trivial question. To address it, we conduct an empirical study in a segment of the computer component industry which traditionally has taken a rather proprietary stance. With the advent of the open source operating system Linux, firms increasingly waived their IPRs on software drivers. We trace and analyze this process using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Our results indicate that component makers went through a learning process, which led some to realize how selectively waiving IPRs may be beneficial for their business. We uncover customer demand pull as the initial trigger and observe how a positive feedback loop sets in subsequently, leading to a further increase in the use of selective revealing.

What has received relatively less attention in the literature is whether patents act as a signal that attracts investors such as venture capital firms. The handful of studies that have addressed that question has not analyzed whether the signaling function of patents decreases after the initial attraction of venture capital, as information asymmetries between investors and target firms reduce. In this study we hypothesize that patent activity has a signaling value that diminishes once information asymmetries between investors and funded firms lessen. To study our proposition we draw upon a longitudinal dataset of more than 580 U.S.-based biotechnology firms to empirically demonstrate that biotechnology firms that have submitted patent applications substantially increase the level of funding they receive for their first round of financing. In line with a reduction of information asymmetries once the initial investment has materialized, patent applications and granted patents have no effect on the growth of venture capital funds raised during the second round of financing. We conclude the study with a discussion of avenues for new research, implications for policy makers that consider the usefulness of the current patent system and with insights that can be employed by managers of firms in knowledge intensive areas such as biotechnology."}, {"e:volume": "43", "e:author": ["Massimo G.

One may thus wonder how their technology development process is influenced by the long-term expectations of their putative customers as well as the short-term requirements of capital investors? This longitudinal case study examines how the business models of three Canadian health technology spin-offs sought to address the value expectations of clinical users and capital investors, how tensions were resolved, and the impact this had on technology design. We describe the synergistic readjustments, drastic reconfiguration and mismatch between business model and technology design we observed. Our discussion highlights the mediating mechanisms by which business models and technology design influence each other, clarifying why the initial value proposition of the spin-offs was either refined or reframed.

In this context, narrative research is often seen as a qualitative social science method used to frame adaptation communication. However, this perspective neglects an important insight provided by narrative theory as applied in the cognitive sciences and other practical fields: human cognition is organized around specific narrative structures. In adaptation, this means that how we ‘story’ the environment determines how we understand and practice adaptation, how risks are defined, who is authorized as actors in the change debate, and the range of policy options considered. Furthermore, relating an experience through story-telling is already doing ‘knowledge work’, or learning. In taking narrative beyond its use as an extractive social research methodology, we argue that narrative research offers an innovative, holistic approach to a better understanding of socio-ecological systems and the improved, participatory design of local adaptation policies. Beyond producing data on local knowledge(s) and socio-cultural and affective-emotive factors influencing adaptive capacity, it can significantly inform public engagement, deliberation and learning strategies–features of systemic adaptive governance. We critically discuss narrative as both a self-reflective methodology and as a paradigmatic shift in future adaptation research and practice.

Our empirical analysis, using both a multiplicative distributed lag model and a dynamic linear feedback model, differs from previous work that examines the patents–R&amp;D relationship in three aspects. First, our estimation results exhibit direct evidence on lagged R&amp;D effects, with the first lag (t−1) of R&amp;D being significant in all distributed lag specifications. Second, a U-shaped lag structure of the patents–R&amp;D relationship is found in most estimations of the multiplicative distributed lag model, which suggests a potential long-run effect of internal R&amp;D investments on firm patenting. Finally, the results from the dynamic linear feedback model coincide with those from the multiplicative distributed lag model, indicating not only lag effects from more recent R&amp;D but also an overall long-run effect of internal R&amp;D investments in the distant past on the knowledge production or innovation process of incumbent pharmaceutical firms."}, {"e:volume": "43", "e:author": ["Wolfgang Sofka", "Edlira Shehu", "Pedro de Faria"], "e:issue": "8", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314001036", "e:keyword": ["Knowledge protection", "Multinational companies", "Patenting"], "e:pages": "1320-1333", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314001036", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Multinational subsidiary knowledge protection—Do mandates and clusters matter?", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "International knowledge spillovers, especially through multinational companies (MNCs), have recently been a major topic of academic and management debate.

In this paper, we show how complex interdependencies and the uncertain nature of technological change shape the process of targeted policy interventions in socio-technical systems. Toward this end we analyzed the evolution of the German feed-in tariff (FIT) system for solar photovoltaic power, a highly effective and widely copied policy instrument targeted at fostering the diffusion and development of renewable energy technologies. We find that the policy has been subject to a considerable amount of changes, many of which are the result of policy makers addressing specific system issues and bottlenecks. Interestingly, however, often these issues themselves were driven by unforeseen technological developments induced by previous policy interventions. We argue that the pattern of policy serving as both a solution to and a driver of technological bottlenecks shows strong similarities with what Rosenberg (1969) called ‘compulsive sequences’ in the development of technical systems.

This study performs regressions on the relationship of patent applications before IPO and the amount of money collected at the IPO, while controlling other factors that may influence IPO performance. We also attempt to account for a potential source of endogeneity problems that can arise for self-selection bias and simultaneity between the number of patent applications prior to going public and the amount of money collected at IPO. We find significant and robust positive correlations between patent applications and IPO performance. The signalling power of patenting is significantly different for US and European companies, and is related to the difficulty in obtaining a signal and its scarcity. An additional patent application prior to IPO increases IPO proceeds by about 0.507% and 1.13% for US and European companies, respectively.

These findings suggest that while shortening the length of the patent term could substantially reduce realized returns, graduated maintenance fees may not adversely affect returns, as firms would be able to identify and selectively renew the subset of high valued patents."}, {"e:volume": "43", "e:author": ["Paula Kivimaa"], "e:issue": "8", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314000390", "e:keyword": ["Innovation studies", "Sustainability transitions", "Intermediaries", "Strategic niche management"], "e:pages": "1370-1380", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314000390", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Government-affiliated intermediary organisations as actors in system-level transitions", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "The article draws from two theoretical fields, innovation intermediation and sustainability transitions, to examine the role of government-affiliated intermediary organisations in system-level transitions. The role of intermediaries working between actors – producers and users, entrepreneurs and adopters, idea generators and funders – has seldom been specifically addressed in the transitions literature. Thus, the role of intermediary organisations in enacting change in socio-technical regimes, particularly of intermediaries falling between traditional public sector and private sector actors, is of interest in this article. Empirical analyses of two Finnish organisations, Sitra and Motiva, show that government-affiliated intermediaries are likely to engage in strategic niche management processes in diverse ways, each organisation having its own distinct characteristics. The analysis also points out that to get from niches to transition, sustained systemic intermediaries are crucial in articulating new visions and expectations. Government-affiliated intermediaries may make an important contribution to sustainability transitions by initiating and managing new policy or market processes and by acting as an impartial contact point or voice for new networks of actors. While independence from public administration is likely to facilitate networking, too neutral a stance or limited temporal engagement may reduce the transition-facilitating effects."}, {"e:volume": "43", "e:author": ["John Gibson", "David McKenzie"], "e:issue": "9", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314000663", "e:keyword": ["Brain circulation", "Diasporas", "Knowledge networks", "Scientific mobility"], "e:pages": "1486-1495", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314000663", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Scientific mobility and knowledge networks in high emigration countries: Evidence from the Pacific", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This paper uses a unique survey to examine the nature and extent of knowledge flows that result from the international mobility of researchers whose initial education was in small island countries.

Using our empirical findings to inform a series of welfare estimates, we calculate benefit-to-cost ratios that the US may expect from implementing PGR in the range of 4:1–10:1. We also discover that these large social benefits result primarily from eliminating unwarranted market power in the current stock of granted patents, and much less so from litigation cost savings per se.

Parallel to this technological change there has been a sharp escalation in costs regarding the new generations of jet fighter aircraft. We estimate a measure of price for the performance and technical characteristics of these aircraft. Embodied technological change in jet fighter airframes is measured using quality-adjusted prices. Although the flyaway cost of jet fighter aircraft has soared, on average, by about 12.63% per year, the quality-adjusted aircraft cost has only risen by about 2.6% per year, a figure lower than the average observed general inflation rate for the period (around 4%).

To study this issue, we conducted an empirical investigation into the origin and types of innovations in financial services offered via mobile phones, a global, multi-billion-dollar industry in which developing economies play an important role. We used the complete list of mobile financial services, as reported by the GSM Association, and collected detailed histories of the development of the services and their innovation process. Our analysis, the first of its kind, shows that 85% of the innovations in this field originated in developing countries. We also conclude that, at least 50% of all mobile financial services were pioneered by users, approximately 45% by producers, and the remaining were jointly developed by users and producers. The main factors contributing to these innovations to occur in developing countries are the high levels of need, the existence of flexible platforms, in combination with increased access to information and communication technology. Additionally, services developed by users diffused at more than double the rate of producer-innovations. Finally, we observe that three-quarters of the innovations that originated in non-OECD countries have already diffused to OECD countries, and that the (user) innovations are therefore globally meaningful.

On the one hand, diminishing returns to specialization in a location can result in a convergence effect: the growth rate of an industry within a region may be declining in the level of economic activity of that industry. At the same time, positive spillovers across complementary economic activities can provide an impetus for agglomeration: the growth rate of an industry within a region may be increasing in the “strength” (i.e., relative presence) of related industries. Building on Porter (1998, 2003), we develop a systematic empirical framework to analyze the role of regional clusters – groups of closely related industries operating within a particular region – in the growth of regional industries. We exploit data from the US Cluster Mapping Project to examine the effects of agglomeration within regional clusters after controlling for convergence at the region-industry level. Our findings suggest that industries located in a strong cluster register higher employment and patenting growth. Regional industry growth also increases with the strength of related clusters in the region and with the strength of similar clusters in adjacent regions. We also find evidence of the complementarity between employment and innovation performance in regional clusters: both the initial employment and patenting strength of a cluster have a separate positive effect on the employment and patenting growth of the constituent industries. Finally, we find that new regional industries emerge where there is a strong cluster.

Specifically, patent citations provide insight into the originality of a discovery that has received patent protection.

The results show that the effect of network partner failure on firm survival is dependent on the strength of ties. The failure of strongly tied network partners harms developers in stable periods and benefits them in turbulent eras, while no such relation is found for weakly tied network partners. Network partner diversity positively affects firm performance in epochs of technological turbulence, while the effect plays no significant role for firm survival in stable settings.

Despite the critical role of innovation in waste reuse, innovation for waste reuse technologies has been largely overlooked in innovation studies. This paper presents the first patent study examining the innovation process for a specific waste reuse technology, to elucidate how waste evolves into a resource with a greater possibility of being used. This study specifically analyzes how innovation occurs, what drives it, and the consequences of this innovation. Coal combustion by-products (CCBs), which are solid residues generated from coal-fired utilities, are specifically examined as a test case because they have been promoted as a resource through century-long innovative efforts for use in construction, mining, and agricultural applications. Having examined more than 700 patents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office database, the results of this study show that innovation has primarily occurred: (1) to reuse CCBs, particularly fly ash, in various building, construction, and structural products; (2) by businesses, particularly those that need to use CCBs; and (3) since 1967, and the number of CCB-related patents peaked during the early 1980s and 1990s. For the drivers of innovation, this study identifies the impact of some market factors, such as cement and lime price, and institutional activities, such as the establishment of industrial associations that support CCB reuse, on patent filings. The role of regulation in innovation, however, is ambiguous with regard to CCB reuse. Although more CCBs have been used as more innovation occurs, the use of CCBs has increased with a lag, due to variation in the values of individual technologies and barriers to the implementation of technologies in the reuse market."}, {"e:volume": "43", "e:author": ["Susan Walsh Sanderson", "Kenneth L.

At times a few researchers with unorthodox research approaches made breakthroughs that greatly advanced particular technology trajectories and pushed LED research in unexpected directions. A succession of LED market niches advanced the technology and provided profits to incentivize continuing research while reducing cost and improving efficacy of LEDs. Innovating firms developed a thicket of patents and captured substantial profit, but were embroiled in extensive litigation that was ultimately resolved through cross-licensing.

Yet little research has compared the geographic incidence of these market and nonmarket channels of interaction. This paper compares the localization of knowledge flows from university inventions through market contracts (licenses) and nonmarket “spillovers” exemplified by patent citations. We find knowledge flows through market transactions to be more geographically localized than those operating through nonmarket spillovers. Moreover, the differential effects of distance on licenses and citations are most pronounced for exclusively licensed university patents. We interpret these findings as reflecting the incomplete nature of licensing contracts and the need for licensees to maintain access to inventor knowhow for many university inventions.

Using this approach, we find conditional complementarities between product and process innovations in French and UK firms and between organizational and product innovations in French firms, but no complementarities between all three forms of innovation. Using different sub-samples, we show that the presence of complementarities depends on the national context as well as on firm size and firm capabilities, which gives support to the contingency perspective."}, {"e:volume": "44", "e:author": ["Eduardo Melero", "Neus Palomeras"], "e:issue": "1", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314001176", "e:keyword": ["Teams of inventors", "Generalists", "Knowledge recombination", "Patents"], "e:pages": "154-167", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314001176", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "The Renaissance Man is not dead!

This paper argues that generalist inventors, holding a broad knowledge set, make an especially valuable contribution to innovation teams in uncertain contexts. For a given level of team knowledge variety, the presence of generalists in an innovation team enables a more effective recombination of knowledge and attenuates the typical barriers affecting team-working processes. On the other hand, the lack of specialized contributions in such teams may hamper the process of adapting each recombined component in the search for an innovative solution. Thus, we expect teams including generalists to perform better than otherwise comparable teams in contexts where there is not a well-defined path to combine knowledge and the advantage of specialized contributions plays only a secondary role. We analyze the role of generalists in teams of inventors in the electrical and electronics industry by tracking the trajectories of individual members and the performance of their teams through their patenting activity.

We use a combined quantitative–qualitative method that employs coupled time-series analyses as support for an in-depth case study.

It was found that the market for social knowledge is extensive, that a broad range of academic researchers across disciplines engage in this activity, and that applied work is becoming more of a structural component in the portfolio of many researchers. Social knowledge application was found to involve highly reflexive relationships between academic and non-academic communities that combine financial, infrastructural and intellectual resources. It was found also that both social and technical knowledge are similar as regards the scope, extent and dynamics of their application in non-academic client communities, but that most social knowledge applications occur independently of technical inputs, stimulating and supporting innovation in a wide variety of technological and non-technological contexts. The implications for policy are that policy-makers should re-examine superficial assumptions that technical knowledge is intrinsically more valuable in stimulating innovation than is social knowledge, particularly in the contemporary business environment which is oriented so substantially to consumer goods with pronounced social and cultural dimensions."}, {"e:volume": "44", "e:author": ["Hui-Lin Lin", "Yi-Chi Hsiao", "Eric S.

It applies in industries where successful entrepreneurial firms, or their technologies, are acquired by incumbents that then commercialize the innovation. To this end we analyze an innovation game between one incumbent and a large number of entrants. In the first stage, firms compete to develop innovations of high quality. They do so by choosing, at equal cost, the success probability of their R&amp;D approach, where a lower probability accompanies higher value in case of success—that is, a more radical innovation. In the second stage, successful entrants bid to be acquired by the incumbent. We assume that entrants cannot survive on their own, so being acquired amounts to a prize in a contest. We identify an equilibrium in which the incumbent performs the least radical project. Entrants pick pairwise different projects; the bigger the number of entrants, the more radical the most radical project. Generally, entrants tend to choose more radical R&amp;D approaches and generate the highest value innovation in case of success.

Both results are inconsistent with expectations. The importance of local networking and other factors in Chinese research culture may cause returnee scholars to exhibit such unexpected behaviours in collaborative propensities. Another central finding is that alumni faculty members tend to publish in journals with an average greater impact factor than non-alumni faculty.

In this sense, political, socio-cultural, and economic issues respond to particular forces: managed economy or entrepreneurial economy. In the entrepreneurial economy, the dominant production factor is knowledge capital that is the source of competitive advantage, which is complemented by entrepreneurship capital, representing the capacity to engage in and generate entrepreneurial activity. Thus, an entrepreneurial economy generates scenarios in which its members can explore and exploit economic opportunities and knowledge to promote new entrepreneurial phenomena that have not been previously visualised. In this context, the entrepreneurial university serves as a conduit of spillovers contributing to economic and social development through its multiple missions of teaching, research, and entrepreneurial activities. In particular, the outcomes of its missions are associated with the determinants of production functions (e.g. human capital, knowledge capital, social capital, and entrepreneurship capital). All these themes are still considerate potentially in the research agenda in academic entrepreneurship literature. This paper modestly tries to contribute to a better understanding of the economic impact of entrepreneurial universities’ teaching, research, and entrepreneurial activities. Taking an endogenous growth perspective, the proposed conceptual model is tested using data collected from 2005 to 2007 for 147 universities located in 74 Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics-3 (NUTS-3) regions of the United Kingdom. The results of this exploratory analysis show the positive and significant economic impact of teaching, research, and entrepreneurial activities.

Our findings reveal that sub-national institutional variations have a profound impact on the relationship between academic collaborations and firms’ innovation performance, illustrate that some established assumptions are not valid in emerging countries, such as China, and offer insights into how EMEs can enhance their innovation performance."}, {"e:volume": "44", "e:author": ["Riccardo Crescenzi", "Luisa Gagliardi", "Simona Iammarino"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314002273", "e:keyword": ["Multinational Enterprises", "Innovation", "Technological change", "Intra-industry knowledge diffusion", "Community Innovation Survey", "United Kingdom"], "e:pages": "596-609", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314002273", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Foreign multinationals and domestic innovation: Intra-industry effects and firm heterogeneity", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This paper looks at foreign Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) investing in the UK and at their impact on the innovation performance of domestic firms active in their same sector.

Applying the standard open input–output model, the paper analyzes the macroeconomic effects of R&amp;D subsidies on employment and production in the business cycle. Findings in the form of backward multipliers suggest that R&amp;D subsidies have stimulated a substantial leverage effect. Almost two thirds of the costs of R&amp;D projects are covered by the enterprises themselves. Overall, a subsidized R&amp;D program results in a production, value added and employment effect that amounts to at least twice the initial financing. Overall, the R&amp;D program counteracts the decline of GDP by 0.5% in the year 2009. In the year 2010 the effects are already procyclical since the German economy recovered quickly.

Knowledge sourcing has a positive impact on both types of EI-performance. However, a broad sourcing strategy reveals a threshold above which the propensity to introduce an EI diminishes. Cognitive constraints in processing knowledge inputs that are too diverse may explain this result. Absorptive capacity generally helps firms to turn broadly sourced external knowledge into EI.

Yet changes in institutional conditions and the importance of non-technological innovation question the accuracy and the relevance of the existing boundaries of innovation systems. These developments ask for a better understanding of how innovation systems integrate within and across different levels. Drawing on a novel combination of configurational and econometric analysis, we analyse 384 Swiss firms and identify five co-existing innovation systems: two generic innovation systems, the autarkic and the knowledge-internalisation; one regional innovation system, the protected hierarchy; and two sectoral innovation systems, the public sciences and the organised learning. The generic innovation systems entail the ‘Science, Technology and Innovation’ (STI) and the ‘Doing, Interacting and Using’ (DUI) learning modes. These systems are structurally distinct and do not integrate. In contrast, all regional and sectoral innovation systems integrate the learning modes of the generic innovation systems and complement them with idiosyncratic elements. The perspective on co-existing innovation systems that we develop here indicates the existence of two layers of innovation systems: a ‘central’ layer that hosts generic innovation systems and that constitutes the foundation for a second ‘surface' layer that hosts regional and sectoral innovation systems. We discuss the implications of layers of co-existing innovation systems for policy-makers and future research."}, {"e:volume": "44", "e:author": ["Fulvio Castellacci", "Christine Mee Lie"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315000128", "e:keyword": ["R&amp", "D tax credits", "R&amp", "D policy", "Sectors", "Meta-regression analysis"], "e:pages": "819-832", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315000128", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Do the effects of R&amp;D tax credits vary across industries?

In this paper we examine the relationships between team performance, MTM, the use of collaborative technologies (instant messaging), and work-place social networks (external advice receiving). The data collected in the R&amp;D unit of an Italian company support the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between MTM and team performance such that teams whose members are engaged simultaneously in few or many teams experience lower performance. We found that receiving advice from external sources moderated this relationship. When MTM is low or high, external advice receiving has a positive effect, while at intermediate levels of MTM it has a negative effect. Finally, the average use of instant messaging in the team also moderated the relationship such that at low levels of MTM, R&amp;D teams whose members use instant messaging intensively attain higher performance while at high levels of MTM an intense use of instant messaging is associated with lower team performance.

Based on survey data collected from engineering professors at two European universities (Politecnico di Milano, Italy: n=117; and KU Leuven, Belgium: n=70), we analyze whether the scientific yield from collaborative projects with industry depends on the degree of proactiveness, selectiveness and novelty of research topics. We observe that the scientific leverage of collaborating with industrial partners is higher when academics pursue a more proactive strategy and are selective.

We find that the regular-funded projects are on average of higher quality, as measured by the number of publications per project and the impact of these publications, than ARRA-funded projects. Moreover, compared to ARRA projects, regular projects are more likely to produce highest-impact articles and exhibit greater variance in research output. The output from regular projects also seems more closely fitting the purpose of funding. The differences in project quality are largely explained by observable attributes of the projects and research teams, suggesting that the NIH may use these attributes as cues for discerning underlying project quality. In addition, ARRA projects are more likely than regular projects to involve investigators with past grant experience. Many of these inter-group differences are specific to R01 grants, the largest funding category in the NIH.

This paper contributes to the catch-up literature by highlighting the insights that a latecomer strategy perspective can provide into catch-up in CoPS noting, in particular, differences between strategies of catch-up in the Iranian case with those of Asian electronics and complex goods in Latin America, and the reasons behind an imbalanced progress in accumulation of production capabilities and technological change capabilities. The evidence shows the importance of marketing capabilities and strategy in CoPS in order for the transition to leadership to take place.

We find that the French and German scientists that discovered GMR and their labs benefited by receiving the Nobel Prize and small licensing fees. The firm that first commercialized the technology, IBM, captured profits from selling hard disk drives and magnetic heads using GMR. Other hard disk drive and head manufacturers based in the U.S. and Japan were able to quickly assimilate the technology and catch up with IBM. France and Germany reaped limited returns due to the lack of domestic firms with the absorptive capacity to commercialize GMR. The U.S. and Japan benefited from the success of their firms in commercializing GMR, as did other countries which were part of the global value chains of those companies. Consumers and firms that incorporated hard drives in their products ultimately benefited from cheaper hard drives with greater capacity. These findings illustrate the importance of absorptive capacity at the firm and national level in capturing benefits from innovation.

Such legitimacy is crucial for attracting qualified employees and financiers. The effect of the access to human and financial capital, in turn, has long-term and substantial influence on performance, whereas the effect of the subsidy itself is marginal and short-lived. Applying a novel matching approach, we compare 130 approved applicants of a prestigious government subsidy with a control group of 154 applications rejected at the very last stage, thereby overcoming some of the selection and endogeneity biases associated with similar studies.

Highly novel ideas are subject to a higher risk of rejection by their evaluating audiences than incremental, “normal science” contributions. Yet the same audiences may deem a contribution to knowledge valuable because it is highly novel. This study develops and tests an explanation of this dual effect. It is argued that the recognition premium that highly acclaimed authors’ work enjoys disproportionately accrues to work that is consistent with the authors’ previously developed identity. Because high novelty is a salient identity marker, authors’ past recognition for highly novel work helps same authors’ new highly novel work earn positive audience valuation. It is further argued that, because recognition for novelty is partly inherited from mentors, disciples of highly acclaimed producers of novel work are more likely to have their work prized for its novelty. In contrast, the authors’ or their mentors’ recognition earned for relatively less novel work does not trigger similar spillover effects and leaves the authors vulnerable to the novelty discount.

The many discussions across research communities regarding the relative roles of combination and origination as sources of technological novelty have not provided much in the way of formal identification and quantification. By taking advantage of the technology codes used by the U.S. Patent Office to classify patents, we discretize technologies and identify four distinct sources of technological novelty. The resulting technological novelty taxonomy is then used to assess the relative importance of refining existing technologies, combining existing and new technologies, and de novo creation of technological capabilities as sources of new inventions. Our results clearly show that the process of invention has been primarily a combinatorial process accompanied by rare occurrences of technological origination.

Initially conceived on structures and interactions identified in economically advanced countries, the application of the NIS concept to developing countries has been gradual and has coincided – in the NIS literature – with a move away from overly macro-interpretations to an emphasis on micro-level interactions and processes, with much of this work questioning the nation state as the most appropriate level of analysis, as well as the emergence of certain intermediary actors thought to facilitate knowledge exchange between actors and institutions. This paper reviews the NIS literature chronologically, showing how this shift in emphasis has diminished somewhat the importance of both institutions, particularly governments, and the political processes of institutional capacity building.

This paper draws from job engagement theory and the theory of job design to develop a framework that positions solver engagement as a key determinant of creativity in online innovation contests. In particular, we propose a multidimensional perspective of solver engagement by distinguishing the simultaneous investments of a contestant’s authentic self in crowdsourcing competitions in terms of physical, cognitive and emotional energy. We argue that the more intensively and persistently engagement energies are applied the higher the creativity and quality of contributions. Further, we examine the mediating effect of solver engagement on the crowdsourcing competition design-creativity relationship. Our findings reveal that the greater the contestants’ psychological involvement when performing competition tasks the higher the creativity of their solutions.

We focus particularly on the role of niche ‘anchoring’ into multiple regimes as the mechanism through which multi-regime interaction occurs, utilising case studies in Germany, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom. Analysis suggests the birth of a new ‘fiat’ regime, oriented towards renewable electricity production. We suggest that fiat regimes, which are heavily dependent on policy supports, are often multifunctional in nature. In addition, we argue that agriculture’s inherent connection to land demonstrates one of the specific characteristics of ‘fiat regimes’: fiat regimes are constructed largely in response to policy efforts to produce or protect public goods, such as natural resources, as opposed to ‘market regimes’ based on technological developments. Findings demonstrate support for the ‘special case’ of the agriculture sector in transition processes: high degrees of policy involvement led to ‘windows of opportunity’ created largely in response to national and international policy agendas, and the multiple functions of agriculture were reflected in competition between agriculture and electricity sectors over natural resource access. As renewable energy currently represents a secondary transition in the agriculture sector, we suggest that further attention needs to be paid to the impact of fiat regime policies on secondary transition processes."}, {"e:volume": "44", "e:author": ["Floortje Alkemade", "Gaston Heimeriks", "Antoine Schoen", "Lionel Villard", "Patricia Laurens"], "e:issue": "9", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315000098", "e:keyword": ["R&amp", "D globalization", "Patents", "Home bias", "National innovation system", "Sectoral innovation system"], "e:pages": "1763-1772", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315000098", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Tracking the internationalization of multinational corporate inventive activity: national and sectoral characteristics", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This paper introduces a unique database, the Corporate Invention Board (CIB).

The results show heterogeneity in sectoral and national patterns of internationalization. These patterns have remained relatively stable over the 1993–2005 period. China is among the least internationalized countries and European countries, especially the UK and the Netherlands, are among the most internationalized countries. The largest countries in terms of patent production, such as Germany and the US, have internationalization profiles that can be very well predicted based upon their sectoral composition. Other country profiles, however, diverge significantly from the prediction based on sectoral profile. Asian countries are on average less internationalized than would be expected, whereas the European countries and Canada are more internationalized. We find that while national level indicators explain a large part of the variance observed in the ability of countries to attract R&amp;D from foreign multinationals, there are significant differences between sectors and this has large implications for the design of foreign R&amp;D and innovation policies.

Gender ratios differ by function with women most prevalent at the CFO position and are most prevalent in the biomedical industry. Using undergraduate education, as an identifier for nationality, we find that, contrary to the popular press, there are more European than Asian immigrants in the TMTs. This suggests that European immigrants are more likely to immigrate with advanced degrees, while the Asian immigrants have only Bachelor’s degrees. In the immigration literature, it has been observed that specific immigrant groups concentrate in particular occupations. To test for this effect, we study the backgrounds of all identifiable Taiwanese immigrants.

We find that overall industry convergence is increasing over time. Moreover, the rate of the increase has been greater within industry than between industries at a given industry level. However, when we cluster the dynamic patterns of industry convergence among industry pairs, the patterns are mixed, and, while some industry groups are converging over time, others are stationary.

We investigate the diversification process in 23 developed countries by means of detailed product trade data in the period 1995–2010. Our results show that relatedness is a stronger driver of diversification into new products in coordinated market economies, while liberal market economies show a higher probability to move in more unrelated industries: their overarching institutional framework gives countries more freedom to make a jump in their industrial evolution. In particular, we found that the role of relatedness as driver of diversification into new sectors is stronger in the presence of institutions that focus more on ‘non-market’ coordination in the domains of labor relations, corporate governance relations, product market relations, and inter-firm relations."}, {"e:volume": "44", "e:author": ["Daniele Rotolo", "Diana Hicks", "Ben R.

The present paper aims to fill this gap by developing a definition of ‘emerging technologies’ and linking this conceptual effort with the development of a framework for the operationalisation of technological emergence. The definition is developed by combining a basic understanding of the term and in particular the concept of ‘emergence’ with a review of key innovation studies dealing with definitional issues of technological emergence. The resulting definition identifies five attributes that feature in the emergence of novel technologies. These are: (i) radical novelty, (ii) relatively fast growth, (iii) coherence, (iv) prominent impact, and (v) uncertainty and ambiguity. The framework for operationalising emerging technologies is then elaborated on the basis of the proposed attributes. To do so, we identify and review major empirical approaches (mainly in, although not limited to, the scientometric domain) for the detection and study of emerging technologies (these include indicators and trend analysis, citation analysis, co-word analysis, overlay mapping, and combinations thereof) and elaborate on how these can be used to operationalise the different attributes of emergence."}, {"e:volume": "44", "e:author": ["Martin Hud", "Katrin Hussinger"], "e:issue": "10", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001006", "e:keyword": ["R&amp", "D", "Subsidies", "Policy evaluation", "Economic crisis", "Treatment effects"], "e:pages": "1844-1855", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001006", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "The impact of R&amp;D subsidies during the crisis", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This study investigates the impact of public R&amp;D subsidies on R&amp;D investment of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Germany during the most recent economic crisis.

First, we take stock of the incumbent evidence on the relation between cost-related and technological competition at country and sectoral level. The overall picture indeed suggests that the countries’ sectoral market shares are mainly shaped by technological factors while cost advantages/disadvantages do not seem to play any significant role. But within any sector, within any country, firms widely differ. Hence the question: does this property apply also at a micro level? Here, we first propose a heuristic model based on a generalized Polya urn process yielding such a property and, then, empirically attempt to identify the underlying dynamics at the firm level using a large panel of Italian firms, over nearly two decades. Results show that also at micro level in most sectors investments and patents correlate positively both with the probability of being an exporter and with the capacity to acquire and to increase exports, whereas labour costs show a negative effect only in some sectors.

Some structural features of knowledge and collaboration networks influence organizations’ exploitative and exploratory innovations in diverse ways. Firstly, direct ties of an organization's knowledge elements in a knowledge network have an inverted U-shaped effect on its exploitative innovation, which is not the case in exploratory innovation. Direct ties in a collaboration network have an inverted U-shaped effect on both its exploitative and exploratory innovations. Secondly, indirect ties of an organization's knowledge elements in a knowledge network affect its exploitative innovation, but not its exploratory innovation. However, indirect ties in a collaboration network affect exploratory innovation, but not exploitative innovation. Thirdly, non-redundancy among ties in a knowledge network exhibits the opposite effect, hindering exploitative innovation, but favoring exploratory innovation. By contrast, non-redundancy among ties in a collaboration network favors exploitative innovation, but shows a non-significant effect on exploratory innovation."}, {"e:volume": "45", "e:author": ["Jochen Markard", "Steffen Wirth", "Bernhard Truffer"], "e:issue": "1", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001626", "e:keyword": ["Technology legitimacy", "Technological innovation system", "Institutional change", "Biogas", "Agriculture", "Energy sector"], "e:pages": "330-344", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001626", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Institutional dynamics and technology legitimacy – A framework and a case study on biogas technology", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "Legitimacy is central for both novel and established technologies to mobilize the resources necessary for growth and survival.

Typically, knowledge produced in a technology inspires subsequent knowledge within the same technology. But knowledge spillovers across technologies can also occur, i.e., technologies can benefit from knowledge that originated in other technologies. Such spillovers support technological variety, one potential goal of technology policy. The extant literature on knowledge diffusion, however, has not been able to explain which characteristics of knowledge increase the likelihood that knowledge will remain within its own technological field or spill over to other technologies. To address this gap, in this paper we test a set of hypotheses on how the diversity of prior art and the degree of technological centrality of knowledge affect the subsequent flow of this knowledge within and across technologies. Drawing upon a comprehensive set of more than 40,000 battery patents, we show that knowledge that is based on comparably less diverse previous knowledge is more likely to be related to intra-technology knowledge flows, and less likely to be related to knowledge spillovers to other technologies. Similarly, compared to peripheral knowledge, core knowledge is more likely to go along with intra-technology knowledge flows and less likely to spill over to other technologies. These findings have important implications for the design of science, technology and innovation policy. Policy measures that encourage the development of specialized and core knowledge are likely to foster the development of stable technological trajectories, whereas measures targeted at developing diversified and peripheral knowledge more strongly contribute to technological variety."}, {"e:volume": "45", "e:author": ["Paula Kivimaa", "Florian Kern"], "e:issue": "1", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001468", "e:keyword": ["Innovation policy", "Policy mix", "Sustainability transitions", "Energy efficiency", "Motors of innovation", "Technological innovation system"], "e:pages": "205-217", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001468", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Creative destruction or mere niche support?

We argue that an area in which policy mixes are particularly important is the field of sustainability transitions. Transitions imply not only the development of disruptive innovations but also of policies aiming for wider change in socio-technical systems. We propose that ideally policy mixes for transitions include elements of ‘creative destruction’, involving both policies aiming for the ‘creation’ of new and for ‘destabilising’ the old. We develop a novel analytical framework including the two policy mix dimensions (‘creation’ and ‘destruction’) by broadening the technological innovation system functions approach, and specifically by expanding the concept of ‘motors of innovation’ to ‘motors of creative destruction’. We test this framework by analysing ‘low energy’ policy mixes in Finland and the UK. We find that both countries have diverse policy mixes to support energy efficiency and reduce energy demand with instruments to cover all functions on the creation side. Despite the demonstrated need for such policies, unsurprisingly, destabilising functions are addressed by fewer policies, but there are empirical examples of such policies in both countries. The concept of ‘motors of creative destruction’ is introduced to expand innovation and technology policy debates to go beyond policy mixes consisting of technology push and demand pull instruments, and to consider a wider range of policy instruments combined in a suitable mix which may contribute to sustainability transitions."}, {"e:volume": "45", "e:author": ["Stephen Roper", "Pietro Micheli", "James H.

However, there is insufficient evidence on the most appropriate or effective role that design could play. Previous case-based research has identified alternative roles for designers in NPD, but there is only tentative evidence over such roles’ contribution to NPD outcomes. Using data on a large sample (c. 1300) of Irish manufacturing plants we are able to examine the effectiveness of three different levels of involvement of designers in NPD and their impact on NPD novelty and success. Our analysis suggests that design is closely associated with enhanced performance regardless of the type of role it plays. However, the potential effects of involving design throughout the process appear to be much greater. The relationship between design and NPD outcomes is also strongly moderated by contextual factors; for example, its significance is only evident for organisations, which also engage in in-house R&amp;D. Also, while both small and larger plants do gain from using design as functional specialism and in some stages of the NPD process, the additional benefits of a continuous involvement of design throughout the process are only evident in larger plants. Finally, while discourse and perceptions over design's role in NPD have certainly changed over time, suggesting a much more widespread and strategic use of design, our findings provide a more static picture, showing that design engagement with the NPD process has not changed significantly over the last two decades."}, {"e:volume": "45", "e:author": ["Jungho Kim", "Chang-Yang Lee", "Yunok Cho"], "e:issue": "1", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001183", "e:keyword": ["Technological diversification", "Core-technology competence", "Firm growth", "Architectural competence"], "e:pages": "113-124", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001183", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Technological diversification, core-technology competence, and firm growth", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This paper investigates, using a unique panel dataset of Korean manufacturing firms, the relationship between technological diversification and firm growth and the conditioning role of firm-specific core-technology competence in the relationship.

However, we do not know if they avoid locations with laggards more so than locations with leaders or vice versa, thus we examine how the relative presence of each affects leaders’ location decisions. For technologically lagging firms, we argue they will prefer locations with leaders over locations with laggards. We further posit that an increasing presence of foreign firms will have a particularly detrimental effect on technologically leading domestic firms, as these lose out in the contest for talent. Contextualized in an emerging market with weak intellectual property rights protection, we examine whether these concerns about knowledge spillovers and competition for talent prompt firms to close their R&amp;D facilities or remain open. Using 5798 observations of R&amp;D laboratories in India during 2003–2011, we find that while technologically leading firms are more likely to close their R&amp;D facilities as the presence of other domestic labs increases, laggards are less likely to do so. These findings suggest concerns over knowledge spillovers are present, especially on the part of technologically leading firms. Moreover, leaders are more concerned by the presence of other leaders. Technologically lagging firms, by contrast, are less likely to close R&amp;D facilities in the face of these concerns and will prefer staying near leaders over laggards.

We found that SCT still represent a relatively low proportion of chemical technologies and that they have not stimulated, in a significant way, the emergence of new firms. However, the importance of new firms has grown in the last 20 years and their technologies seem to have a higher potential of radicalness than incumbents’ technologies. This indicates that, although incumbents’ advantage remains strong, a small group of young firms has started to weaken such advantage. Moreover, the important role played by research organizations in generating SCT may signal that technological opportunities are expanding and that some governments, in particular the US government, are committed to develop SCT.

These theoretical conjectures are tested using a dataset of all tire producers worldwide between 1985 and 1996 that combines detailed firm data on establishment, patenting, and alliance activities. The results indicate that complementarity in terms of corporate and technological diversification strategies, as well as partner characteristics (e.g., size, age, and technological capabilities) drive exploitation alliances. Moreover, firms with similar product portfolios are more likely to engage in exploitative interactions.

Recent research shows that homophilous social networks among faculty entrepreneurs constitute one such barrier, and yet few studies have investigated the specific characteristics of spinoff networks and their relationship to entrepreneurial development. This paper seeks to address this gap through a mixed-methods research design focused on the composition, contributions, and evolution of social networks among faculty entrepreneurs whose spinoffs are within various phases of entrepreneurship. Employing a knowledge-spillover conceptual lens, this study finds that social networks among early-stage academic entrepreneurs are important for spurring and supporting spinoff establishment, but if they do not evolve from their initial configuration, these networks can largely constrain subsequent stages of spinoff development. Social networks among successful spinoffs, however, evolve with the help of first-order—or boundary spanning—individuals who help socialize academic entrepreneurs to market-oriented motivations, values, and practices that they may not otherwise receive in an academic environment. Further, these individuals provide connections to other contacts who, in turn, provide additional spinoff-enabling resources and contacts. Based on these findings, a conceptual model is introduced that explains spinoff success as a function of network evolution.

In the case of U.S. optoelectronic component manufacturers for telecommunications, offshoring is associated with a decrease in innovation in the emerging technology, but an increase in all other types of patenting. The majority of inventors depart to firms outside the industry and stop work in the emerging technology. However, an important minority of emerging technology inventors at the offshoring firms go to a single onshore firm in the same industry (which gains from others’ losses and subsequently dominates this space).

We identified three legitimacy-based strategies they used: leveraging their existing sources of legitimacy, aligning their actions with established institutional rules and norms, and enacting the institutional environment to change perceptions of what is legitimate. We also found a stark contrast between the early and late entrants. The early entrants had to build an effective organizational capability and establish their own firm's legitimacy, as well as establish the legitimacy of the private Chinese solar PV firm as a viable organizational form, both domestically and abroad. Later entrants could leverage the legitimacy established by the early entrants, enabling them to more easily and quickly access external resources and become competitive.

First, it reformulates and differentiates the typology through the lens of endogenous enactment, identifying the main patterns for actors, formal institutions, and technologies. Second, it suggests that transitions may shift between pathways, depending on struggles over technology deployment and institutions. Both contributions are demonstrated with a comparative analysis of unfolding low-carbon electricity transitions in Germany and the UK between 1990–2014. The analysis shows that Germany is on a substitution pathway, enacted by new entrants deploying small-scale renewable electricity technologies (RETs), while the UK is on a transformation pathway, enacted by incumbent actors deploying large-scale RETs. Further analysis shows that the German transition has recently shifted from a ‘stretch-and-transform’ substitution pathway to a ‘fit-and-conform’ pathway, because of a fightback from utilities and altered institutions. It also shows that the UK transition moved from moderate to substantial incumbent reorientation, as government policies became stronger. Recent policy changes, however, substantially downscaled UK renewables support, which is likely to shift the transition back to weaker reorientation."}, {"e:volume": "45", "e:author": ["Mathias Beck", "Cindy Lopes-Bento", "Andrea Schenker-Wicki"], "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733316300038", "e:keyword": ["R&amp", "D subsidies", "Collaborative innovation", "Innovation performance", "Radical innovation", "Incremental innovation", "Policy evaluation", "Treatment effects"], "e:pages": "869-883", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733316300038", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Radical or incremental: Where does R&amp;D policy hit?", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This study investigates the impact and effectiveness of a public R&amp;D support policy.

We argue that the independent STI mode has a stronger effect on technological innovation, whereas the independent DUI mode has a stronger impact on non-technological innovation. In addition, in line with works on the geography of innovation, and innovation systems, we try to determine the impact of regional vs. global DUI and STI interactions on technological and non-technological innovations.

That might explain why the Silicon Valley has been successful despite of having a labour market with a strong strong hire and fire mentality. In contrast, labour market flexibility significantly reduces the likelihood of innovation in a routinised innovation regime with leading innovators and high entry barriers similar to the US automobile industry and steel districts that did not succeed.

Making a parallel with the literature about the impact of education on the educated, we discuss potential explanations behind the impact of this on-the-job learning experience. As we find that this characteristic has no impact on the spendings of the sector, we argue that this academic experience makes them more prone to introduce adequate reforms that makes the sector more attractive for top-researchers. Furthermore, we find that this result is driven by ministers with both sector-specific and electoral experience, the latter measured by a successful election at the regional or national level. This tends to show that political credibility should not be overshadowed by the importance of the sector-specific experience of ministers."}, {"e:volume": "45", "e:author": ["Davide Consoli", "Giovanni Marin", "Alberto Marzucchi", "Francesco Vona"], "e:issue": "5", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733316300208", "e:keyword": ["Skills", "Green jobs", "Task model", "Human capital"], "e:pages": "1046-1060", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733316300208", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Do green jobs differ from non-green jobs in terms of skills and human capital?", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This paper elaborates an empirical analysis of labour force characteristics that emerge as a response to the growing importance of environmental sustainability.

The development of these resources is an unfolding and interrelated process, the causal direction of which is highly ambiguous. We show the variety of paths used by science-based firms to access and develop these critical resources. The picture that emerges is that the various combinations of what we call “assisted” and “unassisted” paths combine to influence the speed of firm growth.

We extend this literature by analyzing the design hierarchy's effect on the evolution of the industry's knowledge base, using the case of wind turbine technology over the period 1973–2009. We assess the technological focus of patents along the core trajectory of knowledge generation, identified through a patent-citation network analysis, and link it to a classification of technological problems into different levels in the design hierarchy. Our analysis suggests that the evolution of an industry's knowledge base along a technological trajectory is not a unidirectional process of gradual refinement: the focus of knowledge generation shifts over time between different sub-systems in a highly sequential pattern, whose order is strongly influenced by the design hierarchy. Each of these shifts initiates the integration of new domains of industry-external knowledge into the knowledge base, thus opening windows of competitive opportunity for potential entrants with strong knowledge positions in the new focus of inventive activity.

This paper draws these strands of literature together in order to develop a discursive approach that investigates the process by which actors use language to build or erode the legitimacy of socio-technical innovations and their niches within transition episodes. Conceptualizing this process in terms of multi-dimensional discursive interactions, we adopt a discursive approach to further scrutinize: (1) the way in which actor groups depicted within the multi-level perspective struggle to frame innovations using narrative work and (2) how these narratives are formed through the ideational capacity of actors to link the content and context of an innovation. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to the case of PV diffusion in Ontario, Canada. Our findings contribute to the development of a more politically-sensitive view of transitions as well as recent work on incumbent-challenger interactions and discourse-transition crossovers. Beyond this, we corroborate and extend several observations in the transition literature, including the semi-coherent nature of the regime, the social construction of the landscape, and the prevalence of fit-and-conform orientations within niche empowerment strategies.

Those relationships were moderated by two factors: organizational productivity in late-stage technology transfer and the researcher‘s perceived role significance (i.e., in fulfilling the strategic mission of the organization). The strongest positive relationship between innovation orientation and organizational commitment emerged among researchers who perceived high role significance and worked in highly productive organizations. A negative relationship between innovation orientation and professional commitment also emerged among those individuals.

The paper describes how political commitment, rather than inherently scale-neutral crops, was central for the outcome of the Asian Green Revolution. It also highlights that while the effects of crop biology are often disregarded in adoption studies, biology significantly affected the ability of Green Revolution crop technology to benefit smallholders, and continues to do so today. Using maize and GM crops as examples, this paper suggests that GM crops in their current form have reinforced a technological trajectory established with hybrid technology and directed it away from smallholder practices and agroecologies.

Thus, modest levels of emphasis on formal appropriability mechanisms may prevent conflicts over ownership of jointly developed knowledge assets and knowledge leakages, while also avoiding the possibly negative effects of overly strict controls by legal departments on innovation collaboration.

This paper investigates the impact of the set of university rules governing the creation of spinoffs, on institutional capability to generate new ventures. Based on panel-data analysis using detailed university-level data on academic spinoffs, we identify three classes of institutionally-defined rules that can motivate faculty members to establish a spinoff company. These are: general rules and procedures; rules regulating monetary incentives; rules related to the entrepreneurial risk. We find that at least some rules pertaining to each of these three classes have some effect on spinoff creation. In particular, we find that monetary incentives play a significant role in promoting academic spinoff activity, and that overly-restrictive university rules regarding contract research have a negative effect on spinoff creation."}, {"e:volume": "45", "e:author": ["John P.

The first question concerns the risk of moral hazard: is societal actor involvement a token activity or a substantial component of the research process? The second question relates to possible adverse selection: does societal actor involvement produce the expected benefits and, if so, under which conditions? We surveyed members and project leaders of 178 projects in two transdisciplinary climate research programmes in The Netherlands. There is no reason to suspect large-scale moral hazard. Projects formally labelled as transdisciplinary have characteristics typically associated with transdisciplinarity but academic projects share those characteristics. Neither is there reason to suspect adverse selection. The archetypical properties of transdisciplinary research are associated with the expected societal benefits. An important finding is that there are different types of benefit, each of which requires its own approach. Benefit is achieved through informal involvement and a diversity of outputs, and much less by giving societal actors a prominent role or influence in the research process.

Our study explores whether inventing teams that span basic and clinical research are more effective at licensing than teams comprised of inventors from only one domain. We propose that laboratory science and clinical research represent fundamentally different research paradigms that defy a simple arithmetic of combining the skills of individuals on teams. Clinical and basic researchers inhabit distinct cultures of work that yield different, and sometimes conflicting, beliefs and approaches to problem-solving. We claim that the complexity and variability of most human medical problems limits the role of basic science in medical innovation. Instead, we argue that clinical research remains an important engine of innovation, even in a period of rapid advances in molecular and genetics sciences, and advanced analytical techniques, because clinical researchers have unique opportunities for insights that emerge from the joint activities of research and close observations of living patients. Our empirical analysis focuses on patents and licenses from two prominent Academic Medical Centers (AMCs) over a 30year period. In hazard models of licensing we find, controlling for a range of effects, that inventions by teams composed of clinical researchers (MDs) are more likely to be licensed than inventions by teams of basic scientists (PhDs), and that inventions that include both MDs and PhDs are not more likely to be licensed. This leads us to question the translational model of combining expertise to bridge different domains. We also find that the training of the team leader has an effect on licensing that is independent of team composition, lending support to our interpretation.

On the one hand, as healthcare providers, they must abide by the logic of healthcare policy, which expects health research to support improved health outcomes and high quality healthcare systems. On the other hand, as research facilities, they are beholden to the logic of innovation policy, which seeks to advance research-driven, science and technology-derived innovations, where industry is the key customer and client. At the intersection of these policy logics, the research hospital must orchestrate a range of interests that may not always coexist harmoniously. Through a detailed case study of a Canadian research hospital, we illustrate organizational efforts to hybridize healthcare and innovation logics. The need to be more ‘business like’ and the expected financial and reputational rewards encourage acceptance of a mandate for technology transfer and commercialization. As well, there is hope that the entrepreneurial turn can serve the hospital's own mission, by prioritizing the needs of patients and the organization itself as a user of its own innovations. Further, insofar as successful technology transfer and commercialization is a transformative force, it is expected to enable the research hospital to achieve its goal of translational and impactful health research.

Grounded in economic decentralization theories, the empirical method employed includes analyzing the scores on an SEI “Specialization Promotion Index” per each province alongside several analytics of invention patent data from each province in the seven SEIs newly designated by the central-level government as of 2010. The data is quantitatively analyzed according to four groups of indicators based on the following specialization-relevant concepts: comparative advantages and technological capabilities; economy size and income; technological uncertainty and lifecycles; and latecomer entry into complex technologies where knowledge is most cumulative. The analysis finds that China’s system of economic decentralization has partially worked to ensure provincial industrial policymaking is effective, whereby a notable number of provinces are seemingly pursuing SEI development strategies (in terms of SEI selection and promotion) that may enable catch-up. However, paradoxically, at the same time, the system appears to sometimes facilitate provincial SEI development strategies that are quite risky or even likely ineffective."}, {"e:volume": "45", "e:author": ["Oscar Llopis", "Pablo D’Este"], "e:issue": "8", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733316300270", "e:keyword": ["Contact with patients", "Medical innovation", "Translational research", "Institutional theory", "Beneficiary contact"], "e:pages": "1512-1523", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733316300270", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Beneficiary contact and innovation: The relation between contact with patients and medical innovation under different institutional logics", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "The recent policy agenda to enhance translational research in biomedicine emphasizes the need to promote interactions among all the actors involved in the medical innovation process.

I analyze these as distinct research paradigms that involve different epistemologies, practices, and institutional loci. I develop the claim that the complexity of biological systems means that clinical research was well adapted to medical innovation, and that the genetics/molecular biology paradigm imposed a predictive logic to search that was less effective at finding new drugs. The paper describes how drug discovery unfolds in each paradigm: in clinical research, discovery originates with observations of human subjects and proceeds through feedback-based learning, whereas in the genetics model, discovery originates with a precisely-defined molecular target; feedback from patients enters late in the process. The paper reviews the post-War institutional history that witnessed the relative decline of clinical research and the rise of genetics and molecular science in the United States bio-medical research landscape. The history provides a contextual narrative to illustrate that, in contrast to the framing of biotechnology as a Schumpeterian revolution, the adoption of biotechnology as a core drug discovery platform was propelled by institutional changes that were largely disconnected from processes of scientific or technological selection.

Additionally, the emphasis is mainly placed on supply-side determinants, while demand-side factors are neglected, particularly the relevance of the processes of structural change. Thus, using a growth model which integrates variables from both the supply side and demand side, we assess the direct and indirect effects of human capital on economic growth, including in the latter the interaction of human capital with the industrial specialization of countries. Based on dynamic panel data estimations, we found that human capital and the countries’ productive specialization dynamics are crucial factors for economic growth. Moreover, the interaction between human capital and structural change in high knowledge-intensive industries impacts significantly on economic growth. However, the sign of this effect depends on the type of country and the period of analysis. Specifically, over a longer time span (1960–2011) and for more highly developed (OECD) countries, the impact of the interaction between human capital and structural change is positive. When we also include transition and Mediterranean countries over a shorter time period (1990–2011), we find that human capital significantly and positively impacts on the countries’ economic growth but the effect of human capital via specialization in high-tech and knowledge-intensive activities is negative.

Based on this, we discuss its application as analytical framework for empirical studies analyzing the impact of the policy mix on technological change.

Moreover, four clusters following the firm-specific assumption to characterize heterogeneous compositions of the service regime are identified. The paper concludes that the service regime framework plays a major role in distinguishing specific service innovation clusters among firms and sectors.

Evidence from the inventors’ survey indicates that one third of respondents are incentivised by current royalty sharing arrangements, one third could be incentivised by higher royalty shares, and the remaining third is totally insensitive to royalty sharing. Plain regressions on university level datasets suggest that the incentive effects documented by the inventors’ survey fail to translate into increased patenting or licensing income. It would seem that inventor royalty shares are not as influential as they could be, due to the poor commercial prospects of university inventions.

However, recent research has shown that the adoption of deployment policies carries the potential of locking in the technology that is most cost-effective at the point of policy introduction, but may be inefficient in the long term. The present paper contributes to the emerging literature on the role of deployment policies in creating path-dependency and eventually technology lock-in. While previous studies focused on the relationship between lock-in and the technology-specificity of deployment policies, this paper introduces a new factor: the existence of multiple applications for a technology. We argue that this factor is highly relevant for technological lock-in and should be considered by policy makers. To support our argument, we simulate the competition among four stationary battery technologies across energy system applications in an investment simulation model. This simulation shows that the degree of competition among technologies differs strongly across applications, which corresponds with a highly varying lock-in probability. Hence, selecting applications in deployment policies very likely corresponds to selecting technologies. We discuss the implications of these results for both policy makers and for the academic debate on deployment policies and technological lock-in as well as on technology assessment and governance more generally. Based on the notion that policies can have different technology-specificity levels, we develop the idea of the application-specificity of policies and provide examples of currently enacted deployment policies that vary in terms of their technology and application specificity."}, {"e:volume": "45", "e:author": ["Jacopo Canello"], "e:issue": "10", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733316300804", "e:keyword": ["Migrant entrepreneurship", "Network", "Industrial districts", "Resilience", "Clusters", "Social capital"], "e:pages": "1953-1964", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733316300804", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Migrant entrepreneurs and local networks in industrial districts", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "Migrant firms are increasing in local manufacturing systems.

Results show the existence of agglomeration and socially-based co-operation forces. Beyond de novo spinoffs, abundant social capital in highly agglomerated regions facilitates co-operation and new firm formation, and even co-operation amongst competitors to create new firms. Socially-based networks, reinforced by agglomeration externalities, all act as learning mechanisms to build pre-entry capabilities in new ventures, complementing Klepper’s inheritance perspective.

Our study analyses how a project-based firm, ‘Global Engineering’, builds new project capabilities for digital delivery through work on three major road and railway infrastructure projects. We find that it seeks to: (1) align the project set-up with the firm’s existing capabilities; and (2) reconcile differing agendas and capabilities in collaborating firms across the project ecology. Here, aligning involves influencing the set-up of digital delivery and renegotiating that set-up during project implementation; and reconciling involves managing across multiple digital systems; accommodating and learning other firms’ software and processes; and using digital technologies to create shared identity across the firms involved in delivery. We argue that creating relative stability enables firms to use existing, and build new, project capabilities, and hence aligning and reconciling are important to project-based firms in environments where there is high interdependence across heterogeneous firms and rapid technological change. We find that building these capabilities involves both ‘economies of repetition’ and ‘economies of recombination’; the former enabling the firm to capture value by mobilizing existing resources and the latter, requiring additional work to re-combine existing and new resources. Our study thus provides insight into how project-based firms build project capabilities for the digital delivery of complex projects in order to remain competitive in their existing markets, and has broader implications for learning in the project ecologies associated with these projects."}, {"e:volume": "46", "e:author": ["John Finch", "Susi Geiger", "Emma Reid"], "e:issue": "1", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733316301275", "e:keyword": ["Regulatory capture", "Technological capture", "Precautionary principle", "Incremental innovation", "Socio-economic interaction", "Material agency"], "e:pages": "160-170", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733316301275", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "Captured by technology?

The continued circulation of such products draws attention to the heterogeneous conditions of their use and allows industry actors to accumulate evidence of the products’ polluting effects over time. We find that this agentic quality of materials – including products and sites of application – is a vital and so far largely ignored dimension in the relationship between environmental regulation and innovation. This is captured in a process we term interactive stabilization, which describes how material agency becomes a focus for interactions between regulatory and industry actors. We develop our argument through an in-depth case study of the environmental regulation of production chemistry and identify three interactive processes: formulating regulatory principles; operationalizing these principles through technical documentation and calculation; and incremental innovation as used by chemists to address clients’ varied material problems in production. We trace stabilizing and destabilizing effects across these three processes and draw particular attention to the role of uncertainty in the operationalization of precaution as a regulatory principle. We argue that this uncertainty may lead to a form of regulatory capture that we frame as technological capture.

However, neither a comprehensive theoretical assessment nor the empirical literature on wages in start-ups unambiguously predicts the existence and the direction of wage differentials between academic spin-offs and non-spin-offs.

As part of this methodological approach, we propose difference-in-differences Content Overlay Maps (“maps of science”) as a means to evaluate how program participants change their research focus over time relative to their national peers.

In line with pragmatic theories of socio-economic value and market construction, it is argued that value creation is not the result or byproduct of innovation. In contrast to traditional regulation and R&amp;D policies, which confine themselves to framing innovation, valuation policies are endogenous triggers of the transformation of a value regime. Value creation is about inquiring into new values in society, translating them into social and technological solutions and making them valuable in markets. In this perspective, pilot and demonstration (P&amp;D) projects in current transition policies can be interpreted as fundamental inceptions of new values that are not predetermined by innovation but actuated through complex processes of value co-creation in society and markets, and which engage policies as agents of change.

Prolific scientists are more likely to move, but this impulse is constrained by recent NIH funding. The quality of peer environments both near and far is an additional factor that influences mobility decisions. We also identify a significant role for family structure. Scientists appear to be unwilling to move when their children are between the ages of 14–17, and this appears to be more pronounced for mothers than fathers.

Rather, clinical trials are part of a more active process of learning that allows pharmaceutical innovations to be useful outside the laboratory. It argues secondly that product development can proceed along a number of long and costly paths before a product’s behaviour in actual practice becomes clear, which can make selecting between alternative courses of action difficult. Thus, product choice and product development need to go hand-in-hand. To consider these arguments, the paper maps out four trajectories of polio vaccine development, tracing their paths through clinical trials since the 1950s, and describes some of the defining features of testing regimes for medical innovation.

First, Japan won market leadership from Germany in the mid-1960s after commercializing the single-lens reflex (SLR) camera that replaced the previously dominant German rangefinder camera. Second, in the late-2000s, Japanese latecomer firms and a Korean firm developed Mirrorless cameras, which allowed them to capture the majority of market share from the incumbent Japanese leaders. We also examine the long period (about 60 years) between these two phases of change, during which leading Japanese firms were able to sustain their market leadership despite the digital revolution from the 1980s to 1990s.

In 2005, the Brazilian firm, Embraer, became the market leader in terms of number of regional jet deliveries. Our theoretical framework considers discontinuities in the building blocks of sectoral innovation systems as windows of opportunity for which challenger firms can devise strategic responses allowing them to assume market leadership. It also considers preconditions as necessary capabilities limiting the number of potential challenger companies. The analysis of leadership change shows that more efficient engines and technological improvements in subsystems, changing oil prices, business cycles, liberalization of air transport services, scope clauses and government interventions provided technological, demand and regulatory windows of opportunity. Launching new aircraft families (an architectural innovation), targeting the 50- and the 100–120-seat niche markets gave first Bombardier’s CRJ family and later Embraer’s E-Jet family the leadership.

It then explores why the strategy later became more difficult to implement successfully."}, {"e:volume": "46", "e:author": ["Keun Lee", "Jee-hoon Ki"], "e:issue": "2", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733316301445", "e:keyword": ["Industrial leadership", "Catch-up cycle", "Latecomer", "Window of opportunity", "Steel industry", "Incumbent trap", "Path creation"], "e:pages": "365-375", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733316301445", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "Rise of latecomers and catch-up cycles in the world steel industry", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This study analyzes the sources of changes in industrial leadership and catch-up by latecomers in the world steel industry since World War II. The shift of leadership from the United States to Japan in 1980 and the subsequent rise of Korea, with POSCO’s output surpassing that of Nippon Steel in 1998, is explained on the basis of a single theoretical framework. We rely on the neo-Schumpeterian concepts of sectoral innovation systems and windows of opportunity for latecomers in catching up with leading countries. These windows include changing generations of technologies, business cycles and demand shifts, and government regulations and other interventions. Japan realized a path-creating catch-up by taking advantage of the opportunity window associated with the emergence of new technologies. Entering as a state-owned enterprise, POSCO engaged in stage-skipping catch-up by utilizing the downturn as a window of opportunity to pay low prices for expanding its facilities and updating its technologies."}, {"e:volume": "46", "e:author": ["Fabio Landini", "Keun Lee", "Franco Malerba"], "e:issue": "2", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733316301391", "e:keyword": ["Catch-up cycles", "Leadership change", "Technology", "Shocks", "History-friendly", "Industrial dynamics", "Simulations"], "e:pages": "431-446", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733316301391", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "A history-friendly model of the successive changes in industrial leadership and the catch-up by latecomers", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "Successive changes in industrial leadership between both firms and countries (described here as catch-up cycles) have been common in several sectors. This article develops a history-friendly model to explore the role played by technological conditions in the emergence of such leadership changes. The model is inspired by two cases where the emergence of disruptively novel technology played an important role: mobile phones and semiconductors. In the baseline setting the model is able to generate the benchmark case of three cycles with two leadership changes. In particular, the simulation analysis reveals that: (a) the more disruptive the new technology and the lower the incumbents’ capabilities, the greater the shake-up of market shares between incumbents and latecomers; (b) leadership change is more likely to occur when it coincides with certain responses by the actors to the technological disruption, such as a high lock-in behaviour on the part of incumbents; and (c) a technology-driven change of industrial leadership is more likely to occur in the presence of increasing returns to technological investments. The counterfactual experiments show that different catch-up dynamics can emerge depending on the magnitude of technological disruption, the degree of lock-ins, the shape of technological landscape, and incumbents’ initial capabilities. In particular, four other types of catch-up cycle are generated – the aborted cycle, persistent leadership, return of the old leadership, and coexistence in leadership between latecomers and incumbents. Each of these cycles is identified with a specific historical case of catch-up."}, {"e:volume": "46", "e:author": ["Andrea Morrison", "Roberta Rabellotti"], "e:issue": "2", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004873331630141X", "e:keyword": ["Wine industry", "Catch up", "Emerging countries", "Trade"], "e:pages": "417-430", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004873331630141X", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "Gradual catch up and enduring leadership in the global wine industry", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "The wine industry is an extremely interesting sector from a catch -up point of view because the latecomers in the international market have changed how wine is produced, sold and consumed and, in doing so, they have challenged the positions of incumbents. Until the end of the 1980s, the European countries, and particularly France and Italy, dominated the international market for wine. Subsequently, significant changes in the market, namely decreases in consumption by traditional consuming countries, the entry of new inexperienced consumers, and the increasing importance of large distribution have threatened this supremacy. Initially, the USA and Australia and later emerging countries such as Chile and South Africa, gained increasing market shares in both exported volumes and value, at the expense of incumbents. However, some of these newcomers (e.g. Australia) have shown slower growth, opening opportunities for newer entrants such as Argentina and New Zealand. At the same time, some of the incumbents (especially Italy) have innovated, challenging the leadership of France in key markets such as the USA. In this article we investigate the different catch-up cycles in the global wine sector that occurred between the 1960s and 2010, through a detailed analysis of export volumes, values and unit prices. We address issues related to the increasing share in the global market of latecomer countries and the relative decline of the incumbents, as well as possible changes in the market leadership within these two groups."}, {"e:volume": "46", "e:author": ["Keun Lee", "Franco Malerba"], "e:issue": "2", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733316301408", "e:keyword": ["Industrial leadership", "Catch-up", "Sectoral systems", "Windows of opportunity", "Leapfrogging strategies"], "e:pages": "338-351", "e:issn": "0048-7333", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733316301408", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "Catch-up cycles and changes in industrial leadership:Windows of opportunity and responses of firms and countries in the evolution of sectoral systems", "e:journal": "Research Policy", "e:abstract": "This study proposes a framework that aims to explain why successive changes in industry leadership (called also the catch-up cycle) occur over time in a sector. In catch-up cycles, latecomer firms and countries emerge as international leaders, whereas incumbents lose their previous positions. New leaders are then dethroned by newcomers. To identify factors at the base of catch-up cycles, this article adopts a sectoral system framework and identifies windows of opportunity that may emerge during the long-run evolution of an industry. This study proposes three windows related to the specific dimensions of a sectoral system. One dimension is related to changes in knowledge and technology. The second dimension pertains to changes in demand, and the third includes changes in institutions and public policy. The combination of the opening of a window (technological, demand, or institutional/policy) and the responses of firms and other components of the sectoral system of the latecomer and incumbent countries determines changes in industrial leadership and catch-up. Sectors differ according to the type of windows that may open and the responses of firms and other components of systems. Empirical evidence of catch-up cycles is presented from six sectors, namely mobile phones, cameras, semiconductors, steel, mid-sized jets, and wines."}]
