In this research, we examine a wide range of previously unexplored heritable effects on consumer choices and judgments. Moreover, whereas prior research on heritable traits has typically employed a piecemeal approach, demonstrating each heritable trait separately, we propose an alternative way to simultaneously explore common mechanisms and links among heritable traits and behaviors. Using a classic twins study design, we find a large heritable effect on preferences for (a) compromise (but not dominating) options, (b) sure gains, (c) an upcoming feasible, dull assignment, (d) maximizing, (e) utilitarian options, and (f) certain products. Conversely, we do not find significant heritable effects regarding judgment heuristics, discounting, and other decision problems. We tentatively propose that the pattern of findings might reflect a generic heritable individual difference relating to \"prudence.\" We discuss the implications of our research with respect to the determinants of preferences and future research on heritable aspects of judgment and choice."}, {"e:author": ["Simona Botti", "Ann L.

This article investigates whether this difference in goals influences satisfaction with an outcome that was either self-chosen or externally determined. In four experiments we manipulate consumption goals, controlling for the outcomes, the option valence, and whether the externally made choice was determined by an expert or at random. Results show that the outcome of a self-made choice is more satisfying than the outcome of an externally made choice when the goal is hedonic but not when it is utilitarian. We hypothesize that this effect results from the greater perceived personal causality associated with terminally motivated activities, such as hedonic choices, relative to instrumentally motivated activities, such as utilitarian choices, and provide evidence that supports this explanation over alternative accounts."}, {"e:author": ["Kristina M.

For example, women at peak fertility (near ovulation) are attracted to different kinds of men and show increased desire to attend social gatherings. Building on the evolutionary logic behind such effects, we examined how, why, and when hormonal fluctuations associated with ovulation influenced women's product choices. In three experiments, we show that at peak fertility women nonconsciously choose products that enhance appearance (e.g., choosing sexy rather than more conservative clothing). This hormonally regulated effect appears to be driven by a desire to outdo attractive rival women. Consequently, minimizing the salience of attractive women who are potential rivals suppresses the ovulatory effect on product choice. This research provides some of the first evidence of how, why, and when consumer behavior is influenced by hormonal factors."}, {"e:author": ["Juliano Laran", "Chris Janiszewski"], "e:volume": "37", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/656576", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "967 - 983", "e:issn": "0093-5301", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1086/656576", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Work or Fun?

For instance, exposure to the retailer brand name \"Walmart,\" typically associated with saving money, reduces subsequent spending, whereas exposure to the Walmart slogan, \"Save money. Live better,\" increases it. Slogans cause reverse priming effects and brands cause priming effects because people perceive slogans, but not brands, as persuasion tactics. The reverse priming effect is driven by a nonconscious goal to correct for bias and can occur without any conscious mediation (i.e., following subliminal exposure to the word \"slogan\"). These findings provide evidence that consumer resistance to persuasion can be driven by processes that operate entirely outside conscious awareness."}, {"e:author": ["Rebecca W.

From an economic perspective, using a durable product more frequently should increase its perceived value. However, we show that perceived usage frequency relative to other consumers can influence product interest more than absolute usage frequency. In five studies, we use scale labels, advertisements, and customer reviews to invoke either a high-frequency or low-frequency norm. We show that high-frequency cues create less product interest and lower willingness to pay than low-frequency cues because consumers infer that their relative usage frequency will be lower, reducing the product's perceived fit. This effect is moderated by the consumer's perceived similarity to the standard of comparison and the consumer's own characteristics."}, {"e:author": ["Derek D. Rucker", "David Dubois", "Adam D.

Five experiments found that individuals experiencing a state of power spent more money on themselves than on others, whereas those experiencing a state of powerlessness spent more money on others than on themselves. This effect was observed using a variety of power manipulations (hierarchical roles, print advertisements, episodic recall, and mental role-playing), across spending intentions and actual dollars spent, and among college and national samples. We propose that this effect occurs because power and powerlessness affect the psychological utility of self versus others, and this in turn affects the monetary worth allocated to spending on self versus others. The research makes novel contributions to appreciating how the spending on the self versus others varies as a function of psychological states and increases our understanding of the role of power in consumer behavior."}, {"e:author": ["Anat Keinan", "Ran Kivetz"], "e:volume": "37", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/657163", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "935 - 950", "e:issn": "0093-5301", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1086/657163", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Productivity Orientation and the Consumption of Collectable Experiences", "e:journal": "Journal of Consumer Research", "e:abstract": "This research examines why consumers desire unusual and novel consumption experiences and voluntarily choose leisure activities, vacations, and celebrations that are predicted to be less pleasurable.

We argue that choices of collectable (unusual, novel, extreme) experiences lead consumers to feel productive even when they are engaging in leisure activities as they \"check off\" items on an \"experiential check list\" and build their \"experiential CV.\" A series of laboratory and field studies shows that the consumption of collectable experiences is driven and intensified by a (chronic or situational) productivity orientation."}, {"e:author": ["Niels Van de Ven", "Marcel Zeelenberg", "Rik Pieters"], "e:volume": "37", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/657239", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "984 - 998", "e:issn": "0093-5301", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1086/657239", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "The Envy Premium in Product Evaluation", "e:journal": "Journal of Consumer Research", "e:abstract": "Consumers are willing to pay a premium for products that elicit their envy.

The envy premium only emerged for a desirable product that the superior other owned (iPhone) when people experienced benign envy. Benign envy is elicited when the other's superior position is deserved, and malicious envy when it is undeserved. When people experienced malicious envy, the envy premium emerged for a desirable product that the superior other did not own (BlackBerry). This shows how benign envy places a premium on keeping up, and malicious envy on moving away from, superior others."}, {"e:author": ["Iris W. Hung", "Aparna A.

In forming size judgments, consumers integrate the actual size information from the stimuli with the semantic cue from the size label. Size labels influence not only size perception and actual consumption, they also affect perceived consumption. Size labels can also result in relative perceived size reversals, so that consumers deem a smaller package to be bigger than a larger one. Further, consumers are more likely to believe a label that professes an item to be smaller (vs. larger) in the size range associated with that item. This asymmetric effect of size labels can result in larger consumption without the consumer even being aware of it (\"guiltless gluttony\")."}]
