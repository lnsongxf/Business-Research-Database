The pain of paying in cash can curb impulsive urges to purchase such unhealthy food products. Credit card payments, in contrast, are relatively painless and weaken impulse control. Consequently, consumers are more likely to buy unhealthy food products when they pay by credit card than when they pay in cash. Results from four studies support these hypotheses. Analysis of actual shopping behavior of 1,000 households over a period of 6 months revealed that shopping baskets have a larger proportion of food items rated as impulsive and unhealthy when shoppers use credit or debit cards to pay for the purchases (study 1). Follow-up experiments (studies 2-4) show that the vice-regulation effect of cash payments is mediated by pain of payment and moderated by chronic sensitivity to pain of payment. Implications for consumer welfare and theories of impulsive consumption are discussed."}, {"e:author": ["Ying Zhang", "Jing Xu", "Zixi Jiang", "Szu-Chi Huang"], "e:volume": "38", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/657605", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "78 - 93", "e:issn": "0093-5301", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1086/657605", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Been There, Done That: The Impact of Effort Investment on Goal Value and Consumer Motivation", "e:journal": "Journal of Consumer Research", "e:abstract": "In the present article, we propose that consumers' initial effort investment in pursuing a goal may increase or decrease the value of the goal and the consumer's subsequent motivation, depending on whether the pursuit of the goal is perceived to be one's autonomous choice. When consumers perceive that the goal they pursue is adopted through an autonomous choice, the initial effort investment is experienced as reflecting the value of the goal; therefore, greater effort should increase the value of the goal as well as consumers' subsequent motivation. Conversely, if consumers perceive that the goal has been imposed on them, they experience psychological reactance that is proportional to the amount of effort that they expend in pursuing the goal; thus, they devalue the goal as they invest more effort in its pursuit and show lower subsequent motivation."}, {"e:author": ["Keith Wilcox", "Thomas Kramer", "Sankar Sen"], "e:volume": "38", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/657606", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "151 - 163", "e:issn": "0093-5301", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1086/657606", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Indulgence or Self-Control: A Dual Process Model of the Effect of Incidental Pride on Indulgent Choice", "e:journal": "Journal of Consumer Research", "e:abstract": "This research examines the largely unexamined effect of incidental pride on consumer self-control. The results demonstrate that incidental pride influences long-term goal pursuit through dual processes that result in conflicting outcomes for consumer decisions: indulgent choices when promoting a sense of achievement and virtuous choices when promoting self-awareness. A series of four experiments in the money and health domains shows that the relative weight of each process at the time of a decision determines whether incidental pride leads to more or less indulgence. We provide outcome and process support for our theory, linking pride to self-control behavior in the consumption domain, and rule out alternative explanations for our findings. Thus, the findings demonstrate that the influence of incidental pride on self-control is contingent on the cognitive and contextual factors that affect decision making."}, {"e:author": ["Allison R.

Survey and experimental results indicate that the more self-relevant a consumer-brand relationship, the more likely are anti-brand retaliatory behaviors after the relationship ends. These anti-brand behaviors are diverse: from complaining to third parties, to negative word of mouth, to illegal actions such as theft, threats, and vandalism. In contrast, post-exit consumer-brand relationships that were low in self-relevance but were high in trust, commitment, and satisfaction are less likely to result in anti-brand actions. The role of a discrete product or service failure is also explored, and results suggest that self-relevance may motivate retaliation even in the absence of a so-called critical incident. Ultimately, this research illuminates previously unexplored mechanisms--including self-conscious emotional reactions--that motivate consumer hostility and retaliation."}, {"e:author": ["Mauricio M.

It is argued that a zero attribute removes a reference point that consumers use to evaluate the size of attribute differences. As a consequence, the shift from a number to zero can make an advantage (or disadvantage) that seemed large and clear in the presence of a reference point become less clear and thus less impactful when a reference point is removed. This leads to an interesting effect, whereby an option can improve its choice share by increasing the level of an undesirable attribute from zero or decreasing the level of a desirable attribute to zero.

We investigated these questions in a sports gambling context (predictions against point spreads) believed to elicit crowd wisdom. In a season-long experiment, fans wagered over $20,000 on NFL football predictions. Contrary to the wisdom-of-crowds hypothesis, faulty intuitions led the crowd to predict \"favorites\" more than \"underdogs\" against point spreads that disadvantaged favorites, even when bettors knew that the spreads disadvantaged favorites. Moreover, the bias increased over time, a result consistent with attributions for success and failure that rewarded intuitive choosing. However, when the crowd predicted game outcomes by estimating point differentials rather than by predicting against point spreads, its predictions were unbiased and wiser."}, {"e:author": ["Sara Kim", "Ann L.

However, this prediction and its causal mechanism have never been studied experimentally. Five studies show that greater equality increases the satisfaction of those in the lowest tier of the distribution because it reduces the possession gap between what they have and what others have. However, greater equality also increases the position gains derived from status-enhancing consumption, since it allows low-tier consumers to get ahead of the higher proportion of consumers clustered in the middle tiers. As a result, greater equality reduces consumption when consumers focus on the narrower possession gap, but it increases consumption when they focus on the greater position gains (i.e., when consumption is conspicuous, social competition goals are primed, and the environment is competitive)."}, {"e:author": ["Morgan K.

We find that purchasing an identity-contrary gift for a close (vs. distant) friend who is an integral part of the self can itself cause an identity threat to the giver. Four experiments in a gift registry context show that after making an identity-contrary gift choice for a close (vs. distant) friend, givers subsequently engage in behaviors that reestablish their identity such as indicating greater identity affiliation with the threatened identity and greater likelihood to purchase identity-expressive products.

This ethnographic study of commercialized climbing expeditions on Everest provides significant evidence that participants negotiate and manage various marketplace tensions within an individual performance ideology. Our study challenges quixotic use of Turner's antistructure-structure dichotomy and extends it such that extraordinary experiences, when bought in the marketplace, can be very individualistic and competitive as opposed to being conducive to feelings of community and liminal camaraderie."}, {"e:author": ["Daniel M.

We find that although individuals differ in how confident they are in the legitimacy of their system, they do not differ in their motivation to defend the system when it is threatened. Instead, they simply adopt different methods of defense. Specifically, when an important system is (verbally) attacked, individuals who are the least confident in the legitimacy of the system seek and appreciate consumption choices that allow them to indirectly and subtly defend the system.

The Role of Emotion in Safety Product Betrayal Aversion", "e:journal": "Journal of Consumer Research", "e:abstract": "Consumers often face decisions about whether to purchase products that are intended to protect them from possible harm. However, safety products rarely provide perfect protection and sometimes \"betray\" consumers by causing the very harm they are intended to prevent.

Expanding research on betrayal aversion, this study examines the role of emotions in consumers' tendency to choose safety options that provide less overall protection in order to eliminate a very small probability of harm due to safety product betrayal. In five studies we find that betrayal aversion is reduced and safer alternatives are selected when factors that dampen the emotional response to potential betrayals are introduced or taken into account. These factors include changing the betrayal from an action to an omission (study 1), introducing positive imagery (study 2), introducing visual representations of risk (study 3), making the decision for another rather than oneself (study 4), and intuitive thinking style (study 5)."}, {"e:author": ["Ann McGill", "Laura Peracchio", "Mary Frances Luce"], "e:volume": "38", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/660110", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "ii - viii", "e:issn": "0093-5301", "e:doi": "10.1086/660110", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Solidarity of Purpose: Building an Understanding of Consumers through a Community of Scholars", "e:journal": "Journal of Consumer Research", "e:issue": "1"}]
