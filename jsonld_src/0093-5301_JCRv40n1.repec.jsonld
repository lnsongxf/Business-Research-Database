These studies, however, have given scant attention to the theoretical distinction between dominant and subordinate forms of cultural capital, with the latter affording comparatively lower conversion rates for economic, social, and symbolic capital. To redress this oversight, this article presents a multimethod investigation of middle-class men who are performing the emergent gender role of at-home fatherhood. Our analysis profiles and theoretically elaborates upon a set of capitalizing consumption practices through which at-home fathers seek to enhance the conversion rates of their acquisitions of domesticated (and subordinate) cultural capital and to build greater cultural legitimacy for their marginalized gender identity."}, {"e:author": ["Lily Lin", "Darren W.

Insights into Consumer-to-Consumer Punishment Decisions", "e:journal": "Journal of Consumer Research", "e:abstract": "Norm violations disrupt social order, and according to prior research, social order can be restored through the punishment of norm violators. Based on this conceptual framework, the current research examines a prevalent yet overlooked behavior in the consumer literature by showing that consumers play an active role in making punishment decisions. Importantly, this article highlights three factors that affect the balance in social order and thus are critical in consumer-to-consumer punishment decisions. First, when a third party in the consumption environment restores social order through punishment, consumers will refrain from punishing further (study 1). Second, punishment is mitigated when the norm violator faces an unjustified adversity, as punishment would create a further imbalance in social order (studies 2a and 2b). Third, the level of punishment required to achieve social order is reduced for a higher status norm violator (study 3). Finally, this article identifies multiple avenues for future research that build on the current work."}, {"e:author": ["Hannah H.

Building on this thesis, this research advances the specific hypothesis that affective feelings are relied on more (weighted more heavily) in judgments whose outcomes and targets are closer to the present than in those whose outcomes and targets are temporally more distant. Results from five experiments show that temporal proximity (a) amplifies the relative preference for options that are affectively superior and (b) increases the effects of incidental affect on evaluations. These effects are observed when compared to a more distant future as well as to a more distant past, and (c) they appear to be linked to a greater perceived information value of affective feelings in judgments whose outcomes and targets are closer to the present.

Online Social Networks, Self-Esteem, and Self-Control", "e:journal": "Journal of Consumer Research", "e:abstract": "Online social networks are used by hundreds of millions of people every day, but little is known about their effect on behavior. In five experiments, the authors demonstrate that social network use enhances self-esteem in users who are focused on close friends (i.e., strong ties) while browsing their social network. This momentary increase in self-esteem reduces self-control, leading those focused on strong ties to display less self-control after browsing a social network. Additionally, the authors present evidence suggesting that greater social network use is associated with a higher body mass index and higher levels of credit card debt for individuals with strong ties to their social network. This research extends previous findings by demonstrating that social networks primarily enhance self-esteem for those focused on strong ties during social network use. Additionally, this research has implications for policy makers because self-control is an important mechanism for maintaining social order and well-being."}, {"e:author": ["Didem Kurt", "J.

Participants, however, make more accurate predictions of the valuation of others in the same role when either (a) an external influence (i.e., similarity priming) or (b) their high cognitive and emotional tendency to connect with others leads to a reduction in empathy gaps.

Consequently, there is an emphasis on the influence of textual content at the expense of the everyday interpersonal viewing contexts surrounding advertising audiences. To help restore this theoretical imbalance an ethnographic study was conducted in eight Australian homes to explore the influence of everyday viewing contexts on advertising audiences. This article examines how the everyday advertising contexts of social interaction, viewing space, media technology use, and time impact consumer responses to television advertising texts. Advertising viewing behavior in the family living room is framed within broader household activity and around cultural ideas regarding family life, and can enhance consumer and family identity value. Our theoretical framework details how television advertisements, everyday viewing contexts, household discourse, and viewer practices intersect to produce processes of advertising response and engagement not explicated in previous studies of consumer behavior."}, {"e:author": ["Rod Duclos", "Echo Wen Wan", "Yuwei Jiang"], "e:volume": "40", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/668900", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "122 - 135", "e:issn": "0093-5301", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1086/668900", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Show Me the Honey! Effects of Social Exclusion on Financial Risk-Taking", "e:journal": "Journal of Consumer Research", "e:abstract": "This research examines the effects of social exclusion on a critical aspect of consumer behavior, financial decision-making. Specifically, four lab experiments and one field survey uncover how feeling isolated or ostracized causes consumers to pursue riskier but potentially more profitable financial opportunities. These daring proclivities do not appear driven by impaired affect or self-esteem. Rather, interpersonal rejection exacerbates financial risk-taking by heightening the instrumentality of money (as a substitute for popularity) to obtain benefits in life. Invariably, the quest for wealth that ensues tends to adopt a riskier but potentially more lucrative road. The article concludes by discussing the implications of its findings for behavioral research as well as for societal and individual welfare."}, {"e:author": ["Edward F.

The article situates fashion blogging as one instance of a larger phenomenon that includes online reviews and user-generated content and extends to the consumption of food and home decor as well as clothing.

Less is known about factors that influence construal level and perceived temporal distance. The present research identifies one such factor and explores the implications for persuasion. Four studies show that an independent self-view is associated with abstract representations of future events and with perceiving these events as happening in the more distant future, whereas an interdependent self-view is associated with concrete representations of future events and with perceiving these events as happening in the more proximal future. Furthermore, a match (vs. mismatch) between the temporal frame of an advertisement and the self-view of the recipient leads to systematic changes in advertisement effectiveness and product appeal. These results add to the construal level theory and the self literatures and have practical implications for advertisers."}, {"e:author": ["Marsha L.

In this research, two cross-sectional and one longitudinal studies examine the emotions evoked by products before and after purchase. High-materialism consumers consistently showed hedonic elevation in product-evoked emotions before purchase, followed by hedonic decline after purchase. Low-materialism consumers, however, did not display this pattern. Findings show that hedonic elevation appears to be due to expectations among high-materialism consumers that purchase of the desired product will transform their lives in significant and meaningful ways. Findings further indicate that satisfaction processes may partially explain the hedonic decline that follows purchase among high-materialism consumers but also suggest that for these consumers, the state of anticipating and desiring a product may be inherently more pleasurable than product ownership itself."}, {"e:author": ["Liad Weiss", "Gita V.

The present research uniquely employs categorization principles to analyze the interplay between individuals and products. It proposes that consumers classify owned (but not unowned) products as integral to their personal self (experiment 1). Consequently, consumers judge product traits (e.g., masculinity) as consistent with their own traits (assimilation) if they own the product, but as inconsistent with their own traits (contrast) if they interact with the product but do not own it, even when owning the product is nondiagnostic of its properties (e.g., following random ownership assignment; experiments 2-4). For example, less creative consumers who enter a drawing for an iPhone may judge it as less creative (assimilation) if they win the product, but as more creative (contrast) if they do not win the product.

This research explores how reactions to the three basic attributes (and their associated functions--utility, time discounting, and probability weighting) vary between the two basic evaluation modes. Nine studies, tapping diverse contexts, yield two general results: first, for all these attributes, people are more sensitive to variations near endpoints (zero magnitude, no delay, and 0% or 100% probability) than in other regions, and this differential sensitivity is more pronounced in SE than in JE. Second, when faced with options involving a trade-off between magnitude and time (delay) or between magnitude and probability (risk), people are both more delay averse and more risk averse in SE than in JE."}]
