Therefore, unskilled managers are terminated and skilled managers invest without fear of termination. Unlike models of managerial discipline based on total payout, dividends are not a substitute for debt--they allow for termination upon non-payment, but at the expense of investment since they do not concentrate ownership and induce monitoring.

Our experimental setting allows us to distinguish between savings banks affected by the US financial crisis through their holdings in Landesbanken with substantial subprime exposure and unaffected savings banks. The data enable us to distinguish between demand and supply side effects of bank lending and find that the US financial crisis induced a contraction in the supply of retail lending in Germany. While demand for loans goes down, it is not substantially different for the affected and nonaffected banks. More important, we find evidence of a significant supply side effect in that the affected banks reject substantially more loan applications than nonaffected banks.

While the patent underlying the new project is owned by the firm, the employee generating the idea needs to be motivated to exert optimal effort for the project to be successful. The firm's choice between integration and non-integration is driven primarily by heterogeneity in beliefs among outside investors (each of whom has limited wealth to invest in the equity market) and between firm insiders and outsiders: if the marginal outsider financing the new project is more optimistic about the prospects of the project than firm insiders, and this incremental optimism of the marginal outsider over firm insiders is greater regarding new-project cash flows than that about assets-in-place cash flows, then the firm will implement the project under non-integration rather than integration. Two other ingredients driving the firm's financing choice are the cost of motivating the employee to exert optimal effort, and the potential synergies between the new project and assets in place. We derive a number of testable predictions regarding a firm's equilibrium choice between integration and non-integration. We also provide a rationale for the \"negative stub values\" documented in the equity carve-outs of certain firms (e.g., the carve-out of Palm from 3Com) and develop predictions for the magnitude of these stub values."}, {"e:volume": "100", "e:author": ["Jeong-Bon Kim", "Yinghua Li", "Liandong Zhang"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304-405X(11)00033-X", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "639-662", "e:issn": "0304-405X", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304-405X(11)00033-X", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Corporate tax avoidance and stock price crash risk: Firm-level analysis", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "e:abstract": "Using a large sample of U.S. firms for the period 1995-2008, we provide strong and robust evidence that corporate tax avoidance is positively associated with firm-specific stock price crash risk.

To understand this relation, we look at the institutional demand pressure defined as the number of days a loan remains in syndication. Using market-level and cross-sectional variation in time-on-the-market, we find that a shorter syndication period is associated with a lower final interest rate. The relation is robust to the use of institutional fund flow as an instrument. Furthermore, we find significant price differences between institutional investors' tranches and banks' tranches of the same loans, even though they share the same underlying fundamentals. Increasing demand pressure causes the interest rate on institutional tranches to fall below the interest rate on bank tranches. Overall, a one-standard-deviation reduction in average time-on-the-market decreases the interest rate for institutional loans by over 30 basis points per annum.

We offer a number of suggestions for improving empirical tests and evidence that several proposed models do not work as well as originally advertised."}, {"e:volume": "96", "e:author": ["Ran Duchin", "John G.

Empirical results are consistent with this explanation. The return premiums to low leverage and low distress are significant in raw returns, and even stronger in risk-adjusted returns. When in distress, low-leverage firms suffer more than high-leverage firms as measured by a deterioration in accounting operating performance and heightened exposure to systematic risk.

We show that differences in popularity between bidder and target help to explain their pairing.

Both bidder and target premiums are positively related to the difference in popularity between the target and the bidder.

We identify different channels through which an open market for corporate control can benefit or harm bondholders: a reduction in managerial slack or the \"quiet life,\" resulting in higher profitability and firm value; a coinsurance effect, in which firms become less risky after being acquired; and an increasing leverage effect, in which bondholder wealth is expropriated through leverage-increasing takeovers. Consistent with the first two mechanisms, we find that the cost of debt rose after the passage of the BC laws; moreover, it rose sharply for firms in non-competitive industries, and for firms rated speculative-grade.

We find that cross-listings have been falling on US exchanges as well as on the Main Market in London. This decline in cross-listings is explained by changes in firm characteristics instead of by changes in the benefits of cross-listing. We show that after controlling for firm characteristics there is no deficit in cross-listing counts on US exchanges related to SOX. Investigating the valuation differential between listed and non-listed firms (the cross-listing premium) from 1990 to 2005, we find that there is a significant premium for US exchange listings every year, that the premium has not fallen significantly in recent years, and that it persists when allowing for time-invariant unobservable firm characteristics. In contrast, no premium exists for listings on London's Main Market in any year.

Complexity increases the market power of the firms because it prevents some consumers from becoming knowledgeable about prices in the market.

Nevertheless, with a sample exceeding 10,000 initial control bids for US public targets, we show that toehold bidding has declined steadily since the early 1980s and is now surprisingly rare. At the same time, the average toehold is large when it occurs (20%), and toeholds are the norm in hostile bids. To explain these puzzling observations, we develop and test a two-stage takeover model where attempted merger negotiations are followed by open auction. With optimal bidding, a toehold imposes a cost on target management, causing some targets to (rationally) reject merger negotiations. Optimal toeholds are therefore either zero (to avoid rejection costs) or greater than a threshold (so that toehold benefits offset rejection costs). The toehold threshold estimate averages 9% across initial bidders, reflecting in part the bidder's opportunity loss of a merger termination agreement. In the presence of market liquidity costs, a threshold of this size may well induce a broad range of bidders to select zero toehold. As predicted, the probability of toehold bidding decreases, and the toehold size increases, with the threshold estimate. The model also predicts a relatively high frequency of toehold bidding in hostile bids, as observed.

The model substantially outperforms a benchmark single-component volatility model that is well established in the literature, and it fits options better than a model that combines conditional heteroskedasticity and Poisson-normal jumps.

We also show how managers' personal wealth constraints can lead to delayed investment and increased reliance on debt financing. Changes in cash flow can cause changes in investment by tightening or loosening the wealth constraints.

Venture capital finance is optimal only when the aggressive continuation strategy is not too profitable, ex ante; the uncertainty associated with the risky continuation strategy (strategic uncertainty) is high; and the firm's cash flow distribution is highly risky and positively skewed, with low probability of success, low liquidation value, and high returns if successful.

Firms that only pay dividends are largely extinct. Repurchases are increasingly used in place of dividends, even for firms that continue to pay dividends. While other factors help explain the timing of repurchases, the overall level of repurchases is fundamentally determined by earnings. The results suggest that repurchases are now the dominant form of payout."}, {"e:volume": "87", "e:author": ["Craig G. Dunbar", "Stephen R.

Target board classification does not change the likelihood that a firm, once targeted, is ultimately acquired. Moreover, shareholders of targets with a classified board realize bid returns that are equivalent to those of targets with a single class of directors, but receive a higher proportion of total bid surplus. Board classification does reduce the likelihood of receiving a takeover bid, however, the economic effect of bid deterrence on the value of the firm is quite small. Overall, the evidence is inconsistent with the conventional wisdom that board classification is an anti-takeover device that facilitates managerial entrenchment."}, {"e:volume": "87", "e:author": ["Rocco R.

The new method compares economic performance of pairs of contiguous counties separated by state borders, where on one side restrictions on statewide branching were removed relatively earlier, to create a natural \"regression discontinuity\" setup. The study uses a total of 285 pairs of contiguous counties along 38 segments of such regulation change borders to estimate treatment effects for 23 separate deregulation events taking place between 1975 and 1990. To distinguish real treatment effects from those created by data-snooping and spatial correlations, fictitious placebo deregulations are randomized (permutated) on another 32 segments of non-event borders to establish empirically a statistical table of critical values for the estimator. The method determines that statistically significant growth accelerations can be established at a > 90% confidence level in five (and none prior to 1985) out of the 23 deregulation events examined. \"Hinterland counties\" within the still-regulated states, but farther away from the state borders, are used as a second control group to consider and reject the possibility that cross-border spillover of deregulation effects may invalidate the empirical design."}, {"e:volume": "87", "e:author": ["Amiyatosh Purnanandam"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304-405X(07)00217-6", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "706-739", "e:issn": "0304-405X", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304-405X(07)00217-6", "e:year": 2008, "e:title": "Financial distress and corporate risk management: Theory and evidence", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "e:abstract": "This paper extends the current theoretical models of corporate risk-management in the presence of financial distress costs and tests the model's predictions using a comprehensive data set.

We find a robust influence of egalitarianism distance on cross-national flows of bond and equity issuances, syndicated loans, and mergers and acquisitions. An informal cultural institution largely determined a century or more ago, egalitarianism exercises its effect on international investment via an associated set of consistent contemporary policy choices.

First, post-buyout growth is concentrated among private-to-private transactions, i.e., deals where the seller is an individual, as opposed to divisional buyouts or public-to-private LBOs where the seller is a private or a public firm.

To correct market- and volatility-timing biases without overconditioning, we show that incorporating realized betas into instrumental variables estimators is effective. Empirically, instrumentation reduces momentum alphas by 20–40%. Overconditioned alphas overstate performance by up to 2.5 times. We explain the sources of both the volatility-timing and overconditioning biases in momentum portfolios."}, {"e:volume": "102", "e:author": ["Eva Liljeblom", "Daniel Pasternack", "Matts Rosenberg"], "e:issue": "2", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X11001668", "e:keyword": ["Stock option contract design", "Optimal contracting", "Agency cost"], "e:pages": "293-316", "e:issn": "0304-405X", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X11001668", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "What determines stock option contract design?", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "e:abstract": "We analyze the factors that drive exercise price policy for executive option plans (ESOPs) and their scope in a country where firms are not subject to the tax and accounting considerations that seem to have led to the dominance of at-the-money options in the US Our “unbounded” data for Finland provide us with an excellent opportunity to investigate whether contract design is consistent with compensation theory.

In support of this, we find that vested option holdings have a strong negative association with loan pricing, especially for informationally sensitive loans, and also predict higher cash flows and credit ratings, a greater distance to default, and lower equity volatility."}, {"e:volume": "106", "e:author": ["Travis L.

A bank makes a loan, learns if it needs monitoring, and then decides whether to lay off credit risk. The bank can transfer credit risk by either selling the loan or buying a credit default swap (CDS). With a CDS, the originating bank retains the loan's control rights; with loan sales, control rights pass to the loan buyer. Credit risk transfer leads to excessive monitoring of riskier credits and insufficient monitoring of safer credits. Increases in banks' cost of equity capital exacerbate these effects. For riskier credits, loan sales typically dominate CDS but not for safer credits. Once repeated lending and consequent reputation concerns are modeled, although CDSs remain dominated by loan sales for riskier credits, for safer credits they can dominate loan sales, supporting better monitoring (albeit to a limited extent) while allowing efficient risk sharing.

However, when entry costs require bidders to optimize their participation decisions, club formation acts as an endogenous limit on competition and reduces the target's premium. In contrast, social efficiency with club bidding is always higher. Our findings can reconcile the contradictory evidence on club bidding."}, {"e:volume": "108", "e:author": ["Akiko Watanabe", "Yan Xu", "Tong Yao", "Tong Yu"], "e:issue": "2", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X12002486", "e:keyword": ["Asset growth", "International equity markets", "Return predictability", "Optimal investment effect", "q-Theory"], "e:pages": "529-563", "e:issn": "0304-405X", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X12002486", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "The asset growth effect: Insights from international equity markets", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "e:abstract": "Firms with higher asset growth rates subsequently experience lower stock returns in international equity markets, consistent with the U.S. evidence.

Relating the probability of these regimes to macroeconomic conditions we find that the second regime can be predicted by economic conditions that are characterized as “stress.” These effects, which are robust to controlling for other systematic risks (term and default), suggest the existence of time-varying liquidity risk of corporate bond returns conditional on episodes of flight to liquidity. Our model can predict the out-of-sample bond returns for the stress years 2008–2009.

Banks can make standard loans on which plentiful historical data are available and unanimous agreement exists on default probabilities. Or banks can innovate and make new loans on which limited historical data are available, leading to possible disagreement over default probabilities. In equilibrium, banks make zero profits on standard loans and positive profits on innovative loans, which engenders innovation incentives for banks. But innovation brings with it the risk that investors could disagree with the bank that the loan is worthy of continued funding and hence could withdraw funding at an interim stage, precipitating a financial crisis. The degree of innovation in the financial system is determined by this trade-off.

We find that the rate of exchange eligible firms engaging in an IPO temporarily increases in advance of impending political promotion events.

Empirically, we find that economic constraints systematically reduce uncertainty about model parameters, reduce the risk of selecting a poor forecasting model, and improve both statistical and economic measures of out-of-sample forecast performance."}, {"e:volume": "114", "e:author": ["Arturo Bris", "Yrjö Koskinen", "Mattias Nilsson"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X14001652", "e:keyword": ["Euro", "Financial integration", "External financing", "Debt financing", "Supply of capital", "Financial dependence"], "e:pages": "554-575", "e:issn": "0304-405X", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X14001652", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "The euro and corporate financing before the crisis", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "e:abstract": "We study the financing policies of European public corporations prior to the euro crisis.

We demonstrate this phenomenon using data on securitized subprime mortgages issued in the period 1997–2006. As the level of securitization increases, lenders have an incentive to originate loans that rate high based on characteristics that are reported to investors, even if other unreported variables imply a lower borrower quality. Consistent with this behavior, we find that over time lenders set interest rates only on the basis of variables that are reported to investors, ignoring other credit-relevant information. As a result, among borrowers with similar reported characteristics, over time the set that receives loans becomes worse along the unreported information dimension. This change in lender behavior alters the data generating process by transforming the mapping from observables to loan defaults. To illustrate this effect, we show that the interest rate on a loan becomes a worse predictor of default as securitization increases. Moreover, a statistical default model estimated in a low securitization period breaks down in a high securitization period in a systematic manner: it underpredicts defaults among borrowers for whom soft information is more valuable.

While both types of intermediaries create safe “money-like” claims, they go about this in different ways. Traditional banks create money-like claims by holding illiquid fixed-income assets to maturity, and they rely on deposit insurance and costly equity capital to support this strategy. This strategy allows bank depositors to remain “sleepy”: they do not have to pay attention to transient fluctuations in the market value of bank assets. In contrast, shadow banks create money-like claims by giving their investors an early exit option requiring the rapid liquidation of assets. Thus, traditional banks have a stable source of funding, while shadow banks are subject to runs and fire-sale losses. In equilibrium, traditional banks have a comparative advantage at holding fixed-income assets that have only modest fundamental risk but are illiquid and have substantial transitory price volatility, whereas shadow banks tend to hold relatively liquid assets."}, {"e:volume": "117", "e:author": ["Vladimir Vladimirov"], "e:issue": "3", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X15000938", "e:keyword": ["Takeover premiums", "Financing bidders", "Takeover contests", "Financial constraints", "Security design"], "e:pages": "534-557", "e:issn": "0304-405X", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X15000938", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Financing bidders in takeover contests", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "e:abstract": "This paper argues that endogenizing how acquirers finance their cash bids is just as important for understanding bidding in takeovers as endogenizing acquirers׳ payment method choice.

One way for the entrepreneur to commit to the contract terms is to purchase inputs on credit from the supplier.

Based on these two roles, we develop testable hypotheses relating lead IPO underwriter centrality to the IPO characteristics of firms they take public.

Number-rigidity implies that the grant-date value of option awards will grow with firm equity returns, which were very high on average during the tech boom. Further, other forms of CEO compensation did not adjust to offset the dramatic growth in the value of option pay. Number-rigidity in options can also explain the increased dispersion in pay, the difference in growth between the US and other countries, and the increased correlation between pay and firm-specific equity returns. We present evidence that number-rigidity arose from a lack of sophistication about option valuation that is akin to money illusion.

We propose a simple, new Tobin’s q proxy that accounts for intangible capital, and we show that it is a superior proxy for both physical and intangible investment opportunities."}, {"e:volume": "123", "e:author": ["Sunil Dutta", "Alexander Nezlobin"], "e:issue": "2", "e:url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X16301982", "e:keyword": ["Cost of capital", "Information disclosure", "Risk premium", "Growth"], "e:pages": "415-431", "e:issn": "0304-405X", "e:doi": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X16301982", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "Information disclosure, firm growth, and the cost of capital", "e:journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "e:abstract": "We study how information disclosure affects the cost of equity capital and investor welfare in a dynamic setting. We show that a firm’s cost of capital decreases (increases) in the precision of public disclosure if the firm’s growth rate is below (above) a certain threshold. The threshold growth rate is higher when the firm’s cash flows are more persistent, or when other firms in the economy are growing at low rates. While current shareholders always prefer maximum public disclosure, future shareholders’ welfare decreases (increases) in the precision of public disclosure if the firm’s growth rate is below (above) the threshold."}]
