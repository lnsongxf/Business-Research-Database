In spite of the intuitive appeal of these arguments, however, many firms find that the uncertainty of a solid, measurable payoff makes it hard to justify major investments. As a result, some managers have given up trying to evaluate the benefits of these systems, and they now make the investment decision “on faith”—losing in the process any form of real accountability.By evaluating dss and oa development projects in the aggregate, however, some of these justification problems can be minimized. While we may not be able to identify the specific benefits generated by an individual system, we can often measure the overall productivity improvements attributable to the portfolio of systems.

The applicability of the methodology in nonsequential and object-oriented design environments is also discussed."}, {"e:author": ["Warren Harrison", "Bahram Adrangi"], "e:volume": "3", "e:url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/07421222.1986.11517772", "e:keyword": ["Software cost estimation", "Programming language as software cost driver"], "e:issn": "0742-1222", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1080/07421222.1986.11517772", "e:year": 1986, "e:title": "The Role of Programming Language in Estimating Software Development Costs", "e:journal": "Journal of Management Information Systems", "e:abstract": "It is commonly thought that the choice of programming language has an effect on the amount of effort involved in writing a program to solve a particular problem.

In this paper we show that it is possible to further increase the potential level of concurrency of a set of transactions, within the context of a specific locking protocol, by further restricting the placement of lock and unlock steps within each transaction. We also discuss a variation of the tree locking protocols that allows transactions to be locked with respect to a dynamically changing set of tree structures.

This problem has been classified as the “replicated copy control problem.” In this paper, we present several ideas that are necessary to attack and manage this problem.

Based on these principles, we delineate five stages of evolution, which may co-exist: (1) separate systems; (2) virtual-driver; (3) logical separation; (4) physical separati..."}, {"e:author": ["Andrew S.

Thus, a top-down, hierarchical approach is applied to the concept of imc to provide a framework for understanding the complexities and interrelationships among its many pieces.

In order to accommodate the new information flow without negatively affecting the waiting times for the previously contracted communications, network capacity may have to be expanded. We present an algorithmic method for least-cost capacity expansion of a set of network paths preselected to carry the incremental information flows.

The added cost is in reduced data consistency.The schemes analyzed include full regeneration, the scheme used by System R*, and two new schemes.

A research model is then developed and used to relate the functions of DSS methodology to decision-making environments and the relevant processes within them. Finally, a contingency theory is presented to show how each of the surveyed methodologies reduces the lack of structure in the decision-making environment, and how this may be used by DSS developers for selecting a DSS methodology. Other components of the research model are discussed, to identify further prerequisites for improved understanding of..."}, {"e:author": ["Edward G. Cale Jr.", "Charles H. Mawhinney", "David R.

Research results from attitudinal studies suggest that students’ attitudes are not the same as those for whom they are surrogates. Still, some research demonstrates that students and nonstudents respond similarly during decision making. This paper contains the results of an experiment to decide if students and industry decision makers made decisions similarly before and following a training program in the use of a DSS generator.

We find that the buyer finn will often maximize profits by limiting its options and reducing its own bargaining power.

Consequently, model management system(s) have become a key component of decision support system generators.

An important phase of the modeling life cycle involves analyzing and explaining the behavior of the formulated model. Such an analysis is necessary to understand the structure and behavior of the model, and to verify the appropriateness of the model to the problem.

However, information technology (IT) costs decline over time, so there is an incentive to delay implementation.

The model emphasizes competition between large firms in a regional (or national) market, interacting with firms in a local market.

Several factors will make it possible for entrants to attack dominant players; simplistic historical pricing mistakes or policies of promising or providing universal service will make it attractive for new entrants to attack.

It is hypothesized that organizations that change according to an ideal-type pattern outperform organizations that follow a different, inconsistent pattern.

To do this, data were collected from 151 independent system development projects in eight different organizations. The context of development was described by two factors—task complexity and system complexity.

This study tested whether the consistency of the user interface across applications affects mental-model development when a user learns and uses multiple applications. One hundred and fourteen participants learned two prototype cooperative work applications in a controlled laboratory setting. Interface consistency across applications was manipulated for two attributes commonly referred to in interface design guidelines: the visual appearance of the display screen and the action language syntax.

DIS have a four-layered conceptual structure: (1) people draw on the business layer to work and learn; (2) people use the breakdown layer to handle unexpected breakdowns; (3) self-organizing project teams use the project layer to create innovative work and IS (re)designs; and (4) the knowledge..."}, {"e:author": ["Fons Wijnhoven"], "e:volume": "1", "e:url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/07421222.1999.11518236", "e:keyword": ["Information systems development scenario", "Information systems project management", "Memory codification", "OMIS superstructure", "OMIS infrastructure", "Organizational memory information systems", "Process scenarios", "Situated systems development"], "e:issn": "0742-1222", "e:issue": "16", "e:doi": "10.1080/07421222.1999.11518236", "e:year": 1999, "e:title": "Development Scenarios for Organizational Memory Information Systems", "e:journal": "Journal of Management Information Systems", "e:abstract": "Well-managed organizational memories have been emphasized in the recent management literature as important sources for business success.

Acceptance is the extent to which members of a problem-solving group acquiesce to the views and solutions of other members, while holding reservations about those views and solutions. The distinction between agreement and acceptance is important because members in agreement are more likely to support the implementation of their solution than are those who merely accept the solution.

According to this view, data are a prerequisite for information, and information is a prerequisite for knowledge. This paper explores the conceptual hierarchy of data, information, and knowledge, showing that data emerge only after we have information, and that information emerges only after we already have knowledge. The reversed hierarchy of knowledge is shown to lead to a different approach in developing information systems that support knowledge management and organizational memory.

Communications of the ACM and Information Systems Research also provided strong evidence of a schism between the use of quantitative and qualitative measures in IT-value research. The Journal of Management information Systems and MIS Quarterly data provided more limited evidence of this schism as well. These schisms have become more pronounced over time. This may be due partly to an increasing reliance on secondary data set analyses that use only quantitative measures and organization-level analyses.

Each type of knowledge reuser has different requirements for knowledge repositories. Owing to how repositories are created, reusers'requirements often remain unmet.

Our paper considers a firm that offers an information good through spot buying, forward buying at a reduced price, or a combination of the two. The time lag between forward buying and spot buying brings about an uncertainty in a consumer's reservation price for the good at the time of advance purchase. We propose a consumer decision-making model that captures this fundamental feature and provides interesting insights into the key elements of consumer behavior. We establish that a consumer offered the choice between forward buying and waiting to (possibly) buy the good on spot faces the tradeoff between a lower unit price and the value of updated preferences.

We analyze vertical differentiation for a monopolist, continuing the practice of modeling consumer valuation as a linear function of product quality and consumer type but generalizing assumptions about marginal costs and consumer distributions.

Such settings require managers, as economic agents, to form a set of expectations about the values of various variables related to the business value of IT.

Under contingency pricing of an information good or service, the firm preannounces a rebate for poor performance. Consumers determine performance probabilities using publicly available historical performance data, and the firm may have additional private information with respect to its future probability distribution. Examining the monopoly case, we explicate the critical role of private information and differences in belief between the firm and market in the choice of pricing scheme. Contingent pricing is useful when the market underestimates the firm's performance; then it is optimal for the firm to offer a full-price rebate for mis-performance, with a correspondingly higher price for meeting the performance standard.

This model provides insights into expected e-marketplace growth and participation, and can be used to determine both the viability and expected long-run size of a given e-marketplace. Our results indicate that the pricing policy of the e-marketplace intermediary can affect the rate at which participation grows and, therefore, sentiment about its prospects.

However, the price charged to users of search engines is typically zero. Therefore, consumers do not face a tradeoff between quality and price. Why do lower-quality products survive in such a market? We develop a vertical differentiation model that explains this phenomenon. The quality of the results provided by a search engine is inherently stochastic, and there is no charge for using an engine.

Our results show that digital distribution through a P2P network is more profitable and more efficient than in the corresponding client-server setting, if the pricing mechanism used provides strong incentives to users to share content.

We postulate that as a firm grows larger, a superior IT infrastructure increases the productivity of other inputs by controlling the complexity-related costs that the firm incurs as it increases in size. In the empirical analysis to support this view, we find that firms with high-growth expectations increase their IT spending as their free cash flow increases, whereas low-growth firms maintain a constant level of IT spending, irrespective of their free cash flow. Further, we analyze the effect of IT investments in one period on growth-related metrics in subsequent periods. We find that a superior IT infrastructure significantly reduces the cost of operations for high-growth firms in subsequent periods.

This study uses a selfishness theory to explain how individuals using IM, as compared to those using audio, can encourage their negotiation partners to make ending concessions, and thereby increase individuals’ gains when agreement is reached.

The solution is illustrated for the collaborative housing market but applies in principle to any sharing market with vertically differentiated goods. A population of renters, heterogeneous both in their preferences for housing quality and with respect to the amount of care they exert in a rental situation, face a choice between collaborative housing and staying at a local hotel.

Using the lens of IPV, we posit that uncertainty in the outsourced task increases the information requirements (IR) of the BPO relationship, which, in turn, leads to more hierarchical governance structures.

A multiple-group analysis reveals significant differences in trust formation, particularly in the cues considered in the evaluation of online services. Whereas a large user base inspires confidence in digital natives, naturalized digitals are more geared toward familiar brands and recommendations.

To address this research gap, in this study we develop a theoretical model to explain the antecedents of quantity and quality of OPDF participation and test the model using a survey and content analysis of forum logs.

In this paper we holistically examine users’ active behaviors on an SNS. Toward this end, we conduct three studies. First, we classify active behaviors on an SNS into four categories using the Delphi method. Then, we develop a measurement model and validate it using the data collected from an online survey of 477 SNS users.

Specifically, we scrutinize the reasons why individuals would unethically reuse such code by not checking or purposefully violating its accompanying license obligations, thus risking harm for their employer. By integrating teleological and deontological ethical judgments into a theory of planned behavior model—using elements of expected utility, deterrence, and ethical work climate theory—we construct an original theoretical framework to capture individuals’ decision-making process leading to the unethical reuse of Internet-accessible code.

Positive trial experience as represented by high review rating of the free version of a mobile app leads to higher sales of its paid version, whereas high visibility of the free version of a mobile app as represented by its product rank does not have a significant impact on the sales of its paid version. This finding suggests that although offering a free trial version is a viable way to improve the visibility of a mobile app, offering a quality free app is more important in boosting sales of the paid app. Moreover, we found that the impact of review rating is reduced when the free version is offered, or when the mobile app is a hedonic app, because consumers have the ability to experience the a..."}, {"e:author": ["Vladimir Zwass"], "e:volume": "1", "e:url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/07421222.2015.1029378", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0742-1222", "e:issue": "32", "e:doi": "10.1080/07421222.2015.1029378", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Editorial Introduction", "e:journal": "Journal of Management Information Systems", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": ["Deepa Mani", "Anitesh Barua"], "e:volume": "1", "e:url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/07421222.2015.1029379", "e:keyword": ["Abnormal returns", "Business process outsourcing", "Contracts", "Financial value", "Market efficiency", "Organizational learning", "Outsourcing"], "e:issn": "0742-1222", "e:issue": "32", "e:doi": "10.1080/07421222.2015.1029379", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "The Impact of Firm Learning on Value Creation in Strategic Outsourcing Relationships", "e:journal": "Journal of Management Information Systems", "e:abstract": "AbstractInformation technology (IT) is central to the process execution and management of an ongoing relationship in outsourcing, both of which are fraught with challenges, and often lead to poor business outcomes.

Based on the stimulus–organism–response framework, we develop a research model that proposes users’ preference fit and perceived enjoyment as two key intervening mechanisms that carry over the differential effects of content and design personalization cues on users’ willingness to stick to a website and to pay for website offerings.

Two different perspectives, the supply and demand perspectives, can be adopted to examine this phenomenon.

However, no prior research has systematically compared both perspectives, and it is unclear whether different perspectives will generate different insights. Using a unique data set collected from an online market, we find that the dispersion of listing prices is three times higher than the dispersion of transaction prices. More interestingly, the drivers of price dispersion differ significantly between listing and transaction data.

We theorize that the valence and volume of prior reviews can play an important moderating role in the effect of deal promotion. Empirically, we show that restaurants with a relatively low prior average rating and a relatively small review volume have improved their online reputations by offering Groupon promotion.

This paper empirically investigates a mediation model in which online user reviews mediate the impact of professional reviews on online user decisions. Using software download data, we show that a higher professional rating not only directly promotes software download but also results in more active user-generated WOM interactions, which indirectly lead to more downloads.

In China, failure rates of ERP are also high, with key differences between China and Western countries in terms of development, cultural, and organizational structure. Even when Chinese firms successfully adopt ERP, many fail to assimilate ERP and consequently never experience the full benefits of the innovation. The purpose of this study is to examine the predictors of adoption versus assimilation in Chinese firms. The existing literature largely assumes a dichotomy of choices when implementing organizational innovations in business: technological evaluation and imitation. We argue that this dichotomy does not apply well to a Chinese ERP context.

Our results show that declining IT cost intensifies or relaxes competition between firms depending on whether they are serving quality- or price-sensitive markets. In both cases, the average price per unit quality decreases when the IT cost declines, which benefits consumers.

However, given the performance of the state-of-the-art speech recognition technology today, widespread acceptance of speech recognition technology would not be realistic without designing and developing new approaches to detecting and correcting recognition errors effectively. In seeking solutions to the above problem, identifying cues to error detection (CERD) is central. Our survey of the extant literature on the detection and correction of speech recognition errors reveals that the system-initiated, data-driven approach is dominant, but that heuristics from human users have been largely overlooked. This may have hindered the advance of speech technology. In this research, we propose a user-centered approach to discovering CERD. User studies are carried out to implement the approach.

Hyperdifferentiation says that firms can now produce almost anything that appeals to consumers and they can manage the complexity of the increasingly diverse product portfolios that result. Resonance marketing says that informed consumers will purchase products that they actually truly want. When consumers become more informed, firms that provide highly differentiated products should experience higher growth rates than firms with less differentiated offerings. We construct measures of product positioning based on online ratings and find supportive evidence using sales data from the craft beer industry.

The data allow us to explore how organizational members manage the tension between a need for continuity in communicative practices and a need for flexibility in managing a jumble of paper-based and digital information systems. In addition, it demonstrates how end users often tinker with genres' media and form in the process of altering combinations among specific genres."}, {"e:author": ["John Hulland", "Michael R.

We assess whether the effect of online trust on intention to shop online is moderated by gender. Our results show that the effect of trust on intention to shop online is stronger for women than for men.

By using the proposed model with actual data on e-mail and spam, we demonstrate that ROA with Bayesian postauditing offers a systematic valuation and risk management framework for evaluating information security spending by firms.

However, when considering repeat purchase products, online reviews have an additional effect in that they can alter consumers' propensity to switch among products, which can intensify price competition and lead to lower profits. The strength of these potentially offsetting effects depends on the informativeness of consumer reviews, which is a function of both objective review accuracy and the ability of consumers to obtain information from reviews when their idiosyncratic preferences over product characteristics might differ from the preferences of reviewers.

Offering both ad-free and ad-supported services is the optimal strategy for a monopolist because ad revenues compensate for the cannibalistic effect of vertical differentiation. In a duopoly equilibrium, exactly one firm offers both services when the ad revenue rate is sufficiently high. Furthermore, we find that a higher ad revenue rate may lead to lower service prices.

We show that a mandatory security requirement will increase the MSSP's effort and motivate it to serve more clients.

Using data collected from 194 organizations in the geospatial industry, we empirically confirm that interoperability is formed via these two different paths.

Accordingly, we conduct a laboratory experiment using teenagers and their parents as subjects, increasing the realism of the context by sampling potential pirates and their parents. Treatments represent various sources of piracy advice (e.g., the teen's parent, a record label, or an external regulator). Subjects make decisions playing our new experimental game—The Piracy Game—extended from the volunteer's dilemma literature. Interestingly, subjects respond negatively to advice from record labels over time, purchasing fewer songs as compared to other sources such as the subject's parent. The existence of a social tie between the adviser and the subject assists in mitigating piracy, especially when a par..."}, {"e:author": ["Yan Dong", "Xiaowen Huang", "Kingshuk K.

While busesinss-to-business (B2B) technology solutions, such as CPFR (collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment), facilitate the sharing of historical information (e.g., transaction records), business intelligence (e.g., potential customer demand) is considered private. Central to CPFR is collaborative demand forecasting (CDF) that allows supply chain partners to share private demand information and incorporate the jointly derived demand forecast into production planning and product replenishment decisions. Implementing CDF, however, is a challenge because of the high costs of the laborious collaboration effort (e.g., to resolve forecast differences). Hence, companies are unable to ..."}, {"e:author": ["John D'Arcy", "Tejaswini Herath", "Mindy K.

Results from a survey of 539 employee users suggest that SRS engenders an emotion-focused coping response in the form of moral disengagement from ISP violations, which in turn increases one's susceptibility to this behavior. Our multidimensional view of SRS—comprised of security-related overload, complexity, and uncertainty—offers a new perspective on the workplace environment factors that foster noncompliant user behavior and inspire cognitive rationalizations of such behavior. The study extends technostress research to the information systems security domain and provides a theoretical framework for the influence of SRS on user behavior.

The benefits from a potential outsourcing relationship expansion have strategic implications for relational incentive provision. Modeling \"information poaching\" in IT outsourcing as an incentive problem with contractibility constraints, our analysis shows that this problem could be mitigated in a repeated game where the outsourcing client and the service provider agree on a relational contract. When the two partners share the belief that they can potentially benefit from a future relationship expansion, they are more likely to behave cooperatively during the early stages of their relationship. However, when they disagree about the likelihood of the future relationship expansion, they will have different preferences on a set of otherwise equivalent relational bonus contracts. Specifically, they will adopt a rel..."}]
