We develop a proxy for the likelihood of cross-listed firms' ICD misreporting during the Section 302 reporting regime. For cross-listed firms domiciled in weak investor protection countries, we have three main findings. First, firms whose managers control their firms and have voting rights in excess of cash flow rights are more likely to misreport ICD than other firms during the Section 302 reporting regime. Second, there is a positive association between the likelihood of ICD misreporting and voluntary deregistration from the SEC prior to the Section 404 effective date. Third, for firms that chose not to deregister, there is a positive association between the likelihood of ICD misreporting and the reporting of previously undisclosed ICDs during the Section 404 reporting regime. We do not find similar evidence for cross-listed firms domiciled in strong investor protection countries. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that, for cross-listed firms domiciled in weak investor protection countries, managers who have the ability and incentive to expropriate outside minority shareholders are reluctant to disclose ICDs in order to protect their private control benefits. The results of our study should be of interest to regulators who wish to identify noncompliant firms for closer supervision, investors who wish to identify ex ante red flags for poor financial disclosure quality, and researchers who wish to understand the economic forces governing cross-listed firms' financial disclosure behavior."}, {"e:author": ["Carlos‐Alberto Dorantes", "Chan Li", "Gary F.

Additional robustness tests support the argument that improvements in management forecasts are due to improvements in the firm's internal information environment rather than to enhancements in management's ability to manage earnings.

If IFRS adoption improves financial statement comparability, we predict this should reduce insiders' ability to benefit from private information. Consistent with these expectations, we find that abnormal returns to insider purchases ― used to proxy for private information ― are reduced following IFRS adoption. Similar results obtain across numerous subsamples and proxies used to isolate IFRS effects attributable to comparability.

Before 2001, Taiwan's Company Act imposed a mandatory public reporting requirement of filing audited financial statements on private firms with contributed capital exceeding a certain threshold. This requirement was rescinded in 2001 and private firms since have had discretion over public financial reporting. We divide private firms retroactively into two groups: voluntary reporting firms, those continuing the practice of filing financial statements after the regime change; and nonvoluntary reporting firms, those discontinuing the reporting practice after the regime change. We find that financial reporting quality is higher for voluntary reporting firms than for nonvoluntary reporting firms and that this quality difference translates into a lower cost of debt for voluntary reporting firms.

We measure risk-taking incentives using two proxies: the sensitivity of managerial wealth to stock return volatility (vega) and the sensitivity of managerial wealth to stock price (delta). We find that rating agencies impound managerial risk-taking incentives in their credit risk assessments. Assuming other things equal, a one standard deviation increase in vega (delta) will lead to an approximately one-notch (two-notch) rating downgrade. In addition, we evaluate the significance of credit ratings in the design of CEO compensation. Our findings suggest that rating-troubled firms will gear down managerial incentives of risk seeking. In particular, other things equal, a rating downgrade to the lower edge of the investment category (i.e., BBB−) in the immediate prior year will bring about an approximately 51 percent reduction of vega incentive from options newly granted to the CEO in the current year. However, we find no evidence that firms' rating concerns significantly affect delta. Given the significance of credit ratings in the marketplace and their close connection to accounting, the findings of the current study advance our understanding, not only of how sophisticated rating agencies are in incorporating forward-looking information (i.e., vega and delta) into risk assessments, but of how influential the raters are in changing firms' compensation policies. The findings also have implications on the role of accounting in constraining excessive managerial risk taking with improved disclosures on managerial compensation."}, {"e:author": ["R.

Theory and anecdotal evidence suggest that mutual monitoring may either decrease effort by facilitating collusion or increase effort by stimulating competition. In our first experiment, we find that mutual monitoring increases effort, because participants do not attempt to collude but rather behave competitively. This result leads us to expand our theory and develop hypotheses to predict that the effect of mutual monitoring depends on whether employees have the inclination to collude or compete. Specifically, we predict that mutual monitoring decreases effort when employees are inclined to collude and increases effort when employees are inclined to compete; that is, mutual monitoring will not change the basic inclination created by the workplace setting, but will “turn up the volume” on the effect that such inclination has on effort. Consistent with our predictions, our second experiment finds that mutual monitoring leads to lower effort when participants have a collusive inclination and (eventually) higher effort when they have a competitive inclination. Overall, the results from these two experiments suggest that allowing employees to observe each other's productive effort in tournament incentive settings may have positive or negative consequences for the firm, depending on whether environmental factors predispose employees to collude or compete."}, {"e:author": ["Guojin Gong", "Laura Yue Li", "Ling Zhou"], "e:volume": "30", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12007/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12007/abstract", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Earnings Non‐Synchronicity and Voluntary Disclosure", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Earnings non-synchronicity reflects the extent to which firm-specific factors determine a firm's earnings.

We propose that high earnings non-synchronicity motivates managers to issue earnings forecasts to reduce information asymmetry between managers and investors and to preempt costly information acquisition by outsiders. Consistently, we find a positive relation between earnings non-synchronicity and managers' propensity to issue earnings forecasts, particularly long-horizon forecasts. This positive relation is weaker when earnings are easier to predict based on the firm's earnings history and is stronger when the firm has higher institutional ownership and greater analyst following. We also find that the market's reaction to management forecasts increases with earnings non-synchronicity. Overall, the evidence suggests that managers voluntarily provide earnings forecasts to alleviate the adverse consequences of earnings non-synchronicity.

We extend this line of research to test if larger Big 4 offices have fewer client restatements. A client restatement provides more direct evidence of a low-quality audit than earnings quality metrics or going-concern reports, because a restatement indicates the client's auditor did not effectively enforce the correct application of GAAP at the time the original financial statements were issued. We analyze 2,557 firm-year restatements in a sample of 23,190 financial statements originally issued by U.S. firms from 2003 to 2008. We find that Big 4 office size is associated with fewer client restatements after controlling for innate client characteristics that may affect restatements (client size, financial performance, industry membership, nonfinancial measures, off-balance sheet activities, and market-related measures), and a set of controls for other auditor factors such as fees and industry expertise.

The revised Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements that resulted from the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) limit nonaudit services (NAS) and mandate NAS fee disclosure. The SEC's requirements are based on the argument that auditor independence could be impaired—and hence audit quality may be reduced—when auditors become economically dependent on their clients or audit their own work. Economic bonding leads to reduced independence, which can lead to reduced audit quality. We study a sample of firms sanctioned by the SEC for fraudulent financial reporting in Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases (SEC-sanctioned fraud firms) and examine whether there is a relationship between auditor fee variables and the likelihood of being sanctioned by the SEC for fraud. We use SEC sanction as a measure of audit quality that has not previously been used in the auditor fee literature and is more precise than some of the other proxies used for flawed financial/auditor reporting. We find, in univariate tests, that fraud firms paid significantly higher (total, audit, and NAS) fees. However, in multivariate tests, when controlling for other fraud determinants and endogeneity among the fraud, NAS, and audit fee variables, we find that while  NAS fees and total fees are positively and significantly related to the likelihood of being sanctioned by the SEC for fraud, audit fees are not. These findings suggest that higher NAS fees may cause economic bonding, thereby leading to reduced audit quality. Our findings of significantly higher NAS fees and total fees in fraud firms hold after controlling for latent size effects and other rigorous testing. These results contribute to the literature that examines the SEC's concerns regarding NAS and can be used by policy makers for additional consideration."}, {"e:author": [], "e:volume": "29", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12014/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12014/abstract", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Abstracts/Résumés", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": ["Frank H.

To an auditor who is highly rewarded for revenue generation and growth, nonaudit services may represent a particularly strengthened economic bond with the client. Prior research shows that, in general, nonaudit service fees received in the current period do not impair audit quality. We examine a different setting. We propose that auditor independence can become impaired, and audit quality compromised, when clients that currently purchase relatively low amounts of nonaudit services, increase their purchases of nonaudit services from the auditor in the subsequent period. We test our prediction in the context of earnings management as a proxy for audit quality, measured by (a) performance-adjusted discretionary accruals and (b) classification shifting of core expenses. Our results indicate that prior to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, rewards to the auditor in the form of future additional nonaudit service fees from current-year high fee-growth-opportunity clients adversely affects audit quality. This effect is particularly strong among companies with powerful incentives to manage earnings. Our findings indicate that regulators should consider the multiperiod nature of the client–auditor relationship when contemplating policies that restrict nonaudit services, as well as the overall environment in which audit partners operate. This might include partner compensation arrangements that put pressure on audit partners to focus on increasing revenue at the expense of audit quality."}, {"e:author": ["Frank Ecker"], "e:volume": "31", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12043/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12043/abstract", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Information Precision and Long‐Run Performance of Initial Public Offerings", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Due to a lack of an information history, IPO firms' information precision is not only generally low but also likely to be estimated initially with considerable error.

Specifically, an upward (downward) revision of information precision results in positive (negative) abnormal returns over the period in which investors update their beliefs. In addition, the positive abnormal returns of firms with unexpectedly high realized information precision are less persistent than the negative abnormal returns of firms with unexpectedly low realized information precision, which can extend up to 18 months after the IPO. The findings imply that long-term investors in IPO stocks do not necessarily behave irrationally, but that both positive and negative post-IPO abnormal performance is also consistent with rational investors gradually updating the perceived information precision parameter of these stocks."}, {"e:author": ["Richard Clune", "Dana R.

Based on interviews of 20 U.S. public company NC members, including 16 chairs, we focus on two primary questions: (1) what is the extent of influence that the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has over committee processes, and (2) to what extent are committee processes formalized (i.e., framed and acted upon in a mechanistic way)? We find that there is continuing recognition of CEO influence in the director nomination process, the level of which varies widely by company. Also, there is considerable variability in the formalization of the director nomination process (e.g., some NCs use search firms and a matrix/grid approach to assessing director skill sets across the board, while others do not). Finally, we find that many interviewees have professional or personal ties to the CEO and that nearly all of the NCs focus on “chemistry” and comfort in the director nomination process, where the often-stated goal is to enhance the board's ability to function effectively and to reduce risk in the director nomination process. The overall message of the interviews perhaps is best captured by one interviewee, who described a “strange little dance.” Throughout the interviews, we find evidence that the NC must “dance” through a complex decision landscape."}, {"e:author": ["Jean C.

However, the majority of past research treats all inside directors as a homogenous group. This study considers that issue in the context of chief financial officers (CFO) serving on their own company's board. Our research is important because individuals in different executive roles bring different skills and knowledge to board interactions, highlighting the potential for differential contributions. As prior research does not specifically distinguish CFOs from other board insiders, the potential benefits of knowledge sharing due to increased communication with other board members may have been masked. Specifically, the CFO is directly responsible for the quality of the financial reporting process and can therefore be associated with specific outcome measures. Our results show that the percentage of CFOs serving on their own boards is not large, likely due to the perspective (consistent with agency theory and reflected in independence guidelines) that company insiders on boards could promote their own best interest at the expense of shareholders. Contrary to this perception, we find that companies whose CFO has a seat on the board are associated with higher financial reporting quality (i.e., a lower likelihood of reporting a material weaknesses in internal controls or having a financial restatement, and better accruals quality). Yet, we also find potential drawbacks in that CFOs with a board seat tend to have higher excess compensation and lower likelihood of termination following poor performance, signaling greater entrenchment. While our results provide information to companies considering appointing the CFO to the board, both costs and benefits are demonstrated, and thus we conclude that each board should consider this decision based on its own circumstances and composition."}, {"e:author": ["Joni J.

This case is interesting because an earlier, failed effort to expense stock compensation was described as highly politicized. However, the boundary between technical and political processes was maintained in the more recent episode. I find that a focus on due process, characterizations of existing accounting requirements as anomalous and available measurement methods as reliable, and warnings about the dangers of injecting “politics” into standard-setting were important to this boundary work. I also find that the boundary work required considerable interpretive flexibility in selecting (or ignoring) the evidence to be used in justifying the standard-setting project and its conclusions. I conclude by suggesting that a different understanding of what it means to be involved in a “political process” might help all parties understand more fully what is taking place during the accounting standard-setting process. Attention could be turned to developing processes to facilitate debates over which values should guide decisions occurring throughout the standard-setting process. To this end, an enhanced standard-setting process might allow for increased participation in agenda setting, in framing and scoping standard-setting projects, and in providing opportunities for nonexperts to participate."}, {"e:author": ["Jeong‐Bon Kim", "Liandong Zhang"], "e:volume": "31", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12048/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12048/abstract", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Financial Reporting Opacity and Expected Crash Risk: Evidence from Implied Volatility Smirks", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "The recent financial crisis has stimulated a renewed interest in understanding the determinants of stock price crash risk (i.e., left tail risk). Recent research shows that opaque financial reports enable managers to hide and accumulate bad news for extended periods. When the accumulated bad news reaches a certain tipping point, it will be suddenly released to the market at once, resulting in an abrupt decline in stock price (i.e., a crash). This study extends this line of research by examining the impact of financial reporting opacity on perceived or expected crash risk. Prominent economists, such as Olivier Blanchard, argue that removing the perception of tail risks (in addition to realized tail risks) is crucial in restoring investor confidence and stabilizing the stock market. Using the steepness of option implied volatility skew as a proxy for perceived crash risk, we find that accrual management, the presence of financial statement restatements, and auditor-attested internal control weakness are all positively and significantly associated with the level of perceived crash risk. Our results suggest that improving financial reporting transparency is an important mechanism for firms and policymakers to reduce the perception of tail risks and stabilize the stock market."}, {"e:author": ["Francesco Bova", "Miguel Minutti‐Meza", "Gordon Richardson", "Dushyantkumar Vyas"], "e:volume": "31", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12049/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12049/abstract", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "The Sarbanes‐Oxley Act and Exit Strategies of Private Firms", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "The costs and benefits of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) have been oft-debated since the inception of the Act. Much of the extant literature has assessed the costs and benefits of SOX to publicly traded companies. We focus on the costs of SOX compliance for private firms wanting to exit the private market via either an acquisition by a public firm or an IPO. Consistent with our predictions we establish two principal findings. First, SOX appears to have shifted the preferences of private firms from going public to exiting the private market via acquisition by a public acquirer. Second, private target deal multiples are increasing in variables that proxy for a private target's level of pre-acquisition SOX compliance. These findings suggest that SOX-related costs have both restricted the action space of possible exit strategies for private firms and led to lower deal multiples for those private acquisition targets that are less likely to be SOX compliant prior to acquisition."}, {"e:author": ["Mark L.

In addition, we find that a portion of the bad news impounded by the bond market reverses following the earnings announcement. Overall, our findings are consistent with bondholders’ asymmetric payoff function having important implications for the valuation role of accounting information in the bond market.

Importantly, overreliance on reviewing management's estimation process when it has been biased by a control deficiency can result in auditor acceptance of an inappropriate accounting estimate. We use an experiment to examine whether auditors recognize the insufficiency of increased sampling of a biased estimation process and their selection of alternative tests to replace or supplement review of the biased estimation process. We find that a significant minority (33 percent) of Big 4 senior auditors erroneously increase tests of management's biased estimation process. We also find that auditors have difficulty selecting alternative tests to replace or supplement review of management's biased estimation process, frequently choosing tests that are either ineffective or inefficient.

The two prevailing perspectives that have surfaced are “neutrality” and “presumptive doubt.” With neutrality, auditors neither believe nor disbelieve client management. With presumptive doubt, auditors assume some level of dishonesty by management, unless evidence indicates otherwise. The purpose of this study is to examine which of these perspectives is most descriptive of auditors’ skeptical judgments and decisions, in higher and lower control environment risk settings. This issue is important, since there is a lack of empirical evidence as to which perspective is optimal in addressing client risks. An experimental study is conducted involving a sample of 96 auditors from one of the Big 4 auditing firms in the Netherlands, with experience ranging from senior to partner. One of the skepticism measures is reflective of neutrality, the Hurtt Professional Skepticism Scale (HPSS), whereas the other reflects presumptive doubt, the inverse of the Rotter Interpersonal Trust Scale (RIT). The findings suggest that the presumptive doubt perspective of professional skepticism is more predictive of auditor skeptical judgments and decisions than neutrality, particularly in higher-risk settings. Since auditing standards prescribe greater skepticism in higher-risk settings, the findings support the appropriateness of a presumptive doubt perspective and have important implications for auditor recruitment and training, guidance in audit tools, and future research."}, {"e:author": ["Boochun Jung", "Woo‐Jong Lee", "David P.

Arguing that both research and practitioner frameworks in auditing and forensic accounting have tended to adopt an individualizing perspective predicated primarily on solo offending, this article adopts an inductive approach to consider why individuals co-offend in fraud. It reports the results of a set of interviews with 37 individuals convicted of a range of frauds including financial statement fraud, insider trading, credit card fraud, money laundering, and asset misappropriation. In each instance, the fraud was perpetrated by a group of two or more co-offenders. Based on inductive, exploratory case coding, we find that reasons for co-offending vary according to the type of bond that exists between co-offenders. Two dimensions of fraudulent co-offending are identified—the primary beneficiary of the fraud and the nature of group attachment—to derive three distinct archetypes of bonds between co-offenders: (1) individual-serving functional bonds, (2) organization-serving functional bonds, and (3) affective bonds. Key elements of each archetype as well as their impact on the decision to co-offend are examined. Our findings suggest that the social nature of fraud is not merely an incidental feature of the crime but is instead a potential key to understanding its etiology and some of its distinctive features. They also support the need for diagnostic tools to move beyond individualistic analyses of fraud toward a broader, group-sensitive assessment of fraud risk."}, {"e:author": ["In‐Mu Haw", "Jay Junghun Lee", "Woo‐Jong Lee"], "e:volume": "31", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12064/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12064/abstract", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Debt Financing and Accounting Conservatism in Private Firms", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": ["John S.

Because charity care reduces profits, such incentives should lead for-profit hospital managers to reduce charity care levels. Nonprofit hospital managers, however, may respond differently to the same incentives because they face a different set of institutional pressures and constraints. We compare the association between pay-for-performance incentives and charity care in for-profit and nonprofit hospitals. We find a negative and significant association between charity care and our proxy for profit-based incentives in for-profit hospitals, and no significant association in nonprofit hospitals. These results suggest that linking manager pay to profitability does not appear to discourage charity care in nonprofit hospitals. Apparently, the nonprofit mission, institutional pressures, and ownership constraints moderate the potentially negative effects of profit-based incentives. Because this evidence partially alleviates concerns over nonprofit compensation arrangements that mirror those used in for-profit hospitals, it should be of interest to regulators and policymakers.

In this study, we investigate a sample of firms that recently adopted a lattice model to value employee stock options to provide evidence on this issue by identifying the determinants of lattice model adoption and examining the effect of lattice model use on reported option values. We report three main results. First, we find that firms are more likely to adopt a lattice model when it is more likely to produce lower values than the BS model and when managers have incentives to lower stock option expense. Second, we find that firms adopting a lattice model increase understatement of reported option values more than firms that continue to use the BS model and that the incremental understatement is due to use of the lattice model. Third, we conduct several tests to examine whether the valuation effect of lattice model use is consistent with efforts to correct for documented shortcomings in the BS model and find no evidence that this is the case.

My evidence supports these concerns. Specifically, I examine the information content of unrealized cash flow hedge gains/losses for future profitability and stock returns. An unrealized gain on a cash flow hedge suggests that the price of the underlying hedged item (i.e., commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate, or interest rate) moved in a direction that will impair the firm's profits after the hedge expires. Consequently, I find that unrealized cash flow hedge gains/losses are negatively associated with future gross profit after the firm's existing hedges have expired. This association only holds after the firm has reclassified its hedges into earnings, and is weaker for firms that can pass input price changes on to their customers. Finally, investors do not immediately price the cash flow hedge information. Instead, investors appear surprised by future realizations of gross margin, consistent with the view that complex and incomplete disclosures delay pricing.

The implications of discretionary adjustments for employees' future efforts and fairness perceptions present important trade-offs for managers to consider. Adjustments may be used to motivate different types of effort in future periods, but may also create perceptions of unfairness among employees who are not affected by negative events. This study examines the joint influence of the likelihood of future negative uncontrollable events and compensation interdependence (i.e., the extent to which one employee's compensation influences others' compensation) on managers' willingness to make adjustments for the effect of a negative uncontrollable event on a single employee. In our experiment, we manipulate the likelihood of future uncontrollable events and whether bonuses are determined individually or are drawn from a shared bonus pool. Results show that managers are less willing to adjust when the likelihood of future events is high to avoid setting a precedent, thereby motivating employees to adapt to changing conditions. We also find that managers are less willing to adjust, regardless of event likelihood, when compensation interdependence is high, to avoid demotivating unaffected employees. Finally, we find that participants' general attitudes toward compensation significantly influence their adjustment decisions beyond the effects of our independent variables. Our results highlight the unique nature of discretionary adjustments, help explain findings from previous research, and demonstrate important considerations managers must make when using the flexibility provided to them in pay-for-performance contracts."}, {"e:author": ["Andrei Filip", "Réal Labelle", "Stéphane Rousseau"], "e:volume": "32", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12071/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12071/abstract", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Legal Regime and Financial Reporting Quality", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "This article uses the Canadian environment, where French civil law (FCL) in the province of Quebec coexists with common law (CL) in the Rest of Canada (denoted as bijural), to test the thesis of the neutrality of the legal system with regard to financial reporting quality (FRQ).

The FCL environment appears to encourage firms to publish accounting data of better quality due to the greater liability risk faced by auditors and corporate directors under that regime. These findings, based on 10 years of data and seven attributes of FRQ, are robust to different matching procedures and model specifications. This research contributes to the current debates in Canada as to whether financial market regulation under FCL and CL jurisdictions should be unified under a single CL national securities regulator. At the broader level, the results support claims that a more in-depth understanding of the implementation of civil law and CL is needed rather than gross generalization about the two systems.

We use a large sample of hedge fund activist events and identify control firms with similar likelihoods of being targeted using the propensity score matching method to apply difference-in-difference tests. We find that when hedge fund activists have relatively large ownership and sufficient time to exert their monitoring power, target firms experience significant increases in conditional conservatism. CFO turnovers, upward/lateral auditor switches, and improvements in audit committee independence after intervention are accompanied by greater increases in conditional conservatism.

Our work goes beyond the development of a tool alone, however, by conducting an extensive comparison of our probability-of-truth measure with eight alternative detection tools representing both quantitative and language-based approaches. Comparisons are made across a variety of samples and show that our language-based approach can be effective in both cross-sectional and time-series settings. It is useful both in distinguishing between fraudulent and truthful firms and in identifying fraudulent reports from a series of reports issued by a single firm. This second setting is one in which accounting-based detection tools have frequently struggled.

Previous studies document abnormal trading by institutions or short selling before announcement of recommendation changes. Such prerelease abnormal trading is interpreted as evidence of information leakage from analyst reports. However, if sophisticated investors obtain information similar to what analysts have from other sources, abnormal prerelease trading patterns would be observed even if there were no information leakage from analyst reports. This paper, using a unique data set from Korea, aims to determine whether a direct causal link between recommendation changes and prerelease trading exists, by comparing trading behavior of client investors with non-client investors. We find that abnormal prerelease trading by client investors, especially client institutions, is earlier in timing and greater in magnitude than that of other investor groups, supporting the information leakage hypothesis. We further find that net buying by client institutions and client large individuals is positively associated with firm, analyst, and earnings forecast change variables that influence formulation of recommendation changes and their impacts."}, {"e:author": ["Jean Bédard", "Lucie Courteau"], "e:volume": "32", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12091/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12091/abstract", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Benefits and Costs of Auditor's Assurance: Evidence from the Review of Quarterly Financial Statements", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Even though there is a worldwide consensus as to the necessity of an audit of annual financial statements for public companies, there is divergence of views as to the review of interim financial statements.

Using a sample of companies listed in Canada, we examine the costs associated with these reviews and the benefits they generate in terms of improvement in the quality of interim financial statements for the years 2004 and 2005. Controlling for the decision to purchase the reviews, we find that audit fees are 18 percent higher for firms with interim reviews and, contrary to many regulators' assumption, we find no evidence that this cost increase is proportionally higher for smaller firms. Regarding the benefits of interim reviews, we find no significant association between either accruals- or nonaccruals-based measures of earnings management and the fact that the interim statements are reviewed by the auditor, neither in the interim reports nor in those of the fourth quarter.

We find that judgment frameworks are particularly well-suited for defending judgments under imprecise standards, and represent a cost-effective alternative to using technical experts.

We examine the causes of these problems and why they persist. To do so, we interview 24 very experienced auditors about how they audit complex accounting estimates such as fair values and impairments and what problems they experience in the process. We find that auditors overwhelmingly choose to audit the details of management's estimate rather than use other allowable approaches. The steps auditors describe and the language they use to describe those steps indicate that they follow a process of verifying individual elements of management's assertions on a piecemeal basis, resulting in overreliance on management's process, rather than engaging in a critical analysis of the overall estimate. The problems that auditors identify are consistent with this view, and include failures to notice inconsistencies among the estimate and other internal data or external conditions and overreliance on specialists to identify, evaluate, and challenge critical assumptions. We interpret these processes and problems using institutional theory and identify two root causes: standards' and firm policies' emphasis on verifying management's model, and audit firms' division of knowledge between auditors and specialists. Institutional theory proposes these conventions arise from firms extending use of procedures that are legitimate in one area (i.e., auditing accounts without significant uncertainty) to a new area (i.e., auditing complex estimates), even though they are likely less effective in the new area. These conventions are reinforced by regulators' method of inspection and by firms' reluctance to change methods without a prompt to change to a clearly better method. We argue that these institutionalized conventions thwart auditors' good-faith attempts to engage in skeptical analysis of estimates. Thus, audit quality problems are likely to persist."}, {"e:author": ["Cristiano Busco", "Paolo Quattrone"], "e:volume": "32", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12105/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12105/abstract", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Exploring How the Balanced Scorecard Engages and Unfolds: Articulating the Visual Power of Accounting Inscriptions", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Research on the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) has questioned whether its adoption generates greater integration between financial and nonfinancial performance measures, supports strategy implementation, increases performance and improves strategic decision making.

Results confirm that auditors primarily acquire technical knowledge on the job, through the interactions among individual engagement team members. However, partners express concern about changes in the practice environment that may limit effectiveness of on-the-job learning, including characteristics of personnel, the approach to formal training at induction, supervisors' reluctance to provide candid feedback, regulatory and economic pressures, and the increased distraction, and reduced interpersonal contact associated with the use of information technology.

Specifically, I argue that argument ambiguity and the mix of positive and negative argumentation interact to influence how investors process and, in turn, react to information contained in analysts’ arguments. When positive arguments are unambiguous, I predict and find that investors react to the content of the arguments because they perceive the arguments provide sufficient support for the rating. In this case, investors react more favorably when the report includes strictly positive argumentation (i.e., one-sided argumentation) than when it includes a mix of positive and negative argumentation (i.e., two-sided argumentation). In contrast, when positive arguments are ambiguous, two-sided argumentation acts as a credibility cue and leads to a higher likelihood of investment than one-sided argumentation.

In a typical deal reached, the controlling shareholder agrees to pay share compensation to minority shareholders and, in many cases, also pledges to meet a specific firm performance target (performance commitments). Using this reform setting, we examine the impact of performance commitments on earnings management behavior, and find the following results. First, less profitable firms have greater incentives to make performance commitments that help to reduce the share compensation that controlling shareholders have to pay. Second, firms entering into such commitments engage in earnings management to meet the promised performance target when actual performance falls short, and firms facing greater default costs tend to manage earnings more aggressively. Third, depending on the performance metric stipulated in the commitment contract, firms employ varying methods to manage earnings. We also find that firms that rely on earnings management to meet their performance targets display inferior performance in the postcommitment years relative to firms that do not.

We recruited experienced financial analysts to participate in two experiments that examined the effect of measurement subjectivity classifications on analysts' use of persistence classifications when forecasting earnings items. We find that analysts rely less on an earnings item's persistence classification when measurement subjectivity is high relative to when measurement subjectivity is low.

General negotiation literature suggests that individuals change their behaviors as deadline pressure increases (i.e., when there is less time in which to conduct a negotiation) in order to increase the probability of reaching an agreement. In an audit context, the end-of-engagement deadline is often based on regulatory filing deadlines (e.g., SEC filings for public companies), which are not determined by either negotiating party. The audit context is also unique in that there are asymmetric consequences for each party (the auditor and client management) for failing to reach an agreement and different negotiation tactics used by the two parties potentially leading to differing levels of concessions. We predict that auditors, who are in a stronger negotiation position, will generally concede less than client management when determining their pre-negotiation position and will tend to use more contentious strategies. However, such contentious strategies require time. Thus, we expect, based on negotiation theory, that as deadline pressure increases, auditors' concessionary behavior will be more affected than that of client management. Consistent with expectations, results of our experiment suggest that CFOs concede more than auditors in general; however, auditors are more reactive to deadline pressure and increase concessions when faced with high deadline pressure, while CFOs do not. We also measure planned strategy use and find results to be consistent with theory: when deadline pressure is high, auditors are less likely to use contentious tactics, while CFOs' strategy choices are unaffected by deadline pressure. These results suggest that characteristics of the unique auditor–client negotiation environment, such as deadline pressures, have potentially differential effects on both parties due to the differing negotiation strategies employed by these parties."}, {"e:author": ["Kenneth L.

Results indicate a consistent negative relation between changes in volume of audit work and audit quality. Specifically, clients of offices that experience increases in workload over the prior year have greater absolute discretionary accruals as well as an increased likelihood of restatement. Our tests also indicate that the effect of office growth is transient and vanishes after one year. We find limited evidence that the size of the auditor's national network of offices partially mitigates the negative effects of office growth on audit quality. We further show that proxies for audit quality are negatively related to office-level growth from new and existing clients. These findings are robust to controls for client and auditor characteristics as well as alternative specifications of growth. Taken together, evidence indicates that while larger offices provide higher audit quality, the benefits of office size are not realized immediately and rapid growth temporarily impairs audit quality.

We find that readability in the form of shorter sentences, textual similarity, and lexical diversity are strongly related to decreases in analysts' uncertainty. Further, shorter sentences and lexical diversity improve both public and private information precision, whereas similarity affects solely analysts' private information precision.

In the second half of our sample period, this percentage exceeds that of the first half, rising to almost 64 percent. Although international differences in accounting standards and conventions may have made earnings from different countries more difficult to compare relative to dividends, we find that it is still cross-country differences in expected future profitability, rather than dividend growth rates, that are more closely related to international differences in valuation ratios. Even among 25 emerging markets, we find that expected future profitability at the five-year horizon can account for 29 percent of all cross-country P/B variations.

Yet, managers' restraint is perhaps unwarranted: research has not yet linked instances of aggressive pre-IPO reporting to increased litigation risk. This paper investigates when aggressive IPO reporting triggers legal consequences. Examining 2,037 IPOs, we find that even when ex post evidence indicates the presence of earnings inflation, litigation is more likely to occur when investors have relied on the suspect earnings during the pricing process. Why might investors rely on some firms' abnormal accruals when valuing the IPO and yet discount the abnormal accruals of other firms? Our analyses suggest that IPO investors incorporate abnormal accrual information into IPO prices in situations where accruals are more likely to reflect information and where other sources of information to help investors make pricing decisions are lacking or are less reliable. In these situations, we find that abnormal accruals do positively correlate with future performance, validating investors' use of this information when pricing these offerings. Yet, when ex post performance reveals that these pre-IPO abnormal accruals were in fact inflated, we find that litigation emerges to allow harmed shareholders to recover losses incurred dating back to the pricing process—importantly, investors are only harmed if they used those abnormal accruals in pricing the IPO. Collectively, our evidence indicates that litigation in response to earnings inflation does indeed surface in the IPO setting—but only when investors need it to settle the score."}, {"e:author": ["Steven J.

In the absence of the value statement, participants with piece-rate rewards for correct responses generate more correct and incorrect responses than do their counterparts with fixed pay, correcting errors as they go along to maximize compensation. Essentially, piece-rate compensation acts as an output control, incentivizing participants to maximize correct responses through a “produce-and-improve” strategy. The value statement suppresses this strategy because participants appear to perceive it as an input constraint, prompting greater initial care at the expense of lower overall productivity. As a result, the value statement eliminates the gains in correct responses that piece-rate incentivized participants otherwise realize. Thus, in settings in which individuals can gain efficiency by working expeditiously and improving quality when necessary, our results suggest the possibility that organizations could be better off just letting incentive schemes operate, rather than emphasizing quality in ways that could overly constrain productivity."}, {"e:author": ["Kevin Markle"], "e:volume": "33", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12148/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12148/abstract", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "A Comparison of the Tax‐Motivated Income Shifting of Multinationals in Territorial and Worldwide Countries", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "This paper tests for differences in the tax-motivated income-shifting behaviors of multinationals subject to different systems of taxing foreign earnings.

Results indicate that, on average, firms with a tax-related ICW have a 4 percent higher three-year cash effective tax rate relative to firms without any such weaknesses. Further estimates reveal that this negative relation stems from pervasive, company-level tax ICWs. Analysis of remediation suggests a causal link. I find that after remediating tax-related ICWs, firms report higher levels of tax avoidance in the future.

We provide theory-consistent evidence that current investors' prevention focus makes them elevate the importance of summary earnings in their evaluation of a company.

Institutional theory suggests that the visible nature of the first category is more likely to threaten perceptions of AC legitimacy and hence prompt turnover, which is what we find. We then enrich the analysis by interacting the AC-member ineffectiveness indicators with the extent of shareholder protest votes, finding that shareholder dissent elevates the turnover effects of both categories of ineffectiveness, as institutional theory would predict. Finally, we find that otherwise effective AC members face an increased likelihood of turnover if they serve on the AC when financial reporting failures are discovered, even if they were not on the AC when the events precipitating the failures occurred.

Two factors, the risk of breaching a contract and community impact, are manipulated between-subjects. We find that auditors assess the materiality of an audit difference significantly higher for a financial case than for a water case. This difference is significantly greater when there is no risk of breaching a contract than when there is a risk of breaching a contract. The risk of breaching a contract has a stronger effect on the difference in auditors' materiality assessments when there is no community impact than when there is a community impact.

Bayesian logic shows that the best available information can often leave decision makers less certain about future events.

In this Discussant Comment, I review the paper's content, analyze its predictive validity, and discuss its multiple implications plus, following Conference instructions, I provide constructive suggestions for improvements. Based on predictive validity analysis, I conclude that engagement partner assignment strategy is an important and acknowledged omitted variable that affects the study's internal validity via both the independent variable (partner's prior performance measure) and the dependent variable (borrower's cost of debt capital). The omission also affects construct validities and, if audit firms are applying a plausible assignment strategy, then interpretation of the study's main results would be reversed. Finally, the lack of a standards intervention noted by the authors and the extreme size and other differences between audits of Swedish private companies and U.S. public companies impair external validity and generalization to the U.S. intervention. As to improvements, I suggest that the authors (i) ask Swedish lenders to validate their presumed use of partner performance ratings in determining a borrower's interest rate, and (ii) ask Swedish Big 4 audit firms to provide a few internal partner performance ratings for comparison with the external performance measures used in the study.

Several papers rely on this theory to motivate and interpret tests in a U.S. setting, but these tests are open to multiple interpretations. This paper investigates the extent to which shareholders of U.S. companies are affected by any such rent extraction. The evidence is inconsistent with the tax-avoidance technologies employed by U.S. firms allowing managers to extract sufficient rents to negatively affect future performance. Additional tests on poorly governed U.S. firms find no evidence that tax-avoidance activities relate positively to either overinvestment or higher executive compensation, and no evidence that either complexity or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act moderates the relation between future performance and tax avoidance.

Prior research has generally provided evidence in support of these regulations and suggests that a more independent and expert audit committee is more effective. We posit that CEO power reduces or even eliminates the improvements in audit committee effectiveness resulting from independent and financially expert committee members. Thus, CEO power may result in an audit committee that appears effective in form but is not in substance. We construct a composite index for CEO power by combining ten CEO characteristics and employ the incidence of internal control weaknesses as a proxy for audit committee monitoring quality. Since all the firms in our sample have completely independent audit committees, we use financial expertise to examine the impact of CEO power on audit committee effectiveness. We find that, when CEO power is low, audit committee financial expertise is negatively associated with the incidence of internal control weaknesses. However, as CEO power increases, this association monotonically weakens. When CEO power reaches a sufficiently high level, this association is no longer negative. The moderating effect of CEO power on audit committee effectiveness is more prominent when the CEO extracts more rents from the firm through insider trading. Our results are not driven by the CEO's involvement in director selection. Our paper suggests that more expert audit committees in form do not automatically translate into more effective monitoring.

Pre-FIN 48, we observe that firms reduce their tax reserves (i.e., increase income) when premanaged earnings are below analysts’ forecasts. Specifically, 78 percent of firm-quarters that would have missed the analyst forecast if not for the tax reserve decrease, meet that target when the decrease is included. Furthermore, we find a significant positive association between the decrease in tax reserves and the deviation of premanaged earnings from analysts’ forecasts. In contrast, post-FIN 48, we find no evidence that firms use changes in tax reserves to manage earnings to meet analysts’ forecasts.

An open (closed) internal reporting environment makes it more (less) likely that managers will observe a colleague's communications with senior executives. This increase in what one manager knows about another manager's communication to senior executives could facilitate employee collusion to extract resources from the firm. To test whether internal reporting openness results in more collusion, we conduct an experiment in which two managers each make separate reports to the firm about cost information they know in common but that remains unknown by the firm. Because both managers face the same truth-inducing contract, conventional economic theory predicts that they will not collude to misreport costs regardless of reporting openness. However, using behavioral theory involving trust and reciprocity, we predict and find that managers honor their nonbinding collusive agreements and successfully collude more often in an open versus closed internal reporting environment, leading to lower firm welfare in the open environment.

In response, analysts revise earnings forecasts less for the downward guidance provided by more career-concerned CEOs.

Consistent with our signaling theory, in the high information asymmetry regime, borrowers with high levels of conservatism and tight performance covenants are less likely to make abnormal payouts to shareholders.

We find that our audit fee results are largely driven by contractual alliances. We perform additional tests to rule out the concern that our audit fee results might be attributable to the impact of strategic alliances on distress risk, audit risk, or control risk.

I argue that institutional pressures on nonprofits to provide higher levels of social benefits imply that lower profits should be reported.

As a result, negative NPV projects are kept for too long and their bad performance accumulates, which can lead to stock price crashes. Using a large sample of firms for the period 1993–2010, we find that firms with overconfident CEOs have higher stock price crash risk than firms with nonoverconfident CEOs.

An experiment with 189 nonprofit directors finds that the enhanced transparency of expense disclosures increases director monitoring by reducing the tendency to accept management expense misreporting. Further, an organization's nonfinancial performance and the perceived fairness of donor evaluation focus interact to influence director monitoring practices. Specifically, when directors know an organization's nonfinancial performance is poor and understand that this performance will negatively influence the willingness of donors to contribute, directors monitor less if they think that donors are adopting a more balanced approach to organizational evaluation that focuses on both financial and nonfinancial performance; that is, there is a reverse fair process effect as this donor approach is perceived as being fairer than if donors focus solely on financial performance.

Given that improvements in both comparability and reporting quality are primary stated objectives of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), it is important to understand their relative roles in shaping the information environment of financial statement users following IFRS adoption. Using 1,861 first-time adopters in 23 countries, I find that firms with a larger improvement in comparability have larger increases in Q, liquidity, forecast accuracy, and forecast agreement following adoption, relative to other adopters. In contrast, improvements in reporting quality around adoption appear to have only a second-order effect that is generally limited to Q effects among those adopters with concurrent improvements in comparability. These results are robust to alternative design and variable specifications. Finally, I continue to find these results for samples restricted to countries with weaker pre-adoption institutional environments and countries that did not initiate proactive financial statement reviews, indicating that strong institutions and regulatory improvements are not driving the results.

These goals can be achieved with very light regulation if, as assumed by traditional economic theory, investors process information costlessly and protect themselves from informational disadvantages, and firms optimally balance the costs and benefits of committing to make their reports reliable. A growing body of research demonstrates that light regulation fails to achieve the SEC's goals, because investors find information processing costly and fail to protect themselves. After reviewing theory and prior evidence, I discuss new lessons learned from Jiang, Petroni, and Wang (2016), who show that Pink Sheets® reduced the liquidity of firms with low reporting quality and increased the liquidity of firms with high reporting quality, merely by highlighting the quality of their listed firms’ disclosure.

I conclude by arguing that markets can achieve the SEC's goals only if they exhibit a particularly strong version of “dynamic” market efficiency, which requires that each individual trade on the path to even incomplete revelation occurs at the then-optimal price. Because dynamic efficiency is unlikely, we should stop being surprised to see evidence that lightly regulated markets fall short on key dimensions. Instead, we should use our well-developed understanding of market inefficiency to guide regulation."}, {"e:author": ["Yun Fan", "Xiaotao (Kelvin) Liu"], "e:volume": "34", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12234/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12234/abstract", "e:year": 2017, "e:title": "Misclassifying Core Expenses as Special Items: Cost of Goods Sold or Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses?", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Prior studies of classification shifting in the income statement conclude that managers misclassify core expenses as special items to inflate reported core earnings (McVay 2006; Fan, Barua, Cready, and Thomas 2010).

In comparison, both COGS and SGA misclassification are associated with just beating the benchmarks of zero core earnings, prior-year core earnings, and analyst earnings forecasts in the fourth fiscal quarter. We also investigate real activities management (RAM) of COGS and SGA to meet benchmarks, and find that managers engage in RAM of COGS to achieve the gross margin benchmark, but not core earnings benchmarks.

Second, we estimate herding propensity without seeding a random error, and allow for nonorthogonal information signals. In doing so, we avoid using the analyst's prior forecast as the proxy for his posterior beliefs, which is a traditional criticism in the literature. We find that more than 60 percent of analysts herd toward the prevailing consensus, and herding propensity is associated with various economic factors. We also validate our herding propensity measure by confirming its predictive power in explaining the cross-sectional variation in analysts’ out-of-sample herding behavior and forecast accuracy.

Auditing standards as determined by standard setters can vary in both toughness and vagueness. Our analysis provides implications for the adoption of International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Countries, such as the United States, where auditor legal liability is significantly more onerous than the global norm are not likely to adopt ISA, since these standards may not induce auditors to provide the optimal level of audit quality. Conversely, the adoption of ISA by countries, such as China, where the legal system makes the recovery of damages from auditors quite difficult, is not by itself likely to result in a high level of audit quality.

In one direction, complex group structure and intragroup transactions enable controlling shareholders to pursue diversionary activities that they later hide by distorting reported earnings.

To empirically clarify whether group affiliation affects company insiders' incentives to address minority shareholders' concerns over agency costs, we examine auditor selection of group firms relative to stand-alone firms. In comparison to nongroup firms, our evidence implies that group firms are more likely to appoint Top 10 audit firms in China, especially when their controlling shareholders have stronger incentives to improve external monitoring of the financial reporting process. After isolating group firms, we find that the presence of a Top 10 auditor translates into higher earnings and disclosure quality, higher valuation implications for related-party transactions, and cheaper equity financing, implying that these firms benefit from engaging a high-quality auditor. In additional analysis consistent with our predictions, we find that group firms that are Top 10 clients pay higher audit fees and their controlling shareholders are more constrained against meeting earnings benchmarks through intragroup transactions and siphoning corporate resources at the expense of minority investors.

Focusing on the activities of three institutional bodies in the early twentieth century, the paper documents how their repeated recourse to “publicity,” which relied crucially on accounting technologies, failed to turn the corporation into an entity more sensitive to the public interest. Specifically, two interrelated contributions are made to existing literature on accounting and corporate governance. Firstly, the paper documents the early historical development of the now taken-for-granted phenomenon of accounting and adjudicating at the entity level (Miller and Power 2013). Secondly, the paper offers a rejoinder to present-day projects of corporate governance which identify better and enhanced accountability as key to the successful reform of the corporation. During the progressive era, accounting expanded and territorialized new spaces, bringing trusts out of a hitherto secretive, private realm and into the view of the public.

One of the well-known explanations is a phenomenon called tax avoidance. We develop a grounded theory model of influences on corporate tax planning through a series of 19 in-depth German tax expert interviews. Our research identifies three independent hurdles in the tax planning process, which can help to explain different levels of tax expense across companies. Those three hurdles sequentially address which tax planning methods are available (defined by business characteristics), desirable (given via aims of tax planning), and implementable (determined by tax manager power). A large part of previous research has estimated the influence of firm characteristics, which we incorporate in the broader term business characteristics, on tax expense, while the other influences that we identify have largely been left “out of the equation.” In the light of the current public debates on tax avoidance, we reveal two important findings: First, we find that companies vary widely in the aggressiveness of their aims of tax planning, which contrasts sharply with the picture often drawn by undifferentiated media reports. Second, tax managers can assume very different levels of power in their organization. The implementation of desirable tax planning methods varies depending on this level of tax manager power. In conclusion, our three-hurdle grounded theory provides generalizable insights into important influences on corporate tax planning which help to explain the observed variation in tax expenses across firms."}, {"e:author": ["Greg Capps", "Lisa Koonce", "Brian J.

In this paper, we investigate whether fact-weighting guidance counteracts this tendency. Such guidance, now found in some accounting standards, indicates whether particular transaction facts are more important than others in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. Using an experiment, we find that fact-weighting guidance does reduce preparers' tendency to favor the accounting treatment in an example. However, results also suggest that some degree of example-based reasoning persists even with fact-weighting guidance, and that preparers are not fully aware of how fact-weighting guidance affects their judgments. Our findings have practical implications. They suggest to standard setters a potential remedy—namely, fact-weighting guidance—for the misuse of accounting examples.

Accounting as a means to an end, rather than as an end in itself, is the basic concept on which this essay is based. The ends that accounting serves are control, information for decisions, and an overview, or conspectus, of the enterprise. For these purposes, traditional, transactions-based accounts are useful, because they yield trustworthy reports of resource flows into and out of an enterprise. Government intervention has emphasized and extended the inherent and cost-determined limitations of traditional accounting. Though such critics as Professor Chambers are upset at this situation, they have not shown how or which change would be beneficial, net of costs, to users. Exit values, in particular, are not the philosopher's stone that Professor Chambers seeks. As this essay shows, neither these nor other measures of economic values fulfill Professor Chambers' demands. Though traditional accounting has its limitations, they are debilitating only when one holds unrealistic expectations.

In 1949 Terborgh of the Machinery and Allied Products Institute (MAPI) developed an approximate decision rule for optimal replacement of assets that deteriorate, taking technological change into account explicitly. The simple rule is essentially equivalent to a full discounting analysis under the same assumptions. More than 30 years later it is still used by U.S. firms and, what is perhaps more important, it is still being taught to engineering students throughout North America. DCF analysis is now much more widely used by firms than the MAPI formula (though often only for major replacements) but, unlike the MAPI formula, often with a total lack of understanding of the nature of the replacement problem. This paper exmaines Terborgh's rule on its own terms (assumptions, approximations) and reveals errors in derivation of the rule, by Terborgh and later by Smith (1961). The original rule is tested against the revised form with these errors eliminated over a range of interest rates, technological and other changes, and is found to be remarkably robust.

For this model, management must determine optimal production prior to knowing the actual demand, a stochastic variable with known distribution. Management must choose the production quantity to balance prospects for sales revenue against risks of losses from shortages and from unsold items. This paper develops an expected return on investment criterion model for determining the optimal production quantity. Formulas and solution methods applicable to general demand distributions are obtained. A special solution technique for normally distributed demand is presented.

This paper analyzes the incentive effects of alternative legal systems on the auditor's decision making process. The first system, termed strict liability, holds the auditor liable whenever there is a loss, and the second system, termed negligence, holds the auditor liable for losses arising from the auditor's deviation from a prescribed due care standard. The auditor is assumed to have ex ante limited knowledge of the financial state of the client and the standard setting process. He revises his beliefs on the client's financial state based on a costless signal that may be interpreted as an internal audit report. The analysis shows that signal “quality” and auditor's perception of the client's financial state jointly determine the level of liability required to induce the auditor to adopt a socially optimal due care level. As in Simon's (1982) Model, negligence with supplementary insurance is preferred to strict liability. Further, negligence is shown to operate with less information than strict liability, in contrast to models such as Green (1978) and Shavell (1978)."}, {"e:author": ["KRISHNAGOPAL MENON", "KENNETH B.

This study describes an audit simulation model which is designed to assist auditors in evaluating and documenting the reliability of complex internal control systems.

First, dependencies between error and control processes can be modeled, which allows an auditor to investigate the effects of collusion on system reliability and final balance error amounts.

While factors such as inflation, technological change and growth often have been discussed in connection with the adequacy of provisions for depreciation under a historical cost model, there is another dimension to the capital maintenance problem and it concerns the multiplier effect of depreciation. When an amount equal to depreciation is reinvested, a firm's productive capacity tends to increase. Reinvestment of depreciation also increases a firm's financial capital if book depreciation is more accelerated than economic depreciation. Based on a model developed by Ijiri (1967), this paper derives an index of this growth due to depreciation. The index estimates a bias in conventional depreciation methods that has been overlooked in the literature on the subject. This bias has implications for inflation accounting because if conventional depreciation methods have a built-in growth bias, adjustments for inflation may be a type of double counting. A second implication mentioned concerns the bias in accounting rates of return."}, {"e:author": ["MARK A. COVALESKI", "MARK W. DIRSMITH", "CLINTON E.

The contradictory conclusions of previous studies may stem from their use of empirical research methods (e.g., the market model) with overly strong assumptions. The current study applies an alternative approach; it utilizes a research method which relies on two versions of the second degree stochastic dominance criterion: the standard second degree stochastic dominance and stochastic dominance with lending and borrowing. These criteria examine changes in stockholders' welfare by considering simultaneously risk and possible outcomes in a more general manner. They do not require the assumptions of the market model, nor do they necessitate the estimation of specific risk measures such as stock beta. The stochastic dominance approach is applied to a sample of firms that switched from FIFO to LIFO, and to a control group of firms that did not.

This is because the sales accrual method provides information on management's expectations about future cash flows.

First, it is argued that income measurement cannot, and should not be, abandoned. Second, the discussion emphasizes that the (social) usefulness of information does not depend on stockholder unanimity, the optimality of income maximization, and the structure of markets (such as complete markets). As a corollary, no apparent reasons suggest that any of the latter conditions rule out income measurement as providing useful information. Third, the paper shows how one links economic efficiency to income measurement within a standard neoclassical framework.

Several algorithms have been designed to search for efficient valuation systems. These algorithms, however, do not take advantage of the information contained in the characteristic parameters of the goods to be valued.

This paper empirically assesses the degree to which current cost data as required by Financial Accounting Standards Statement No. 33 might implicitly be used by equity market participants. Studies to date, focusing on income measures, documented little or no effect of the data on prices. We argue here that income was the wrong focus. Instead, because current costs can be used to construct quantity indexes and hence measure real productive growth of the firm, the focus should be on the test of association between real productivity (obtained by use of current cost data) and stock returns rather than between income measures and stock returns. Therefore, this paper tests for whether growth measure (of real productive output) which can be obtained by utilizing current cost information and which cannot be obtained without such information, can explain cross-sectional variation in security returns beyond measures based on historical costs. Returns should be more highly associated with current cost based measures of real productive growth than with similar measures based on historical cost, if the current cost data have value. Like the time-series macroeconomic analysis done by Fama (1981), our cross-sectional microeconomic analysis relying on current cost accounting data suggests that security returns are positively related to real productive activity. Moreover, the tests seem to suggest that current cost data, on the margin, reflect productive activity information that may not be already contained in historical cost accounting data."}, {"e:author": ["CLIFTON BROWN"], "e:volume": "4", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1987.tb00658.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1987.tb00658.x/abstract", "e:year": 1987, "e:title": "Diagnostic inference in performance evaluation: effects of cause and event covariation and similarity", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

Such behavior is controlled, but not eliminated, by the presence of a costly mandated audit, which may detect such cheating. Managers compete for positions in a competitive managerial labor market, and managerial effort is assumed to be observable.

This study explores the firm-size related differential information content of earnings releases by focusing on annual earnings, assuming that the role of firm size as a proxy for the availability of predisclosure information may differ between annual versus quarterly earnings. In addition, it also investigates how abnormal return reactions to annual earnings releases as a function of firm size change around the date of annual earnings releases. The results show that the firm-size related differential information content of earnings releases exists with annual earnings. Specifically, the extent of common stock return reactions on (around) the annual earnings release date is inversely related to firm size, while market reaction to some early predisclosure dates is positively associated with firm size. The inverse relationship begins to show up a week prior to the earnings release date, and the positive relationship exists for days prior to that week.

There exists no empirical evidence on the time-series properties and predictability of general price level (GPL)-adjusted annual earnings data.

That is, application of a random-walk model to the HC series indicated that these series were fairly well-represented by the random walk, but a similar application to the GPL series confirmed that these series were not as well-represented by a random walk."}, {"e:author": ["WAYNE R.

This paper investigates in multiple agent settings the fundamental issue of whether a contractual coordination and incentives mechanism that induces equilibrium behavior is implementable. Implementability means that the mechanism, when put into effect by the principal, produces an equilibrium desired by him in the agents' subgame that is not Pareto-dominated by another equilibrium. Strong implementability of a mechanism means that the equilibrium desired by the principal Pareto-dominates all other equilibria. The main result shows that in a moral hazard setting, strong implementability is guaranteed under regularity conditions imposed on the net profit from joint production, and monotonicity of compensation and production in effort. A substantial class of distribution functions, including the beta distributions, satisfy these regularity conditions. These conditions appear to be “minimal” sufficient. Through examples, it is shown that strong implementability is generally not possible. An example also shows that even if the optimal mechanism relies on a more stringent equilibrium concept (dominant strategy equilibria) it may still be not implementable even if there is a unique equilibrium of the stronger type. The proof of the theorem introduces the technique of the Ky Fan Conditions to check the consistency of systems of inequalities that define equilibria. The paper explores various ways to overcome the implementability problem in analytical models to derive testable propositions in accounting choice settings such as budgeting, transfer pricing, auditing, and setting and enforcing standards."}, {"e:author": ["RONALD A.

The Governmental Accounting Standards Board requires the disclosure of projected benefits and asserts that accumulated benefits severely understate the obligations of a governmental unit.

It is assumed that each agent (division manager) knows the local profit function for the division and has disutility for effort. The principal seeks to maximize firm-wide profits net of the costs of the centrally provided input and compensation to the agents.

This paper analyzes the decision-facilitating role of external accounting reports in large capital markets in which managers are costlessly motivated to act in the best interests of investors. Given homogeneous beliefs, time-additive preferences, and a sufficient variety of tradeable claims, external accounting reports are shown to provide a basis for Pareto improvements (relative to merely reporting dividends) only if those reports provide a means of making better production decisions. In a large economy, with both economy-wide and firm-specific risks, such improvements are shown to occur if the reports reveal events that affect the future productivity of the economy or individual firms or events that will result in economy-wide windfall gains or losses. However, reports that reveal future firm-specific windfall gains or losses have no value, even though they would affect market prices. Furthermore, while resources will be allocated more efficiently if managers have information about the productivity of their firms, the economy can achieve those efficiency gains without reporting firm-specific productivity information to investors, provided that investors hold well-diversified investment portfolios and are aware of each manager's information structure and decision criterion (which is to maximize the “full information” value of their firms)."}, {"e:author": ["RICK ANTLE"], "e:volume": "5", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1988.tb00700.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1988.tb00700.x/abstract", "e:year": 1988, "e:title": "Discussion of “Firm‐specific Information and Efficient Resource Allocation”", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": ["LLOYD R.

This paper investigates the use of variance analysis when inputs are assumed to be substitutable. When input prices change after the budget is formulated, cost minimization behavior requires substitution of relatively cheaper input(s) for the more expensive input(s). An explicit incorporation of this substitution effect is necessary to provide proper incentives to production managers. The traditional variance analysis which depends upon “standards” is tantamount to assuming a fixed proportion production technology, even when inputs are substitutable. Thus the traditional variance analysis can yield a misleading and incorrect analysis which in turn can lead to a nonoptimal input combination. The paper provides a general framework for variance analysis which accounts for and, therefore, encourages substitution. Budgets are “flexible” not only with respect to output levels, but also with respect to input prices. The framework explicitly accounts for a new standard based upon realized conditions. To do so, a duality between production and cost functions is exploited so that the optimal input mix is obtained with ease under different price regimes. Four examples of cost functions are offered. They can be regarded as the new flexible standards which depend on both output levels and input prices."}, {"e:author": ["YAW M.

In addition, the deferred revenue or capitalized expenditure flows after a MAC will exceed the pre-MAC levels that would have resulted from formerly capitalizing or deferring these items. We discuss using deferred tax flows as a proxy for a firm's level of capitalization and deferral. Finally, we test our hypothesis by examining changes in deferred tax flows for a sample of firms that capitalized research and development costs prior to the promulgation of FAS2. The test results indicate that managers actively restored revenue flows and capitalized expenditures for the period immediately following FAS2. Second, smaller firms appear to be more active in this restoration process than larger firms.

Disclosure timeliness is of concern because a report's usefulness may be inversely related to the reporting delay. Although longer delays increase the likelihood that some of the information contained in annual earnings disclosures will be preempted by information from more timely sources, previous research investigating the relation between earnings-disclosure timeliness and the intensity of the associated market reaction has reported mixed results. These inconclusive findings may be at least partially due to the effects of a potentially confounding variable — firm size — which may have offset the reporting delay effect. Large firms usually disclose earnings relatively early, but the associated market reaction tends to be small due to the size effect. Small firms disclose later, but their associated market reaction tends to be high due to the size effect. Consequently, this study employs a multivariate approach, which controls for firm size, in investigating the relationship between the timeliness of annual earnings disclosure and the associated security price reaction. The study's results support the hypothesis that after controlling for firm size, the length of the reporting delay is inversely related to the magnitude of report period price revaluations. That is, longer delays are associated with smaller market reactions, when firm size is held constant. There is some evidence that this relation may be stronger for earnings announcements which convey “bad news.”"}, {"e:author": ["GORDON D.

The relevance of the SFAS 33 data is assessed in two contexts: (1) the association of security returns with inflation-adjusted and historical cost based earnings, and (2) the SFAS 33 data's ability, in a one-period-ahead prediction of security returns in comparison with the traditional historical cost model.

One of the objectives of segment reporting, as expressed in the FASB's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number 14, is to enable investors to improve their assessments of companies' opportunities for future growth. Implicit in this idea are the assumptions that (1) industry membership provides information on companies' growth prospects, and (2) segment data provide incremental information over consolidated data for assessing industry-related growth prospects. This research examines these assumptions by using an informational perspective for earnings. The informational perspective on accounting information posits that a role of accounting data such as earnings is to alter investors' beliefs about a company's future dividend paying ability, as reflected in its prospective cash flows. Specifically, this study shows that the relationship between earnings amounts and current security prices depends on whether the earnings originate from high growth or low growth industries, as defined in the paper. Furthermore, segment data appear to improve the informativeness of such an earnings classification for explaining security prices. The results suggest that investors use information on industry growth prospects in analyzing individual companies, and that segment information plays a useful role in improving such analyses."}, {"e:author": ["BERTRAND HORWITZ"], "e:volume": "5", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1989.tb00727.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1989.tb00727.x/abstract", "e:year": 1989, "e:title": "Discussion of “Attributes of industry, industry segment and firm‐specific information in security valuation”", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": ["MAUREEN McNICHOLS"], "e:volume": "5", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1989.tb00728.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1989.tb00728.x/abstract", "e:year": 1989, "e:title": "Discussion of “Attributes of industry, industry segment and firm‐specific information in security valuation”", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": ["JOSEPH K.

Quarante-cinq vérificateurs expérimentés (chefs de groupe, directeurs et associés) issus de cabinets d'experts-comptables figurant parmi les «huit grands» se sont prêtés à un exercice visant à recueillir leur interprétation des critères de probabilité de la Norme n° 5."}, {"e:author": ["ROBERT H.

In conventional dollar unit sampling (DUS) the “alpha” risk of erroneously rejecting an acceptable accounting population generally can be held to reasonable levels by working with a sufficiently large audit sample. Kaplan (1975) has discussed how such a DUS sample size may be chosen when controlling both the alpha and beta risk. However, as illustrated in this paper, neither Kaplan's procedure nor other previously developed DUS procedures provide a workable method that effectively controls for both the alpha and beta risk with small sample sizes or with accounting populations that have comparable understatement and overstatement errors. This paper presents a hypothesis-testing approach to DUS that provides a solution to this problem. “Power curves” based on a large number of simulation studies of the new approach are presented in order to illustrate the reliability of the approach. Comparisons are also made with the corresponding power curves for two Stringer-based confidence bound methods of DUS. In these comparisons, the new hypothesis-testing approach to DUS appears to provide more favorable audit performance with smaller sample sizes than do the conventional DUS methods, although the primary advantage of the approach lies in its ability to control for both effectiveness (beta risk) and efficiency (alpha risk)."}, {"e:author": ["DAVID R.

Discovery sampling is a frequently used auditing technique. The objective of discovery sampling is to decide whether to accept or reject an audit population for which acceptance is appropriate only if the occurrence rate of serious errors is very low. This objective is met by auditing a sample and accepting only if the sample is free of serious errors. This paper first develops a Bayesian decision theory approach to the discovery sampling problem. Using this approach the auditor optimizes sampling effort according to a decision model that explicitly includes such factors as risk of failure of accepting too high an error rate, losses from wrong decisions, sampling costs, and prior distribution of the error rate. The form of the loss function used includes both linear and quadratic loss functions as special cases. Methods and formulas applicable to various prior distributions for the error rate are obtained.

An explanation is also given for negative market reactions to LIFO adoptions documented by most of the empirical studies of LIFO/FIFO decisions.

In decentralized economies with transaction costs in contracting, it is demonstrated that an endogenous demand exists for the recording of events that affect the firm's value (“historical events”) and for the perpetual maintenance of audit trails to those records. A demand for the aggregation of records into reports (such as the financial statements) is derived from the costliness of the design, implementation and processing of contracts based on the primary data. But if principals do not control the recording or the reporting process, the agents will distort both the records and reports to their advantage. This gives rise to a demand for auditing services, which in turn creates a demand for audit trails, the causal links to verifiable facts underlying the records. Due to the costs of verification, with sufficient penalties and a positive probability of detection, random sample verification is as efficient as exhaustive verification. For random sample verification to be effective, the maintenance of audit trails for the life of the firm is necessary."}, {"e:author": ["PAUL DANOS", "JOHN W. EICHENSEHER", "DORIS L.

The analysis in this paper considers the effects of relaxing regulations that ensure that the proportions of ownership retained by entrepreneurs in new issues are observable to investors. Entrepreneurs, endowed with full ownership of their firms and private information concerning future prospects, seek to share risks with investors able to diversify those risks away. There is a trade-off for entrepreneurs receiving good news between shedding risk and having their shares undervalued by uninformed investors. In equilibrium, an entrepreneur with good news either retains full ownership or sells a portion of his shares at the same price offered by an entrepreneur with bad news. The price in the latter case reflects rational expectations by investors as to the proportion of ownership retained by the entrepreneur conditional on his news. Only in certain cases are Pareto orderings possible across regimes in which ownership retention is either observable or unobservable.

This paper examines the interaction between the signaling and agency aspects of a new issue process, The issuing firm can signal its private information by the choice of an auditor. It also employs an investment banker who is better informed about the market demand for the issue and whose actions in selling the new equity securities are unobservable, In this framework the firm's benefits from signaling depend greatly on the time at which its investment banker acquires his private information, If the banker receives a private signal after signing a binding underwriting contract all asymmetric information problems are resolved via a first best agreement that facilitates a separating equilibrium, Under this scenario the issuer's choice of a higher quality auditor induces the banker to exert more effort in selling the issue and to set a higher offer price. The issuer's signaling opportunities are limited when the banker possesses private information prior to contracting. In this case an inefficient underwriting contract is signed in which the offer price is set below the first-best level.

This paper presents new theoretical results regarding the problem of audit sampling in the presence of nonsampling errors of the first type. When nonsampling errors of the first type exist, standard statistical auditing procedures yield a negatively biased estimate of the true number of errors and dollar amounts associated with those errors. A double-audit sampling plan is introduced here and provides an unbiased estimate of the true number of errors and dollar amounts of those errors in the presence of nonsampling errors of the first type. A new concept of auditor reliability also is defined, and results analogous to those in classical measurement theory are developed for the case of nonsampling errors of the first type.

This paper presents a combined bound procedure for determining such an overall upper bound when using the moment method of monetary unit sampling (MUS). A procedure is also presented for determining optimal sample sizes over several independent accounts. The new combined bound procedure provides the moment method of MUS with the same type of flexibility that is currently available for the Stringer method of MUS. In addition, the new sample size planning procedure provides the combined moment bound with added flexibility and options that are not available when using a combined Stringer bound approach. The effectiveness and efficiency of both procedures has been investigated using 4324 separate simulation studies. The results indicate that the combined upper confidence bounds of the moment method are significantly smaller than those provided by the most attractive Stringer-based combined bound method.

Previous research has shown that analysts' forecasts of quarterly earnings per share (EPS) are more accurate than those of accepted time-series models. In addition, some previous research suggests that, on average, analysts' forecasts tend to be optimistic (i.e., biased). Two explanations for analysts' superiority have been proposed: (1) analysts use more recent information than can time-series models and (2) analysts use forecast-relevant information not included in the time-series of past earnings. This paper provides evidence on a third potential source of analyst superiority: the possibility that humans can use past earnings data to predict future earnings more accurately than can mechanical time-series models. We find that human judges do no worse than accepted time-series models when both use the same information set: namely, the series of past EPS figures. To date, little or no research has attempted to determine why analyst bias might exist. Still, some possible reasons have been forwarded. First, pessimistic forecasts or reports may hinder future efforts of the analyst or the analyst's employer to obtain information from the company being analyzed. Second, forecast data bases may suffer a selection bias if analysts tend to stop following those firms that they perceive as performing poorly. This study proposes, and provides evidence regarding, a third possible explanation for analyst bias: the use of judgmental heuristics by analysts. Many studies have shown that human predictions are often biased because of the use of such heuristics. We present evidence that suggests this may be the case for analysts' forecasts of earnings per share."}, {"e:author": ["STEVEN ALLEN", "RAMACHANDRAN RAMANAN"], "e:volume": "6", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1990.tb00772.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1990.tb00772.x/abstract", "e:year": 1990, "e:title": "Earnings surprises and prior insider trading: Tests of joint informativeness", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

The alternative versions of the t-test found in event studies result from different weighting schemes for abnormal returns, different abnormal return models, and different correlational structures among abnormal returns. In the presence of dependencies among abnormal returns, the generalized least squares t-tests are much more sensitive to the mis-specifications in the abnormal return model than are the nongeneralized t-tests. Therefore, when analyzing contemporaneous returns, particularly with samples exhibiting a large industry concentration, a nongeneralized t-test should be preferred to a generalized least squares t-test because of the dependencies that may exist. Because the generalized least squares t-tests are highly sensitive to errors in specifying an appropriate abnormal return model, a portfolio time-series ordinary least squares regression should be preferred to a generalized least squares regression even when the variance or covariance matrix of abnormal returns can be estimated with a high degree of reliability. In testing for the mean effects, the concern for event period variance increases seems to be unwarranted, and the variance estimators using event period data are inefficient and biased. The issue is not whether variance increases in an event period, but which variance is to be used: that of the event period or of the nonevent period?

The paper reviews and synthesizes modern finance valuation theory and the ways it relates to the valuation of firms and accounting data. These models permit uncertainty and multiple dates, and the concept of intertemporal consistency in equilibria becomes critical. The key conclusions are (1) the basic theoretical insight derives from a powerful condition of no arbitrage; there is no role for complete markets in basic valuation theory; (2) only anticipated dividends can serve as a generically valid capitalization (present value) attribute of a security; (3) the notion of risk is general, and models such as the CAPM occur only as special cases; (4) the notion that one can capitalize cash flows rather than dividends requires additional (relatively stringent) assumptions; (5) existing theory of “pure” earnings under uncertainty lacks unity regarding their meaning and characteristics. It is argued that only one concept of “pure” earnings makes economic sense.

The owner of an asset can abandon its use for resale value provided that a secondary market exists for the asset. The abandonment alternative adds a standby value to the asset. This paper studies the implications of the abandonment alternative for asset valuation. The basic idea is that a real asset can be likened to a call option on the larger of the asset's use value or its exit value. It is shown that a real asset can be valued as the sum of its discounted operating cash flows (or savings) and a put option on the operating cash flows, with an exercise price equal to the asset's exit value. This makes asset exit values relevant to the valuation of the firm's assets and liabilities.

This paper integrates cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis into the theory of capital budgeting by modeling the profit function in the CVP relation as put and call options on sales revenue. Such an approach is shown to be particularly useful when the profit function is piecewise linear, such as when there are multiple break-even points, or when the profit function is truncated. The results are of general applicability because such an approach does not require making assumptions about the decision maker's risk attitude. This claim is proven by showing that certain well-known decision models in the extant literature can be derived as specific cases from the results. The paper also shows how the CVP analysis can be extended to the case in which there is a dependence of the firm's cash flows on macroeconomic variables. Specifically, it applies to the CVP analysis the state-contingent claim approach to capital budgeting of Banz-Miller (1978) and relates the option valuation approach to Banz and Miller's framework.

Recent attention on labor productivity has resulted in many manufacturing concerns negotiating incentive contracts with the labor force. Such incentive contracts provide for management and the work force to share monetary benefits generated by productivity gains. These gain-sharing contracts require a benchmark level of labor productivity from which to assess productivity gains. This paper examines gain-sharing contracts in an agency setting, deriving conditions under which contracts using a performance evaluation measure of a ratio of total labor hours to standard direct labor hours might be optimal. These optimality conditions are characterized in terms of the fixed and variable cost components of the total labor requirement and the standard direct labor requirements. An observed gain-sharing contract based on such a measure is then evaluated using actual production data. The generalized method of moments is employed to estimate the key production parameters, indicating that the optimality conditions are violated. The characterization of optimal gain-sharing contracts thus clarifies the manner in which productivity must be measured if these programs are to provide the proper incentives to the work force."}, {"e:author": ["JOYCE BERG", "DON COURSEY", "JOHN DICKHAUT"], "e:volume": "6", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1990.tb00789.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1990.tb00789.x/abstract", "e:year": 1990, "e:title": "Experimental methods in accounting: A discussion of recurring issues", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Abstract.  “What economic problems do existing accounting institutions solve?” Experimental economics helps to answer this question.

Both theoretical and experimental research has shown that full disclosure of private information will be observed when disclosures are credible. Disclosures are generally considered to be credible when they either are subject to an antifraud rule, are ex post verifiable, or are both. However, little consideration has been given to the individual and interactive effects of these conditions. This paper presents arguments concerning the effects of antifraud rules and ex post verifiability on disclosures of private information and the reaction to those disclosures. It predicts an equilibrium of full disclosure only when an antifraud rule is in effect, independent of the presence or absence of ex post verification. Further, one adverse selection problem is posited to disappear after repeated observations, regardless of antifraud rules or ex post verifiability. These assertions are tested by 20 laboratory experiments, which, in addition, provide insight into the effect of a legal system on disclosures.

The nature of optimal equilibrium contracts for auditors hired by firms to certify the validity of firms' financial reports is studied in this paper. Financial reports may affect the interest rates at which firms can borrow funds; hence, without auditing, firms might be inclined to present favorable, if not altogether accurate, financial information. We observe that an optimal audit contract that allows auditors' contracts to be contingent on the audit report can take different forms depending on the parameter values; only in rare cases is an optimal contract independent of the audit report. Specifically, in some cases, an optimal contract is characterized by a payment for a favorable report that is larger than the payment for an unfavorable report. In other cases, the conclusion is reversed. We note, in contrast to the spirit of agency models, that an audit contract need not function in equilibrium as a motivational device inducing the auditor to work; in some cases, it serves as a means to transfer signaling costs from low-risk firms to high-risk firms. We also provide a rationale for mandating noncontingent audit contracts. In some circumstances equilibria in which auditing is informative cannot exist when contingent contracting is allowed; once contracts are required to be noncontingent, however, there exist equilibria in which auditing is informative."}, {"e:author": ["GERALD A.

A theory of intrafirm allocation under information asymmetry based on Myerson's general theory of mechanisms is developed. From the general model, it is shown that every Myerson equilibrium resource allocation mechanism is a “cost plus” type of transfer pricing. Specializing the general model to allow risk-neutral agents, we derive the exact form of the compensation schemes in dominant strategy equilibrium transfer pricing mechanism. The general Myerson agency problem is transformed into a central planner's problem enabling us to bypass the first-order approach to the problem. The closed form solution shows that each of the agents' compensation schemes is composed of a profit-sharing component, a cost refund, taxes, and subsidies, making it a Groves-like scheme. Additional results show that if the principal is asymmetrically informed about one of the agents only, the agent may derive rent from private information under monotonic compensation schemes, and we provide additional conditions under which Hirshleifer's classical marginal cost pricing is in equilibrium."}, {"e:author": ["MARK PENNO"], "e:volume": "7", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1990.tb00802.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1990.tb00802.x/abstract", "e:year": 1990, "e:title": "Discussion of “Intrafirm resource allocation: The economics of transfer pricing and cost allocation in accounting”", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": ["RAMJI BALAKRISHNAN"], "e:volume": "7", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1990.tb00803.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1990.tb00803.x/abstract", "e:year": 1990, "e:title": "The role of budgets and variances in repeated investment decisions", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Abstract.  This paper considers investment in a two-period principal-agent model. In each period the agent has pertinent pre- and postdecision information about the returns from the project. Messages from the agent are interpreted as a budget and a self-reported variance. The paper examines when the sequential resolution of the uncertainty in profits would, by itself, result in a long-term contract. This focus is maintained by eliminating any role for learning or consumption smoothing in the contracting arrangement. Because they allow for commitment to future investment strategies contingent on current-period reports, relative to short-term contracts, long-term contracts exhibit efficiency gains. There is an endogenous demand for both budget and variance reports. By considering an N-period model, gains from long-term contracting are shown to be positively related to the principal's flexibility in committing to future investment strategies that are contingent on the agent's prior period report(s). Sequential resolution of the agent's uncertainty, either within or across periods, strictly enhances the demand for long-term contracting.

To detect a location shift in leptokurtic residuals, a nonparametric rank test may be more efficient than a parametric t-test. Event studies that use a nonparametric test generally use the sign test, the Wilcoxon test, or some variation of the Wilcoxon test. The sign and Wilcoxon test statistics are calculated from the event-period residuals, so skewness and potential cross-sectional dependencies are not accounted for, causing a concern about the reliability of these tests for event studies. In this paper we propose a Mann-Whitney (MW) rank statistic in which the rank of the event-period residual is calculated relative to the estimation-period residuals. The MW statistic is a nonparametric analogue of the standardized residual (the residual scaled by its estimated standard deviation) used in the parametric (Patell-type) t-test. The MW statistics enable us to account correctly for skewness as well as potential cross-sectional correlation, and they are more powerful than the sign, Wilcoxon, and standardized residual statistics in detecting a location shift in leptokurtic residuals. Our results are based on a Monte Carlo study of simulated residuals. We simulate cross-sectionally independent residuals (for noncontemporaneous events) and cross-sectionally correlated residuals (for contemporaneous events)."}, {"e:author": ["A.

This paper examines three possible specification problems with the research on information content of earnings disclosure. The first deals with the extent to which contemporaneous prediction errors are good surrogates for revisions of future earnings expectations and, hence, distributions of cash flows. This problem is elucidated by evaluating analysts' revisions of future earnings expectations as “relevant omitted variables.” The results show that the quality of such surrogation is high in the first quarter but low in the second. The second problem concerns the degree to which analysts' earnings forecasts are good surrogates for the market's own earnings expectations. Unbiasedness and orthogonality are the two properties examined. Although analysts' forecasts satisfy the unbiasedness property, the necessary condition of orthogonality is not satisfied. Hence, analysts' earnings forecasts are not Muthian rational expectations (i.e., they are not good surrogates for market forecasts). Consequently, the explanatory power of known empirical results is likely to be understated."}, {"e:author": ["JUDY RAYBURN"], "e:volume": "7", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1990.tb00806.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1990.tb00806.x/abstract", "e:year": 1990, "e:title": "Discussion of “Specification problems with information content of earnings: Revisions and rationality of expectations and self‐selection bias”", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": ["RAY BALL"], "e:volume": "7", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1990.tb00807.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1990.tb00807.x/abstract", "e:year": 1990, "e:title": "Discussion of “Specification problems with information content of earnings: Revisions and rationality of expectations and self‐selection bias”", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": ["WAYNE R.

Cumulative average residuals are used to detect the announcement effects of large earnings forecast revisions. The main results of this study are the following. First, an investor with access to changes of earnings per share forecasts at the beginning of the month of publication could realize abnormal excess returns. Second, trading strategies based on earnings forecasts revisions can also yield abnormal returns, but the magnitude of the revision, the sector of the company, and the month in which the revision is realized must be considered. Third, when financial analysts' forecasts are published, the informational content of large revisions in forecasts has already been discounted by the market. This result is similar to findings of U.S.– and U.K.–based studies. Finally, large forecasts revisions coincide with a period of abnormal returns. However, the information content of the announcement of forecasts changes cannot be established. The gains are larger if the trade is undertaken before the diffusion of the forecast revision to the IBES subscribers. These results do not vary with the model chosen to predict company returns.

The American Auditing Standards Board recently modified the standard form auditor's report in the United States. Neither Leslie's recommendation nor universal definitions of materiality were adopted.

This study investigates the translation of foreign financial statements in inflationary economies. The analysis is conducted by comparing the results obtained from the temporal and current rate methods to the translated adjusted-for-inflation (TAI) financial statements under varying degrees of purchasing power parity. The findings indicate that under perfect purchasing power parity, the temporal method yields undistorted results versus TAI. The current rate method, however, results in a distortion. When the purchasing power parity degree is not perfect, both the current rate and temporal methods distort the results. However, if the inflation exceeds the devaluation of the local currency, translation using the temporal method results in a lower distortion. This result is reversed when the devaluation of the local currency exceeds the rate of inflation. The study then proceeds to examine, from the viewpoint of a standard-setting body, the translation models in a cost-benefit framework. The results indicate that TAI is usually the best. This result is due to the fact that the benchmark model is more informative than the other methods, and the information production costs are close to the costs under the temporal method. Further, if the rate of inflation exceeds the devaluation of the local currency, the temporal method dominates the current rate method. The opposite holds if the devaluation of the local currency exceeds the rate of inflation. Moreover, this study examines the implications of CICA Handbook. Section 1650.

Results from an experiment with 64 audit partners from six firms were consistent with the hypothesis that audit partners employ the same (compensatory) judgment process when making footnote disclosure decisions as when making additional paragraph decisions. This process led the partners to make judgments for the additional paragraph decision that were in accordance with SAS No. 58. In contrast, their judgments for the footnote disclosure decision were consistent with a decision theory model of auditor behavior rather than the noncompensatory process implied by SFAS No. 5.

The paper develops a simple and parsimonious model that relates earnings and unexpected earnings to market returns. The analysis emphasizes that any model under uncertainty must be consistent with the theory of value, earnings, and dividends under certainty (i.e., Hicksian income theory). An extension of this theory exists such that the model subsumes uncertainty. The Hicksian approach is useful because it embeds key dividend irrelevancy concepts due to Modigliani and Miller (1961), and these can be retained under uncertainty. An interesting empirical proposition can be inferred from the model: earnings, rather than the change in earnings, ought to serve as a premier exploratory variable of returns. This contention is consistent with some recent empirical findings due to Easton and Harris (1991)."}, {"e:author": ["DAN S. DHALIWAL", "KYUNG J. LEE", "NEIL L.

A recent article in this journal (Hsieh, Ferris, and Chen, 1990) presents evidence demonstrating that financially distressed firms that terminate overfunded pension plans experience significantly positive abnormal returns, while nondistressed terminating firms experience returns not different from zero. The article concludes from this evidence that the market regards the property rights to excess assets as residing fully with the sponsoring firm prior to termination, particularly when the sponsoring firm is not financially distressed. Accordingly, the reporting requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 88, which require immediate recognition of gains resulting from termination, are inconsistent with the market's view of the ownership rights to excess plan assets. Similarly, the article suggests that the excise tax imposed on asset reversions is “punitive” because property rights to fund assets resided with the company prior to termination. This paper questions three aspects of the Hsieh, Ferris, and Chen article: (1) the plausibility of the theory explaining differential reaction to the announcement to terminate for distressed and nondistressed firms; (2) the effect of the distressed/nondistressed classification criteria, event date specification, and event window length on the results; and (3) the appropriateness of using the empirical results, if reliable, to evaluate accounting treatment or federal tax policy."}, {"e:author": ["S.

This paper explores restrictions in private lending agreements to determine how contractors' status affects (1) the number of limitations on managerial actions and (2) tightness (or slack) of contract restrictions at contract inception. The major result of the multivariate tests is that highly leveraged borrowers are forced to negotiate agreements with both more numerous and tighter restrictions. Debt contracts represent a series of rational trade-offs. Firms with higher debt face more restrictions, which are tighter and more likely to restrict managerial actions. Similarly, borrowers are more likely to agree to tighter extensive restrictions in exchange for more substantial loans. The evidence also indicates that larger firms that possess greater resources to avoid default are able to negotíate looser agreements that contain fewer restrictions. Secured loans do not impose a large number of accounting-based restrictions on managements' actions because secured lenders have less need to restrict managements' options. However, long-term agreements, including insurance loans, include more restrictions on dividends and payout options but use covenant ratios to allow management the flexibility needed over the course of a long-term loan."}, {"e:author": ["JOHN S.

The key advantage of the MCDM model developed here is that an optimal solution is obtained without requiring ex ante specification of a loss function by the auditor. Thus, the model addresses a previously recognized problem (e.g., Menzefricke, 1984) that loss functions may vary depending on characteristics of the audit. In this paper, we develop a model of the auditor's sampling plan selection problem incorporating multiple decision criteria, use the model under a variety of simulated audit conditions, and compare our results with previous research."}, {"e:author": [], "e:volume": "8", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1991.tb00847.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1991.tb00847.x/abstract", "e:year": 1991, "e:title": "Book Reviews/Compte rendu de livres", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Book reviewed in this article:"}, {"e:author": ["RAJIV D.

This article examines the value of communication in a setting in which the owner and the manager of a firm differentially share the costs and benefits of information acquisition. Absent communication, the optimal contract induces allocative distortions to enhance the information content (about whether the manager expended effort in searching for additional information pertinent to the allocation decision) of the observed output. Communication has value because it reduces the value of the information externality in the observed output and, thus, reduces allocative distortions. Hence, the results lend support to the use of accounting reports (e.g., budgets) and ex post monitoring of decisions (e.g., an internal audit) in managerial performance evaluation. However, unless the manager's search is observable, it is optimal to use the information in the observed outcomes in compensating the manager. This finding highlights that the optimality of observed resource allocation practices cannot be evaluated independently of the larger problem of motivating the manager to acquire pertinent information because the information acquisition and resource allocation problems cannot be decomposed."}, {"e:author": ["ALISON J.

This paper reports the results of an empirical investigation of the effect of firm size on the magnitude of the long-window earnings response coefficient (ERC). In contrast to earlier studies, we find that size is positively related to the magnitude of the long-window ERC. This result was robust across alternative event windows (12, 15, and 24-months). The argument advanced in the literature has been that since more information is available throughout the year for large firms, a less pronounced market reaction occurs at the earnings announcement date. Our result is not inconsistent with this since we examined the relationship over a long window. It appears that the greater availability of alternative information sources and increased search activities about large firms, rather than resulting in a weaker ERC for large firms, may actually enhance or strengthen the magnitude of the long-window ERC. Our intepretation of this finding is that the broader set of information available about large firms enables market participants to interpret the information in the financial statements more completely and to estimate future cash flows more accurately, leading to a decreased level of system uncertainty. In addition, we present evidence that the largest response coefficients are for large nonsurvivor firms while the smallest are for small firms, both survivors and nonsurvivors."}, {"e:author": ["HOWARD D.

This study considers the welfare effects of line-of-business (LOB) reporting by firms operating in imperfectly competitive markets. The analysis is based on a two-period model in which a multisegment firm, labeled the incumbent, operates as a monopolist in two markets in the first period and then competes against an entrant in each of the two markets in the second period. The incumbent obtains private information in the first period. LOB reporting fully reveals that information to the entrants; aggregate reporting only partially reveals the incumbent's information. The second-period consequences on firms and consumers parallel results previously available from the information-sharing literature. These results serve to explain why some firms opposed the imposition of LOB reporting by accounting rule-making bodies. The incumbent may distort first-period production in an attempt to influence entrant beliefs. However, such distortions lower the incumbent's expected first-period profit and result in no gains in the second period.

The forecast is constrained by the extent to which the accounting system reflects the private information, and the extent to which estimates regarding the private information are available from other sources, such as financial analysts. The market assesses the credibility of the forecast in setting the price of the firm's stock. A partially separating equilibrium is presented. The implications of the equilibrium are consistent with empirical regularities concerning the market's reaction to management forecasts. In particular, a majority of management forecasts contain good news, forecasts containing bad news are more credible than forecasts containing good news, and stock price reactions are stronger for firms that are not followed by financial analysts. Analysis of investor returns suggests that although a more effective accounting system reduces the variance of returns, it also skews them to the left.

A key characteristic of the reporting of private management information is that managers do not always report their information, and they reveal or withhold both “good” and “bad” news. Several recent papers provide models of managers' voluntary disclosure decisions. These models are typically constructed so that managers do not always disclose or withhold their information, despite rational behavior by both the privately informed managers and interested uninformed parties external to the firm. Our paper seeks to contribute further to this literature by developing a richer model of the forces that might influence a manager's decision to disclose private information. Our model is a direct extension of the model in Darrough and Stoughton (1990). In our model, there is a continuum of possible private incumbent signals and the entrant may be privately informed about the cost of entry. Partial disclosure of private information results from the tension that exists between an informed manager's desire to communicate good news to (and hide bad news from) the capital market and his desire to communicate bad news to (and hide good news from) competitors in the firm's product market."}, {"e:author": ["ED NOSAL"], "e:volume": "9", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1992.tb00870.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1992.tb00870.x/abstract", "e:year": 1992, "e:title": "Discussion of “Voluntary financial disclosure in an entry game with continua of types”", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": ["PAUL J.

Subjects were given endowments and made tax reporting decisions subject to monetary penalties for underpayment of taxes and uncertainty about the amount of taxable income and the tax agency's cutoff point for audit selection. Two types of tax audit regimes were considered. In the first (nonstrategic audit regime), subjects faced a fixed probability of audit selection. A second (strategic) audit regime also was examined in which the probability of audit selection varied in response to tax reports as in the Reinganum and Wilde (1988), Beck and Jung (1989b), and Jung (1991a) models. Five hypotheses based on the comparative statics predictions of the models were tested and four were supported by the experimental data. Among the noteworthy findings are that tax rate changes have significant effects on reporting decisions under both audit regimes, rather than just under the strategic audit regime as hypothesized. A reduction (increase) in taxable income uncertainty induces subjects to report a low level of income significantly more (less) often under strategic auditing, but does not have a significant effect on income reports when audit policies are nonstrategic. The effects of changes in the level of uncertainty about the audit cutoff point are also investigated and found to depend upon the benefit of conducting an audit. Finally, we find that subjects generally report a low income more frequently than predicted by either the strategic or nonstrategic models."}, {"e:author": ["ALAN MACNAUGHTON"], "e:volume": "9", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1992.tb00872.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1992.tb00872.x/abstract", "e:year": 1992, "e:title": "Fringe benefits and employee expenses: Tax planning and neutral tax policy", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

One theoretical approach recently emphasized in the accounting literature is positive accounting theory. Synonymous with this theoretical view are the 1978 and 1979 articles published by Ross Watts and Jerold Zimmerman. These two articles prompted criticism from three different perspectives. There are critiques that refer to technical research methods problems, critiques concerned with philosophy of science issues, and critiques centered on the limitations of economics-based accounting research. In their 1990 article, Watts and Zimmerman responded to most of the published critiques. They specifically claimed that methodological criticisms have failed to have any influence on accounting research. This paper provides a critical examination and assessment of these alleged failures by examining two types of critiques, economics-based critiques and those based on issues of the philosophy of science. The critiques discussed include those to which Watts and Zimmerman responded as well as several other critiques that either Watts and Zimmerman failed to discuss or that were not published until after their 1990 article appeared. Positive accounting theory is shown to be applied economic positivism. Tracing the historical background of positive accounting research through its economic roots shows that the “positive” aspect of the Watts and Zimmerman approach is more rhetoric than methodology. It is argued that positive accounting theory does represent a problem shift toward a domain of research that is appropriate for Chicago School economics. A review of the published critiques of positive accounting theory shows that although critiques based on philosophy of science may not be very effective, economics-based critiques that emphasize the limitations of equilibrium-based economic analysis offer a promising avenue for methodological critiques of positive accounting theory."}, {"e:author": ["LAWRENCE A.

In an experimental lab design for a sample of 88 auditors from a national public accounting firm, actual underreporting on an audit task was observed. Findings show that underreporting is systematically related to the auditor's level of moral reasoning as measured by the Defining Issues Test (DIT).

Results also show that although an unattainable time budget affects behavior, peer pressure has the most significant impact on underreporting. The present study makes three important contributions to the auditing and psychology literature. First, it establishes the significance of peer pressure as an antecedent to underreporting.

For trade relief to be granted, the International Trade Commission must find that the domestic industry has been injured by the foreign industry behavior. An inquiry into injury includes an assessment of the profitability of the domestic industry. We believe this provides an incentive to semiconductor firms to “manage” accruals to report lower earnings in 1985.

The role of accounting information in investment decision making and capital markets has been investigated by exploring fundamental connections between accounting numbers and market-based phenomena of interest. Studies of bond rating predictions have described how bond raters make their judgments as a function of accounting and other data. This study expands our knowledge of these fundamental connections by investigating whether bond ratings have a direct impact on bond yields and how accounting information impacts the bond yields—directly, or indirectly through the bond ratings. A simultaneous equation system is constructed using firm-specific financial information, bond ratings by two major rating agencies, and initial offering yields. The sample used in this study consists of 189 new issue industrial bonds rated by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's that were issued from 1981 through 1985. Tests of alternative structural model configurations provide evidence regarding the interrelations between bond ratings, financial information, and bond yields. The improvements in the statistical methodology lead to a better understanding and assessment of the relative roles of bond ratings and financial information in setting bond prices. The use of simultaneous equation modeling allows the interrelations among yields, ratings, and financial information to be assessed and allows the direct and indirect effect of financial information on yields to be estimated. This results in the ability to conclude that financial information affects bond ratings, that bond ratings directly affect bond yields, that financial information also directly affects bond yields, and that financial information indirectly affects bond yields through its effect on ratings. The role of accounting information in setting bond market prices is clarified using this approach."}, {"e:author": ["RAMESH CHANDRA"], "e:volume": "9", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1992.tb00880.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1992.tb00880.x/abstract", "e:year": 1992, "e:title": "Discussion of “Bond ratings, bond yields, and financial information”", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": ["GORDON D.

Much work has been directed to develop aggregate efficiency measures for firms or decision-making units (DMUs) in which we are able to observe only the outputs and inputs. Assuming that each DMU has the same type of observed outputs and inputs and using only this information, Farrell's technical efficiency and the CCR ratio can be used to assign an aggregate measure of efficiency to each DMU, which can then be used to compare the efficiency of the DMUs. This paper considers a subset of the general aggregate efficiency problem called the matched output/input case in which each output is matched to exactly one input, forming a subunit. Dividing the output by the input for each subunit within a DMU yields a subunit ratio that is the output per unit input. For a particular subunit, the subunit ratios for two DMUs can be compared directly. If all the subunit ratios of one DMU exceed the corresponding subunit ratios in another DMU, then we should reasonably expect that any aggregate efficiency measure has the efficiency of the first DMU greater than the efficiency of the other DMU. This requirement is defined as the Matched Output/Input Axiom, which is then shown to be violated for certain data sets satisfying Simpson's Paradox. Both Farrell's technical efficiency and the CCR ratio are then shown to violate the Matched Output/Input Axiom, which raises questions about the overall validity of both procedures."}, {"e:author": ["RAJIV D.

Several studies have documented a significant association between firm size and cumulative abnormal returns surrounding quarterly earnings announcements, after controlling for unexpected earnings. The sign of the association depends on the sign of unexpected earnings. Specifically, in a regression of cumulative abnormal returns on unexpected earnings and firm size, the coefficient on firm size is negative for observations with positive unexpected earnings and is positive for observations with negative unexpected earnings. These results hold after adjusting returns for the firm size return effect. In the absence of an economic rationale for firm size per se to be priced in this manner, we draw on extant capital market literature to identify two potential explanations for the signed-size effect. Each suggests that firm size may be proxying for some misspecification of the relation between cumulative abnormal returns and unexpected earnings: measurement error in the researcher's proxy for unexpected earnings and constrained estimation of earnings response coefficients. The signed-size effect remains after incorporating numerous procedures to mitigate the influence of each of these misspecifications. We develop implications of ignoring the anomalous signed-size effect for studies investigating the association between cumulative abnormal returns and unexpected earnings. Studies affected are those that omit firm size (the estimated earnings response coefficient is biased upward), include firm size as a linear additive variable (the estimated coefficient on firm size is generally not interpretable), and include other variables correlated with firm size (their estimated coefficients are generally biased)."}, {"e:author": ["VERONIQUE MAZAY", "TREVOR WILKINS", "IAN ZIMMER"], "e:volume": "10", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1993.tb00381.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1993.tb00381.x/abstract", "e:year": 1993, "e:title": "Determinants of the Choice of Accounting for Investments in Associated Companies", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

This paper extends the growing literature on factors affecting cross-sectional and intertemporal variation in earnings response coefficients. It tests the empirical implications of recent theoretical work by Choi and Salamon (1989) and Holthausen and Verrecchia (1988), who model the degree of price adjustment associated with earnings announcements as a function of the amount of noise or garbling in the accounting earnings signal relative to valuation-relevant cash flows or dividends. The particular earnings measurements considered relate to U.S. multinational companies and to the differences in income determination under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 8 and SFAS No. 52. The study finds a modestly smaller relative price adjustment for a given amount of unexpected earnings for multinational firms than for nonmultinationals during the SFAS No. 8 period. This finding is consistent with multinationals producing “noisier” earnings signals during this time period. However, several indirect measures suggest that there was greater prior probability uncertainty associated with the future cash flows or dividends of the nonmultinational sample. Accordingly, this cannot be ruled out as a competing explanation for the observed differences in the market's response to earnings signals during the SFAS No. 8 period. Following the implementation of SFAS No. 52, the earnings response coefficient increased substantively for firms whose accounting for translation gains or losses was most affected by this standard. These results suggest that the earnings measurements produced under SFAS No. 52 were perceived by market participants to be of higher quality (less noisy) than those produced under SFAS No. 8. The framework and analysis in this paper hold promise for investigating the relative informativeness of earnings signals produced under alternative income determination rules."}, {"e:author": ["JENNIFER L.

Account balances are typically subjected to separate audit procedures (e.g., accounts receivable and inventory). Two or more assertions about a single financial balance may be subjected to separate tests (e. g., completeness and existence). Two or more transaction streams combining to form a single balance (e. g., sales on account and cash receipts on account combine into accounts receivable) may be tested separately. A financial balance may be subdivided into two or more account components for separate testing (e.g., retail accounts receivable and wholesale accounts receivable). In all of these audit testing scenarios, the question arises as to the appropriate way to combine or aggregate the evidence gathered from separate tests of subpopulations into an overall conclusion about the amount of audit risk being borne, that is, the risk of a material amount of misstatement remaining undetected in the overall population at the conclusion of such separate audit tests. A number of algorithms and heuristics have been proposed for combining audit risks at the subpopulation level into overall risk conclusions about audit risk at a more aggregate level. Some of the heuristics involve piecemeal evaluation of individual subpopulations to draw overall conclusions about the financial statements as a whole. This paper analyzes one such approach, the Poisson distribution-based “max rule,” for combining judgments of audit risk based on tests of subpopulations. This prescription has been interpreted to mean that the overall risk of material misstatement in a population is the maximum of the audit risks computed with respect to the individual subpopulations, but we believe that such an interpretation is incorrect. Furthermore, given the literature that has promoted the max rule, some auditors could misapply the concurrency property of the Poisson distribution. Although the max rule may be justified at the planning stages of the audit, we show that, if it is used at the evaluation stage of the audit, it can lead to underestimation of the upper error limit and overall risk faced upon completing tests of subpopulations and should not be used to evaluate results of audit procedures applied to subpopulations to draw overall audit conclusions."}, {"e:author": ["PETER CHENG", "DANIEL COULOMBE"], "e:volume": "10", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1993.tb00392.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1993.tb00392.x/abstract", "e:year": 1993, "e:title": "Voluntary Income‐Increasing Accounting Changes", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

This paper examines the choice of return-generating models for event studies with contemporaneous event periods and industry clustering (CEPIC). The importance of specifying an appropriate return generating model in event studies with CEPIC is demonstrated by showing that if the return-generating model is the two-factor model, inferences based on the market model are invalid. Evidence that the two-factor model is a better return-generating model is presented. Both the analytical results and empirical evidence support the finding in Chandra and Balachandran (1990) that inferences using generalized least squares (OLS) on the market model are very sensitive to return-generating model misspecifications. The results in this paper indicate that the findings in earlier event studies with CEPIC based on the market model need to be interpreted with caution. Further, the contemporaneous dependencies in the two-factor model residuals are found significant for the majority of the sampled industries. That is, the industry index in the two-factor model cannot remove all the cross-correlations in the market-model residuals. Therefore, even with the two-factor model as the return-generating model, GLS may he a preferred method for estimation and inferences, and the test statistic for inferences has to be robust to the presence of cross-sectional dependencies. Finally, using an error components model, it is shown that the industry factor can explain on average 6.7 percent and 11.5 percent of variations in market model residuals, for daily and weekly returns, respectively. This implies that the industry effects are too important to ignore in event studies with CEPIC."}, {"e:author": ["RAMJI BALAKRISHNAN", "DOUGLAS V.

However, once implemented, these “standards,” if not adhered to, may have profound legal ramifications. This paper reports on a behavioral study of these issues. The subjects were 82 U.S. general jurisdiction judges. Findings indicate that the jurists did rely on internal firm guidance when evaluating injured-party claims."}, {"e:author": ["MARIO J.

Few studies have examined auditors' decisions to use internal auditors as assistants. In addition, those that have investigated this issue have primarily concentrated on the three internal audit factors: objectivity, competence, and work performed. This study expands the research in this area by investigating the impact of inherent risk on auditors' decisions to use internal auditors as assistants. Specifically, the study examines the effect of inherent risk on (1) the extent to which auditors consider factors related to the internal audit function in making decisions to use internal auditors as assistants and (2) the complexity of auditors' decision processes in making such judgments. The results indicate that inherent risk impacts the extent to which internal audit objectivity and work performed affect auditors' decisions to use internal auditors as assistants. In high inherent risk conditions, the results suggest that auditors use a complex configural decision process to evaluate the objectivity and work performed of the internal auditors. Specifically, in the high inherent risk condition, the effect of the work performed by the internal auditors on auditors' decisions to use internal auditors as assistants is contingent upon the level of internal audit objectivity. When objectivity is high, differences in the nature of the work performed by the internal auditors have a significant effect on auditor judgments. However, when objectivity is low, auditors do not appear to consider the work performed by the internal auditors. In the low inherent risk condition, no interactions exist between internal audit objectivity and work performed as auditors appear to use a less complex decision process in evaluating these variables."}, {"e:author": ["JOHN WATERHOUSE", "MICHAEL GIBBINS", "ALAN J.

Adequate disclosure of risks and uncertainties is an issue of interest to the accounting profession and regulators both in Canada and in the United States.

Auditors in the United States are still required to disclose material uncertainties in the audit report. The criterion of predictive ability is used in this research to evaluate the potential usefulness of this report modification requirement. Specifically, the study examines the ability of report modifications to predict the materially adverse resolutions of pending litigation. The subsequent resolution patterns for a sample of litigation loss contingencies (with an audit report modification) and a control sample of litigation loss contingencies (without an audit report modification) were compared.

This paper examines a two-consumption date principal/agent model in which the manager receives private information at the first date. After observing his private information, the manager (agent) selects both the capital and personal effort he will invest in production. Operating cash flows are realized at both dates and any uninvested funds at the initial date are either paid out as a dividend to the equityholders (principal) or invested in zero net present value investments that require no effort. The aggregate cash flow at the second date is paid out as a dividend to the equityholders. The compensation contract specifies the manager's compensation as a function of the information available at the two dates. The key issue is whether it is valuable to have the contract based on the agent's communication of his private information. As in a single-consumption date model, communication may permit the implementation of more efficient incentives with respect to the manager's action choices. In addition, communication can facilitate the smoothing of the manager's consumption over the two dates. Direct communication can have positive value, but the analysis identifies a number of factors that can result in communication having no value. These factors include no direct preference for effort, public reporting of the private information at the second date, access to personal investments, and access to a dividend policy that will costlessly convey the private information through first-date dividends. Although access to personal investments may make communication redundant (since it is an alternative means of smoothing consumption), the analysis identifies conditions under which the equityholders would prefer to use communication and restrict the manager's access to personal investments (since it can have a negative effect on incentives)."}, {"e:author": ["STEVEN HUDDART"], "e:volume": "9", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1993.tb00906.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1993.tb00906.x/abstract", "e:year": 1993, "e:title": "Discussion of “Communication in Multiperiod Agencies with Production and Financial Decisions”", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": ["Jean Bédard", "Tony Dimnik"], "e:volume": "9", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1993.tb00907.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1993.tb00907.x/abstract", "e:year": 1993, "e:title": "Howard M.

The issues examined are how to deal with time intervals with no trading, the choice of abnormal returns measurement, and the choice of statistical tests to determine if there is a significant price change, the increase in power of the statistical tests that can be attained from examining intraday rather than daily intervals. In conclusion, the best methods to detect price reactions at the intraday level are not the same as those that are currently standard practice for detecting price changes at the daily level.

The occurrence of conglomerate mergers is somewhat of a mystery. This paper presents a model demonstrating a tax motive for these mergers. Specifically, conglomerate mergers are unions between firms with not highly correlated earning prospects—when one merger partner underperforms (earning inadequate income) in the future, the other is likely to overperform. By amalgamating such firms into common taxable entities, conglomerate mergers create several tax benefits: (1) improved chances that future tax write-offs and credits will be immediately utilized in full rather than deferred as less valuable loss-carryforwards; (2) reduced chances that tax write-offs and credits are permanently lost in bankruptcy; and (3) an enhanced ability to write off the interest on additional debt Empirical support for these results are presented. Given (1) and (2), the U.S. tax law changes in 1981 and 1986 would respectively encourage and discourage merger activity, outcomes that were indeed observed. Consistent with (3), a cross-sectional examination of U.S. mergers shows that mergers were more likely to increase consolidated leverage when earnings of the predecessor firms were less highly correlated. Nontax-related bankruptcy costs are not specifically modeled, but firms whose potential tax write-offs and credits are larger tend to have lower preference for leverage. Thus, in many instances diminishing bankruptcy risk is not a motive for conglomeration, but full utilization of tax write-offs is."}, {"e:author": ["MARK A.

Consumption taxes of various forms are of increasing importance worldwide. This study employs a laboratory market design to investigate differential market reactions to three consumption tax forms while holding all other factors constant. Ten laboratory markets were conducted, each involving nine volunteer participants. Market participants were randomly assigned to roles analogous to wholesalers, retailers, or consumers of a market good. The three tax forms were (1) a sales tax imposed on retail consumers of a commodity, (2) a gross-receipts tax imposed on retail sellers, and (3) a value-added tax imposed on sellers at two levels of production. At least three markets were conducted under each tax regime as a basis for experimental comparison. The tax rates used in each structure were chosen so that a competitive model would predict different equilibrium prices but the same tax burdens (the sum of explicit and implicit taxes) across the three tax regimes. Results generally support these predictions, with somewhat stronger support for equivalent tax revenues (explicit taxes collected) than for equivalent tax incidence (distribution of tax burdens after price adjustments). Observed tax incidence differences suggest that market agents who are called upon to explicitly pay taxes actually bear relatively lower tax burdens after implicit tax price adjustments.

The credibility of individual commercial borrowers, which lenders refer to as “character,” affects lenders' use of accounting information. This effect of source credibility is subtle compared to the effect of external audits on the use of financial statements in other contexts. It is hypothesized that accounting facts must be positive (supporting loan approval) for character facts to influence lenders' judgments and loan decisions. Character facts will not affect judgments or loan decisions significantly when accounting facts are negative (supporting loan denial). This accounting/character interaction is predicted to become stronger as lenders gain experience and develop criteria for evaluating character. In an experiment, lenders read a loan application that contained facts concerning accounting, character, and other information; the accounting and character facts were manipulated to be either positive or negative, resulting in four versions of the application. The lenders recommended approval or denial of the loan and estimated the likelihood that the loan would be fully repaid (a risk estimate). Interactive effects of accounting and character facts on lenders' loan decisions and risk estimates were found, but the accounting/character interactions generally did not vary with experience level. One notable difference was that experienced lenders never approved loans when accounting facts were negative, but inexperienced lenders sometimes did."}, {"e:author": ["PHILIP R.

La crédibilité des différents emprunteurs commerciaux, que les prêteurs assimilent à la notion de ≪ conduite ≫, influe sur l'utilisation que font ces derniers de l'information comptable. L'incidence de la crédibilité de la source est subtile par rapport à celle de l'opinion des vérificateurs externes sur l'utilisation des états financiers dans d'autres contextes. L'auteur pose l'hypothèse selon laquelle les faits comptables doivent être positifs (c'est-à-dire avaliser le prêt) pour que les faits relatifs à la conduite des emprunteurs influent sur les jugements des prêteurs et sur leurs décisions de prêt. Les faits liés à la conduite des emprunteurs n'auront pas d'incidence appréciable sur les jugements ou les décisions de prêt si les faits comptables sont négatifs (c'est-à-dire qu'ils incitent le prêteur à refuser le prêt). Cette interaction entre les faits comptables et la conduite des emprunteurs devrait s'accentuer à mesure que les prêteurs acquièrent de l'expérience et élaborent des critères qui leur permettent d'évaluer cette conduite. L'auteur s'est livré à une expérience dans le cadre de laquelle des prêteurs ont lu une demande de crédit qui contenait certains faits d'ordre comptable, des faits relatifs à la conduite de l'emprunteur et divers autres renseignements; les faits comptables et les faits portant sur la conduite ont été manipulés de façon qu'ils soient tantôt positifs, tantôt négatifs, ce qui a donné lieu à quatre versions de la demande de crédit. Les prêteurs recommandaient ensuite l'autorisation ou le refus du prêt et estimaient la probabilité que ce dernier soit intégralement remboursé (estimation du risque). L'expérience a permis d'établir les conséquences interactives des faits comptables et des faits liés à la conduite des emprunteurs sur les décisions de prêt et les estimations du risque formulées par les prêteurs, mais les interactions entre les faits comptables et la conduite ne variaient pas, de façon générale, avec le niveau d'expérience. Une différence est cependant digne de mention: les prêteurs expérimentés n'ont jamais autorisé de prêts lorsque les faits comptables étaient négatifs, ce qui n'est pas toujours le cas des prêteurs inexpérimentés."}, {"e:author": ["GARY JOHN PREVITS", "ROBERT BRICKER"], "e:volume": "10", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1994.tb00408.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1994.tb00408.x/abstract", "e:year": 1994, "e:title": "Fact and Theory in Accounting History: Presentmindedness and Capital Market Research", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Abstract.  Recent studies have begun to apply contemporary capital markets methods to historical, archival accounting data. This paper discusses period-specific issues relevant to such research. The general categories of issues considered are agency relationships and the capital market environment, trading practices, regulation, and corporate information disclosure. These contextual issues are discussed as they relate to the following business conditions in the United States during the first decade of the 20th century. First, the population characteristics of security holders were different, and a “money trust” comprised of investment bankers often controlled large corporations. This implies that careful thought needs to be given to assumptions about the role of publicly available information and “retail” investors in securities trading. Second, trading practices were quite different: stock price manipulation was tolerated, as were “wash” and “matching” securities transactions. These conditions, coupled with corporate disclosure of dubious quality and widespread colored financial press reporting, create difficulties in interpreting security price and trading activity. Third, while financial reporting regulation was minimal during the early 1900s, it is unclear whether government threats of regulation may have been regarded as sufficiently plausible by companies so as to motivate “voluntary” behavior. These facts suggest that contemporary researchers choosing to conduct capital market studies using data from historical time periods must fully consider the context of the period under study in designing their study, selecting data, interpreting results, deriving new theory, and drawing policy implications."}, {"e:author": ["JAYNE M.

Before 1986 Australian companies' unregulated foreign currency accounting practices were diverse. Firms variously recognised exchange rate gains or losses on foreign currency long-term debt (1) as the exchange rate moved, (2) when the debt was settled, or (3) progressively over the term of the debt. This study tests empirically whether the voluntary accounting policy choices were endogenous to contractual equilibria between claimants against the firm and management. Managers' choices are explained as an efficient means to report the impact on debt and equity values from exchange rate movement effects on the value of investments in foreign currency earning assets domiciled in Australia. The study finds that asset specificity and the ratio of firms' investments in assets in place to growth options are significant in explaining the accounting policy choice. Firms used accounting methods that provided accounting exchange rate hedges concurrent with their economic exchange rate hedges of specialised assets in place."}, {"e:author": ["KUMAR SIVAKUMAR", "GREGORY WAYMIRE"], "e:volume": "10", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1994.tb00410.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1994.tb00410.x/abstract", "e:year": 1994, "e:title": "Voluntary Interim Disclosure by Early 20th Century NYSE Industrials", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Abstract.  This paper examines stock market behavior associated with interim earnings and marketing-production disclosures by NYSE industrial corporations during 1905–10. Mean stock price changes are examined to assess whether these firms were more likely to disclose favorable information. We also examine the magnitude of price changes and trading volume to provide evidence on the credibility of these disclosures as perceived by investors. The sample and time period we examine enable us to evaluate the stock market effects of interim disclosures in a discretionary disclosure environment. We find no evidence that these firms were more likely to selectively disclose favorable interim information based on contemporaneous stock price changes. Also, no significant differences are detected in the incidence of interim disclosure before dividend or annual earnings increases compared to dividend cuts/omissions or annual earnings declines. We also document increased trading volume in the announcement week and prior weeks, but significant price changes are restricted to the preannouncement period. These results are driven by firms that do not frequently disclose interim information, and these firms' disclosures are frequently accompanied by concurrent news items (in particular, new financings). Price and volume results are weakly sensitive to the exclusion of cases with concurrent news items. Collectively, our results suggest no systematic tendency to disclose favorable information and managerial disclosures were at least partially credible in the early 20th century disclosure environment."}, {"e:author": ["CHEE W.

Running a test of significance has become equated with scientific rigour and the touchstone for establishing knowledge. This article focuses on two related publication system biases that have emanated from holding this episteme: the bias against publishing studies failing to attain statistical significance (i.e., “negative results”) and the tendency to equate scientific significance with statistical significance. It is argued that the emphasis placed on obtaining statistical significance is misguided because statistical significance is not always a prerequisite, nor is it ever sufficient in establishing research findings as scientifically valuable or meaningful. In addition, negative result studies are capable of making a valuable contribution to science and their systematic omission impedes the advance of the discipline. Consequently, statistical significance is found to be a poor criterion on which to base publication decisions. The article also surveys the budgeting, participation, and performance evaluation areas of managerial accounting research to determine whether evidence of these biases exists in accounting. The findings are consistent with the operation of both biases. Some approaches for counteracting or eliminating these biases are examined; as a first step, it is recommended that statistical significance be replaced with the criterion of reasonable precision."}, {"e:author": ["CAROL A.

The auditee seeks to maximize expected successful fraud net of a fixed sanction for detected fraud. The auditor seeks to minimize expected costs from sampling and fraud losses. Both simultaneous play and commitment versions of the game are analyzed. For each version, pure strategies are optimal. In comparison with simultaneous play, the commitment version equilibrium results in greater audit effort and less fraud by the auditee. Comparative statics showing effects of sanction level and recovery rates are derived.

This article investigates the relationship between supplier concentration and competition in the market for audit services. The study is motivated by the concern that high levels of concentration may be detrimental, resulting in lower levels of competition, which could harm clients through higher fees and lower levels of service. However, a counterargument is that high levels of concentration may not be detrimental but may result because market leaders display exceptional performance, providing lower-priced audits (perhaps due to economies of scale) and/or enhanced service to clients. We obtained audit fee and financial data on 140 life and health insurance companies and 101 property and casualty insurance companies. Our findings indicate that concentration is negatively associated with fees, suggesting that higher levels of concentration are related to higher levels of price competition (i.e., lower fees). Additionally, we address the validity of concentration as a surrogate for competition by examining competition among the market leaders. Our analysis examines the fees paid by 47 insurance companies that switched auditors during the sample period. We investigate the effect of industry specialization on fees paid by clients that switch auditors, finding evidence of significant fee cutting among market leaders for each others' clients but no evidence of fee reductions for clients switching from nonleaders to market leaders. This is consistent with the claim that there is significant price competition for clients among the market leaders, suggesting that high concentration need not result in low levels of price competition (i.e., higher fees)."}, {"e:author": ["JEFFREY W.

Auditors, regulators, and academics are interested in the pricing practice of “lowballing” and its relationship to auditor independence. Several analytical models have examined these issues. However, these theories have gone untested primarily due to a lack of field data concerning important environmental variables. In this study, a multiperiod model of lowballing and independence is developed and tested in laboratory markets via the experimental economics methodology. The study contributes to the literature in two respects. First, it represents one of the first studies providing empirical evidence and theory testing of the relationship between lowballing and independence. Second, the model presents a new rationale for low-ball pricing and its relationship to auditor independence. Lowballing and impairment of independence, occurring without exogenous transaction costs, are caused by positing cross-sectional variation in audit cost and quality and an informational advantage that accrues to an incumbent auditor-client pair regarding future variation in these audit dimensions. The model is operationalized in a multiperiod laboratory market consisting of multiple sellers and buyers. Sixteen markets are conducted to test price and reporting predictions of the model. The markets strongly exhibit lowballing behavior, but the exact price predictions are generally not supported. The markets also support reporting predictions, with sellers deviating from truthful reporting (impairing their independence) only when additional future profits are greater than the additional cost of misreporting.

Les vérificateurs, les responsables de la réglementation et les universitaires s'intéressent à la pratique du ≪ leurre-prix ≫ et à sa relation avec l'objectivité du vérificateur.

Leur étude vient enrichir la documentation existante sous deux rapports. D'abord, il s'agit de l'une des premières études à produire une argumentation empirique et à expérimenter la théorie de la relation entre la pratique du leurre-prix et l'objectivité. Ensuite, le modèle repose sur un raisonnement nouveau relatif à la pratique du leurre-prix et à sa relation avec l'objectivité du vérificateur. La pratique du leurre-prix et l'atteinte à l'objectivité, qui se manifestent indépendamment des coûts exogènes des opérations, sont le résultat de la prémisse d'une variation transversale dans les coûts et la qualité de la vérification et d'un avantage relatif à l'information qui échoit à un couple vérificateur attitré-client en ce qui a trait à l'évolution de ces dimensions de la vérification. Les auteurs ont appliqué le modèle pendant un certain nombre de périodes à des marchés de laboratoire réunissant plusieurs acheteurs et plusieurs vendeurs.

L'expérience est concluante quant à la pratique du leurre-prix, mais elle n'est pas convaincante en ce qui a trait à la prévision exacte des prix. L'expérience confirme également la validité des prévisions relatives à l'information communiquée, les vendeurs ne s'éloignant de la vérité (et faisant une entorse à l'objectivité) que lorsque les profits supplémentaires qu'ils sont susceptibles d'en retirer sont supérieurs aux coûts supplémentaires que risque d'entraîner la communication d'information inexacte.

In addition, it provides finer evidence than prior U.S. studies as to the audit procedures that first signaled the misstatements. Large dollar-value misstatements, found to be concentrated in relatively few accounts, arose primarily from judgment errors or biases (poor or unreasonable estimates made in the presence of adequate accounting information) or errors made in the performance of cutoff or accrual procedures. Substantive tests of detail and three sets of attention-directing procedures initially signaled the majority of the large dollar-value misstatements. The results suggest that nonrecurring activities such as cutoffs and valuations appear to be inherently more risky than recurring transactions and, therefore, warrant special attention when planning and performing audit procedures.

We regress unexpected announcement period returns on unexpected earnings and compare the results for seasonal firms—those with sales consistently concentrated in the same quarter each year—to those of other firms. For seasonal firms, we find robust evidence of a greater regression intercept and some evidence of a greater earnings response coefficient in peak sales quarters than in nonpeak quarters. These results are consistent with a greater resolution of the uncertainty about seasonal firms' prospects in their peak sales quarters than in other quarters. Our evidence also shows that fourth-quarter earnings announcements have smaller stock price response coefficients than do interim announcements. Some prior has found smaller fourth-quarter earnings response coefficients for small but not large firms. We find some evidence that fourth-quarter earnings response coefficients are smaller than interim-quarter response coefficients for large firms as well as for small firms.

This article reports the results of an investigation into the informativeness of financial communications with shareholders when the level of market uncertainty regarding future firm performance varies. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the informativeness of annual reports is positively associated with the level of market uncertainty. The informativeness of annual reports is measured by the extent of price reaction, regardless of direction, at the time of disclosure. To obtain a sample of firms with temporal variation in the level of market uncertainty, the article investigates firms nearing financial distress. Financial distress is represented by the firm's receipt of a going-concern audit report from the external auditor. Time periods immediately preceding receipt of the going-concern report are presumed to exhibit changing market uncertainty regarding future firm prospects. The empirical evidence is consistent with the article's hypothesis in that price reactions to annual reports systematically vary the nearer the firms are to financial distress. Specifically, price reactions to annual reports for the three years preceding distress are more than 35 percent larger than the price reactions to reports from earlier periods. This evidence is consistent with the informativeness of financial disclosures being dependent on the level of market uncertainty and advances our understanding of the usefulness of accounting disclosures to market participants.

Generally accepted auditing standards, auditing textbooks, and firm audit manuals indicate that, other things equal, the presence of significant monetary incentives based on financial results increases the inherent risk of material misstatement, and higher inherent risk should ordinarily cause the auditor to exercise a heightened degree of professional skepticism in conducting the audit. This article addresses the following basic research question: Are auditors sensitive to management's incentives to manage earnings? Research that examines whether auditors distinguish between explanations provided by managers with different incentives is important because audit standards indicate that inquiry of management can assist the auditor in evaluating significant unexpected differences. Two experiments were conducted. The first experiment explored whether management-buyout-induced incentives to make income-decreasing accruals affect auditors' judgments of the probability that a material misstatement exists. As predicted, auditors were sensitive to these incentives. The second experiment explored whether bonus-induced incentives affect auditors' judgments of the probability that a material misstatement exists. The auditors agreed that bonus plans such as the one in the experiment create incentives for management to make income-increasing or income-decreasing accruals depending on the terms of the plan. However, the auditors' judgments were unaffected by whether the unexpected difference and management's incentives were congruent. The auditors opted for potential audit effectiveness rather than potential audit efficiency by assuming that—on balance—management had incentives congruent with the unexpected overstatement."}, {"e:author": ["PETER M.

In this study, we appeal to theories advanced by Darrough and Stoughton (1990) to enhance our understanding of why some firms may voluntarily include directional forecasts in their annual reports while others do not. The data are consistent with their predictions that a firm's disclosure policy reflects its concern for both financial market valuation and product market competition. We find that for “good news firms, the probability of forecasting is increasing in the financing requirements but decreasing in the threat of competitor entry. The converse holds for “bad news” firms. These results lend further empirical support to the observation that the familiar good news hypothesis tested in the management earnings forecast literature offers only a partial explanation for the decision to forecast. Interestingly, however, even after controlling for financial and product market considerations, an overall voluntary disclosure bias still exists in the data. The data also provide support for the OSC's concern about a voluntary disclosure bias. Only 17.5 percent of our sample forecasts represent revisions downward relative to the previous year's results. However, in contrast to the OSC's concern about a general lack of forward-looking disclosures in annual reports, 35.9 percent of our sample firms include directional forecasts in their MD&A or elsewhere in the annual report."}, {"e:author": ["PETER M.

Les auteurs font appel aux théories proposées par Darrough et Stoughton (1990) afin de mieux comprendre pourquoi certaines entreprises incorporent volontairement des prévisions directionnelles à leurs rapports annuels alors que d'autres s'en abstiennent. Les données qu'ils recueillent sont conformes à leurs prédictions selon lesquelles la politique d'information d'une entreprise reflète ses préoccupations à l'égard de la cote d'évaluation que lui attribue le marché des capitaux et à l'égard de la concurrence à laquelle elle doit faire face sur le marché des produits. Les auteurs constatent que pour les entreprises dont l'information est favorable, la probabilité de produire de l'information prévisionnelle croît lorsque l'entreprise a besoin de capitaux, mais décroît lorsqu'un nouveau concurrent menace d'entrer sur le marché. L'inverse est vrai pour les entreprises dont l'information est défavorable. Ces résultats viennent étayer plus solidement, sur le plan empirique, l'observation selon laquelle l'hypothèse familière de l'information favorable vérifiée dans les travaux portant sur la prévision des résultats par la direction n'offre qu'une explication partielle à la décision de produire de l'information prévisionnelle.

This study provides further evidence about whether accounting choice decisions reflect a consistent strategy to manage income by investigating the relation between methods used in financial reports and lobbying positions on accounting for income taxes. A numerical income-strategy score is calculated for each lobbyist based on whether the firm chose an income-increasing or income-decreasing alternative for the following: depreciation, inventory, investment tax credit, and pension amortization. We find that firms lobbying for no tax allocation, the most income-increasing alternative, have higher average income strategies (more income increasing) than firms lobbying for comprehensive allocation, the most income-decreasing alternative. Combining the firms favoring either no allocation or partial allocation (due to the conceptual similarity of these alternatives), we find that their average income strategy score is also higher than firms favoring comprehensive allocation. Further, firms favoring discounting deferred taxes, which would ordinarily increase net income by reducing the deferred portion of income tax expense, employ more income-increasing strategies than firms opposed to discounting. In contrast, the hypothesized relationship was not found between income strategy and when the benefits anticipated from the use of a net operating loss carryforward should be recognized. Nevertheless, the combined lobbying positions differ significantly between both the upper and lower third and upper and middle third of the firms classified by their income strategy scores.

In investigating whether learning occurred, I explored the issues of auditor efficiency and effectiveness. To study auditor learning over an extended period in a real task and incentive setting, I employed archival data from a Big Six firm. The benefits of exploring the effects of “real-life” auditor behavior without interference by the researcher come at a cost. Using archival data poses several methodological questions that do not usually have to be addressed by behavioral accounting researchers. Thus, the tradeoffs involved in the archival approach to studying auditor behavior are explored. In addition, this article provides descriptive information about an audit setting not studied to date: the central research unit. This setting involves having auditors examine financial accounting problems, an activity not well understood by audit researchers.

This article examines the tax-compliance game between taxpayers, a tax-collecting agency, and third-party tax-return preparers. In our model, taxpayers are uncertain about their taxable income and may hire tax practitioners to reduce tax uncertainty. We examine the viability of tax practitioners as a signaling device (taking into account the effects on the behavior of the tax-collecting agency) and investigate the desirability of encouraging (or discouraging) the use of tax practitioners via the use of alternative tax-crediting rules. Our study establishes that tax crediting enables legislators to deal better with the consequences of taxpayers' strategic reporting. We show that the effects of changes in crediting rates cannot be replicated by changes in tax rates or penalties; the government would generally like to “price discriminate” in subsidizing tax practitioners' involvement in the tax-compliance process. It is suboptimal to permit all taxpayers to take a tax credit for preparers' fees; some taxpayers should be denied such a subsidy. Further, if the government is constrained to adopt an identical credit schedule for all taxpayers, it will often find that a policy allowing no tax credit Pareto dominates any uniform crediting policy."}, {"e:author": ["HAIM FALK"], "e:volume": "11", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1994.tb00457.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1994.tb00457.x/abstract", "e:year": 1994, "e:title": "International Accounting: A Quest for Research", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

Previous work on hypothesis generation demonstrates that auditors tend to generate frequently occurring financial statement errors as their initial hypotheses to explain unexpected fluctuations. However, such work does not examine how the initially generated hypothesis affects subsequent performance at identifying an actual error. We hypothesized that the initially generated hypothesis would interfere with an auditor's ability to subsequently switch to a different hypothesis. Thus, if the initial hypothesis were incorrect, auditors would find it difficult to switch hypotheses in order to identify an actual error. Moreover, initially generating a frequent error would exacerbate this difficulty. Auditor-subjects were asked to generate an initial error hypothesis after seeing a pattern of fluctuations in which sales and accounts receivable were overstated. After they generated their initial hypothesis, half of the subjects were provided with additional information that was consistent with a very frequent error (sales cutoff) and the other half were provided with information consistent with an infrequent error (sales recorded twice). As expected, we found that initially generating the very frequent error (i.e., sales cutoff) versus some other less frequent error affected auditors' subsequent performance at identifying actual errors. Specifically, auditors who generated the very frequent error as their initial hypothesis performed best when it was the actual error, but performed worst when the infrequent error was the actual error. In contrast, auditors who generated a less frequent error as their initial hypothesis performed moderately well (i.e., between best and worst) both when the actual error was frequent and when it was infrequent.

Les travaux antérieurs qui ont porté sur la formulation d'hypothèses démontrent que les vérificateurs ont tendance, dans la formulation de leurs hypothèses initiales, à attribuer les fluctuations imprévues aux erreurs qui se produisent fréquemment dans les états financiers.

Les auteurs avancent que l'hypothèse formulée au départ et la capacité des vérificateurs de passer par la suite à une hypothèse différente interfèrent.

Plus précisément, les vérificateurs qui invoquaient l'erreur très fréquente dans leur hypothèse initiale obtenaient les meilleurs résultats lorsque cette erreur était l'erreur véritable, mais ils obtenaient les résultats les moins bons lorsque l'erreur peu fréquente se trouvait être l'erreur véritable. Les vérificateurs qui invoquaient une erreur moins fréquente dans leur hypothèse initiale affichaient, pour leur part, une performance relativement bonne (c'est-à-dire se situant entre la performance la meilleure et la performance la moins bonne), aussi bien lorsque l'erreur véritable était fréquente que lorsqu'elle était peu fréquente.

This study investigates the relation between disclosure policy and liquidity in equity markets. Disclosure policy influences market liquidity because uninformed investors “price protect” against adverse selection, and this price protection is manifested in market liquidity. Bid-ask spreads, the empirical measure of market liquidity used in this study, are predicted to be inversely related to disclosure policy. In addition, increased trading by informed traders and higher probability of information event occurrence are predicted to both increase spreads and intensify the relation between spreads and disclosure policy. These predictions apply during periods in which no news about the firm is disclosed or pending. The results show that relative bid-ask spreads for firms with disclosure rankings in the bottom third of the empirical distribution are approximately 50 percent higher than spreads for firms with disclosure rankings in the top third of the empirical distribution. Tests that assume endogenous disclosure policy reveal a significant negative relation between disclosure policy and spreads, even after controlling for the effects of return volatility, trading volume, and share price. Tests for cross-sectional variation in spreads and for the sensitivity of spreads to disclosure policy based on informed trade activity and probability of information event occurrence are generally consistent with the predictions, though these results are not statistically significant.

The analysis indicates that current earnings exhibit high explanatory power for returns if they correlate with expected future earnings (or with other information that reflects expected future earnings). A high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio coupled with a high return on equity (ROE) can ex ante indicate earnings growth, and the earnings of firms with these attributes are positively correlated with future earnings.

This study tests the theory that students' performance on different types of examination questions is related to their level of formal reasoning ability, where formal reasoning refers to their ability to solve different types of problems. The theory of formal reasoning is based on Piaget's theory that the ability to solve problems is related to the maturation process. Piaget argued that young children can solve only the most straightforward types of problems and are not capable of solving complex problems simply because their minds have not developed sufficiently. With maturation, more complex types of problems can be solved. To measure the formal reasoning level of intermediate accounting students, we used an instrument developed by Piaget. Then, we related this level to the marks they received on examinations in several accounting courses. On examination questions that involve only straightforward types of problems, students performed equally well, regardless of their formal reasoning level, but students with higher levels of formal reasoning ability performed significantly better on questions that involve more difficult types of problems. The paper concludes by suggesting that accounting examinations should include more questions that require the use of higher reasoning skills if the accounting profession is to attract more students who have higher levels of reasoning ability."}, {"e:author": ["MARTHA L.

This study expands the existing literature by testing the notion that accounting method choice can affect earnings usefulness for firms engaged in research and development (R&D) activities. We test hypotheses concerning (1) changes in earnings usefulness for firms that switched their R&D accounting method as a result of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 2 (SFAS No. 2); and (2) differences in earnings usefulness between similar firms using different R&D accounting methods prior to the rule change. We find that for our sample of R&D firms, there is a statistically significant decline in earnings usefulness for firms forced to switch from capitalizing to expensing R&D outlays, and that the decline appears to persist over time. In addition, the comparison of earnings usefulness between firms using different R&D accounting methods before SFAS No. 2 indicates that capitalizing firms had significantly higher earnings usefulness than expensing firms."}, {"e:author": ["STEPHEN P.

This study extends the Beck, Davis, and Jung (1992) experimental study by incorporating opportunities for taxpayer subjects to purchase advice before making their tax reporting decisions. Tax advice has two roles in the model and experiment. First, tax advice allows taxpayers to reduce their uncertainty about the amount of taxes owed. This permits us to study the demand for tax advice in conjunction with its effect on tax reporting decisions. Second, the decision to purchase tax advice from an expert provides a means of signaling that may alter tax agency audit policies. The resulting audit policies, in turn, can affect taxpayers' decisions to purchase tax advice. These interdependencies are incorporated in a game-theoretic model and several predictions are tested experimentally. Consistent with theory, subjects sorted themselves into three groups based upon their private information. Another prediction supported by the experiment is that the demand for tax advice increased with the magnitude of an uncertain tax deduction (amount-at-risk). We also found, as expected, that the effects of tax advice on pre-audit tax revenues depend upon the amount-at-risk. When the amount-at-risk was high, subjects in settings with tax advice reported lower average incomes and paid lower taxes than did those subjects in settings without the opportunity to purchase tax advice. The opposite was true for the low amount-at-risk condition, supporting our prediction that tax advice and amount-at-risk would have an interactive effect on tax reporting. Analysis was also performed on post-audit tax collections. Contrary to theory, post-audit tax payments were found to increase when subjects had an opportunity to purchase tax advice. This result apparently was caused by a tendency to over-purchase tax advice and, in some cases, to report a low income regardless of the advice received."}, {"e:author": ["STEVEN J.

We conclude that goodwill is priced as an asset; that asset revaluations, successful efforts accounting for extractive industries, and immediate recognition of foreign currency exchange gains and losses on long-term assets and liabilities are generally uncorrected with the information that investors consider relevant; that U.K., U.S., and Australian tax accounting methods do not recognize ‘enough’ tax expense or liability; and that accrual pension accounting and, in some specifications, interest capitalization add explanatory power beyond Australia's cash-based method. Our findings suggest that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) required GAAP reconciliation reflects information useful to investors for U.K. and Australian firms, and to a more limited extent, for Canadian firms."}, {"e:author": ["SATI P.

We examine variations in the relation between a hospital's level of service capability and the operating costs of its departments and activities (e.g., surgery, laboratory, laundry). We propose a model of the hospital as a set of concentric, interrelated services organized around a core mission to provide patient care. We hypothesize that increases in service capability (i.e., complexity of operations) will increase overall operating costs. At the departmental level, we expect variations in service capability to have a greater cost impact in departments that are closer to the patient. We examine these issues using 1986 data from 154 acute-care hospitals. We disaggregate total operating costs into 18 pools that together account for 84 percent of all operating costs. We find that models with aggregate drivers explain about 90 percent of the variance in overall hospital costs. Complexity is found to be a significant determinant of overall operating costs. At the departmental level, models with department-specific drivers dominate models that employ aggregate drivers. We find that approximately 45 percent of hospital operating costs are significantly associated with the complexity of care provided. There is only limited support for the claim that the effect of the complexity of care provided on operating costs increases as the extent of a department's direct contact with the patient increases. Hence, although our results suggest that the complexity of care should be accounted for in any cost allocation and reimbursement scheme, they also suggest that finding the “right” level of adjustment is a difficult task because complexity differentially affects costs in the various departments."}, {"e:author": ["JEAN‐FRANÇOIS L'HER", "JEAN‐MARC SURET"], "e:volume": "13", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1996.tb00498.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1996.tb00498.x/abstract", "e:year": 1996, "e:title": "Consensus, Dispersion and Security prices", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

Valuation theory recognizes that the relation between earnings innovations and changes in security valuation is increasing in the persistence of the earnings innovations. Analyses in this article reveal that the present value of revisions in expected future benefits is a function of the length of revision horizon, suggesting that earnings persistence is determined, in part, by an entity's going-concern status. These analyses predict an inverse relation between earnings informativeness and an entity's probability of termination. Drawing on a sample of quarterly earnings and returns data from more than 1,500 distinct firms for the period 1981–1990, a statistically significant inverse relation is documented between an entity's probability of termination and the informativeness of earnings—the latter measured as the coefficient from a regression of returns on earnings. Further empirical analyses reveal that this result is a pervasive economic phenomenon not attributable to extreme conditions or other prevailing explanations of earnings informativeness. This inference is robust to variations in research design, including measurement of earnings informativeness and of termination probability and alternative specifications of the relation between returns and earnings. Consequently, the evidence in this article is consistent with a fundamental role for an entity's going-concern status in determining the usefulness of earnings."}, {"e:author": ["LYNDA THOMAN"], "e:volume": "13", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1996.tb00501.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1996.tb00501.x/abstract", "e:year": 1996, "e:title": "Legal Damages and Auditor Efforts", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

It is well known that monitoring information can be used to reduce moral hazard problems. This paper analyzes a model in which the agent can affect the precision (or quality) of the information observed by the principal. In particular, the agent is assumed to be capable of supplying two types of effort: productive effort and effort that reduces the outcome variance. Variance reduction improves the principal's ability to use the outcome to infer the agent's productive effort. However, if the agent's variance-reducing actions are unobservable, a moral hazard problem related to those actions arises. The principal then faces a trade-off between obtaining monitoring benefits from variance reduction and the costs of motivating the agent to choose the desired level of outcome variance. Moreover, the incentives that the principal sets up to motivate the agent to reduce the variance also affect the agent's incentives to increase the outcome. The paper establishes conditions under which the principal motivates the agent to expend nonzero effort in reducing the variance. The incentives for variance reduction depend on the agent's degree of risk aversion and on the feasibility of nonmonotonic contracts. The results explain a variety of observed contracts such as bonus plans, bonus plans with an upper bound, and stock options."}, {"e:author": ["COLIN D.B.

These advantages are timeliness, inclusiveness, and causality. First, experimental methods can be more timely in that experiments can be designed to provide evidence on an ex ante basis. This advantage particularly applies when there are no relevant archival data available and/or no close historical substitutes for a proposed accounting standard. Second, experiments can be more inclusive. They can test a spectrum of standard-setting solutions that the archival approach precludes for lack of available data. Finally, experimental methods can powerfully isolate and measure the direction and strength of cause-effect relations. In their decision making, standard setters require knowledge on the nature and cause of intended and unintended consequences of proposed and already promulgated standards.

We examine the effects of forecast bias and economic stability on the type of information acquired. Our results suggest that individuals are less inclined to acquire unprocessed information as economic stability decreases. Under conditions of economic instability, they are more inclined to acquire processed information, and processed and unprocessed information combined. Forecast bias, on the other hand, does not affect individuals' information acquisition decisions. Individuals appear to recognize the optimism contained in biased forecasts and attempt to adjust for such biases. Our results also suggest that individuals can more effectively use processed information than unprocessed information, regardless of the degree of forecast bias. Our overall findings suggest that individuals acquire forecasts because forecasters are perceived to have superior (processing) abilities.

Using regressions of analysts' earnings forecast revisions on unexpected earnings, unexpected dividends, and five variables that reflect whether the signs of unexpected earnings and dividends confirm or contradict each other, we find evidence of both corroboration and substitution. Analysts' earnings forecast revisions are significantly related to the five corroborative variables, and this relation has statistically significant explanatory power beyond that in the magnitudes of unexpected earnings and unexpected dividends.

In response to increased concerns about audit efficiency and effectiveness, analytical procedures are increasingly being used in place of and as a supplement to substantive tests of details. Despite their increased use, little is known about how analytical procedures are performed in practice.

First, by contributing to a more complete understanding of how analytical procedures are performed, we provide the basis for accounting researchers to identify current analytical procedure problems/issues and, thus, perform more relevant research.

We investigate this possibility using a regression of security returns on unexpected income and an estimate of the change in percent of production added to inventory (CPAI).

Society sets minimum testing amounts and fines for detected theft, whereas the firm determines the employee's wages and the amount of monitoring above the minimum. The results fall into three separate cases. When society's minimum testing standards and fines are sufficiently high, the employee never steals in any period. In this case, the firm performs the minimum amount of testing and pays the lowest feasible wage. In the remaining two cases, the testing standard and fines are too low to prevent theft by themselves. In these two cases the firm's control system determines whether there will be theft in the first period. I show that if the firm chooses to prevent all first-period theft, then it uses only one type of control. She offers a wage premium and monitors the minimum amount. The wage premium substitutes for a tine large enough to prevent all theft. If the firm designs controls that do not prevent all theft, then the firm also uses only one control. In contrast to the no-theft case, the firm pays the lowest feasible wage and monitors above the minimum. This choice reflects the increasing returns to scale of monitoring in preventing theft."}, {"e:author": [], "e:volume": "14", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1997.tb00523.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1997.tb00523.x/abstract", "e:year": 1997, "e:title": "Book Review/Compte rendu de livre", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Book reviewed in this article:"}, {"e:author": ["MICHAEL FIRTH"], "e:volume": "14", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1997.tb00524.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1997.tb00524.x/abstract", "e:year": 1997, "e:title": "The Provision of Nonaudit Services by Accounting Firms to their Audit Clients", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Abstract.  There has been a strong growth in accounting firms' provisions of nonaudit services to their audit clients. To date, however, there have been few studies into the determinants of this joint provision of audit and nonaudit services. One reason for the paucity of research is the lack of publicly available data with which to empirically examine relationships and test theories. However, recent legislation in the United Kingdom requires publication of nonaudit fees paid to a company's auditor, and this disclosure provides the data with which to investigate the joint provision of consultancy and audit services. A model is developed that seeks to explain a company's decision to hire nonaudit services from the auditor. The model argues that companies that face potentially high agency costs purchase relatively smaller amounts of nonaudit services from their auditor. High agency-cost companies require independent audits in order to reassure investors and creditors; the provision of joint services, which increases the economic bonding of the auditor to the client, may jeopardize independence or the appearance of independence. The model is tested using data observations from 500 companies, and the results indicate that companies that have higher agency-cost proxies are associated with smaller purchases of nonaudit services from their auditors."}, {"e:author": ["STEPHEN C.

Accounting research contains two distinct approaches to the interaction between accounting management and the independent auditor. Game theory suggests that the auditor's testing strategy will affect the manager's reporting strategy and that the two strategies form an equilibrium. The game-theoretic approach views the auditor as active, in that the auditor acknowledges the effect that his or her testing strategy has on the manager's reporting. In contrast, in the decision-theoretic approach, the auditor tests reports, but ignores the effect that such testing might have on the manager's reporting behavior. Essentially, the decision-theoretic approach views the auditor as passive, taking the reporting strategy as given when designing tests. We use United Kingdom data to estimate both models and test their validity using nested hypothesis tests. Our results demonstrate that the active, game-theoretic model better describes the auditor-manager interaction.

This paper reports the results of an experiment examining the framing bias and a potential debiasing technique. Practicing auditors formed a judgment about a hypothetical client's inventory internal control system to determine the amount of related substantive testing. Auditors from two Big Six firms were randomly assigned to one of four treatments in a fully crossed 2 times 2 between-subjects design. The initial description of the internal control system was identical for all treatments, as were the items of additional evidence about the system. Auditors either judged the risk of the control system or the strength of the control system. The risk-strength frames were crossed with two levels of debiasing technique: “none” or “evidence rating.” Results indicate that without debiasing, significant framing effects were present, but that evidence rating significantly mitigated the framing effect. In this auditing context, the framing bias appears to be easily induced, but is not robust.

Inherent uncertainty regarding the existence and size of the liabilities creates a setting where outsiders are uncertain if management is informed about these liabilities, so firms can plausibly withhold “bad news”, that is, they do not disclose liabilities that exceed a threshold level. Three novel hypotheses are that a firm is more likely to disclose as (1) its pollution propensity increases, (2) outsiders' knowledge of its environmental liabilities increases, and (3) the risk of incurring proprietary costs decreases.

This study examines the effect of specialization at the different stages of an audit workpaper review. Auditing literature advises focusing each review level on specific kinds of errors (i.e., seniors on mechanical errors and managers on conceptual errors), rather than having seniors and managers perform successive all-encompassing reviews. However, surveys of review practice suggest that all-encompassing reviews are common. To determine whether specialization at different levels of review improves reviewers' overall effectiveness, this study has 35 managers and 39 seniors actually perform a review of a realistic set of workpapers. Half the subjects performed specialized reviews, whereas the other half performed all-encompassing reviews. Overall accuracy rates in our study are consistent with prior research. In addition, the combined reviews of seniors and managers are more effective than those of either seniors or managers separately, demonstrating the benefits of hierarchical review. However, specialized review leads reviewers to be significantly less accurate than reviewers performing all-encompassing reviews. The results suggest specialization will not automatically improve review effectiveness, and that accounting firms may need to re-evaluate their review guidance and professional training on workpaper reviews."}, {"e:author": ["PAUL E.

The accounting method in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 8 for restatement of a foreign operation's financial statements denominated in a foreign currency into the parent's currency equivalents for inclusion in the parent company's financial statements was severely criticized by market participants and managers. Its replacement, SFAS No. 52, represented an attempt to improve on the methods of SFAS No. 8. This study examines two questions: did SFAS No. 8 produce relevant information for valuing US multinational firms, and are the results reported under SFAS No. 52 more valuation relevant than those reported under SFAS No. 8? Valuation relevance is studied because the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has stated that relevance is an important criterion for choosing among alternative accounting methods. Considered collectively, the results suggest that the rules in SFAS No. 8 produced a poor accounting measure for valuing US multinational firms, and that the introduction of SFAS No. 52 has resulted in a significant improvement in the valuation relevance of the accounting numbers associated with the restatement of a foreign operation's financial statements. However, this improvement applies only to the subset of firms that designated a foreign currency as their functional currency (i.e., switched to the current-rate method) and not to firms that designated the dollar as their functional currency (i.e., as if they still reported under SFAS No. 8)."}, {"e:author": ["RICHARD A.

The research is important because it highlights the need to include auditors from several firms in research designs, provides evidence of differences in moral development among public accounting firms, and profiles the professions' average level of moral development for three levels. The data are from 494 managers and seniors (204 females and 290 males) from five Big Six firms. Using the Defining Issues Test (Rest 1979a) to measure moral development, several results were noted. First, the results indicate a difference in the average level of moral development among firms, suggesting that use of subjects from only one firm inhibits the generalizability of findings regarding moral development. Second, female managers are at a significantly higher average level of moral development than male managers. In fact, the average scores for male managers fell between those expected for senior high school and college students. The data suggest that a greater percentage of high-moral-development males and low-moral-development females are leaving public accounting than their respective opposites. These results indicate that the profession has retained, through advancement, males who are potentially less sensitive to the ethical implications of various issues. The analysis also indicates that Kohlberg's (1969) theory of moral development is not biased towards the thought processes of males because female auditors did not score lower on the Defining Issues Test."}, {"e:author": ["STEVEN SALTERIO", "ROSS DENHAM"], "e:volume": "14", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1997.tb00546.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.1997.tb00546.x/abstract", "e:year": 1997, "e:title": "Accounting Consultation Units: An Organizational Memory Analysis", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Abstract.

In this paper we report the results of research that examines the role of accounting consultation units in public accounting firms. We describe the five largest accounting consultation units in Canada. The accounting consultation units are then examined through the lens of organizational memory theory. We find differences among the accounting consultation units in their ability to act as a source of organizational memory for their firms. These differences include the following: the amount of resources devoted to the consultation function, the structure of the units, the mandate received by the unit from the firm, and the availability and amount of documentation about previous consultations. These differences suggest that firms' accounting consultation units differ in their ability to provide technical accounting advice. This variability may affect the actual or perceived quality of such advice to both clients and external regulators. In addition, this paper introduces organizational memory theory to the accounting literature.

Consistent with prior research, we treat audit quality as a dichotomous variable and assume that Big Six auditors are of higher quality than non-Big Six auditors. Earnings management is captured by discretionary accruals that are estimated using a cross-sectional version of the Jones 1991 model. Prior literature suggests that auditors are more likely to object to management's accounting choices that increase earnings (as opposed to decrease earnings) and that auditors are more likely to be sued when they are associated with financial statements that overstate earnings (as compared to understate earnings). Therefore, we hypothesize that clients of non-Big Six auditors report discretionary accruals that increase income relatively more than the discretionary accruals reported by clients of Big Six auditors. This hypothesis is supported by evidence from a sample of 10,379 Big Six and 2,179 non-Big Six firm years. Specifically, clients of non-Big Six auditors report discretionary accruals that are, on average, 1.5-2.1 percent of total assets higher than the discretionary accruals reported by clients of Big Six auditors. Also, consistent with earnings management, we find that the mean and median of the absolute value of discretionary accruals are greater for firms with non-Big Six auditors.

We hypothesize that the net benefits of this disclosure are largest when (1) there is a high degree of stakeholder concern about compensation, (2) compensation policies are defensible, and (3) corporate governance is strong. Consistent with our stakeholder concern prediction, disclosing firms have higher compensation levels and are more apt to have received prior shareholder proposals about executive compensation. Contrary to this prediction, we find a negative association between financial press coverage of compensation policies and the probability of disclosure. Additionally, the disclosure decision is unrelated to the defensibility of compensation policies and the firm's corporate governance profile. Industry-adjusted firm performance, managerial entrenchment, CEO tenure, institutional holdings, and compensation committee independence variables are insignificant. We also compare the financial performance and compensation practices of compensation peers to two yardsticks — performance and pay practices at the sample firms and the corresponding S&P industry index firms. The compensation levels of compensation peers exceed those of the firms in the corresponding S&P industry indexes. Because (1) compensation levels and performance sensitivities at sample firms are more similar to those at compensation peers than to those at S&P industry index firms, and (2) the superior financial performance and higher performance sensitivities of disclosing firms justify high pay, this evidence suggests that the compensation peers of disclosing firms are an appropriate comparison group."}, {"e:author": ["LEONARD C.

When earnings are small compared to book value, the weights are different from when earnings are large relative to book value, and they vary in a nonlinear way over the difference between the two.

By using data on the number of auditors as the measure of audit-firm size, this paper covers all firms active in the two audit markets in the period 1970 to 1994. The results indicate that the more liberal Dutch audit market has the highest dynamic measures of market structure and the highest concentration. Hence, the results show that high concentration can go hand in hand with high-market-share mobility and high audit-firm entry and exit. The results for market-share mobility also hold for an analysis including only the largest audit firms.

We extend the theoretical work of Gal-Or 1986 to incorporate an endogenous imprecise cost signal in two imperfect market structures: Cournot competition and Bertrand competition with imperfectly substitutable products. In addition, we theoretically link market structure to product market strategy. To examine product market strategy, we employ a laboratory markets design that allows for strategic reaction by a rival firm in each of these markets, because the competitive position of a firm is determined by its capacity to produce at low cost, or to differentiate its product from other products (Porter 1985). Consistent with our theoretical work, we argue that firms that compete on the basis of cost leadership (which we demonstrate may be characterized as Cournot competition), benefit through increased profits from increased product cost accuracy, whereas firms that compete on the basis of product differentiation (which we demonstrate may be characterized as Benrand competition) do not benefit from such increased product cost accuracy. Our results are consistent with this contention. That is, profit is higher in the experimental cost leadership markets (operationalized as Cournot markets) when subjects know their true cost, while profit is higher in the experimental product differentiation markets (operationalized as Bertrand markets) when subjects receive uninformative cost reports and make their decisions based on expected costs. These results suggest that the value of more accurate cost reports may be dependent upon the firm's competitive market structure strategy and product market strategy."}, {"e:author": ["DEREK K.

We focus on carryforwards because, in providing this information each period, management must use their private information about the firm's profitability prospects. Thus, accounting measurement of tax carryforwards is another way of providing a management earnings forecast. In analyzing the role of carryforwards in valuation, we distinguish between two conflicting effects. First, deferred taxes from carryforwards represent future tax savings; hence, they should be valued positively as assets. In contrast, the existence of tax carryforwards may signal a higher likelihood of future losses, which would have a negative effect on expected earnings and share prices. We find that analysts consider earnings of firms with carryforwards to be less persistent because of the increased likelihood of future losses. We also find that analysts tend to be less precise and more optimistic (biased) in forecasting earnings of firms with carryforwards. This higher optimism and lower precision are more pronounced just after firms adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SPAS) 109 and are almost entirely corrected over time. An analysis of investors' valuation indicates a strong positive relation between deferred taxes from carryforwards and share prices, suggesting that these carryforwards are valued as assets. Also, earnings and book values of equity are valued less in firms that have carryforwards than in firms without carryforwards. Finally, the valuation allowance required under SFAS 109 assists equity investors in valuing a firm's earnings and net assets. The combined findings on analysts' interpretation and investors' valuation suggest that analysts fail to fully capture the implication of carryforwards on future earnings within their forecasting horizon."}, {"e:author": ["ROBERT N.

The paper uses reports filed by individual pension plans with the Department of Labor under the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 for the analysis. Evidence reported in the paper shows that as firms become overfunded, they make conservative actuarial choices to avoid visibility costs, and that as firms become underfunded, they make liberal actuarial choices to avoid visibility costs. As the annual contributions increase relative to the permissible contribution ranges, firms make conservative actuarial choices to minimize penalties and maximize tax benefits. As the annual contributions decrease relative to the permissible contribution ranges, firms make liberal actuarial choices to minimize penalties and maximize tax benefits. The larger the profitability, cash flow from operations, and tax liability, and the smaller the debt of a firm, the higher the likelihood that the firm's managers will make conservative actuarial choices to maximize contributions. Conversely, the smaller the profitability, cash flow from operations, and tax liability, and the larger the debt of a firm, the higher the likelihood that the firm's managers will make liberal actuarial choices to minimize contributions. This evidence, which is consistent with the hypothesis of funding management, can aid the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in regulating the defined-benefit pension plans more effectively and help plan beneficiaries to manage their retirement portfolios more efficiently.

This causes audits of high-accrual firms to pose more uncertainty than audits of low-accrual firms because of potential estimation error and a greater chance that high-accrual firms have undetected asset realization and/or going concern problems that are related to the high level of accruals. One way that auditors can compensate for this risk exposure is to lower their threshold for issuing modified audit reports, an action that will increase modified reports and, therefore, lessen the likelihood of failing to issue a modified report when appropriate. We call this auditor reporting conservatism and test if high-accrual firms in the United States, are more likely to receive modified audit reports for asset realization uncertainties and going concern problems. Empirical results for a large sample of U.S. publicly listed companies support the hypothesis that auditors are more conservative, that is, more likely to issue both types of modified audit reports for high-accrual firms. Further analyses show that income-increasing accruals are somewhat more likely to result in reporting conservatism than income-decreasing accruals, and that only the Big Six group of auditors show evidence of reporting conservatism.

The objective is to study deviations from the symmetric information risk-neutral rational expectations (RE) benchmark, which predicts no trade in such settings. The results of a series of double-auction and call markets are reported in which traders manage a portfolio of cash and asset shares over 15 rounds of trading. A public signal regarding the value of the liquidating dividend is released every third round, and traders' subjective expectations of the liquidating dividend are elicited each round as cash-motivated forecasts. We find that, despite the public dividend signal, traders' dividend forecasts are heterogeneous. Forecasts and prices both underreact to the public signals, with prices under-reacting more than forecasts. In general, price changes are not closely associated with public signals, and there is greater excess price volatility in double auctions than in call markets. Forty-three percent of trades are inconsistent with the trader's forecasts, and inconsistent trades occur more frequently in the double-auction markets. On average, approximately 10 percent of the outstanding shares are traded in each round, and trading volume is increasing in the mean absolute forecast revision and decreasing in the contemporaneous dispersion in forecasts. These results suggest that differential processing of the public signal and/or speculative trading for short-term gain may help to explain why symmetric information RE predictions are often not supported in empirical and experimental settings.

When a firm's default risk is low, changes in its financial condition should be of limited relevance to bondholders, but should be relevant to stockholders. In contrast, as the likelihood of financial distress increases, stockholders' limited liability allows them to abandon the firm to the bondholders (Fischer and Verrecchia 1997). Accordingly, as a firm's default risk increases, changes in its financial condition should be increasingly important to bondholders and less important to shareholders.

Audit firms in the model make strategic specialization and pricing decisions. Through specialization, an audit firm achieves a comparative cost advantage over its competitors for all clients whose characteristics are closer to its area of specialization. This comparative cost advantage is further fortified by the presence of start-up costs. As a result, each audit firm obtains some market power and is able to price-discriminate across clients by offering “specialization-and-relationship-specific” audit fee schedules. This paper demonstrates that the practice of “low-balling” is a natural consequence of competition among audit firms. However, low-balling occurs only in a certain market segment where audit firms compete fiercely. This paper also shows that a policy of banning low-balling acts as a substitute for the commitment of the audit firms to partially collude their pricing policies and results in increased profits for audit firms and increased fees.

We document significant stock price movements on release dates of industry Flash Reports by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) each month that contain aggregate industry data on new orders and shipments. The magnitude of the price revisions on Flash Report disclosure dates is positively associated with changes in the numbers disclosed and varies across sample firms in a manner associated with identifiable characteristics of the firms. Further tests indicate that the Flash Report provides mainly forward-looking information on new orders that is linked to firm-specific sales changes and has explanatory power for quarterly stock prices beyond firm-specific earnings.

However, learning theory suggests that players' choices will be repeated in the future based on outcomes. We found that penalties triggered both increases and decreases in effort, and seemed to introduce a “shock” that increased the variability of effort.

Most of this research relies on the familiar techniques of dichotomous probit or logistic regression. Only a limited amount of this research uses n-chotomous qualitative response models such as ordered probit or multinomial logistic regression. A potential explanation for this limited use is that the interpretation of model coefficients in qualitative response models with limited dependent variables (dichotomous or n-chotomous) differs substantially from OLS regression, and econometric texts do not provide a systematic approach to coefficient interpretation. This paper discusses several approaches to interpreting coefficients in n-chotomous qualitative response models. These methods focus on partial derivatives, elasticities of probability, sensitivity analysis, and odds ratios. The methods are applied to the models presented in Thomas (1989) and Mittelstaedt (1989). Additional analyses of the models demonstrate that the methods of interpretation can provide different conclusions or strengthen existing conclusions. The methods provide a better understanding of the directional effects of model coefficients, the relative responsiveness of the probability of choice to changes in the independent variables, and the effects of changes in the independent variables on the probability of choice. These methods should make these models more attractive to researchers interested in choice-based financial accounting research, and allow for a broader range of decision outcomes than that provided by dichotomous qualitative response models."}, {"e:author": ["THOMAS A.

Accrual measurement concepts indicate that financial statement fraud should be associated with high levels of earnings relative to operating cash flow. We demonstrate that the excess of earnings over operating cash flow is extreme in most fraud cases in years immediately prior to the fraud discovery based on a sample of 56 fraud cases from 1978 to 1991. We compare the distribution of the earnings minus operating cash flow variable for fraud firms with that for a sample of 60,453 firm-years for firms listed on COMPUSTAT. We test a logistic regression model in which the discovery/nondiscovery of fraud is the dependent variable, and earnings minus operating cash flow is the explanatory variable. Other control variables are included in the model based on prior studies. Results are consistent with expectations derived from accrual measurement theory. We then examine the predictive ability of the model using our sample of fraud firms and a sample of nonfraud firms in the same four-digit SIC code industries. Observations for the fraud firms are for the fiscal year prior to the discovery of fraud. Observations for the nonfraud firms are for the same fiscal years as the fraud firms in the same industries. The predictive ability of the model, including the excess of earnings over operating cash flow, is substantially higher than the predictive ability of the model omitting this variable.

Finally, we demonstrate that the post-offering underperformance disappears once we control for the overoptimism in earnings growth expectations. Thus, the evidence presented in this paper is consistent with the “equity issue puzzle” arising from overly optimistic earnings growth expectations held at the time of the offerings."}, {"e:author": ["S.

In this paper, we test a deferred tax explanation of this negative association. Specifically, we argue that investors, conditional on adjusting inventory to as-if first-in, first-out (FIFO), estimate a firm's future LIFO liquidation tax burden as its LIFO reserve multiplied by the appropriate corporate tax rate and include this tax-adjusted LIFO reserve in the valuation of a LIFO firm's net assets. On the basis of this argument, the tax-adjusted LIFO reserve is in effect an estimate of an off-balance-sheet deferred tax liability and, as a result, we predict a negative association between the tax-adjusted LIFO reserve and market value of equity. We test our deferred tax explanation by estimating a valuation model in which a firm's market value of equity is expressed as a function of the firm's assets, liabilities, deferred tax liability, and tax-adjusted LIFO reserve; the model is estimated separately in years preceding and following the reduction of tax rates mandated by the US Tax Reform Act of 1986. Test results provide strong support for the deferred tax explanation of the negative association between a firm's LIFO reserve and the market value of its equity."}, {"e:author": ["RACHEL M.

We find that our estimates of earnings are more accurate and less biased than standard measures of sample mean and median. However, we do not find a closer relationship between excess market returns and forecast errors from our maximum likelihood estimate than from the sample mean.

It constructs a stylized model in which the taxpayer reports both financial accounting income and taxable income. The government observes both reports before deciding whether to conduct an audit. The analysis of the equilibrium yields two hypotheses. First, the probability that the government will audit a transaction is higher if the transaction generates a positive book-tax difference (e.g., an expenditure that is deducted for tax purposes but capitalized for financial reporting purposes) than if the transaction generates no book-tax difference. Second, conditional on being selected for audit, transactions with and without book-tax differences are equally likely to have detected understatements of tax liability."}, {"e:author": ["EMEKA T.

First, the study tests for asymmetric price reactions to positive and negative earnings surprises (ES). Second, the study associates policy differences across jurisdictions with variations in the cash flow effects of positive and negative ES and then uses the framework to consider variations in price responses across regulatory climates. In the same context, the study investigates the effects of a utility's abnormal profits on the asymmetry of price reactions to positve and negative ES. The empirical predictions are motivated by the disparity between the principles and practices that underlie cost recovery for the utilities and the uneven effects of the cost-recovery practies on the cash flows associated with positve and negative ES. The results show that the sign of ES and the climate in which a utility operates are related to the size of price reactions to ES. Furthermore, a utility's abnormal profit status has significant effects on the size of price reactions to ES. Only a modest price response asymmetry is indicated for manufacturing firms."}, {"e:author": ["PATRICIA M. S.

Periodic applications of effort by the agent are required. The agent also obtains private information as the project evolves, and he decides whether the project should be abandoned or continued. The principal not only seeks to provide incentives to induce the agent to take up such risky investments and work hard at them, but also seeks to provide incentives for the agent to abandon the project if the profit prospect is low. We show that the agent's decision to continue is not always aligned with the principal's desire. The result provides an economic rationale for the sunk cost phenomenon.

We argue that access to private information and direct restrictions on investments are likely to affect the extent to which accounting quality reduces financing constraints. Our results suggest that, for financially constrained firms, banks’ access to private information decreases the value of accounting quality. We further find that, for both financially constrained and unconstrained firms, covenants directly restricting capital expenditures also mitigate the importance of accounting quality. Our results suggest that, when information asymmetry problems are likely to be the largest, accounting quality is most important. However, the importance of accounting quality is mitigated if outside capital suppliers have access to private information and is eliminated if they impose contractual restrictions on investment. We also provide evidence that banks’ access to private information reduces the cash flow sensitivity of cash and mitigates the importance of accounting quality in reducing this sensitivity. This additional evidence suggests that our investment–cash flow sensitivity results are not driven by measurement error of the investment opportunity set."}, {"e:author": ["ERIK PEEK", "RICK CUIJPERS", "WILLEM BUIJNK"], "e:volume": "27", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2010.01010_10.x/abstract", "e:keyword": ["Actionnaires", "Actualité de l’information sur les résultats", "Créanciers", "Institutions", "G32", "K22", "M41"], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2010.01010_10.x/abstract", "e:year": 2010, "e:title": "Exigences des créanciers et des actionnaires en matière d’information dans les entreprises à capital ouvert par rapport aux entreprises à capital fermé observations européennes", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Les auteurs se demandent si l’importance de l’information comptable dans l’établissement de contrats et la communication avec les actionnaires et les créanciers a une incidence sur la rapidité de publication de l’information sur les résultats (c’est-à-dire sur l’actualité de cette information), dans les états financiers à vocation générale diffusés dans le public. Pour opérationnaliser la relation entre les exigences relatives à l’actualité de l’information et l’importance de l’information comptable pour les actionnaires et les créanciers, les auteurs comparent l’actualité de l’information sur les résultats (l’asymétrie de cette information) dans les entreprises à capital ouvert par rapport aux entreprises à capital fermé. Ils attribuent les écarts dans l’actualité de l’information entre les entreprises à capital ouvert et les entreprises à capital fermé aux exigences des actionnaires, dans les pays où les institutions assurent une solide protection aux investisseurs. De façon analogue, ils attribuent ces écarts aux exigences des créanciers, dans les pays où les institutions assurent une solide protection aux créanciers. Leur analyse des entreprises à capital ouvert et à capital fermé dans 13 pays de l’Europe occidentale semble indiquer que les créanciers et les actionnaires ont des exigences différentes relativement à l’actualité de l’information. Les auteurs constatent notamment que l’écart entre les entreprises à capital ouvert et les entreprises à capital fermé en ce qui a trait à l’asymétrie de l’actualité de l’information n’est pas associéà la mesure dans laquelle un pays protège les investisseurs, mais qu’il affiche une relation positive avec la mesure dans laquelle un pays protège les créanciers. Les résultats de l’étude tendent également à démontrer que les actionnaires réclament la symétrie plutôt que l’asymétrie de l’actualité de l’information. Ces observations débouchent sur une conclusion importante : les états financiers à vocation générale sont sensibles aux exigences d’information des créanciers, ce qui contraste avec l’hypothèse selon laquelle ces créanciers — essentiellement privés — s’intéresseraient aux rapports à vocation spéciale."}, {"e:author": ["FRANK D.

Les discussions préliminaires des deux organismes dans le cadre de ce projet indiquent qu’ils entendent modifier les états financiers exigés de manière à accroître la proximité de l’information liée à la performance relative à chaque période. Les auteurs apportent des preuves en ce qui a trait à ce changement potentiel en analysant l’incidence de la proximité de l’information contenue dans les états financiers sur la capacité des investisseurs d’assimiler les propriétés sérielles des données relatives aux flux de trésorerie et aux régularisations qui sont présentées, pertinentes à la formulation de prévisions. Ils examinent également le rôle que joue l’information rétroactive dans cette relation. Les résultats expérimentaux de l’étude semblent indiquer que les investisseurs non professionnels sont en mesure d’assimiler plus rapidement la relation entre les flux de trésorerie et les régularisations de la période courante et la matérialisation des flux de trésorerie futurs lorsque l’information contenue dans les états financiers est présentée dans un seul état plutôt que lorsqu’elle est subdivisée en deux états. Les auteurs constatent en outre que les investisseurs non professionnels affichent des degrés plus faibles d’erreurs prévisionnelles absolues et une dispersion des prévisions moins grande lorsque l’information contenue dans les états financiers leur est communiquée dans un seul état.

To operationalize the relationship between timeliness demands and the importance of accounting information to shareholders and creditors, we compare the (asymmetry in) earnings timeliness of public firms with that of private firms. We attribute public versus private firm differences in timeliness to shareholders’ demands when a country’s institutions provide strong investor protection. Similarly, we attribute these differences to creditors’ demands when the institutions provide strong creditor protection. Our analysis of public and private firms in 13 Western European countries suggests that creditors and shareholders have different timeliness demands. In particular, we find that the public versus private firm difference in asymmetric timeliness is not associated with a country’s degree of investor protection but positively associated with a country’s degree of creditor protection. The results further suggest that shareholders demand symmetric rather than asymmetric timeliness. An important implication of our study is that general-purpose financial statements are responsive to creditors’ reporting demands, which contrasts with the idea that these — primarily private — creditors would use special-purpose reports."}, {"e:author": ["FRANK D.

We provide evidence related to this potential change by investigating the effects of financial statement information proximity on investors’ ability to learn the forecast-relevant time series properties of reported cash flows and accruals. We also examine the role feedback plays in this relationship. Our experimental results suggest that nonprofessional investors are able to more quickly learn the relation between current period cash flows and accruals and future cash flow realizations when financial statement information is presented in a single statement rather than separated into two statements. In addition, we find that nonprofessional investors exhibit lower levels of absolute forecast errors and less forecast dispersion when financial statement information is unified into a single statement. Finally, we provide evidence that nonprofessional investors who receive extensive outcome feedback on a single page initially learn more quickly and later, after learning has leveled off, accurately forecast more consistently than do investors who receive extensive or limited feedback spread across two pages.

We examine empirically the causes of such guidance cessation and find that poor operating performance — decreased earnings, missing analyst forecasts, and lower anticipated profitability — is the major reason firms stop quarterly guidance. After guidance cessation, we do not find an appreciable increase in long-term investment once managers free themselves from investors’ myopia. Contrary to the claim that firms would provide more alternative, forward-looking disclosures in lieu of the guidance, we find that such disclosures are curtailed. We also find a deterioration in the information environment of guidance stoppers in the form of increased analyst forecast errors and forecast dispersion and a decrease in analyst coverage.

Furthermore, the difference in adjustment is larger when the bias track record is inconsistent than when it is consistent.

The results show that analysts tend to underreact to the information contained in customer acquisition cost, average revenue per user, and the number of subscribers. These are the performance measures that have significant predictive ability for future earnings of wireless firms. Distinguishing between firms on the basis of their nonfinancial disclosure patterns reveals that the above findings are driven primarily by firms with irregular disclosures.

Increased book–tax differences may be informative for credit rating agencies as they may signal decreased earnings quality or changes in the firm’s off–balance sheet financing. Results suggest a significant negative association between positive changes in book–tax differences and ratings changes. This evidence is consistent with large positive changes in book–tax differences signaling decreased earnings quality and/or increased off–balance sheet financing. We also find that large negative changes in book–tax differences result in less favorable rating changes, consistent with these changes signaling decreased earnings quality. In additional analyses, we find that the association between changes in book–tax differences and rating changes is attenuated for high–tax-planning firms (e.g., where book–tax differences more likely reflect tax planning than decreased earnings quality)."}, {"e:author": ["SATI P.

La PPA 2006 contient deux dispositions principales : 1) les entreprises doivent assurer la capitalisation intégrale de leur régime de retraite en sept ans (alors qu’une période de trente ans leur était auparavant accordée pour capitaliser 90 pour cent de leur passif au titre du régime) et 2) elles peuvent se prévaloir d’une déduction fiscale à l’égard des cotisations à concurrence de 150 pour cent du passif au titre du régime (alors que le plafond de la déduction était antérieurement de 100 pour cent). Une fois contrôlés l’incidence de la norme SFAS 158, les possibilités de croissance, le coût du financement externe et les autres informations publiées au cours de la période d’échantillonnage, les auteurs examinent les rendements anormaux des entreprises ayant un régime de retraite, à proximité des dates marquantes du processus législatif ayant menéà l’adoption de la PPA 2006.

Deuxièmement, les auteurs constatent que les répercussions sur la valeur boursière sont plus négatives dans le cas des entreprises présentant des passifs non capitalisés plus importants au titre du régime et devant faire face à des dépenses en immobilisations plus substantielles, alors que les entreprises dont les taux d’imposition marginaux sont plus élevés enregistrent des répercussions positives. Troisièmement, les auteurs ne relèvent aucun élément permettant d’affirmer que les répercussions sur la valeur boursière varient selon les différentes catégories de risque définies par la PPA 2006.

Le modèle repose sur trois facteurs définis par les normes d’audit et par les travaux de recherche antérieurs : la compétence, la qualité du travail et l’objectivité. Les auteurs élaborent une expression analytique du modèle à l’aide du cadre de référence des fonctions de croyance afin de dépasser les limites des études antérieures. Leurs résultats révèlent que la modélisation de la relation « et » est essentielle à l’évaluation de la solidité de la fonction d’audit interne. Au chapitre des relations, l’analyse montre que, lorsque celle qui unit ces trois facteurs est solide ou parfaite, la fonction d’audit interne demeure d’une grande solidité, même en présence d’éléments probants positifs ou négatifs à l’égard de l’un des facteurs. Ce résultat persiste dans la mesure où les niveaux de croyance au sujet des deux autres facteurs sont élevés. Les auteurs démontrent en outre comment la qualité de la gouvernance d’entreprise influe sur l’évaluation de la fonction d’audit interne et comment il est possible de recourir à l’analyse coûts-avantages dans ce contexte pour mieux déterminer la quantité de travail d’audit externe qu’exige le respect des normes. L’analyse des auteurs révèle que l’étendue du travail d’audit devant être réalisé par l’auditeur externe dépend de la solidité de la fonction d’audit interne et de l’importance des coûts associés aux litiges et au respect de la réglementation auxquels le vérificateur externe doit faire face."}, {"e:author": ["KHIM KELLY"], "e:volume": "27", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2010.01023_13.x/abstract", "e:keyword": ["Coefficients de pondération", "Connaissances", "Indicateurs avancés", "Modèle causal", "D83", "M10", "M41", "M52"], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2010.01023_13.x/abstract", "e:year": 2010, "e:title": "Exactitude des coefficients de pondération de multiples indicateurs avancés de rendement : incidence sur le rendement et les connaissances des gestionnaires", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "De nombreuses sociétés qui utilisent de multiples indicateurs avancés de rendement ne valident pas le modèle causal qui relie ces indicateurs aux résultats financiers futurs, et les relations de cause à effet du modèle sont souvent abandonnées aux estimations subjectives qui peuvent être sujettes à l’erreur.

Les résultats obtenus montrent que le fait que des coefficients de pondération inexacts soient affectés aux indicateurs avancés améliore le rendement, réduit la fluctuation du rendement et enrichit les connaissances, comparativement à l’absence de coefficients de pondération. En outre, le rendement est semblable, peu importe que les coefficients de pondération soient exacts ou inexacts, alors que les connaissances sont meilleures lorsque les coefficients de pondération sont inexacts que lorsqu’ils sont exacts, ce qui ne confirme en rien les effets de polarisation des coefficients de pondération inexacts. Les observations résultant de l’étude semblent indiquer qu’à tout le moins dans certaines circonstances, les gestionnaires tirent avantage des coefficients de pondération affectés aux indicateurs avancés, même lorsqu’ils sont inexacts, et sont en mesure de corriger ces inexactitudes pour parvenir à un niveau comparable de rendement et de connaissances, comme s’ils avaient disposé de coefficients de pondération exacts."}, {"e:author": ["DENNIS J.

The model is based on three factors identified by auditing standards and by prior academic research: Competence, Work Performance, and Objectivity. We develop an analytical expression of the model using the belief function framework in order to overcome limitations of prior research. Our results reveal that modeling the “And” relationship is essential for assessing the strength of the IA function. As far as interrelationships are concerned, the analysis shows that, when the three factors have a strong or a perfect relationship, the strength of the IA function remains high even if there is positive or negative evidence about one of the factors. This result holds as long as there are high levels of belief about the other two factors. Further, we demonstrate how the quality of corporate governance affects the evaluation of the IA function and how a cost–benefit analysis can be applied to this framework to help determine the amount of external audit work needed to comply with standards. Our analysis reveals that the extent of external audit work to be carried out by the external auditor depends on the strength of the IA function and the amount of litigation and regulatory costs likely to be faced by the external auditor."}, {"e:author": ["KHIM KELLY"], "e:volume": "27", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2010.01023_5.x/abstract", "e:keyword": ["Causal model", "Knowledge", "Lead measures", "Relative weights", "D83", "M10", "M41", "M52"], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2010.01023_5.x/abstract", "e:year": 2010, "e:title": "Accuracy of Relative Weights on Multiple Leading Performance Measures: Effects on Managerial Performance and Knowledge", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Many firms that use multiple lead measures in their performance measurement systems do not validate the causal model linking these measures to future financial outcomes, and the cause-and-effect relationships in the model are often left to subjective estimates that may be prone to errors. Using an experiment, this study examines how the accuracy of assumptions about the relative importance of lead measures in a causal model affects managerial performance and knowledge, when managers are given the opportunity to learn over multiple periods. The results show that having inaccurate relative weights on lead measures improves performance, reduces performance variability, and enhances knowledge, relative to not having any weights. Furthermore, performance is similar under accurate versus inaccurate relative weights, whereas knowledge is better under inaccurate than accurate relative weights, providing no support for the biasing effects of inaccurate relative weights. The findings suggest that, at least under certain circumstances, managers benefit even if they are given inaccurate relative weights on lead measures, and they are able to correct those inaccuracies to reach a comparable level of performance and knowledge as if they had been given accurate relative weights."}, {"e:author": ["DENNIS J.

Specifically, the initial market reaction to an extreme positive earnings surprise is larger for firms with high levels of short interest.

We find that auditing produces real economic benefits for stakeholders by mitigating inefficiency in the use of school resources. We also find that stringent compliance rules reduce an audit’s effectiveness but auditors’ experience can help to overcome the problems. The lack of disclosure of auditing costs hinders the ability to conduct a cost–benefit analysis of new requirements.

Thus, APs are fundamentally different than other audit tests in taking a broader perspective of an entity’s performance vis-à-vis its environment. As such, APs have been found to be a cost-effective means to detect misstatements, and many have argued that a number of prior financial frauds would have been detected had auditors employed effective APs. With several dramatic and far-reaching developments over the past decade, the current study examines whether and how APs have changed during this period. In particular, we focus on the impact of significant “enablers” and “drivers” of change such as technological advancements and the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We also compare our findings to an influential study of the practices of APs by Hirst and Koonce (1996) that was conducted over 10 years ago. We interview 36 auditors (11 seniors, 13 managers, and 12 partners) from all of the Big 4 firms using a structured questionnaire. The data reveal some similarities in findings when compared to prior research (e.g., auditors continue to use fairly simple analytical procedures). However, there are a number of significant differences reflecting changes in AP practices. For instance, as a result of technology auditors now rely more extensively on industry and analyst data than previously. Further, auditors report that they develop more precise quantitative expectations and use more non-financial information. They also appear to rely more on lower level audit staff to perform APs, conduct greater inquiry of non-accounting personnel, and are willing to reduce substantive testing to a greater extent as a result of APs conducted in the planning phase. Finally, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has had an impact in greater consideration and knowledge of internal controls, which is seen as the most important factor driving the use and reliance on APs."}, {"e:author": ["BENJAMIN C.

Evidence from Firms’ Geographic Location", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "The scarcity of suitable proxies for asymmetric information has impeded empirical research from providing reliable evidence on whether information risk shapes equity pricing. In reexamining this unresolved question, we rely on firms’ geographic distance from financial centers to gauge information asymmetry. We provide strong, robust evidence supporting the prediction that equity financing is cheaper for firms nearer central locations, implying that investors rationally require more compensation when information asymmetry is worse. The equity pricing role of geographic proximity is economically large, with our coefficient estimates translating into firms located within 100 kilometers of the city center of the nearest of six major financial centers, or in their metropolitan statistical areas, enjoying equity financing costs that are seven basis points lower. Our inferences are insensitive to measuring both the cost of equity capital and distance in several ways, controlling for corporate governance quality, and addressing endogeneity. Collectively, our analysis suggests that investors discount the price that they pay for their securities to reflect the greater information asymmetry that ensues when firms are far from major financial centers."}, {"e:author": ["Nicolas Heinrichs", "Dieter Hess", "Carsten Homburg", "Michael Lorenz", "Soenke Sievers"], "e:volume": "30", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2011.01148.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2011.01148.x/abstract", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Extended Dividend, Cash Flow, and Residual Income Valuation Models: Accounting for Deviations from Ideal Conditions", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Previous empirical studies derive the standard equity valuation models (i.e., DDM, RIM, and DCF model) while assuming that ideal conditions, such as infinite payoffs and clean surplus accounting, exist. Because these conditions are rarely met, we extend the standard models by following the fundamental principle of financial statement articulation. We then empirically test the extended models by employing two sets of forecasts: (1) the analyst forecasts provided by Value Line, and (2) the forecasts generated by cross-sectional regression models. The main result is that our extended models yield considerably smaller valuation errors. Moreover, by constructing these models, we obtain identical value estimates across the extended models. By reestablishing empirical equivalence under nonideal conditions, our approach provides a benchmark that enables us to quantify the errors caused by individual deviations from ideal conditions and thus to analyze the robustness of the standard models.

Our focus on extreme events is motivated by two arguments. First, the accounting concept of materiality in conjunction with litigation risk influences managers and auditors to make more conservative choices with respect to material events. Second, focusing on extreme shocks minimizes the probability that accounting slack may obscure the effect of asymmetric timeliness (Beaver and Ryan 2005). We identify individual events using short-window extreme returns, since long-window returns would aggregate the effect of multiple events and thus limit our ability to detect the asymmetry. Taken together, these features of our research design provide a more powerful test of asymmetric timeliness. Consistent with prior studies, we document that the correlation between bad news and concurrent earnings is significantly higher than that between good news and concurrent earnings. Our analysis of extreme events also enables us to document higher correlation of good news with earnings two or more quarters ahead. This is in contrast to prior studies that were unable to document asymmetry in the relation between returns and subsequent earnings in the opposite direction to that between returns and concurrent earnings. Our paper contributes to the growing literature on conservatism by modifying the Basu methodology to enhance the power of the test of asymmetric timeliness."}, {"e:author": ["Yen‐Jung Lee"], "e:volume": "29", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2011.01152.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2011.01152.x/abstract", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "The Effect of Quarterly Report Readability on Information Efficiency of Stock Prices", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": ["JEAN C.

Our first research question therefore is whether the quality of accounting information (or “accounting quality”) is one such information imperfection that is associated with cross-sectional variation in stock price delay. We define accounting quality as the precision with which financial reports convey information to equity investors about the firm’s expected cash flows. Poor accounting quality is likely associated with higher expected returns through uncertainty about stock valuation parameters and incomplete information.

This metric is highly correlated with VC funds’ financial returns, and with the likelihood of successful exits through initial public offerings or trade sales. After going public, companies backed by higher quality VCs have lower abnormal accruals, lower earnings management through real activities manipulation, and a lower likelihood of financial restatement. Companies backed by top-quartile VCs do not appear to engage in real activities manipulation as a substitute for accruals manipulation. Companies backed by lower-tier VCs exhibit earnings management behaviors which are indistinguishable from those of non-VC-backed companies.

In this study, we provide direct evidence linking earnings management to earnings discontinuities for a sample of firms that settle securities class action lawsuits and restate earnings from the alleged GAAP violation period. We compare the distribution of restated (“unmanaged”) earnings to originally reported (“managed”) earnings. We find that discontinuities are not present in the distribution of analyst forecast errors and earnings changes using unmanaged earnings but are present using managed earnings. The discontinuity in the earnings level distribution is attenuated, but not eliminated, on an unmanaged basis. These shifts among our sample of firms are caused by earnings management and cannot be explained by sample selection or research design issues. Our findings are important because many studies use earnings discontinuities as a proxy for intentional earnings manipulations and we provide the first direct evidence of a link between these two phenomena."}, {"e:author": ["Jere R.

We find that in countries where the Big 4 (as a group) conduct more listed company audits, both Big 4 and non–Big 4 clients have higher quality audited earnings compared to clients in countries with smaller Big 4 market shares. In contrast, in countries where there is a greater concentration within the Big 4 group, we find that Big 4 clients have lower quality audited earnings compared to countries with more evenly distributed market shares among the Big 4. Thus concentration within the Big 4 group appears to be detrimental to audit quality in a country and of legitimate concern to regulators and policymakers. However, Big 4 dominance per se does not appear to harm audit quality and is in fact associated with higher earnings quality, after controlling for other country characteristics that potentially affect earnings quality."}, {"e:author": ["Ross Jennings", "Connie D.

We show for the first time that the stringency of disclosure requirements for IPO prospectuses is negatively associated with the extent of IPO underpricing, after controlling for various country- and firm-level determinants of underpricing. Moreover, we find that the disclosure effect on IPO underpricing is moderated by the extent of a country’s capital market integration.

In this paper we examine the effect of mandatory IFRS adoption on firms’ information environment. We find that after mandatory IFRS adoption consensus forecast errors decrease for firms that mandatorily adopt IFRS relative to forecast errors of other firms. We also find decreasing forecast errors for voluntary adopters, but this effect is smaller and not robust. Moreover, we show that the magnitude of the forecast error decrease is associated with the firm-specific differences between local GAAP and IFRS. This finding suggests that it is IFRS adoption rather than a correlated unobservable factor that is causing forecast errors to decrease. Exploiting individual analyst level data and isolating settings where analysts would benefit more from either increased comparability or higher quality information, we document that the improvement in the information environment is driven both by information and comparability effects. These results suggest that mandatory IFRS adoption has improved the quality of information intermediation in capital markets, and as a result firms’ information environment, by increasing both information quality and accounting comparability."}, {"e:author": ["Francesco Bova"], "e:volume": "30", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2012.01160.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2012.01160.x/abstract", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Labor Unions and Management’s Incentive to Signal a Negative Outlook", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Evidence suggests that the negotiated wage for a unionized employee group is an increasing function of the firm’s prior profitability.

I assess the strategy of missing mean consensus analysts’ earnings estimates as a way for managers to signal a negative outlook to their unionized employees. I find that unionized firms are more likely to miss estimates than their nonunionized counterparts. Additionally, this propensity to miss estimates is increasing in both the firm’s percentage of unionized employees and multiunionism, but is unaffected by the timing of the signal relative to contract renewal. Finally, the increased propensity to miss estimates appears to be driven by both differences in expectations management and earnings management across the two groups. Specifically, managers of unionized firms take less action than their nonunionized counterparts to guide forecasts downward when estimates are too high, and they take more action to deflate earnings when expectations are too low. Taken together, the findings suggest that managers do seek to project a negative outlook to their unions, and that this tendency is increasing in the union’s negotiation strength."}, {"e:author": ["Nilabhra Bhattacharya", "Hemang Desai", "Kumar Venkataraman"], "e:volume": "30", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2012.01161.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2012.01161.x/abstract", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Does Earnings Quality Affect Information Asymmetry?

If a target is a U.S. publicly traded company, an acquirer’s initial assessment of the potential benefits associated with the acquisition of the company is based on publicly available information. Generally, the acquirer obtains limited private information from the target prior to announcing the deal, but engages in transactional due diligence after signing the acquisition agreement to affirm that the financial reporting warranties made by the target are accurate. We construct a low-quality financial reporting score based on measures prior research identifies as being associated with less reliable, less relevant, and less precise financial reporting. We find that acquirers offer higher premiums for targets with low-quality financial reporting. However, we also find that low-quality financial reporting increases the likelihood of deal renegotiation, and contributes to the probability of deals going bust. We document that failed targets are more likely to restate their financial statements after the announcement of the deal, supporting our conjecture that low-quality financial reporting contributes to deals being terminated.

In this study, we test this conjecture by comparing the dividend policies of firms accused of accounting fraud to those of firms not accused of accounting fraud. Specifically, we examine whether alleged fraud firms are as likely to be dividend payers as non-fraud firms, and whether managers of dividend-paying fraud firms increase dividends at the same rate as managers of non-fraud firms. Our data reveal that dividend paying status is negatively associated with the probability of committing accounting fraud. In addition, we also find that, during the alleged fraud period, the earnings–dividends relation is weaker for the alleged fraud firms relative to firms not accused of fraud. Finally, using propensity score match tests, the data provide evidence that managers of alleged fraud firms increase dividends less often than managers of firms not accused of fraud, consistent with the alleged fraud firms not being able to match the dividend policies of firms not accused of fraud.

The business strategy measure also appears to capture client business risk and provides incremental explanatory power beyond the individual measures of client complexity or risk used in traditional audit fee models. We contribute to the literature by constructing a replicable business strategy measure and identifying organizational business strategy as an important ex ante determinant of financial reporting irregularities and levels of audit effort.

First, we review a stratified random sample of 90 analyst reports and find that the majority of these analysts include explicit adjustments for working capital and other accruals in their cash flow forecasts. Second, using a large sample of analysts' cash flow forecasts from 1993–2008, we find that these forecasts outperform time-series cash flow forecasts in correctly predicting the sign and magnitude of accruals. Finally, we find a significant market reaction to analysts' cash flow forecast revisions, suggesting that investors find these revisions informative. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that analysts' cash flow forecasts are not simply naïve extensions of their own earnings forecasts, but that they reflect meaningful and useful accrual adjustments.

These changes in compensation contracts are related to a decline in investments, including research and development expenditures, capital investments and acquisitions. Moreover, consistent with the rules in SOX directly affecting CEOs' incentives to take risk, we document that the decline in investments exceeds the amount that would be expected from changes in compensation packages alone. Finally, we also find evidence that the changes in investments are related to lower operating performances of firms, suggesting that these changes were costly to investors. Our evidence speaks to the debate on how corporate governance regulation interacts with firms' and managers' incentives, and ultimately affects corporate operating and investment strategies. Our study suggests that one indirect cost of such regulations in SOX is the significant reductions in corporate risk-taking activities in the post-SOX period.

Relative to these benchmark firms, we find that IFRS firms exhibit significant increases in income smoothing and aggressive reporting of accruals, and a significant decrease in timeliness of loss recognition; however we do not find significant differences across IFRS and benchmark firms in meeting or beating earnings targets. Our findings contrast with findings in earlier studies which suggest that IFRS adoption leads to increased accounting quality.

ERM, developed with the assistance of the accounting profession, provides a framework and plan to integrate management of all sources of risk. Challenged by measurement difficulties common to research on management control systems, prior ERM studies present mixed findings. Using ERM quality ratings of financial companies by Standard & Poor's, we find that higher ERM quality is associated with greater complexity, less resource constraint, and better corporate governance. Controlling for such characteristics, we find that higher ERM quality is associated with improved accounting performance. Results show a market reaction to signals of enhanced management control from initial ERM quality ratings and rating revisions, and a stronger response to earnings surprises for firms with higher ERM quality. Focusing on the recent global financial crisis, our analysis suggests that there is no relation between ERM quality and market performance prior to and during the market collapse. However, returns of higher ERM quality companies are higher during the market rebound. Overall, results reveal that firm performance and value are enhanced by high-quality controls that integrate risk management efforts across the firm, enabling better oversight of managers' risk-taking behavior and aligning that behavior with the strategic direction of the company."}, {"e:author": ["Dean Neu", "Jeff Everett", "Abu Shiraz Rahaman"], "e:volume": "30", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2012.01195.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2012.01195.x/abstract", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Internal Auditing and Corruption within Government: The Case of the Canadian Sponsorship Program", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": [], "e:volume": "29", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2012.1176.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2012.1176.x/abstract", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Abstracts/Résumés", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": ["Jing LI"], "e:volume": "30", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2012.1181.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2012.1181.x/abstract", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Accounting Conservatism and Debt Contracts: Efficient Liquidation and Covenant Renegotiation", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": [], "e:volume": "29", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2012.1192.x/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2012.1192.x/abstract", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Abstracts/Résumés", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": ["Ricardo F.

This paper provides one explanation for managerial conservatism in a two-period agency model with hidden information (a binary project type) and hidden actions (the agent's efforts). A piece-wise linear incentive scheme with accounting earnings as the performance measure is employed. The agent's discretion is the choice of a depreciation method. Discretion is valuable if and only if the agent's marginal productivity of a “bad” project is greater than that of a “good” project, but not to an extreme degree. A conservative depreciation method decreases current compensation in exchange for a “bet” on future compensation and, hence, serves as a commitment device for the agent to signal that the prospect is indeed good.

We show that if signals generated by the same monitor are negatively (positively) correlated, then the optimal monitoring assignment will be “focused” (“dispersed”). This holds because dispersed monitoring allows the firm to better utilize relative performance evaluation. On the other hand, if each monitor communicates only an aggregated signal to the principal, then focused monitoring is always optimal since aggregation undermines relative performance evaluation. We also study team-based compensation and randomized monitoring assignments.

Because these reputa-tional concerns are more of an issue if an auditor's independence is impaired, we investigate the relationship between the abnormal market returns for Andersen clients around the time of the indictment announcement and several fee-based measures of auditor independence. Our results suggest that when news about Andersen's indictment was released, the market reacted negatively to Andersen clients. More importantly, we find that the indictment period abnormal return is significantly more negative when the market perceived the auditor's independence to be threatened. We also examine the abnormal returns when firms announced the dismissal of Andersen as an auditor. Consistent with the audit quality explanation, we document that when firms quickly dismissed Andersen, the announcement returns are significantly higher when firms switched to a Big 4 auditor than when they either switched to non-Big 4 auditors or did not announce the identity of the replacement auditor.

The book income adjustment (BIA) of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) created apparently strong incentives to manage book income downward in 1987. Five earlier papers using different methodologies and samples all conclude that earnings were reduced in response to the BIA. This consensus of findings offers an opportunity to investigate our speculation that methodological biases are more likely when there appear to be clear incentives for earnings management. A reexamination of these studies uncovers potential biases related to a variety of factors, including choices of scaling variables, selection of affected and control samples, and measurement error in estimated discretionary accruals. A reexamination of the argument underlying these studies also suggests that the incentives to manage earnings are less powerful than initially predicted, and are partially mitigated by tax and non-tax factors.

Results indicate that auditor market concentration is positively associated with the non-Big 6 audit fees but is unrelated to the Big 6 audit fees. Evidence is mixed concerning the client influence hypothesis. When this construct is proxied by the number of rival auditors operating within a geographic area centered on the municipality, the prediction of negative audit fee-client influence relation is strongly supported for both groups of auditors. Results are much weaker using measures developed based on the relative importance of a municipal client to its auditor's audit portfolio. The issues addressed in this study are important at a time when the Canadian municipal sector is undergoing major changes because of municipal amalgamation, altering the underlying market structure for audit services and the bargaining position of a municipality vis-Ã-vis its auditor.

A trade-off arises between these two economic forces in the two oligopolistic markets.

However, the literature also finds that NAS can adversely affect the appearance of auditor independence, and this may be more than a “mere perception” problem, because there is also evidence that stock prices are significantly lower for companies that pay their auditors large fees for nonaudit services."}, {"e:author": ["David C.

We posit that including a high-quality quantified analysis in a proposal enhances its persuasive power by increasing both the perceived competence of the proposal preparer and the perceived plausibility that a favorable outcome could occur. Under some conditions, however, quantification also encourages criticism of the details of the proposal, which potentially offsets these effects. We experimentally test implications of our model in a managerial decision setting, investigating conditions in which quantification is more and less likely to result in criticism of the quantified proposal and, thus, less and more likely to be persuasive.

We show that various economic trade-offs give rise to endogenous earnings management. Specifically, the owner may reduce agency costs by designing a compensation contract that tolerates some earnings management because such a contract allocates the compensation risk more efficiently. The earnings-management activity produces accounting reports that deviate from those prescribed by accounting standards. Given such reports, the valuation of the firm may be nonlinear and s-shaped, thereby recognizing the manager's reporting incentives. We also explore policy implications, noting that (1) the regulator may find enforcing a zero-tolerance policy - no earnings management allowed - economically undesirable; and (2) when selecting the optimal accounting standard, valuation concerns may conflict with stewardship concerns.

Reduced conservatism is expected to occur if relatively high levels of NAS result in reduced auditor independence and, ultimately, lower-quality auditing. Because client-specific demand for NAS is expected to vary, our proxy for the auditor-client economic bond is the extent to which NAS purchases (relative to audit fees) are greater or less than expected. Using several different methods for identifying news-based conservatism, we consistently find that higher than expected levels of NAS are not associated with reduced conservatism. This result is robust to allowing for endogenous NAS demand, as well as several explicit factors that may be associated with differences in conservatism. Similar conclusions arise from tests that use alternative measures of the economic bond between auditors and their clients, as well as in tests confined to either the Big 6 or non-Big 6 audit firms. Our results are consistent with factors such as market-based incentives, the threat of litigation, and alternative governance mechanisms offsetting any expected benefits to the audit firm from reducing its independence.

Under the maintained assumption that firms conducting reviews guided analysts' earnings forecasts, I document firm characteristics associated with the decision to provide private earnings guidance. Then I document the characteristics of “guided” versus “unguided” analyst earnings forecasts. Findings demonstrate an association between several firm characteristics and guidance practices: managers are more likely to review analyst earnings models when the firm's stock is highly followed by analysts and largely held by institutions, when the firm's market-to-book ratio is high, and its earnings are important to valuation but hard to predict because its business is complex. A comparison of guided and unguided quarterly forecasts indicates that guided analyst estimates are more accurate, but also more frequently pessimistic. An examination of analysts' annual earnings forecasts over the fiscal year does not distinguish between guidance and no-guidance firms; both experience a “walk-down” in annual estimates. To distinguish between guidance and no-guidance firms, one must examine quarterly earnings news: unguided analysts walk down their annual estimates when the majority of the quarterly earnings news is negative; guided analysts walk down their annual estimates even though the majority of the quarterly earnings news is positive."}, {"e:author": ["Nicholas Dopuch", "Mahendra Gupta", "Dan A.

A feature of our research is that we also test whether any apparent inefficiencies in production, identified using SFE and DEA, are correlated with audit pricing. That is, do apparent inefficiencies cause the public accounting firm to reduce its unit price (billing rate) per hour of labor utilized on an engagement? With respect to results, we do not find any evidence of relative (within-sample) inefficiencies in the use of partner, manager, senior, or staff labor hours using SFE. This suggests that the SFE model may not be sufficiently powerful to detect inefficiencies, even with our reasonably large sample size. However, we do find apparent inefficiencies using the DEA model. Audits range from about 74 percent to 100 percent relative efficiency in production, while the average audit is produced at about an 88 percent efficiency level, relative to the most efficient audits in the sample. Moreover, the inefficiencies identified using DEA are correlated with the firm's realization rate. That is, average billing rates per hour fall as the amount of inefficiency increases.

In the case of a proposed strategy change, we show that managers can extract the capital market's information by announcing a potential new strategy, and then conditioning the decision to implement the new strategy on the size of the market's price reaction to the announcement. Under this arrangement, we show that a necessary condition to implement all and only positive net present value strategy changes is that managers proceed to implement some strategies that garner negative price reactions upon their announcement.

Thus, what looks like “sunk-cost” behavior may in fact be optimal. Both demonstrations show that, in addition to performing their usual role of anticipating future cash flows generated by a manager's actions, capital market prices can also be used to direct a manager's actions.

Two basic types of empirical research have developed. The “historical” type explores the relation between market values and reported accounting numbers, often using the linear dynamics in Ohlson 1995 and Feltham and Ohlson 1995 and 1996. The “forecast” type explores the relation between market value and the present value of the book value of equity, a truncated sequence of residual income forecasts, and an estimate of the terminal value at the truncation date. The analysis in this paper integrates these two approaches. We expand the Feltham and Ohlson 1996 model by including one- and two-period-ahead residual income forecasts to infer “other” information regarding future revenues from past investments and future growth opportunities. This approach results in a model in which the difference between market value and book value of equity is a function of current residual income, one- and two-period-ahead residual income, current capital investment, and start-of-period operating assets. The existence of both persistence in revenues from current and prior investments and growth in future positive net present value investment opportunities leads us to hypothesize a negative coefficient on the one-period-ahead residual income forecast and a positive coefficient on the two-period-ahead residual income forecast. Our empirical results strongly support our hypotheses with respect to the forecast coefficients."}, {"e:author": ["F. Todd Dezoort", "Richard W. Houston", "Michael F.

In order to do this, individual analysts appear to be reducing coverage for well-followed firms while increasing coverage of firms that were less followed prior to Reg FD. Analysts who had preferential links with firms that they covered, such as analysts from large brokerage houses, tend to have greater forecast accuracy in the pre-FD period.

The hypothesis set manipulation entailed inheriting a correct hypothesis set, inheriting an incorrect hypothesis set, or generating a hypothesis set. The information search was manipulated by providing a balanced evidence set to auditors (i.e., evidence on a range of likely causes including the actual cause - analogous to a standard audit program) or asking them to conduct their own search. One hundred and two auditors participated in the study. The results show that auditors who inherit a correct hypothesis set and receive balanced evidence performed better than those who inherit a correct hypothesis set and did their own search, as well as those who inherited an incorrect hypothesis set and were provided a balanced evidence set. The former performance difference arose because auditors who conducted their own search were found to do repeated testing of non-errors and truncated their search. This suggests that having a correct hypothesis set does not ensure that a balanced testing strategy is employed, which, in turn, diminishes part of the presumed benefits of a correct hypothesis set. The latter performance difference was attributable to auditors' failure to generate new hypotheses when they received evidence about a hypothesis that was not in the current hypothesis set. This demonstrates that balanced evidence does not fully compensate for having an initial incorrect hypothesis set.

First, we find that as the control-ownership disparity becomes larger, controlling shareholders tend to engage more in opportunistic earnings management to hide their behavior and avoid adverse consequences such as disciplinary action. The result of our full-model regression reveals that an increase in the control-ownership wedge by 1 percent leads to an increase in the magnitude of (unsigned) discretionary accruals by 1.3 percent of lagged total assets, ceteris paribus. Second, we find that for our full-model regression, the magnitude of (unsigned) discretionary accruals is greater for group-affiliated firms than for nonaffiliated firms by 0.8 percent of lagged total assets. This result suggests that business group affiliation provides controlling shareholders with more incentives and opportunities for earnings management. Finally, we find that for our full-model regression, the magnitude of (unsigned) discretionary accruals is greater for publicly traded firms than for privately held firms by 1.2 percent of lagged total assets.

To address these questions we construct a model of profitability biases (differences between reported profitability under R&D expensing and capitalization) and show that the key drivers of the reporting biases are the differences between R&D growth and earnings growth (momentum), and between R&D growth and return on equity (ROE). Companies with a high R&D growth rate relative to their profitability (typically early life-cycle companies) report conservatively, while firms with a low R&D growth rate (mature companies) tend to report aggressively under current generally accepted accounting principles.

We propose that a manager's reporting decisions are affected by his or her trade-off of the benefits of appearing honest against the benefits of misrepresentation. The information system affects the manager's trade-off by improving the owner's ability to make an inference regarding the manager's level of honesty. Thus, to the extent that the manager perceives benefits to appearing honest, the presence of an information system can increase managerial honesty. As the information system becomes more precise, however, the manager must forgo greater benefits of misrepresentation in order to achieve the same appearance of honesty. For managers under a precise system, this will shift the trade-off decision toward the benefits of misrepresentation and away from the benefits of appearing honest. Notably, in our experiment, the only benefit of appearing honest is an intrinsically motivated desire for social approval. We find that, although the existence of an information system increases managerial honesty, honesty is lower under a precise than under a coarse information system. We also compare profit earned by the owners in our experiment, which relies on a behavioral role of an information system, with the maximum profit theoretically possible given a contractual use of the information system. This comparison suggests that, unless the available information system is sufficiently precise, the owner will obtain greater profits by not contracting on its output, even if that output is fully contractible."}, {"e:author": ["DENNIS H.

(2) Do auditors detect the overstatements in firms that they perceive to be failing? I predict and find that as (ex post) bankrupt firms that do not (ex ante) appear to be distressed approach bankruptcy, their financial statements reflect significantly greater material income-increasing accrual magnitudes in nongoing-concern years than do control firms. The accrual behavior of these firms resembles that of bankrupt firms that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sanctioned for fraud. Like sanctioned firms, the nonstressed bankrupt firms display significantly greater (material) increases in receivables; inventory; property, plant, and equipment; sales; net working capital, current, and discretionary accruals in prebankruptcy nongoing-concern years than do control firms. They also display significantly more negative changes in cash flows from operations and net cash and a greater disparity between accrual-based net income and operating cash flows than do control firms, consistent with Lee, Ingram, and Howard 1999. Finally, I predict and find that these firms' going-concern years reflect evidence consistent with auditor-prompted reversal of previous overstatements.

Our analysis using a sample of 538 firms indicates that audit committees comprised solely of independent directors meeting at least four times annually are significantly and negatively associated with the NAS fee ratio.

We theorize that differences in client turnover rates between large and small audit firms can be explained by the market structure of the audit industry, which consists of an oligopolistic segment dominated by a few large audit firms and an atomistic segment composed of many small audit firms. We further hypothesize and confirm that fee discounting is more extensive in the atomistic sector, and our results confirm this hypothesis. Our analysis of audit fee changes indicates that clients who switch auditors within the atomistic sector receive on average a discount of 24 percent over the prior auditor's fee. However, clients who switch auditors within the oligopolistic sector receive on average a discount of only 4 percent. Given that price competition is known to be less intense in oligopolistic markets than in atomistic markets, we believe that market structure theory can explain why fee discounting is lower when larger audit firms compete for clients."}, {"e:author": ["X.

This study verifies the association between market capitalization and revenue, and examines economic factors that potentially influence Internet company managers' decisions to adopt allegedly aggressive revenue-recognition policies. Specifically, we examine factors hypothesized to influence the reporting of advertising barter revenue and grossed-up sales levels. We begin by providing descriptive evidence on the use of barter and grossed-up revenue across Internet sectors. Although common in some sectors, we find that the use of these accounting policies is not pervasive overall. We limit our empirical analyses to Internet companies that have the opportunity to report grossed-up or advertising barter revenue. Our cross-sectional predictions are based on both external and internal incentives to maximize revenues as well as constraints that may limit management's discretion. We predict that the following factors increase the likelihood that a firm will report grossed-up and/or barter revenue: shorter time before needing additional external financing, more active individual investor interest in the firm's stock, more active pursuit of growth via acquisitions, and greater use of stock options in employee compensation. We also posit that barter transactions might be an inexpensive way for firms to evaluate the viability of future marketing or content alliances with potential partners. Finally, we predict that constraints on management discretion are related to the reputation/quality of the firm's auditor and underwriter and the extent of management ownership. We find that firms with greater cash burn rates and higher levels of activity on Motley Fool message boards are consistently associated with barter and grossed-up revenue reporting."}, {"e:author": ["Jeffrey Cohen", "Ganesh Krishnamoorthy", "Arnold M.

The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of various corporate governance factors, such as the board of directors and the audit committee, on the audit process. Importantly, there is little professional guidance on how auditors should consider such factors when formulating an appropriate audit strategy, and there has been only one prior study on this issue (Cohen and Hanno 2000). Because there are no current specific auditing standards that relate to the effect of corporate governance on the audit process, we conducted a semi-structured interview with 36 auditors on current audit practices in considering corporate governance in the audit process. Reflecting on client experiences, auditors indicate a range of views with regard to the elements included in the rubric of “corporate governance”. Most significantly, auditors view management as the primary driver of corporate governance. The inclusion of top management in the “corporate governance mosaic” is inconsistent with agency theory's prescription of the board and other mechanisms serving as a means to independently oversee management's actions to protect stakeholders. Auditors consider corporate governance factors to be especially important in the client acceptance phase and in an international context. Further, despite the attention placed on the audit committee in the academic literature, in the business community, and by regulators in different countries (e.g., Canada, United States, Australia), several respondents indicated that their experiences with their clients suggest that audit committees are typically ineffective and lack sufficient power to be a strong governance mechanism.

Given the mixed support for DFH from archival research, we conduct experimental markets that directly operationalize the model's decision variables, which permits a direct test of whether the model is descriptively valid. In addition, our market setting provides a strong test of this theory by including an alternative Nash equilibrium also present in field settings, one in which only auditor quality is used by entrepreneurs to signal IPO value. Our results suggest that DFH predict entrepreneur behavior in baseline markets where both computerized investors and auditors are programmed to price consistently with the DFH equilibrium. However, the DFH model does not describe behavior when “robot” investors are replaced with human investors in the market. The results suggest that entrepreneurs and investors strategically interact in a manner that leads them away from the DFH equilibrium and toward the alternative Nash equilibrium behavior of entrepreneurs with high-value assets hiring high-quality auditors irrespective of IPO risk.

More specifically, we expect that, in the absence of mandated disclosure, CEO compensation is likely to be less performance-contingent among widely held firms than among closely held firms. Moreover, we also expect that the advent of mandated disclosure leads widely held firms to increase the extent to which CEO compensation is performance-contingent, much more so than closely held firms would. We use a unique data base resulting from the Ontario Securities Commission amendment of regulation 638 in October 1993. For the first time, this amendment required firms listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange to provide detailed executive compensation data similar to those required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, for the current year as well as retroactively for the previous two years.

We find that the weight of CFO in the compensation model is positive and significant in the presence of earnings and stock returns. We also find that the relative quality of CFO compared with that of earnings has a positive (negative) impact on the weight of CFO (earnings).

This latter inability contributes to significant forecast pessimism associated with zero reported earnings and significant forecast optimism associated with zero earnings forecasts."}, {"e:author": ["JAN BARTON"], "e:volume": "22", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1506/C27U-23K8-E1VL-20R0/abstract", "e:keyword": ["Audit quality", "Capital markets visibility", "Financial reporting credibility", "Reputation"], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1506/C27U-23K8-E1VL-20R0/abstract", "e:year": 2005, "e:title": "Who Cares about Auditor Reputation?", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "I provide evidence on the demand for auditor reputation by examining the defections of Arthur Andersen LLP's clients following the accounting scandals and criminal conviction marring the auditor's reputation in 2002. About 95 percent of clients in my sample did not switch auditors until after Andersen was indicted for criminal misconduct regarding its failed audit of Enron Corp. I test whether the timing of client defections and the choice of a new auditor are consistent with managers' incentives to mitigate potentially costly information and agency problems. I find that clients defected sooner, mostly to another Big 5 auditor, if they were more visible in the capital markets; such clients attracted more analysts and press coverage, had larger institutional ownership and share turnover, and raised more cash in recent security issues. However, my proxies for agency conflicts — managerial ownership and financial leverage — are not associated with the timing of defections or the choice of new auditor. Overall, my study suggests that firms more visible in the capital markets tend to be more concerned about engaging highly reputable auditors, consistent with such firms trying to build and preserve their own reputations for credible financial reporting."}, {"e:author": ["Anja Waegenaere", "Richard C.

The setting features both information asymmetry between the taxpayer and the tax authorities and inconsistent tax transfer-pricing rules. The latter creates the possibility of each country trying to tax the same income. We study the effect of the probability of transfer-price rule inconsistency on the strategies and payoffs of the taxpayer and the tax authorities. We find that an increase in the probability of transfer-price rule inconsistency induces more aggressive auditing by governments. It therefore deters taxpayers from shifting income to the country with the lower tax rate in situations in which the transfer-pricing rules are consistent, and can either increase or decrease the income reported to the low-tax-rate country in cases in which the transfer-pricing rules are inconsistent. We find that an increase in transfer-price rule inconsistency could either increase or decrease the taxpayer's expected tax liability and could either increase or decrease the deadweight loss from auditing. Our results call into question the conventional wisdom that the prospect of double taxation due to transfer-price rule inconsistency increases a firm's expected tax liability and governments' expected audit costs."}, {"e:author": ["Baruch Lev", "Doron Nissim"], "e:volume": "23", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1506/C6WA-Y05N-0038-CXTB/abstract", "e:keyword": ["Accruals", "Information costs", "Institutional investors", "Market efficiency", "Transaction costs"], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1506/C6WA-Y05N-0038-CXTB/abstract", "e:year": 2006, "e:title": "The Persistence of the Accruals Anomaly", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "The accruals anomaly — the negative relationship between accounting accruals and subsequent stock returns — has been well documented in the academic and practitioner literatures for almost a decade. To the extent that this anomaly represents market inefficiency, one would expect sophisticated investors to learn about it and arbitrage the anomaly away. We show that the accruals anomaly still persists and, even more strikingly, its magnitude has not declined over time. How can this be explained? We show that the accruals anomaly is recognized and, indeed, exploited by certain active institutional investors, but the magnitude of this accruals-related trading is rather small. By and large, institutions shy away from extreme-accruals firms because their attributes, such as small size, low profitability, and high risk stand in stark contrast to those preferred by most institutions. Individual investors are also, by and large, unable to profit from trading on accruals information due to the high information and transaction costs associated with implementing a consistently profitable accruals strategy. Consequently, the accruals anomaly persists and will probably endure."}, {"e:author": [], "e:volume": "24", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1506/car.24.3.0/abstract", "e:keyword": [], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1506/car.24.3.0/abstract", "e:year": 2007, "e:title": "Abstracts", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:author": ["Mary A.

We contribute to extant research by comparing R&D expenditures in the United States and Canada, thereby exploiting the differences in the two countries' R&D tax credit mechanisms and generally accepted accounting principles. The two tax incentive mechanism designs are consistent with differing views of the degree of financial constraints faced by firms in these economies. Our sample also allows us to explore the effects of capitalizing R&D on Canadian firms. Employing a matched design, we document relations between tax credit incentives and R&D spending consistent with both Canadian and U.S. public companies responding as though they are not financially constrained. We estimate that the Canadian credit system induces, on average, $1.30 of additional R&D spending per dollar of taxes forgone while the U.S. system induces, on average, $2.96 of additional spending. We also find that firms that capitalize R&D costs in Canada spend, on average, 18 percent more on R&D. Collectively, this evidence is important to the ongoing debates in both countries concerning the appropriate design of incentives for R&D and is consistent with the assumptions found in the U.S. tax credit system, but not those found in the Canadian system."}, {"e:author": ["Joseph V.

To protect its reputation capital, avoid legal liability, and promote shareholder interests, a more independent, diligent, and expert board may demand differentially higher audit quality (greater assurance, which requires more audit work) than the Big 6 audit firms normally provide. The audit fee increases as the auditor's additional costs are passed on to the client, such that we expect positive relations between audit fees and the board characteristics examined. We find significant positive relations between audit fees and board independence, diligence, and expertise. The results persist when similar measures of audit committee “quality” are included in the model. The results add to the growing body of literature documenting relations between corporate governance mechanisms and various facets of the financial reporting and audit processes, as well as to our understanding of the determinants of audit fees."}, {"e:author": ["W.

We first document the frequency and magnitude of pro forma earnings in press releases issued during June through August 2000, and describe the 433 firms that engaged in this financial disclosure strategy. Our test period predates public expressions of concern by trade associations and regulators that pro forma earnings may mislead investors and the subsequent issuance of guidelines and rules on the disclosure of pro forma earnings numbers. We use two complementary approaches to determine whether the share prices that investors assign to pro forma firms are systematically higher than the prices assigned to other firms. Our market-multiples tests for differences in price levels find some evidence suggesting that pro forma firms may be priced higher than firms that do not use the disclosure strategy. This apparent overpricing is not, however, related to the pro forma earnings numbers themselves. Our narrow-window stock returns tests reveal no evidence of a stock return premium for pro forma firms at the quarterly earnings announcement date. Collectively, the results cast doubt on the notion that investors are, on average, misled by pro forma earnings disclosures despite the widespread concern expressed in the financial press and by regulators."}, {"e:author": ["Thomas E.

We argue that interpersonal relationships are characteristic of many capital-budgeting contexts, and that these relationships can lead to emotional affective reactions. For example, reactions such as frustration and anger may result if a manager is treated unfairly by another individual involved in a capital project. Drawing on relevant work in neurobiology and psychology, we then predict that these affective reactions can influence managers' capital-budgeting decisions. We report on four experimental scenarios that demonstrate the impact of affective reactions on capital-budgeting decisions. Consistent with our predictions, the results indicate that managers consider both financial data and affective reactions when evaluating the utility of an investment alternative. Our results suggest that researchers should consider both affect and cognition to more fully understand decision making in accounting contexts."}, {"e:author": ["DEREK JOHNSTON", "STEVE ROCK"], "e:volume": "22", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1506/CXBY-2NXT-DVWC-2TJR/abstract", "e:keyword": ["Earnings management", "Environmental liabilities", "Superfund"], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1506/CXBY-2NXT-DVWC-2TJR/abstract", "e:year": 2005, "e:title": "Earnings Management to Minimize Superfund Clean‐up and Transaction Costs", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "We investigate whether firms identified as potentially responsible parties (PRPs) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (more commonly known as Superfund) appear to manipulate earnings to minimize their exposure to Superfund clean-up and transaction costs.

Our findings suggest that both nonaudit and total fees are perceived negatively by investors' that is, the higher the fees paid to the auditor, the greater the implied threat to auditor independence, and the lower the financial reporting credibility of a Big 5 audit. Furthermore, our findings appear to be largely unrelated to corporate governance: investors do not perceive the auditor as compensating for weak governance. Separately, recent anecdotal evidence suggests that declining revenues from nonaudit services' as a result of recent regulatory restrictions” are being offset by substantial increases in audit fees. Other things being equal, rising audit fees imply higher profit margins for audit services, indicating that the audit function may no longer be a loss leader.

Even with individual liability for clean-up costs, shareholders' limited liability creates an incentive to select the latter project type and to impose costs on the rest of the economy. This tendency is exacerbated when clean-up liability is joint and several. We show that a disclosure requirement cannot have an unambiguous effect on the selection of the “cleaner” project. However, an accrual requirement, together with an accounting-based dividend restriction, is shown to promote choice of the project that imposes lower expected costs on the rest of the economy.

We introduce a method of combining order sizes and depth quotes to yield more precise estimates of effective spreads on trades likely constrained by quoted depth. We find that while firms with higher rated disclosures are charged lower effective spreads, they are also quoted lower depth, consistent with the notion that better disclosures reduce information asymmetry but also cause some liquidity suppliers to exit the market. Therefore, a simple examination of spreads and depths yields ambiguous inferences on the relation between disclosure policy and market liquidity. We resolve this ambiguity by estimating depth-adjusted effective spreads, and find that firms with higher rated disclosures have lower depth-adjusted effective spreads across all trade sizes. Consequently, our results reveal a robust inverse relation between disclosure ratings and effective trading costs.

One of the necessary conditions for auditors to enhance their reputations on a sustainable basis is accurate metaperception. We report the results of an experiment that investigates determinants of auditors' metaperception accuracy. Our participants comprise teams of audit partners, managers, and seniors who work together in the field. Each auditor performs two tasks of varying complexity and then predicts whether other team members can accurately perform the task and how other team members assess his or her performance on the tasks. Results show that accuracy in knowing what others think of one's technical proficiency (metaperception) is generally high, particularly when the predictor auditors are partners and managers; however, metaperception accuracy is asymmetric and varies depending on the predictor auditor, the target auditor being predicted, and task complexity.

According to this characterization, as institutional ownership increases, stock prices should reflect more current-period information that is predictive of future period earnings. Consistent with this latter view, we find that the extent to which stock prices lead earnings is positively related to the percentage of institutional ownership. This result holds after controlling for various factors that affect the relation between price and earnings. It also holds when we control for endogenous portfolio choices of institutions (e.g., institutional investors may be attracted to firms in richer information environments where stock prices tend to lead earnings). Further, a regression of stock returns on order backlog, conditional on the percentage of institutional ownership, indicates that institutional owners place more weight on order backlog compared with other owners.

The paper also develops a theoretical model that explains this horizon-dependent analyst underreaction as a rational response to an asymmetric loss function. The model assumes that, for a given level of inaccuracy, analysts' reputations suffer more (less) when subsequent information causes a revision in investor expectations in the opposite (same) direction as the analyst's prior earnings-forecast revision. Given this asymmetric loss function, underreaction increases with the risk of subsequent disconfirming information and with the disproportionate cost associated with revision reversal. Assuming that market frictions prevent prices from immediately unraveling these analyst underreac-tion tactics, investors buying (selling) stock on the basis of analysts' positive (negative) earnings-forecast revisions also benefit from analyst underreaction. Therefore, the asymmetric cost of forecast inaccuracy could arise from rational investor incentives consistent with a preference for analyst underreaction.

Results from three experimental market settings (with low, medium, and high liability levels) suggest two major conclusions. First, firms' new investments increase significantly when auditors' liability level increases from low to medium, and decrease significantly as the liability level increases from medium to high. This result provides support for the argument that adequate auditor liability is necessary to motivate firms to invest in new projects. Excessive liability, however, may discourage firms from making new investments. Second, the frequency of audit failure decreases insignificantly when auditors' liability increases. These two results have an important policy implication: the benefit of imposing high liability on the auditor (i.e., an insignificant decrease in audit failure) may be more than offset by its cost (i.e., a significant decrease in new investments)."}, {"e:author": ["Evelyn Patterson", "James Noel"], "e:volume": "20", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1506/F9KW-QM6U-6NXF-QCUN/abstract", "e:keyword": ["Audit strategy", "Defalcation", "Fraud opportunity", "Misreporting"], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1506/F9KW-QM6U-6NXF-QCUN/abstract", "e:year": 2003, "e:title": "Audit Strategies and Multiple Fraud Opportunities of Misreporting and Defalcation", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "We examine how an auditor assesses the risk of fraud and formulates an audit plan when the auditee has the opportunity to commit various types of fraud.

An Examination of Specific Accruals", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "There is relatively little evidence on the specific accruals used to manage earnings. This paper examines this issue by considering the use of specific accruals in three earnings-management contexts: equity offerings, management buyouts, and firms avoiding earnings decreases. We argue that the costs of managing earnings through different income statement items vary and that the benefits of earnings management through each of these items depend on the context. We thus make differential predictions regarding which specific accrual will be used to manage earnings in each of the three contexts we consider. To measure earnings management for specific accruals, we develop performance-matched measures to capture the unexpected component of accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, depreciation expense, and special items. Consistent with our predictions, we find that firms issuing equity appear to prefer managing earnings upward by accelerating revenue recognition. Specifically, we find that accounts receivable for these firms are unexpectedly high. Conversely, for the management buyout context, we predict and find unexpected accounts receivable to be negative. For firms trying to avoid reporting an earnings decrease, we expect firms to be less concerned with earnings persistence and therefore more likely to use more transitory, and less costly, items to achieve their goal. We find that special items are significantly more positive for this group. This paper provides a further step toward understanding how the incentives behind earnings management affect the method used to achieve earnings goals, and it illustrates the usefulness of examining individual accruals in specific contexts."}, {"e:author": ["Lynn Rees", "K.

As a result, the financial reporting and tax reporting trade-off is more pronounced in the Canadian setting of this study compared with the U.S. setting.

This study provides evidence that productivity measurement mediates the relationship between performance outcomes and intensity of JIT practices. Specifically, both JIT and non-JIT plants that use a broader range of productivity measures are more efficient and profitable than other plants. Also, plants that employ industry-driven productivity measures are more profitable and efficient than plants that employ idiosyncratic productivity measures, especially if the former are more JIT-intensive than the latter. Furthermore, plants that employ quality productivity measures are less efficient and less profitable than those that do not, especially if they use more intensive JIT practices. The latter result is consistent with JIT-intensive plants overinvesting in quality. This study also finds that plants that invest more in buffer stock are less efficient and less profitable, especially if they use more intensive JIT practices. Despite the fact that plant profitability and efficiency are highly correlated, JIT-intensive plants are more profitable but less efficient than plants that are not JIT-intensive, after controlling for productivity measures, plant size, and buffer stock.

This evidence raises the question of whether such institutions myopically price firms, overweighting short-term earnings potential and underweighting long-term earnings potential. Evidence of such myopic pricing would establish a link through which institutional investors could pressure managers into a short-term focus. The results provide no evidence that high levels of ownership by banks translate into myopic mispricing. However, high levels of transient ownership are associated with an over- (under-) weighting of near-term (long-term) expected earnings, and a trading strategy based on this finding generates significant abnormal returns.

This paper empirically tests a theoretical prediction arising from the noisy rational expectations equilibrium model that suggests that the decline could be driven by non-information-based (NIB) trading activity, because such trading reduces the ability of stock prices to reflect accounting information. Specifically, Dontoh, Radhakrishnan, and Ronen (2004) show that when NIB trading increases, the R2s of a regression of stock price on accounting information declines.

We address this issue by extending prior research and focusing on the importance of various explanatory variables, including nonaudit service revenues, client pressure, internal audit quality, and coordination, to the external auditor's decision to rely on the work of internal audit. We use data primarily obtained through surveys completed by internal and external auditors. The survey responses represent 74 separate audit engagements. Our findings reveal that when significant nonaudit services are not provided to a client, internal audit quality and the level of internal-external auditor coordination positively affect auditors' internal audit reliance decisions. However, when the auditor provides significant nonaudit services to the client, internal audit quality and the extent of internal - external auditor coordination do not significantly affect auditors' reliance decisions. Furthermore, when significant nonaudit services are provided, client pressure significantly increases the extent of internal audit reliance. Thus, external auditors appear to be more affected by client pressure and less concerned about internal audit quality and coordination when making internal audit reliance decisions at clients for whom significant nonaudit services are also provided."}, {"e:author": ["SATI P.

First, there is a divergence-of-interests problem as management ownership falls. Second, there is an offsetting entrenchment problem when management ownership increases within intermediate regions of ownership. Agency problems are mitigated through contracting, but contracts are often based on accounting numbers prepared by management. Because accounting numbers must be reliable for contracts to be enforced, agency theory predicts a demand for higher-quality auditors when agency problems are more severe. However, extant studies find no significant or robust relation between management ownership and audit firm size. In contrast to extant research, this study samples unlisted companies rather than listed companies for two reasons. First, the monitoring value of auditing may be higher in unlisted companies because they are less vulnerable to takeover and they are required to disclose much less nonaccounting information to shareholders. Second, unlisted companies have greater variation in management ownership, which permits more powerful tests of the demand for auditing as ownership varies between 0 percent and 100 percent. Consistent with a divergence-of-interests effect, the association between management ownership and audit firm size is found to be significantly negative within low and high regions of management ownership.

In contrast, test of earnings management over a similar period in a control sample of Canadian gold-mining firms produced insignificant results. Further, empirical results are robust to several sensitivity tests performed. During the period from June 1988 to December 1990, the Australian firms were found to have engaged in economic earnings management. This is consistent with the sample firms' incentive of maximizing economic earnings immediately prior to the introduction of income tax on gold mining.

A between-subjects experiment, using an SEC enforcement fraud case, was conducted to examine these relationships. Sixty-nine auditors made risk assessments and designed an audit program. We found that auditors who used a standard risk checklist, structured by SAS No. 82 risk categories, made lower risk assessments than those without a checklist. This suggests that the use of the checklist was associated with a less effective diagnosis of the fraud. We also found that auditors with a standard audit program designed a relatively less effective fraud program than those without this tool but were not more willing to seek consultation with fraud experts. This suggests that standard programs may impair auditors' ability to respond to fraud risk. Finally, our results show that fraud risk assessment (FRASK) was not associated with the planning of more effective fraud procedures but was directly associated with the desire to consult with fraud specialists. This suggests that one benefit of improved FRASK is its relation with consultation.

Theoretical economic analysis, in contrast, predicts that the optimal level of product-costing accuracy is sometimes higher at lower levels of competition. Results of survey research are inconsistent, suggesting a need for further identification of conditions under which higher competition leads to more accurate product costing. This study shows experimentally that individuals' choices of the level of product-costing accuracy depend not only on the current level of competition but also on the previous level of competition — that is, on an interaction between market structure (monopoly, duopoly, and four-firm competition) and market history (increasing versus decreasing competition). In the experiment, subjects decide on the quantity of data to collect at a pre-set price per datum to support more accurate product-cost estimates. Subjects collect the most cost data (i.e., choose the most accurate product costing) in monopoly, collect the least in duopoly, and an intermediate amount in the four-firm market, consistent with the pattern of optimal cost-data collection in Hansen's 1998 model. The process of convergence to the optimum differs significantly across market types and market histories, however. Subjects who begin in four-firm competition adapt more successfully to change than those who begin in monopoly. The lowest levels of decision performance occur when ex-monopolists face their first competitor: they overreact to this first encounter with competition and overspend on cost data."}, {"e:author": ["SCOTT B.

Problems with these studies that limit the generalizability of their findings include their cross-sectional nature and samples that usually come from one or two firms.

In particular, we examine the association between firm size and the timing of security returns for two components of annual earnings changes: the average change for a firm's industry and the firm's idiosyncratic change. We find that large firms' prices have a longer lead than small firms' prices with respect to both components. Large firms' early lead on industry-wide earnings suggests that returns of large firms predict returns of same-industry small firms.

Consistent with intuition and with Easton, Harris, and Ohlson 1992, the analysis shows that aggregation over time renders the lag in accounting recognition relatively less important and thus improves the returns-earnings R2. Interestingly, the analysis also reveals that aggregating earnings over longer periods increases the positive covariance between aggregate earnings and the accounting lag, which may further increase the R2. This positive covariance can lead to an earnings coefficient greater than one over some range of aggregation, which is consistent with the findings of Easton et al. that over the 10-year interval the returns-earnings regression slope coefficient is greater than one (1.7). The empirical results highlight the fact that the slope coefficient, which is greater than one and increasing with the interval, accounts for much of the increment to the returns-earnings R2. In fact, constraining the slope coefficient to be one results in an R2 of 11 percent for the 10-year interval, which is considerably lower than the R2 of 47 percent when the regression is unconstrained. Hence, the positive covariance between current earnings and the accounting lag, rather than the diminishing effect of the accounting lag, appears to be the dominant explanation for the observed high R2 over long intervals."}, {"e:author": ["Anwer S.

We conjecture that online trading has increased the proportion of naive investors in the market. We predict that this will result in (1) a decrease in the average precision of investor information prior to earnings announcements leading to higher earnings response coefficients (ERCs), (2) an increase in differential interpretation of earnings leading to higher trading volume reactions that are unrelated to price change, and (3) a decrease in differential prior precision leading to a decrease in the association between trading volume and absolute price change. We find evidence consistent with all three predictions.

Our results provide the first empirical evidence that U.S. firms' use of debt to fund acquisitions significantly declines as foreign tax credit limitations reduce the marginal tax benefits received from borrowing. This finding is consistent with earlier speculation that U.S. foreign tax credit provisions could materially affect the capital costs of U.S. companies in debt-financed acquisitions.

However, the motives and economic consequences of the two are quite different. In general, private information production is intended by investors to increase their trading profit, which has the effect of widening the information gap between informed and uninformed investors and increasing the firm's cost of capital. On the other hand, public disclosure can be used to narrow this information gap and to lower the cost of capital. This paper provides a theoretical model to examine the economic incentives behind these two forms of information dissemination and their consequences on the cost of capital. By simultaneously considering the firm's and the information traders' decisions, the paper derives an equilibrium in which the amount of private information production, the level of public disclosure, and the cost of capital are all linked to specific characteristics of the firm, of information traders, and of the market. In contrast to conventional beliefs, the paper predicts that, across firms, the cost of capital can be either positively or negatively related to the firm's disclosure level, depending on the specific factors that cause the variation within a particular sample. Similarly, the extent to which investors follow a firm and the firm's disclosure level can be either positively or negatively related to each other.

Consistent with the psychological phenomenon of loss aversion, this change in pricing behavior reduced the frequency of reported losses. This study further reveals that the accounting format for reporting fixed costs influenced pricing behavior. Specifically, participants receiving capacity costing feedback reports established increasingly lower selling prices relative to the prices established by participants receiving contribution margin feedback reports.

We hypothesize that the information-processing objective (that is, purpose) assigned to consultants influences the mental representations they construct to process and store information, which ultimately influences their recommendations regarding the continuation of a poorly performing project. Results suggest that consultants will not construct mental representations amenable to making high-quality project-continuation recommendations unless they are assigned that specific purpose.

We construct a model in which debt is needed to discipline managerial investment decisions despite endogenous compensation contracts. We show that accounting covenants increase value when (1) debt serves as a credible commitment to penalize poor investment decisions; (2) the firm faces other (exogenous) sources of uncertainty that can make debt risky despite good investment decisions; and (3) accounting information serves as a contractible proxy for firm's economic performance. In these circumstances, accounting covenants ensure that shareholders do not offer compensation schemes that would encourage bondholder wealth expropriation when the debt becomes risky. A covenant specifying a required level of accounting performance provides additional bondholder power when performance is low. An accounting-based dividend covenant allows a disbursement to maintain investment incentives when performance is high without allowing dividend-based expropriation. The optimal covenants depend on the reliability of accounting information, and the interaction between accounting performance and the different incentive conflicts provides new insight into the empirical literature on accounting-based covenants."}, {"e:author": ["JONG‐HAG CHOI", "RAJIB K.

The model predicts that interdisciplinary differences exist in quality norms, which could result in disparity among business disciplines in the number of top-tier articles published. I examine the period from 1980 to 1999 and, consistent with the theory, find that significant differences exist in the number of articles and proportion of doctoral faculty who published in the “major” journals in accounting, finance, management, and marketing. Most notably, the proportion of doctoral faculty publishing a major article is 1.4 to 2.4 times greater in the other business disciplines than in accounting (depending on the set of journals). The theory also predicts an upward drift over time in the quality norms used by referees.

Overall, the evidence is consistent with the market treating disclosed PRB liabilities as less reliable than recognized PRB liabilities and pension liabilities.

These findings are inconsistent with the Choi, Collins, and Johnson 1997 conclusion that PRB liabilities are inherently less reliable than pension liabilities. The paper also investigates factors that may have contributed to the lower perceived disclosure reliability. Our results suggest that the market perceived PRB liability disclosures to be less reliable when firms provided range disclosures, had higher probabilities of reducing plan benefits, or had lower ratios of retiree to total PRB obligations.

We conduct an experiment in which we manipulate practice risk through client characteristics. We also manipulate provision and nature of outcome information. We find that tax professionals process information differently for clients of different risk levels. Specifically, tax professionals weight negative outcome information more heavily when forming likelihood assessments underlying recommendations for a high-risk client, relative to a low-risk client. Further, risk directly affects recommendations in that tax professionals more strongly recommend an aggressive position for a low-risk client.

We measure earnings absent tax expense management as actual pre-tax earnings adjusted for the annual ETR reported at the third quarter. We provide robust evidence that firms lower their projected ETRs when they miss the consensus forecast, which is consistent with firms decreasing their tax expense if non-tax sources of earnings management are insufficient to achieve targets. We also find that firms that exceed earnings targets increase their ETR, but this effect is less significant.

Proponents of this audit approach argue that decision making is enhanced because the knowledge of the system allows the auditor to focus on the most important risks. However, there has not been an explicit framework to explain how systems knowledge can enhance decision making. To provide such a framework, we combine mental model theory with general systems theory to produce a hypothesis we refer to as a systems-mediated mental model hypothesis. We test this hypothesis using experimental economics methods. We find that (1) subjects make systematic errors under the setting without an organizing framework provided by the systems information, and (2) the presence of an organizing framework results in lower reporting errors. Importantly, the organizing framework significantly enhances decision making in the settings where the environment changed.

These contexts are represented in the form of different cases that vary in terms of the materiality and income direction of the individual and aggregate PAJEs. The current paper posits that auditors will be more likely to waive PAJEs in excess of materiality (i.e., make a “non-GAAS” decision) when there is potential reward for doing so or when there is little litigation risk from doing so. The case decisions of 155 audit partners and managers indicate that they are not affected by potential reward (Client's Relative Fees), but are affected by potential risk (the Client's Financial Health, the PAJE's Subjectivity, and the PAJEs' Aggregate Directional Effect on Income).

Our paper highlights that the use of the loan loss provision to accomplish more than one objective gives rise to situation-specific costs and benefits of manipulating the provision up or down. We hypothesize that relatively undervalued banks have greater incentives to signal their future prospects than fairly valued banks and that banks' incentives to smooth intensify as premanaged earnings deviate from norms. On the basis of these conjectures, we categorize sample banks into subgroups that are predicted to use loan loss provisions consistent with their situation-specific incentives. This allows us to refine the research methods used in prior research to examine heterogeneous incentives. While we find evidence consistent with the use of loan loss provisions to smooth earnings, particularly when premanaged earnings are extreme, our evidence on signaling is less consistent. In particular, our signaling results depend on the introduction of an interaction term that has not been used in prior research. We also document that the intensity of smoothing (signaling) is not uniform across the sample. In addition to being a function of the incentive to smooth (signal), it also is a function of the incentive to signal (smooth)."}, {"e:author": ["Hun‐Tong Tan", "Jackson Yip‐Ow"], "e:volume": "18", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1506/UG8M-8H3D-1GA2-7BYK/abstract", "e:keyword": ["Audit workpapers", "Memo structure", "Preparer&#146s conclusion", "Review process"], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1506/UG8M-8H3D-1GA2-7BYK/abstract", "e:year": 2001, "e:title": "Are Reviewers' Judgements Influenced by Memo Structure and Conclusions Documented in Audit Workpapers?", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "This paper investigates how the initial conclusion reached by the preparer of audit workpapers and the manner with which the preparer structures the associated evidence can influence the reviewer's judgement in an audit setting.

In regression analysis, we find that restructuring charges are significantly positively associated with post-restructuring changes in earnings relative to the restructuring year, but this association is largely driven by firms with multiple restructurings and firms reporting losses in the restructuring year. We find no association between restructuring charges and post-restructuring changes in earnings relative to the year before restructuring.

In contrast, enabling use seeks to put employees in a position to deal directly with the inevitable contingencies in their work. The design principles that underlie the enabling use of management control systems are repair, internal transparency, global transparency, and flexibility. Through a detailed analysis of a single-case field study carried out over a two-year period, we illustrate how management pursued the objectives of efficiency and flexibility by using management control systems in enabling ways. We suggest that the four design principles of enabling use can facilitate field studies of management control systems, but that they can also be used to define an enabling typology for contingency researchers to analyze the ways in which organizations simultaneously pursue efficiency and flexibility through their management control systems."}, {"e:author": ["PIERRE JINGHONG LIANG"], "e:volume": "17", "e:url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1506/VK8R-AADH-UR0D-6QR6/abstract", "e:keyword": ["Accounting recognition", "Moral hazard", "Communication", "Agency theory"], "e:issn": "0823-9150", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1506/VK8R-AADH-UR0D-6QR6/abstract", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Accounting Recognition, Moral Hazard, and Communication", "e:journal": "Contemporary Accounting Research", "e:abstract": "Two complementary sources of information are studied in a multiperiod agency model.

In a simple setting with no communication, alternative labor market frictions lead to alternative optimal recognition policies. When the agent is allowed to communicate his or her private information, accounting signals serve as a veracity check on the agent's self-report. Finally, such communication sometimes makes delaying the recognition optimal. We see contracting and confirmatory roles of accounting as its comparative advantage. As a source of information, accounting is valuable because accounting reports are credible, comprehensive, and subject to careful and professional judgement.

Because we cannot observe relevant benchmarks, we model portfolio and risk decisions as functions of macroeconomic and firm-specific factors using data from a period when regulatory capital was immune to SFAS No. 115 accounting. We examine a sample of 230 publicly traded banks and find that (1) irrespective of adoption timing, banks classified too few securities available for sale (AFS) relative to estimated benchmarks; (2) weaker banks that adopted the standard early classified far more securities as AFS relative to benchmarks; (3) banks altered the size of their securities portfolios along with the levels of interest-rate risk and credit risk as regulatory capital decreased; and (4) the level of interest-rate risk on banks' loan portfolios increased at the time of SFAS No. 115 adoption. We also explore the 1995 Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amnesty when firms could “readopt” SFAS No. 115.

We provide evidence on the pervasiveness of accounting misstatements, describe their nature, and show how, if at all, they affect litigation. We assess the nature of restatements by determining whether regular, recurring earnings from primary operations (core) or other components of earnings (noncore) are misstated, and we assess their pervasiveness by estimating the number of primary accounts misstated. In our sample, companies with core restatements have higher frequencies of intentional misstatements (fraud) and subsequent bankruptcy or delisting. Likewise, these companies have, on average, more material misstatements, more negative security price reactions to restatement announcements, and more negative security price changes over the six months preceding and following restatement announcements. However, controlling for these and other factors, we find a significant association between accounting items and litigation, whether occurrences or resolutions.

A lack of consensus about derecognition accounting is a major impediment to achieving convergence in global standards that must be resolved. Thus, both SFAS No. 140 and IAS No. 39 will be reexamined, and evidence pertinent to the debate is timely and important. In this study, we present evidence consistent with the view of credit-rating analysts, who view many securitizations as, in substance, secured borrowings. Specifically, for a sample of originators applying sale accounting guidance in SFAS No. 125 / 140 during the period 1997-2003, we show that off-balance-sheet debt related to securitizations has, on average, the same risk-relevance for explaining market measures of risk (that is, CAPM beta) as on-balance-sheet debt. We also find that, in a returns and earnings association framework, the pricing multiple on securitization gains declines as the amount of off-balance-sheet debt increases, implying that investors take off-balance-sheet debt into account when assessing the valuation-relevance of such gains. For those who advocate the control and components approach to securitization accounting, our results suggest that, at least for frequent securitizers, the put option arising from implicit recourse is a “missing piece” that is not currently accounted for when calculating securitization gains.

This study uses an experiment, involving 286 public accountants, to consider how discussion with peers may influence auditors' subsequent resolution of realistic audit-specific moral dilemmas. Auditors were asked to prescriptively discuss how an accountant ideally should resolve a moral dilemma, or to deliberatively discuss how an accountant actually would resolve a moral dilemma. The results showed that auditors have higher moral reasoning scores after prescriptive discussion with peers and lower moral reasoning scores after deliberative discussion with peers. Thus, the study findings point to the significance of discussion of contentious dilemmas with peers and the importance of type of discussion for predicting and explaining auditors' moral reasoning. More specifically, the results indicate that discussion with peers may provide information and/or signal what is important and acceptable to the resolution of a moral dilemma, which facilitates transformation of an auditor's moral reasoning.
