We find that issuance of unfavorable unsolicited credit ratings enables rating agencies to extract higher fees from issuers by credibly threatening to punish those that refuse to acquire a rating. Also, issuing unfavorable unsolicited ratings increases the rating agencies' reputation by demonstrating to investors that they resist the temptation to issue inflated ratings.

Investors observe neither opaque funds' portfolios nor opaque assets' payoffs. Consistent with empirical observations, an \"opacity price premium\" arises: opaque assets trade at a premium over transparent ones despite identical payoffs. This accompanies endogenous market segmentation: transparent (opaque) funds trade only transparent (opaque) assets. The opacity price premium incentivizes financial engineers to render transparent assets opaque deliberately."}, {"e:volume": "27", "e:author": ["Xavier Vives"], "e:issue": "12", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhu064", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "3547-3592", "e:issn": "0893-9454", "e:doi": "10.1093/rfs/hhu064", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Strategic Complementarity, Fragility, and Regulation", "e:journal": "Review of Financial Studies", "e:abstract": "Fragility is affected by how the balance sheet composition of financial intermediaries, the precision of information signals, and market stress parameters all influence the extent of strategic complementarity among investors' strategies. A solvency and a liquidity ratio are required to control the likelihood of insolvency and illiquidity. The solvency requirement must be strengthened in the face of increased competition, whereas the liquidity requirement must be strengthened under more conservative fund managers and higher penalties for fire sales. Greater disclosure may aggravate fragility and require an increase in the liquidity ratio, so regulators should establish prudential and disclosure policies in tandem."}, {"e:volume": "27", "e:author": ["Michal Barzuza", "David C.

Self-Selecting into Lax Law", "e:journal": "Review of Financial Studies", "e:abstract": "We find that Nevada, the second most popular state for out-of-state incorporations and a state with lax corporate law, attracts firms that are 30–40% more likely to report financial results that later require restatement than firms incorporated in other states, including Delaware. Our results suggest that firms favoring protections for insiders select Nevada as a corporate home, and these firms are prone to financial reporting failures. We provide some evidence that Nevada law also has a causal impact by increasing a Nevada firm's propensity to misreport financials after the firm has incorporated in Nevada."}, {"e:volume": "27", "e:author": ["Xin Chang", "Sudipto Dasgupta", "George Wong", "Jiaquan Yao"], "e:issue": "12", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhu066", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "3628-3657", "e:issn": "0893-9454", "e:doi": "10.1093/rfs/hhu066", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Cash-Flow Sensitivities and the Allocation of Internal Cash Flow", "e:journal": "Review of Financial Studies", "e:abstract": "We study how firms allocate cash flow by estimating the cash-flow sensitivities of various uses of cash flow. We decompose cash flow into a transitory and a permanent component and focus on the allocation of the transitory component, which by construction contains little information about future growth opportunities. We find that more financially constrained firms allocate more transitory cash flow to cash savings and direct less toward investment than do less constrained firms, consistent with constrained firms accumulating liquidity to buffer against future financial constraints. We also illustrate several methodological advantages of our approach over alternative methods in previous studies."}, {"e:volume": "27", "e:author": ["Ilona Babenko", "Rik Sen"], "e:issue": "12", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhu050", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "3658-3698", "e:issn": "0893-9454", "e:doi": "10.1093/rfs/hhu050", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Money Left on the Table: An Analysis of Participation in Employee Stock Purchase Plans", "e:journal": "Review of Financial Studies", "e:abstract": "We analyze participation decisions in employee stock purchase plans. These plans allow employees to buy company stock at a discount from the market price and resell it immediately for a sure profit. Although an average employee stands to gain $3,079 annually, only 30% of individuals take advantage of this risk-free opportunity. Participation is more likely among employees who are familiar with stocks, are more educated, are less financially constrained, and make fewer errors in valuing financial securities. Our results suggest that compensation plans requiring active decisions by individuals can result in poor financial outcomes for employees of lower socioeconomic status."}]
