This paper shows that cross-venue strategies create highly interlinked markets: trades on one venue are followed by sizeable cancellations of limit orders on competing venues. These cancellations are explained in a simple model of competition between two limit order markets with fast and slow traders. Only the fast traders can access the liquidity of both venues simultaneously. Empirically, we confirm the predictions that the fraction of fast traders (1) reduces the equilibrium liquidity supply and (2) reduces the magnitude of the cancellations following a trade."}, {"e:volume": "28", "e:author": ["Xiaohui Gao", "Tse-Chun Lin"], "e:issue": "7", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhu075", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "2128-2166", "e:issn": "0893-9454", "e:doi": "10.1093/rfs/hhu075", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Do Individual Investors Treat Trading as a Fun and Exciting Gambling Activity?

I find that the market responds more slowly in periods with lower media coverage of foreign news and to information from more linguistically and culturally distant countries. These results suggest that both investors' inattention and lack of understanding of foreign information slow the incorporation of new information into prices. I further separate these two mechanisms by examining market responses to earnings surprises."}, {"e:volume": "28", "e:author": ["Allaudeen Hameed", "Randall Morck", "Jianfeng Shen", "Bernard Yeung"], "e:issue": "11", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhv042", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "3153-3187", "e:issn": "0893-9454", "e:doi": "10.1093/rfs/hhv042", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Information, Analysts, and Stock Return Comovement", "e:journal": "Review of Financial Studies", "e:abstract": "Analysts follow disproportionally firms whose fundamentals correlate more with those of their industry peers. This coverage pattern supports models of profit-maximizing information intermediaries producing preferentially information valuable in pricing more stocks. We designate highly followed firms whose fundamentals best predict those of peer firms as bellwether firms. When analysts revise a bellwether firm's earning forecast, it changes the prices of other firms significantly; however, revisions for firms that are less intensely followed do not change the prices of heavily followed firms. Unidirectional information spillovers explain how the more accurately priced stocks might exhibit more comovement."}, {"e:volume": "28", "e:author": ["Pat Akey"], "e:issue": "11", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhv035", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "3188-3223", "e:issn": "0893-9454", "e:doi": "10.1093/rfs/hhv035", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Valuing Changes in Political Networks: Evidence from Campaign Contributions to Close Congressional Elections", "e:journal": "Review of Financial Studies", "e:abstract": "This paper investigates the value of firm political connections using a regression discontinuity design in a sample of close, off-cycle U.S. congressional elections.

Engagements address environmental, social, and governance concerns. Successful (unsuccessful) engagements are followed by positive (zero) abnormal returns. Companies with inferior governance and socially conscious institutional investors are more likely to be engaged. Success in engagements is more probable if the engaged firm has reputational concerns and higher capacity to implement changes. Collaboration among activists is instrumental in increasing the success rate of environmental/social engagements. After successful engagements, particularly on environmental/social issues, companies experience improved accounting performance and governance and increased institutional ownership."}, {"e:volume": "28", "e:author": ["Narasimhan Jegadeesh", "Roman Kräussl", "Joshua M.

The Equilibrium Effects of Credit Default Swaps on Bond Markets", "e:journal": "Review of Financial Studies", "e:abstract": "We provide a model of nonredundant credit default swaps (CDSs), building on the observation that CDSs have lower trading costs than bonds. CDS introduction involves a trade-off: it crowds out existing demand for the bond, but improves the bond allocation by allowing long-term investors to become levered basis traders and absorb more of the bond supply. We characterize conditions under which CDS introduction raises bond prices. The model predicts a negative CDS-bond basis, as well as turnover and price impact patterns that are consistent with empirical evidence. We also show that a ban on naked CDSs can raise borrowing costs."}, {"e:volume": "28", "e:author": ["David J. Denis", "Diane K. Denis", "Mark D.

These differences are observed only when the unit CEO was not the CEO or a director of the pre-spinoff parent firm—that is, when there is a greater need to assess the CEO's ability and match with the firm.

Using 75,000 retail mortgage applications, I analyze the effect of risk-management involvement on loan default rates. The bank requires risk-management approval for loans that are considered risky based on hard information, using a sharp threshold that changes during the sample period. Using a regression discontinuity design and a difference-in-differences estimator, I am able to show that risk-management involvement reduces loan default rates by more than 50%.

Liquidity improves for the overall market and even for noncolocated trading entities. We find that the upgrade is pursued mainly by participants who engage in market making. Those that upgrade use their enhanced speed to reduce their exposure to adverse selection and to relax their inventory constraints. In particular, the upgraded trading entities remain competitive at the best bid and offer even when their inventories are in their top decile. Our results suggest that increasing the speed of market-making participants benefits market liquidity."}]
