Theories limited to two or three variables tend to have low predictive validity and consequently are of limited use to anyone attempting to predict or interpret relationships among organizational variables. One purpose of the study reported here was to develop a more encompassing and more valid theory about a specific relationship---the relationship between centralization and effectiveness.A second purpose of the study was to set forth and test the efficacy of a general approach for developing more encompassing and more valid theories about organizations. The successful application of this approach resulted in a six-variable theory: the relationship between the two variables <i>centralization</i> and <i>effectiveness</i> is a function of (1) the average size of the units of analysis, (2) the effectiveness subconstruct considered, (3) the extent of professionalization in the organizations, and (4) whether the organizations produce primarily goods or services. Specifically, 57% of the variance in the linear association between centralization and effectiveness was shown to be explainable by a linear function of the four variables just noted. This theory enables identification of the conditions where centralization will be related to effectiveness most positively (i.e. <i>r</i> = 0.49) and the conditions where it will be related to effectiveness most negatively (i.e., <i>r</i> = -0.56).Besides these four predictor variables, four others were tested as possible predictors of the centralization-effectiveness relationship, but were rejected. Rejection of two of these latter four variables contradicted commonly accepted beliefs---decentralization was <i>not</i> more positively related to effectiveness in turbulent environments and decentralization was <i>not</i> more positively related to effectiveness in larger organizations.Two concerns regarding the organization science literature resulted from this research. The first follows from our observations that most reports of studies include dysfunctionally sparse descriptions of the organizational contexts in which the data were collected and that in many studies the magnitudes of both the variables of primary interest and also the contextual variables are reported on coarse scales (e.g., on nominal scales with few levels, such as “small” and “large”). As a consequence of these two practices, researchers synthesizing the literature and developing theories from it---as was done in the research reported here---necessarily group together studies that should be distinguished from one another on the basis of their attributes. This unwanted grouping results in theories that are less predictive than they could be.The second concern is that the subset of the organization science literature dealing with relationships between organizational design variables (such as centralization) and organizational effectiveness contains few studies demonstrating the causal directions of observed relationships. As a result, because various levels of effectiveness may lead to the adoption or evolution of different levels of “design variables,” or may be related to certain levels of a design variable because both are related to a third variable researchers and administrators observing high correlations between a design variable and effectiveness must be cautious in inferring that effectiveness can be enhanced by changing, the level of the respective design variable."}, {"e:author": ["Tom Finholt", "Lee S.

This “library tale” has two purposes. The first is a demonstration of conceptual uses of ethnographies for developing grounded theory. Propositions are generated on entrepreneurial orientations and opportunity structures. Opportunities are seen to arise in the creation of linkages between spheres of exchange, or fields in which an object exchanges at different values. Entrepreneurial tactics, such as converting between spheres, call for skills in informal planning, astute use of timing, and networking. These “tactical” skills coexist with “moral” skills, in persuasiveness, the manipulation of norms, and recognition of culturally specific opportunities. The entrepreneur's acts thus create a dialectic of moral (normatively approved) and tactical (instrumentally enacted) changes.The second purpose is a demonstration of methodological implications of ethnographies. Library tales are helpful in the process of “constant comparison” (Glaser and Strauss 1967), by augmenting available, within-site observations with other sources of insight, and of potential disconfirmation of emerging ideas. However, there are limits to the “translation” of library tales. There thus arises a need for observations tailored to specific comparative questions. Multiple site case replication research is suggested for tailoring observations to synchronic, comparative uses. Processual, continuous contextual analysis is suggested for diachronic, intensive followups to such questions as the relationships amongst constraints and individual agency."}, {"e:author": ["Karlene H.

This type of change can operate in addition to top-down planned organizational change, providing “another engine” of organizational transformation over time.All evolutionary change processes require that there be a system for replicating activities over time, a source of variation in activities, and mechanisms which permit some activities to persist while others do not. In this model, formalized job systems and related management practices provide the mechanism for the replication of job activities. Idiosyncratic jobs—or jobs created around particular people rather than in the abstract—serve as a mechanism for unplanned variation in sets of job duties. Finally managerial actions such as layoffs, reorganizations, budget changes and copying jobs from other areas lead to the selective retention of some sets of job activities over others.The organizational change created by these processes may or may not be adaptive for the organization. The outcome will depend on such factors as the birth, death and imitation rates for idiosyncratic and other jobs, as well as the criteria used for job birth and job termination. Adaptation is possible, but is a function of complex, nonlinear constraints. Specific organizational processes that determine these factors are discussed.The model implies that adaptive change can occur in the absence of clear and consistent goals. Thus, the model's implications contradict the frequent assumption of strategic planning literatures that clear and stable goals are necessary for adaptive organizational change. Formalization is necessary for the organization to maintain over time those job activities which have proved to be useful innovations. Thus, the model's implications also contradict the assumption in structural contingency theory that formalization deters adaptive change.Although consistent with other theories of evolutionary organizational change, the model extends prior work by detailing concrete mechanisms, clarifying boundary conditions for the process, and stressing that adaptation is feasible but definitely not assured. The outcome depends in part upon managerial attention to organizational processes rather than to outcomes, and “benign opportunism”—or creative attention to unfolding organizational competencies.Finally, the paper outlines the potential of the model for further study, especially for empirical research on evolutionary change processes and on organizational learning. The evolutionary change process described can be seen as a form of trial-and-error learning in which retained jobs constitute the organization's memory. It is distinct from many other organizational learning models, however, because the source of innovation—idiosyncratic jobs—is not planned in advance by top management, and may be unrelated to current aspirations of the dominant coalition."}, {"e:author": ["Barbara S.

Examples of such sequences from organizational behavior include organizational life cycles, patterns of innovation development, and career tracks of individuals. The methods considered here enable the analyst to find characteristic patterns in such sequences. Forces shaping those patterns can then be found by more conventional methods. After a brief definitional section, the paper begins by discussing three types of sequence questions: (1) questions about whether a typical sequence or sequences exist, (2) questions about why such patterns might exist, and (3) questions about the consequences of such patterns. The theoretical foundations of the first type of question, which is in fact the most important, are then considered. Having established the legitimacy of the approach here taken, the paper then introduces two exemplary datasets with which to focus discussion. These raise the issue of conceptualization and measurement of sequence data. Illustrative cases are presented to show the importance of extreme care in conceiving a sequence to measure and then choosing indicators for it. The paper then turns to methods proper, considering them in several categories. It first briefly mentions methods not employing “distance measures” between events: permutational techniques, stochastic (e.g., Markov) models, and durational methods. Most of these do not directly address sequence questions but can be used to do so if necessary. Turning to the methods based on event distance, the paper first considers the problem of measuring distance between events (1) in terms of elapsed time, (2) in terms of categories of events, and (3) in terms of observed successions. It then considers methods for unique event sequences (sequences in which no events repeat), proposing the use of multidimensional scaling and illustrating it with an analysis of data on medical organizations. For the separate case of repeating event sequences, the paper discusses optimal matching methods, which count the number of individual transformations required to change one sequence into another. These methods are illustrated by an analysis of data on musicians' careers. The paper then briefly considers the problem of finding subsequences common to several longer sequences (or repeated in one longer sequence).

The authors addressed that problem by developing a conceptual framework that integrates theoretical perspectives from economics, finance, and especially strategy, organization theory, and human resource management to offer a broader process-oriented integrative model. The integrative model explicitly describes how synergy realization is a function of the similarity and complementarity of the two merging businesses (combination potential), the extent of interaction and coordination during the organizational integration process, and the lack of employee resistance to the combined entity. The approach differs from traditional methods of studying mergers and acquisitions in three ways: (1) the success of a merger or acquisition is gauged by the degree of synergy realization rather than more removed and potentially ambiguous criteria such as accounting or market returns; (2) the key attribute of combination potential is conceptualized not only in terms of the similarities present across businesses, as in most studies of mergers and acquisitions, but also in terms of the production and marketing complementarities between the two businesses; and (3) the data are derived from a case survey method that combines the richness of in-depth case studies with the breadth and generalizability of large-sample empirical investigations.The framework was tested empirically across a sample of 61 mergers and acquisitions. The extent to which a merger or acquisition resulted in synergistic benefits was related to the strategic potential of the combination, the degree of organizational integration after the deal was completed, and the lack of employee resistance to the integration of the joining firms. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that (1) independent of any similarities across joining firms, the presence of complementary operations increased the probability of acquisition success by boosting synergy realization, (2) organizational integration was the single most important factor in explaining synergy realization, even to the extent that M&As with high combination potential were significantly more successful when coupled with high organizational integration than when integration efforts were less forceful, and (3) mergers and acquisitions that were dependent on gains from combining similar production and marketing operations tended to elicit more resistance from employees than M&As focused on realizing complementary benefits.

Because customer relationships are characterized by social distance, customers must depend on strangers to act on their behalf. Procedural fairness serves as an intermediary to build trust when interchangeable organizational agents exercise considerable delegated power on behalf of customers who cannot specify or constrain their behavior.

Some researchers have challenged this line of reasoning, arguing that organizations can shift the efficiency/flexibility tradeoff to attain both superior efficiency and superior flexibility. Others have pointed out numerous obstacles to successfully shifting the tradeoff. Seeking to advance our understanding of these obstacles and how they might be overcome, we analyze an auto assembly plant that appears to be far above average industry performance in both efficiency and flexibility. NUMMI, a Toyota subsidiary located in Fremont, California, relied on a highly bureaucratic organization to achieve its high efficiency. Analyzing two recent major model changes, we find that NUMMI used four mechanisms to support its exceptional flexibility/efficiency combination. First, metaroutines (routines for changing other routines) facilitated the efficient performance of nonroutine tasks. Second, both workers and suppliers contributed to nonroutine tasks while they worked in routine production. Third, routine and nonroutine tasks were separated temporally, and workers switched sequentially between them. Finally, novel forms of organizational partitioning enabled differentiated subunits to work in parallel on routine and nonroutine tasks. NUMMI's success with these four mechanisms depended on several features of the broader organizational context, most notably training, trust, and leadership."}, {"e:author": ["Art Budros"], "e:volume": "10", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.10.1.69", "e:keyword": ["Downsizing", "Organizational innovation", "Organizational change"], "e:pages": "69-82", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.10.1.69", "e:year": 1999, "e:title": "A Conceptual Framework for Analyzing Why Organizations Downsize", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Although downsizing has become an integral part of organizational life in the U.S., there is little serious theoretical or empirical work on this issue.

However, variations in quality are harder to observe for knowledge-based assets than for tangible assets. This creates information dilemmas for buyers and, accordingly, a risk of overbidding, whenever a target is in a knowledge-intensive industry.This study found that most buyers took steps to mitigate the information dilemmas associated with knowledge-based assets. Specifically, buyers coped by (1) offering lower bid premia; (2) using contingent payment (e.g., stock or earnouts); and (3) increasing information both through lengthy negotiations and by avoiding tender offers.However, when the two firms drew on unrelated forms of expertise, buyers did not apply these strategies. It may be that a buyer's information needs are lower if little postacquisition integration is anticipated. An alternative explanation is that unrelated buyers may not be fully aware of the information dilemmas that they face. If so, they may be especially at risk of overbidding.The contingency relationship identified here with respect to related expertise warrants further study.

The paper presents and analyzes a case study of the B-2 “Stealth” bomber, an aircraft that was designed by four firms almost entirely by computer. The key information systems used in the project were (1) a common-access database to manage part designs and (2) an advanced system to perform structural analysis. These systems played a crucial role in enabling the four firms to coordinate their design and development activities precisely enough to meet the demanding engineering requirements imposed by the aircraft's unique mission. The paper analyses the case study using transaction cost, agency, and information processing theories.The analysis leads to several conclusions about the mechanisms through which the variables emphasized in these theories operated to improve coordination. First, the information systems aided coordination directly by making information processing less costly. Second, this enhanced information processing made the governance of the project more efficient. In particular, by establishing a “technical grammar” for communication, the systems helped to create social conventions around which firms could coordinate their activities, thus limiting the need for a hierarchical authority to promote coordination. This technical grammar also reduced governance costs by reducing asset-specificity, thereby reducing risks associated with contractual holdup. These interactions between communication and governance effects have not been elucidated in the IT/coordination literature. They are important in part because they help explain why the vertically disintegrated organization of the project proved viable. Finally, the systems facilitated decentralized decision-making by reducing agency (measurement) costs. This combination of effects may generalize to other settings in which information technology is used to promote coordination, especially in “virtual” or “disaggregated” corporations."}, {"e:author": ["Kimberly D.

In support of our hypotheses, results from an experimental study of complex decision-making suggest that, in situations where a structured decision protocol is the usual method of decision-making, individuals in moderately negative moods are significantly more likely than those in moderately positive moods to: (1) carefully execute all the steps of a structured decision protocol, (2) execute the steps of a structured decision protocol in the correct order, and (3) rely on the outcome of the structured decision protocol as the primary basis for the decision. We discuss these findings in terms of their implications for both organizational decision models and psychological models of mood and decision-making.

Using the effectiveness story as an exemplar, we develop a more general model of this process for all umbrella constructs, defined here as broad concepts used to encompass and account for a diverse set of phenomena.

We propose that umbrella constructs will arise most frequently in academic fields without a theoretical consensus, will inevitably have their validity seriously challenged, will have a shorter life than their constituent elements, and will be more vulnerable to validity challenges when they lack support from practitioners.

The nature of this complexity is analyzed by linking an institutional Information-Space (I-Space) framework to the work of complexity theorists. The I-Space framework identifies the codification, abstraction, and diffusion of information as cultural attributes. Codification involves the assignment of data to categories, thus giving them form. Abstraction involves a reduction in the number of categories to which data needs to be assigned for a phenomenon to be apprehended. Information is diffused through populations of data-processing agents, thus constituting the diffusion dimension. Complexity theorists have identified the stability and structure of algorithmic information complexity in a way that corresponds to levels of codification and abstraction. Their identification of system parts and the richness of cross-coupling draws attention to the fabric of information diffusion. We discuss two modes of adaptation to complex environments: complexity reduction and complexity absorption. Complexity reduction entails getting to understand the complexity and acting on it directly, including attempts at environmental enactment. Complexity absorption entails creating options and risk-hedging strategies, often through alliances.The analysis, and its practical utility, is illustrated with reference to China, the world's largest social system. Historical factors have shaped the nature of complexity in China, giving it very different characteristics than those typical of Western industrial countries. Its organizations and other social units have correspondingly handled this complexity through a strategy of absorption rather than the reduction strategy characteristic of Western societies. Western firms operating in China therefore face a choice between maintaining their norms of complexity reduction or adopting a strategy of complexity absorption that is more consistent with Chinese culture. The specifics of these policy alternatives are explored, together with their advantages and disadvantages.The paper concludes with the outlines of a possible agenda for future research, focusing on the investigation of complexity-handling modes and the contingencies which may bear upon the choice between them."}, {"e:author": ["Kenneth A.

Kauffman's insight, which is the basis of the findings in this paper, is that complexity is both a consequence and a cause. <i>Multicoevolutionary complexity</i> in firms is defined by moving natural selection processes inside firms and down to a “parts” level of analysis, in this instance Porter's value chain level, to focus on microstate activities by agents. The assumptions of stochastically idiosyncratic microstates and coevolution in firms are analyzed. Competitive advantage, as a dependent variable, is defined in terms of Nash equilibrium fitness levels. This allows a translation of Kauffman's theory to firms, paying particular attention to (1) how value chain landscapes might be modeled, (2) assumptions underlying Kauffman's models making them amenable to firms, and (3) a delineation of seven of Kauffman's computational experiments. As part of the translation, possible parallels between the application of complexity catastrophe theory to coevolutionary pockets and studies by institutional theorists and social network analysts are discussed. The models derive from <i>spin-glass</i> microstate models resulting in Boolean games. Kauffman's <i>Boolean statistical mechanics</i> is introduced in developing the logic underlying the somewhat simplified <i>NK</i>[<i>C</i>] model. The model allows the use of computational experiments to better understand how the dependent variable—value chain fitness—is affected by changes in the number of internal interdependencies <i>K</i>, the number of coevolutionary links with opponents <i>C</i>, the size of the coevolutionary pocket <i>S</i>, and the number of simultaneous adaptive changes, among other things. Various computational experiments are presented that suggest strategic organizing approaches most likely to foster competitive advantage. High or low Nash equilibrium fitness levels are shown to result from internal and external coevolutionary densities as a function of links among value chain competencies within a firm and between a firm and an opponent. Complexity phenomena appear to suggest a number of expected (and thus validating) and surprising strategies with respect to complex organizational interdependencies. For example, moderate complexity fares best and external coevolutionary complexity sets an upper bound to advantages likely to be gained from internal complexity. Various complexity “lessons” are discussed. Models such as the <i>NK</i>[<i>C</i>] could offer insights into strategic organizing."}, {"e:author": ["John D.

We describe a formal dynamic model of the birth, evolution, and death of scientific paradigms based on Kuhn's <i>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>. The model represents scientific activity as a changing set of coupled institutions; a simulated ecology of interacting paradigms in which the creation of new theories is stochastic and endogenous. The model captures the sociological dynamics of paradigms as they compete against one another for members, solve puzzles, and recognize anomalies. We use sensitivity tests and regression to examine the role of intrinsic versus contextual factors in determining paradigm success. We find that situational factors attending the birth of a paradigm largely determine its probability of rising to dominance, while the intrinsic explanatory power of a paradigm is only weakly related to the likelihood of success. For those paradigms surviving the emergence phase, greater explanatory power is significantly related to longevity. However, the relationship between a paradigm's “strength” and the duration of normal science is also contingent on the competitive environment during the emergence phase. Analysis of the model shows the dynamics of competition and succession among paradigms to be conditioned by many positive feedback loops. These self-reinforcing processes amplify intrinsically unobservable microlevel perturbations in the environment—the local conditions of science, society, and self faced by the creators of a new theory—until they reach macroscopic significance.

We address this issue by considering the problem of landscape design—the tuning of fitness landscapes on which actors adapt. We examine how alternative organizational designs influence actors' fitness landscapes and, in turn, the behavior that these alternative designs engender. Reducing interdependencies leads to robust designs that result in relatively stable and predictable behaviors. Designs that highlight interdependencies, such as cross-functional teams, lead to greater exploration of possible configurations of actions, though at the possible cost of coordination difficulties. Actors adapt not only on fixed landscapes, but also on surfaces that are deformed by others' actions. Such coupled landscapes have important implications for the emergence of cooperation in the face of social dilemmas. Finally, actors' perceptions of landscapes are influenced by the manner in which they are framed by devices such as strategy frameworks and managerial accounting systems."}, {"e:author": ["Kevin J.

Specifically, a causal system can be characterized by its <i>dimensionality</i>, and by the nature of <i>interaction</i> between causal factors. Low dimensional causal systems yield periodic and chaotic dynamics, while high dimensional causal systems yield white and pink noise dynamics. Periodic and white noise dynamics stem from systems where causal factors act independently, or in a linear fashion, while chaotic and pink noise systems stem from systems where causal factors act interdependently, in a nonlinear fashion.

Knowing as action calls for an “epistemology of practice.” Moreover, the epistemology of possession tends to privilege explicit over tacit knowledge, and knowledge possessed by individuals over that possessed by groups. Current work on organizations is limited by this privileging and by the scant attention given to knowing in its own right. Organizations are better understood if explicit, tacit, individual and group knowledge are treated as four distinct and coequal forms of knowledge (each doing work the others cannot), and if knowledge and knowing are seen as mutually enabling (not competing). We hold that knowledge is a tool of knowing, that knowing is an aspect of our interaction with the social and physical world, and that the interplay of knowledge and knowing can generate new knowledge and new ways of knowing. We believe this <i>generative dance</i> between knowledge and knowing is a powerful source of organizational innovation.

We estimate these models with data from the population of banks worldwide engaged in interbank foreign exchange currency (FX) trading from 1974 to 1993.

We also examine potential factors which facilitate the posting of specific assets as “credible commitments” to attenuate supplier opportunism. We find that specific investments by buyers serve as a mechanism to 1) increase coordination when the manufacturing task is complex, 2) buffer the buyer against technological uncertainty, and 3) build close relationships when the requisite production skills are scarce (the supply market is thin). We find more specific investments in supply arrangements that are embedded in a broader business relationship. We find fewer supplier-specific investments in the Japanese context. Finally, we find that buyers focus their investments on lesser-known, low-share component makers, perhaps to capitalize on a unique, focused supplier capability."}, {"e:author": ["Alfred A.

With hindsight it often appears that full advantage is not taken of what is known. Part of the reason organizations neglect apparent warnings is because of limited resources and the way resources are allocated. Drawing on concepts from the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, this paper examines situations where resource availability and use can compromise safety by initiating drift. Empirical evidence from the nuclear power industry is reviewed to demonstrate the relationship between resources, resource deployment, and drift. Drift is influenced by error signals, feedback loops, and imperfect watchfulness. Resource availability and use can initiate drift, but they do not necessarily yield catastrophe. Should organizations fall into a threatened position, they can enlist characteristics, behaviors, and capabilities to stabilize the situation, avoid breaching the safety border, and achieve greater security. Through an in-depth study of two plants with contrasting reputations for safety, this paper identifies the characteristics, behaviors, and capabilities that organizations on the edge exhibit. The characteristics, behaviors, and capabilities of the plant with the stronger safety reputation changed after a significant reduction of resources. Resource reduction led to movement toward the safety border, which in turn led to change. Evidence shows that organizations operating closer to the border of safety respond to warnings from unusual events in a resilient rather than anticipatory way. To overcome unexpected problems and limitations, they rely on after-the-fact intervention rather than preparation, foresight, and the provision of countermeasures. Once they recognize they have problems, they explore for novel approaches, typically seeking new knowledge and skills by dismissing old staff and hiring new people, buying advice from outside experts or consultants, and modeling, benchmarking, and copying other organizations' best practices. Organizations on the edge initiate change in response to external demands for change often only after painful public incidents. These organizations emphasize hierarchy and powerful headquarters staff, and their leaders tend to act as commanders and controllers rather than as catalysts and facilitators. The focus of this paper is not on the occurrence of accidents per se, nor on highly reliable operations, but on the precursors and consequences of drift within a safety border. Operating on the edge of the border extends beyond safety to other performance measures and beyond nuclear power to other industries. In settings as diverse as U.S. banks, hospitals, and universities, Israeli kibbutzim, Japanese kereitsu, and Korean chaebol, operating on the edge has become more common."}, {"e:author": ["Nancy B.

We will show how these organizational determinants influence the level of absorptive capacity, ceteris paribus the level of prior related knowledge.

As the environment of many companies becomes more chaotic, the exploration of organization forms characterized by flexibility and adaptability has been intensifying.

These gaps can be traced back to the artificial separation between the macrolevel and the firm level of analysis and the prevalence of a static notion of form. To contribute to a more encompassing theory of new organization forms, a coevolutionary perspective is suggested. In this perspective, contextual variation of macrolevel management logics is proposed as a key mediator in the coevolution of organization and environment. At the firm level, the contextual variation of management logics is reflected in shared managerial schemas underlying strategic design actions. The resulting coevolutionary model shows how contextual applications of management logics may be a source of variation in new organization forms. On the basis of a literature review, three management logics, representing ideal types, are described: classical management logic, modern management logic, and postindustrial management logic.

Again consistent with complementarities, piecemeal changes—with the exception of IT—were found to deliver little performance benefit, while exploitation of the full set of innovations was associated with high performance. Though few European firms were found to exploit the complementarities of new organizational practices, those that did enjoyed high-performance premia."}, {"e:author": ["David Webb", "Andrew Pettigrew"], "e:volume": "10", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.10.5.601", "e:keyword": ["Strategic Agility", "Contextualism", "Receptive Context", "Strategy Diffusion", "Early Adopters"], "e:pages": "601-621", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.10.5.601", "e:year": 1999, "e:title": "The Temporal Development of Strategy: Patterns in the U.K. Insurance Industry", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Much writing in the field of strategic management remains an exercise in comparative statics. Cross-sectional research designs are combined with the static metaphors of contingency thinking to analyse the fit between the positioning and resource base of the firm and its performance in differing environments. However, the inadequacies of this tradition are increasingly recognised even by scholars who have created it (Porter 1991). Strategy can no longer be conceived through the static language of states or positions and must now be understood as an innovation contest where the bureaucratic and inflexible will not survive.This paper takes up the challenge to explore the dynamics of industry and firm strategy development. The empirical focus of the paper is the U.K. insurance industry in a period of upheaval between 1990 and 1996. By means of an innovative cross-correlational time series analysis, we are able to show the ebb and flow of strategic change in the industry and the patterns of initiation and imitation as certain firms lead areas of strategy and others follow. These findings are interrogated and interpreted by drawing on and developing theoretical ideas from three literatures which historically have not talked to one another. These are the literatures on innovation, institutionalism, and contextualism.The empirical results show firms pursuing multiple strategies at one point in time and also altering the strategic agenda over time. A cross-correlational analysis of nine firms in the U.K. insurance industry reveals the existence of leaders and laggards in the development of a variety of strategic initiatives. Theoretically the paper examines the mixture of external conditions and internal context and processes which contribute to the development of early and later adopters of strategies in an industry over time."}, {"e:author": ["Marie-Laure Djelic", "Antti Ainamo"], "e:volume": "10", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.10.5.622", "e:keyword": ["Fashion Industry", "New Organization Forms", "Coevolution", "Historical Perspective"], "e:pages": "622-637", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.10.5.622", "e:year": 1999, "e:title": "The Coevolution of New Organizational Forms in the Fashion Industry: A Historical and Comparative Study of France, Italy, and the United States", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "In many industries, the contemporary context of acute environmental dislocation shows the limits of traditional organizational recipes. In direct response to environmental challenges, companies are experimenting with new organizational solutions. While flexibility, or the capacity to redefine organizational form to follow changing purposes, is undeniably a common trend, these experiments otherwise differ greatly. Diversity is such, in fact, that it is difficult to clearly identify and define a unique organizational paradigm for the future.To explore the connection between environmental dislocation and organizational transformations, we adopt a historical and comparative perspective. Our empirical base of evidence is the luxury fashion industry in three countries, France, Italy, and the United States. For many years, this industry was defined by stable environmental conditions, and a craft model of organization remained dominant. We show that, over a more recent period, increasing environmental turbulence has brought about a redefinition of the rules of the game. A common response has been for organizations to move towards greater flexibility or modularity and to experiment with network forms. However, we also show that the paths or trajectories leading to organizational flexibility have varied significantly across countries, reflecting historical legacies and institutional constraints. We identify in fact three different network forms in that industry, which represent national ideal types—the “umbrella holding” company in France, the “flexible embedded network” in Italy, and the “virtual organization” in the United States.We argue that the process of change in the luxury fashion industry has been one of coevolution, where environmental transformation and organizational change have fed upon each other through time. Pioneer firms in the luxury fashion industry originally devised organizational solutions within the bounds set by nationally defined constraints and opportunities. Becoming institutionalized, these early solutions in turn shaped the environment for individual organizations and organizational populations, creating new sets of opportunities and constraints. In a path-dependent manner, different models of organization and national competitiveness thus emerged.In conclusion, we are brought to question the likelihood of full and stable convergence towards a unique organizational form or paradigm. There appears to be, in each national context, a process of construction of new organizational solutions that starts from local foundations. Embedded as they are in powerful historical and institutional legacies, organizational differences are there to stay, we believe, beyond the period of transition and acute environmental dislocation."}, {"e:author": ["Mitchell P.

We find that the network was initially created with the strategic intent of producing incremental income in exchange for cross-border referrals. However, we also find that this strategy reveals asymmetric positive returns, which produce serendipitous opportunities for individual member firms to bypass the original intent of network by entering each other's market. We propose that such tensions may be endemic to alliance networks, and we explore their sources and consequences on a variety of characteristics, including network stability, member opportunism, and control.

The necessity for this undertaking derives from the fact that to be successful, management must choose the right extent of analysis for preparing major decisions. Testing this hypothesis requires the ability to measure the thoroughness of a decision preparation and to relate different levels of thoroughness to the success of the decision outcomes. In this paper, the author first presents the conceptual framework of argumentation rationality which makes it possible to measure the thoroughness of a decision preparation—or in other words, the soundness of reasons given for the decision.For a concrete-trial usage, the concept is then combined with the methodology of account analysis introduced by Lewin (Lewin 1996, Lewin and Hunter 1996, Hunter 1999) for the research project on “New Organization Forms in the Information Age” (NOFIA). The arguments given explicitly in the accounts express rationales for management decisions and thus give hints on the intensity of the decision preparation. Using a simplified version of the measuring concept which assesses the argumentation rationality on three selected rationality determinants (pro/contra relation, depth of arguments, and breadth of arguments), two different types of rationality analyses are carried out to illustrate the fruitfulness of the approach. First, on the basis of 16 accounts concerning an important strategic decision of Daimler-Benz made in 1985 (becoming an integrated technology group), the arguments discussed during that time are identified and structured for assessing the substantiation of decision preparation. The developed structure of reasoning not only allows a formal evaluation, but in addition offers starting points for a substantial discussion of the change action. Secondly, 138 accounts from the German automotive industry of the years 1990–1997 are analyzed in order to identify first typical patterns of management argumentation. Based on the available empirical foundation, four types of reasoning are isolated, which differ characteristically with respect to the considered rationality determinants. The paper closes with a perspective on significant questions for further elaborating as well as employing the concept in future research."}, {"e:author": ["Gerardine DeSanctis", "Peter Monge"], "e:volume": "10", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.10.6.693", "e:keyword": ["Communication", "Electronic Communication", "Virtual Organizations"], "e:pages": "693-703", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.10.6.693", "e:year": 1999, "e:title": "Introduction to the Special Issue: Communication Processes for Virtual Organizations", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Few topics have received more attention in the management literature of recent years than that of virtual organizations.

In so doing, we also highlight factors that influence the use of networks for coordination with suppliers, and the impact such use has on coordination success. Contrary to much recent speculation, the use of electronic networks for transactions was not associated with increased outsourcing, but rather with greater dependence on internal production. Moreover, the use of interpersonal relationships for coordination, which many think of as an alternative to electronic network use, was positively associated with greater network use. Surprisingly, use of electronic networks was negatively associated with such outcomes as order quality and efficiency, and satisfaction with suppliers, while more reliance on personal linkages was associated with better outcomes and mitigated the negative consequences of using electronic networks."}, {"e:author": ["Manju K.

However, little is known about how these organizations work. Much prior research suggests that virtual organizations, for the most part because they use information technology to communicate, will be decentralized and nonhierarchical. This paper examines the behavior of one such organization. The analysis is based on a case study of the communication structure and content of communications among members of a virtual organization during a four-month period. We empirically measure the structure of a virtual organization and find evidence of hierarchy. The findings imply that the communication structure of a virtual organization may exhibit different properties on different dimensions of structure. We also examine the relationship among task routineness, organizational structure, and performance. Results indicate that the fit between structure and task routineness affects the perception of performance, but may not affect the actual performance of the organization. Thus, this virtual organization is similar to traditional organizations in some ways and dissimilar in other ways. It was similar to traditional organizations in so far as task-structure fit predicted perceived performance. However, it was dissimilar to traditional organizations in so far as fit did not predict objective performance. To the extent that the virtual organizations may be similar to traditional organizations, existing theories can be expanded to study the structure and perceived performance of virtual organizations. New theories may need to be developed to explain objective performance in virtual organizations."}, {"e:author": ["D. Sandy Staples", "John S. Hulland", "Christopher A.

Overall, the results indicated that remote employees' self-efficacy assessments play a critical role in influencing their remote work effectiveness, perceived productivity, job satisfaction, and ability to cope. Furthermore, strong relationships were observed between employees' remote work self-efficacy judgments and several antecedents, including remote work experience and training, best practices modeling by management, computer anxiety, and IT capabilities. Because many of these antecedents can be controlled managerially, these findings suggest important ways in which a remote employee's work performance can be enhanced, through the intermediary effect of improved remote work self-efficacy.

In a sample of 605 matched cases of employees and their immediate supervisors from a large, reformed state-owned firm, organizational support was found to relate to affective commitment more strongly than to organizational citizenship behavior. Personal relations, however, were found to relate similarly to affective commitment and organizational citizenship behavior. Moderator effects are evident with the less-traditional Chinese employees manifesting greater citizenship behavior than do more-traditional Chinese, in response to a high-quality relationship with their supervisor.

Similarly, we argue that the spillovers that result from proprietary alliances are a function of the institutional commitments and practices of members of the network. When the dominant nodes in an innovation network are committed to open regimes of information disclosure, the entire structure is characterized by less tightly monitored ties. The relative accessibility of knowledge transferred through contractual linkages to organizations determines whether innovation benefits accrue broadly to membership in a coherent network component or narrowly to centrality.

We argue that the supporting institutional mechanisms affect the incorporation patterns of intercollegiate programs in basketball, ice hockey, and lacrosse over the period from the late nineteenth century to the present. The research strategy of examining the spread of three different sports programs, each a proxy for different strategies of resources and visibility, provides evidence on the comparative pattern of effects of the three institutional mechanisms. Results indicate that all three institutional support mechanisms affect the incorporation of the intercollegiate programs. Differences in the pattern of incorporation across the three strategies provide robust evidence for alternatives to a prevailing “iron cage” view of institutional pressures and constraints.

Drawing on concepts from theoretical computer science, the article introduces a taxonomy of production tasks based on their computational complexity and shows how to use the notion of computational complexity to analyze organizational phenomena such as vertical integration disintegration, the choice between markets and organizations as performers of particular production tasks, and the internal partitioning of organizational tasks and activities. The article then relates the complexity of the production function of the organization to the ways in which organizations structure themselves.

This paper draws on institutional and resource dependence theories to examine this fundamental transformation of firm capital structure during China's transition. I propose that managers borrowed from external sources even when internal funds were available because retained earnings were considered state assets. Firms used retained earnings to signal financial health but borrowed externally to reduce dependence on the state. Uncertainty during transformation produced interfirm imitation of borrowing strategies, particularly imitation of local and high status others. I argue that the dynamics of market development shaped firm borrowing strategies and that these strategies are best viewed as trajectories over time.

This may partially be because the publication rate of special issues has been growing. As Olk and Griffith report in the following paper, between 1956 and 1987 one special issue was published every 4.15 publication years, or 6% of the 326 total issues published by the <i>Academy of Management Journal (AMJ), Academy of Management Review (AMR), Administrative Science Quarterly (ASQ), and the Strategic Management Journal (SMJ)</i>. In contrast, between 1988 and 1999 a special issue was published every publication year for the journals studied, or 19% of 328 issues. Even when <i>Organization Science (OS)</i> is excluded because it was a new journal in 1990, the publication rate of special issues is still 17% of all issues published in the latter period.Given the increased rate of special issue publication, many questions have been raised about this practice. Those asking the questions include authors, those who evaluate authors' contributions to knowledge, and even editors themselves. One concern is whether a paper submitted for a special issue will take longer to be published than a “normal” submission. If so, then younger colleagues in particular may think twice, reflect on their tenure clocks, and perhaps be less likely to submit their work. A second question concerns whether the odds are higher that a manuscript will be accepted for a special issue rather than for a normal submission.Underlying the second question is the suspicion that somehow it is “easier” to get a paper accepted for a special issue than it is for a regular submission. Among the speculations are that special issue editors are required to fill a whole issue and thus may accept lower-quality papers than normal to “fill” the special issue. Following this logic, should evaluators somehow “discount” papers published in special issues because they may be of lower quality than regularly submitted papers?We now have data with which to address these questions. In the article that follows, Paul Olk and Terri Griffith report on data collected on the five mainstream management journals noted above for the years 1956–1999, and they compare special issue articles to regularly published articles, assessing speed to publication, impact, and paper quality measured by article citation counts.The authors find that for <i>ASQ, OS</i>, and <i>SMJ</i>, special issue articles are cited at a significantly higher rate than are regular issue articles. However there is no significant difference in citation rates for <i>AMJ</i> and <i>AMR</i>. Thus, for three of the five journals studied, special issue articles have a significantly higher impact. With respect to paper quality as measured by variance in citation rates, they find that there is no significant difference in citation rate variance for four of the five journals. With the exception of <i>ASQ</i>, there is no significant difference in quality when the two publication venues are compared. This study should put to rest rumors and generalized rumblings regarding the quality, impact, and publication speed of special issues in mainstream management journals in the United States.I highly recommend this interesting article to the readers of <i>Organizational Science</i>."}, {"e:author": ["Anne S.

While many studies have been devoted to investigating various factors driving network partner choice, there is also an interesting and unexplored tension in this body of work. On the one hand, much work emphasizes change in social structure—showing that firms expand networks by forming new relationships with new partners. At the same time, other scholars emphasize stability of social structure—showing that firms tend to choose past exchange partners. We seek to reconcile this tension by proposing that firms form new relationships with new partners as a form of exploration, and form additional relationships with existing partners as a form of exploitation (March 1991). Further, whether exploration or exploitation is chosen depends on the type of uncertainty that firms are facing: whether it is firm-specific or market-level uncertainty. We test our hypotheses using data on both interlock and alliance networks for the 300 largest U.S. firms during the 1988–1993 period. The results provide some evidence that whether networks are stable or changing depends on the type of uncertainty experienced by firms."}, {"e:author": ["R. Edward Freeman", "Andrew C.

In response, we offer a model emphasizing both linear and cyclical aspects of transactive memory development in work groups, and we propose that task is a major influence on developmental processes. We introduce task representation and the task-expertise-person (TEP) unit as basic constructs involved in transactive memory development, and we provide a dynamic model of how TEP units are constructed, evaluated, and utilized. Regarding observable changes over time, we propose that transactive memory systems can vary in terms of accuracy (the degree to which group members' perceptions about others' task-related expertise are accurate), sharedness (the degree to which members have a shared representation of the transactive memory system), and validation (the degree to which group members participate in the transactive memory system).

Grounding our research in the decision process literature, we introduce the concept of “toxic decision processes”: organizational decision processes that generate widespread negative emotion in an organization through the recursive interplay of members' actions and negative emotions. We draw on a longitudinal, qualitative analysis of six toxic decision processes to develop a model that describes the three phases—inertia, detonation, and containment—through which these processes unfold. Each phase is characterized by distinctive sets of interactions among decision makers and other organizational members, and by emotions such as anxiety, fear, shame, anger, and embarrassment, that shape and are shaped by these interactions. We show that toxic decision processes are triggered by issues that are sensitive, ambiguous, and nonurgent and identify several mechanisms that connect actors' emotions and actions, over time creating a toxic decision process that leads to the cumulative buildup and diffusion of toxicity. These mechanisms include the construction of a “danger zone” around the issue that is avoided by all parties, the spread of negative emotion through processes of empathetic transmission and emotional contagion, and the suppression of widespread negative emotion that leads to the development of a volatile emotional context for future decision making. This study has important implications for the decision process literature, revealing how the different lenses through which decision making is usually viewed are connected by the emotionality that runs through each of them."}, {"e:author": ["Ned Kock"], "e:volume": "15", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1040.0071", "e:keyword": ["Computer-mediated communication", "Communication media", "Media richness theory", "Schema theory", "Human evolution"], "e:pages": "327-348", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1040.0071", "e:year": 2004, "e:title": "The Psychobiological Model: Towards a New Theory of Computer-Mediated Communication Based on Darwinian Evolution", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "This article reviews theories of organizational communication with a special emphasis on theories that have been used to explain computer-mediated communication phenomena. Among the theories reviewed, two—social presence and media richness—are identified as problematic and as posing obstacles to future theoretical development. While shortcomings of these theories have been identified in the past, some of these theories' predictions have been supported by empirical evidence. It is argued that this theoretical dilemma can be resolved based upon principles derived from a modern version of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection and the application of those principles to the understanding of human evolution. A new theoretical model called the psychobiological model is developed, which predicts variations in cognitive effort in computer-mediated collaborative tasks. The model proposes that there is a negative causal link between the “naturalness” of a computer-mediated communication medium, which is the similarity of the medium to the face-to-face medium, and the cognitive effort required from an individual using the medium for knowledge transfer. The model also states that this link is counterbalanced by what are referred to as “schema alignment” and “cognitive adaptation.” The schema alignment construct refers to the similarity between the mental schemas of an individual and those of other participant(s). The cognitive adaptation construct refers to an individual's level of schema development associated with the use of a particular medium. Finally, the model states that the degree to which the medium supports an individual's ability to convey and listen to speech is particularly significant in defining its naturalness, more so than the medium's degree of support for the use of facial expressions and body language. An example is offered of how the psychobiological model can be tested in the context provided by the customer support area of an online broker."}, {"e:author": ["Martha S.

Transaction costs consist of search, bargaining, monitoring, enforcement, and other costs not directly related to the production of goods or services. Usually such costs are attributed to difficulties in measurement (the metering problem) or difficulties in redeploying assets to alternative uses (asset specificity). These variables are thought to be objective features of economic transactions. Rarely are the social-psychological dimensions of these objective features taken into account. Although economic transactions are fundamentally human activities, human behavior in the economics literature is usually reduced to such simplifying assumptions as shirking and bounded rationality. In this article, we develop a model of transaction costs based on a more complete description of human psychology as it operates in exchange relationships.We argue that transaction costs are often due to the difficulty of evaluating the fairness of a specific exchange of goods and services. Besides asset specificity and the metering problem, which are treated in the transaction-cost economics literature, the organizational justice literature is especially relevant. Beginning with the work of Ouchi (1980), the paper examines some of the ways that the organizational justice literature complements transaction-cost economics. Because mechanisms that order economic transactions are essentially conflict-resolution structures, we develop a model of economic organization in which transaction costs are related to the perception of fairness in economic exchange. In the literature, governance mechanisms are selected so as to minimize transaction costs. Based on the organizational justice framework, we suggest that the transaction-cost calculus is affected by the perception of fairness in the exchange. In addition, the relationship between the governance mechanism and the perception of fairness is moderated by the elements of interactional justice that characterize the exchange."}, {"e:author": ["Paul M.

However experts themselves may be prone to skewed decision making as the stability of their own industry environment changes and as their positioning within the industry shifts. We examine this possibility in the context of expert credit-rating agencies (“agencies”) and their risk ratings of emerging-market sovereign borrowers (“ratings”) published from 1987 to 1998, a period that includes both industry stability (1987–1996) and industry turbulence set off by financial crises in several emerging-market countries (1997–1998). After controlling for macroeconomic and related objective risk factors linked to the sovereigns themselves, we find several points: (1) agency ratings during crisis-induced industry turbulence are negatively skewed, indicating undue pessimism among these experts, in line with decision-making perspectives predicting negative reaction by experts in an effort to retain legitimacy with salient stakeholders, in this case, investors and public regulators; (2) this negative shift is greater for incumbent firms and regionally focused firms, possibly because of the loss of previous informational advantages; and (3) this negative shift during crisis-induced turbulence is greater as industry rivalry among these experts increases in particular market segments, possibly indicating the development of competitive bandwagons among experts. Together, our results suggest that objective assessments by expert organizations are vulnerable to substantial distortion from the confluent effects of industry instability and expert positioning within the industry, particularly positioning affecting rivalry among experts.

The author uses a system dynamics model to explore the conditions under which unanimity rule supports the organization's ability to make decisions. Simulation experiments suggest that the dynamics and outcomes of unanimous decision making under and exceeding a critical threshold level of decision pressure are fundamentally different. Under this critical threshold, the decision-making system is capable of recovering from severe shocks to the system. If decision pressure is close to its threshold, a relatively small change can cause the decision process to collapse. In this respect, large groups operating under unanimity rule are less sustainable because they are more likely to exceed their critical threshold than small groups. Decomposing the decision-making system in small units, embedded in a hierarchical structure, therefore appears to be a necessary condition for sustainable performance in large organizations applying unanimity rule."}, {"e:author": ["Witold J.

Our theory begins with the problem as the basic unit of analysis, arguing that a problem's complexity influences the optimal method of solution search and the optimal means of organizing that search. The distinguishing feature that differentiates among organizational alternatives is the different way each resolves conflict over the selection of solution trials, that is, the way it chooses the path of search. Our theory predicts that efficiency demands that these governance alternatives be matched in a discriminating way to problems based on their associated benefits and costs in governing solution search. Thus, our theory is among the first to simultaneously treat both the boundary choice (i.e., internal versus external) and the choice among alternative internal approaches to organizing."}, {"e:author": ["Paul R.

This suggests that an underlying theme focuses on how CEO compensation is related to instrumental choices made in a competitive, capitalist culture. This study seeks to expand the understanding of CEO compensation by examining it in the context of other cultures, based on the premise that national culture plays a significant part in the nature of compensation strategies.We relate cultural dimensions (uncertainty avoidance, power distance, individualism, and masculinity-femininity) developed by Hofstede (Hofstede 1980a, 2001) to several dimensions of CEO compensation. These dimensions are total CEO pay, the proportion of variable pay to total compensation, and the ratio of CEO pay to the lowest level employees. The main findings of our paper are (1) all of the different dimensions of CEO pay were related to power distance, leading us to infer that CEO pay in a culture is most reflective of the strength of the power structure in a society, and (2) total compensation and the ratio of variable pay to total pay are related to individualism.We conclude that cultural dimensions can contribute to understanding cross-national CEO compensation. The implication of this conclusion is that there are different ways that CEO compensation fits into the cognitive schema of various cultures and, furthermore, that these cognitive schema vary across societies that affect the nature of the “cultural matrix into which [money] is incorporated” (Bloch and Parry 1989, p. 1). Moreover, our results imply that particular forms of CEO compensation do not mean the same thing in different cultures, but rather carry different symbolic connotations depending on the values dominant in a society. Thus, not only does the compensation structure of a firm within a culture have a symbolic meaning within organizations (e.g., Trice and Beyer 1993), but it can also be seen as an expression of deeper social values (Hofstede et al. 1990) that may differ across countries."}, {"e:author": ["Frank T.

We report an interpretive case study of an ERP system after its implementation in a large government agency.

We explain the change in enactments with the concept of <i>improvised learning</i>, which was motivated by social influence from project leaders, “power users,” and peers.

We construct an agent-based simulation in which multidepartment firms with different designs face environments whose turbulence and complexity we control. The model’s results produce two sets of testable hypotheses. One set pinpoints formal designs that cope well with three different environments: turbulent settings, in which firms must improve their performance speedily; complex environments, in which firms must search broadly; and settings with both turbulence and complexity, in which firms must balance speed and search. The results shed new light on longstanding notions such as equifinality. The other set of hypotheses argues that the impact of individual design elements on speed and search often depends delicately on specific powers granted to department heads, creating effects that run contrary to conventional wisdom and intuition. Ample processing power at the bottom of a firm, for instance, can slow down the improvement and narrow the search of the firm as a whole. Differences arise between our results and conventional wisdom when conventional thinking fails to account for the powers of department heads—powers to withhold information about departmental options, to control decision-making agendas, to veto firmwide alternatives, and to take unilateral action.

Therefore, although the use of social networks in job search may enhance women’s actual knowledge of prevailing wages, I hypothesize that institutional characteristics that employers could assume to constrain women’s networks and concomitant access to salary information will directly affect salary offers, as well as moderating the influence of network ties on pay. To test this perspective, job search outcomes of women attending elite coeducational and women’s colleges were examined. Regarding the number of offers obtained, women who consulted with proportionally more male peer and employed adult male advice ties received significantly more job offers than women using fewer male advice contacts. With regard to salary offers, this study reveals an institutional sex composition effect: women exiting single-sex institutions (i.e., women’s colleges) received significantly lower salary offers than women from coeducational schools, even after accounting for human capital, job characteristics, and institutional reputation. The effects of social networks on pay were moderated by institutional sex composition such that women exiting women’s colleges received lower returns in the form of salary to their cross-gender advice ties than did women from a matched coeducational institution. Implications of these results for theories of social capital and women’s occupational attainment are discussed."}, {"e:author": ["Mark Thompson"], "e:volume": "16", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1050.0120", "e:keyword": ["Communities of practice", "Situated learning", "Organizational knowledge"], "e:pages": "151-164", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1050.0120", "e:year": 2005, "e:title": "Structural and Epistemic Parameters in Communities of Practice", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "If communities of practice (Lave and Wenger 1991) are best understood as fluid social relations, enacted among a self-selected group of participants, then are they best left alone, free from “interference” by organizational managers and policymakers? Or are there ways in which organizations can provide helpful support to such communities, without constraining the delicate dynamic by which they are sustained?This paper supports the latter position, arguing that organizations should sponsor the creation of certain loose organizational structures, around which it is hoped that communities of practice may then interact. However, some recent empirical research is presented suggesting that attempts to control group interaction by introducing too much structure are likely to result in the demise of the community itself. It is therefore proposed that there are lower and upper parameters for structural intervention in communities of practice.It is suggested that such communities also have <i>epistemic</i> parameters, where participants’ willingness to express their ideas as conceptual boundary objects around which others may engage and develop ideas is a minimum requirement, but where too much inward communicative focus is likely to result in gradual loss of meaning, with a negative effect on the community. In developing this position, this paper attempts to deepen our theoretical understanding of the interrelationship between organizational structure and the epistemic activity of members of communities of practice. Several practical implications of these insights are discussed for organizations wishing to cultivate and maintain communities of practice within their own working environments."}, {"e:author": ["Violet T.

When evaluating the organization’s fulfillment of organization-wide promises, employees’ referents were primarily coworkers with whom they had close direct ties, namely, friends and advice givers. On the other hand, when evaluating the fulfillment of job-related promises, employees’ referents were mainly fellow workers who could substitute for them and people with whom they had multiple relationships.The effects of social influence also varied with the domain of promise evaluated. For organization-wide promises, employees’ fulfillment evaluations were similar to those of their friends. However, for job-related promises, their fulfillment evaluations were dissimilar to those of coworkers who played the dual roles of friends and substitutes.This study advances psychological contracts research by demonstrating that third parties to the psychological contract can influence fulfillment evaluations.

Despite this increased attention, we still know surprisingly little about how the dynamics of distributed teams differ from those of their collocated counterparts and how existing models of teams apply to this new form of work. For example, although it has been argued that distributed as compared with collocated teams have more severe conflicts that fester longer and resist resolution, few comparative studies investigate dynamics such as conflict in both distributed and collocated teams. In this study, we examine conflict, its antecedents, and its effects on performance in distributed as compared with collocated teams. Our goal is to understand how conflict plays out in distributed and collocated teams, thus providing insight into how existing models of conflict must be augmented to reflect the trend toward distributed work.We report the results of a field study of 43 teams, 22 collocated and 21 distributed, from a large multinational company. As expected, the distributed teams reported more task and interpersonal conflict than did the collocated teams. We found evidence that shared identity moderated the effect of distribution on <i>interpersonal</i> conflict and that shared context moderated the effect of distribution on <i>task</i> conflict. Finally, we found that spontaneous communication played a pivotal role in the relationship between distribution and conflict. First, spontaneous communication was associated with a stronger shared identity and more shared context, our moderating variables. Second, spontaneous communication had a direct moderating effect on the distribution-conflict relationship, mitigating the effect of distribution on both types of conflict.

This paper contributes to emerging work on boundary theory by examining the extent to which individuals desire to integrate or segment their work and nonwork lives. This desire is conceptualized and measured on a continuum ranging from segmentation (i.e., separation) to integration (i.e., blurring) of work and nonwork roles. We examine the fit between individuals’ desires for integration/segmentation and their access to policies that enable boundary management, suggesting that more policies may not always be better in terms of job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Using survey methodology and a sample of 460 employees, we found that desire for greater segmentation does moderate the relationship between the organizational policies one has access to and individuals’ satisfaction and commitment. People who want more segmentation are less satisfied and committed to the organization when they have greater access to integrating policies (e.g., onsite childcare) than when they have less access to such policies. Conversely, people who want greater segmentation are more committed when they have greater access to segmenting policies (e.g., flextime) than when they have less access to such policies. Moreover, the fit between desire for segmentation and organizational policy has an effect on satisfaction and commitment over and above the effects of demographic characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, income, number of children, and the ages of those children."}, {"e:author": ["Kyle J.

First, the spontaneous facet of improvisation tends to be overemphasized, and second, there is a general assumption that improvisation always leads to positive performance. Our goal is to clear up the conceptual confusion about improvisation by laying out the various aspects of preparation that are required for effective improvisation. In our theoretical model, we delineate how the improvisational theater principles of “practice,” “collaboration,” “agree, accept, and add,” “be present in the moment,” and “draw on reincorporation and ready-mades” can be used to understand what it takes to improvise well in work teams and to create a context favoring these efforts. Our findings support a contingent view of the impact of improvisation on innovative performance. Improvisation is not inherently good or bad; however, improvisation has a positive effect on team innovation when combined with team and contextual moderating factors. We also provide initial evidence suggesting that the improvisational skill can be learned by organizational members through training.

Definitions of reputation risk in the existing literature and the business community have a tendency to be static and asset oriented. We suggest that this contrasts sharply with insights on the social construction of knowledge that inform recent risk studies. Drawing on this critique, we argue that the ambivalence engendered by on-going processes of definition (responsibilities, boundaries, fact construction) characterizing the knowledge society demands a reconceptualization of reputation risk. We propose a reconceptualization of reputation risk that not only incorporates a more sophisticated view of reputation, but also acknowledges the role that risk and trust relations can play in its constitution. In addition to contributing to the theoretical development of reputation risk in the organization studies literature, we develop the notion of reputable action as a guiding principle for realizing active trust development in the practical management of reputation risk."}, {"e:author": ["Phyllis A.

These changes call for a renewed research focus on work design. Building on configuration and complexity perspectives, we propose a framework for studying work design. We argue that three issues require attention to advance the knowledge of work design: (1) defining the boundaries of work systems, (2) examining how the system is nested in a hierarchy within and between organizations, and (3) determining interactions between the elements of a work system. We propose a method of frontier analysis for identifying equifinal designs—the set of equally effective work designs for different combinations of inputs (situations or contexts) and outputs (performance criteria).

This paper examines the concept of regional industrial identity as a social code that (1) arises from the shared understandings of residents and external audiences about the suitability of a region for particular kinds of business activity and (2) influences decisions about where to locate investments. We argue that such understandings are principally informed by configurations of industry clusters that have already formed in a region. Clusters, which are the results of historical investments, are also important signals about the types of business that can thrive in the future.

We argue that many psychological processes related to power and social influence (such as escalation of commitment, similarity attraction and in-group favoritism, the disinhibiting effects of power, and the persistence of hierarchical structures) can all be logically derived from the self-enhancement idea, the desire to see oneself and one’s actions in a positive light.

Sensemaking is central because it is the primary site where meanings materialize that inform and constrain identity and action. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the concept of sensemaking.

We sense joint enthusiasm to restate sensemaking in ways that make it more future oriented, more action oriented, more macro, more closely tied to organizing, meshed more boldly with identity, more visible, more behaviorally defined, less sedentary and backward looking, more infused with emotion and with issues of sensegiving and persuasion.

We attribute this neglect to our field’s philosophical, theoretical, and methodological fealty to the precepts of equilibrium and linearity. We argue that ingrained assumptions and habituated methodologies dissuade organizational scientists from grappling with problems to which these ideas and tools do not apply. Nevertheless, equilibrium and linearity are assumptions of social theory, not facts of social life. Drawing on four empirical studies of organizational fields in flux, we suggest new intellectual perspectives and methodological heuristics that may facilitate investigation of fields that are far from equilibrium. We urge our colleagues to transcend the general linear model, and embrace ideas like field configuration, complex adaptive systems, self-organizing networks, and autocatalytic feedback.

A number of paradigms for the study of organizations were elaborated during the mid-1970s, including transaction cost economics, resource dependence theory, organizational ecology, new institutional theory, and agency theory in financial economics. These approaches reflected the dominant trends of the large corporations of their time: increasing concentration, diversification, and bureaucratization. However, subsequent shifts in organizational boundaries, the increased use of alliances and network forms, and the expanding role of financial markets in shaping organizational decision making all make normal science driven by the internally derived questions from these paradigms less fruitful. Instead, we argue that problem-driven work that uses mechanism-based theorizing and research that takes the field rather than the organization as the unit of analysis are the most appropriate styles of organizational research under conditions of major economic change—such as our own era.

We present evidence that common patterns of interaction between schemas and context may occur during sensemaking in organizations. In terms of theoretical implications, our framework focuses attention on the specific interactions between context and cognition (rather than on context or cognition alone) that comprise situated cognitions, and helps to more concretely define situated cognitions as momentary or temporally bounded perceptions. We offer several practical implications of this framework for managers and suggest avenues for further elaboration on our ideas through research."}, {"e:author": ["Giovanni Gavetti"], "e:volume": "16", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1050.0140", "e:keyword": ["Capabilities", "Organizational search", "Cognition", "Hierarchy"], "e:pages": "599-617", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1050.0140", "e:year": 2005, "e:title": "Cognition and Hierarchy: Rethinking the Microfoundations of Capabilities’ Development", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "This article identifies gaps in the microfoundations of capabilities research, particularly in work that is based on the framework of evolutionary economics. It argues that such research has focused excessively on the quasi-automatic, routine-based aspects of capability development, and largely neglected the roles played by cognition and organizational hierarchy. By deriving a model of search that jointly considers how routine-based and cognitive logics of action coexist within an organizational hierarchy to affect capability development, this article offers three contributions. First, it delineates the traits of a microfoundational structure for research on capabilities that begins to address these gaps. Second, based on this structure, it highlights previously neglected causal mechanisms that contribute to our understanding of how capabilities develop. The model shows that managers’ cognitive representations of their strategic decision problem fundamentally drive organizational search, and therefore the accumulation of capabilities. Furthermore, it shows that the accuracy of the representations a manager chooses might vary according to where she is situated in the organizational hierarchy. This more refined perspective leads to a set of propositions regarding how different hierarchical arrangements influence capability development and organizational performance.

Various streams of literature implicitly assume that financial markets influence firm strategies, yet the specifics of these interactions are not well specified. Motivated by a case study of the retail brokerage industry, this study proposes three particular characteristics of learning from financial markets. First, there is vicarious learning from outcomes (e.g., stock valuations), yet this has characteristics that are more similar to institutional forms of mimetic isomorphism. Second, the forward-looking and complex nature of financial valuations incites a paradoxically simplified type of crude heuristic learning. Third, there is a mutual and simultaneous learning process in that firms learn from financial markets, which in turn are themselves in a process of social construction. This combination of special characteristics suggests a number of learning pathologies that center around an increasing likelihood (compared with other types of learning and adaptation) of falling prey to misleading signals. A computer simulation, based on a model in which Cournot duopolists play a multistage game involving investment and cost reduction, explores the implications of these characteristics and pathologies in a systematic way."}, {"e:author": ["Julian Birkinshaw", "Mats Lingblad"], "e:volume": "16", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1050.0142", "e:keyword": ["Intrafirm competition", "Organization charter", "Evolutionary theory"], "e:pages": "674-686", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1050.0142", "e:year": 2005, "e:title": "Intrafirm Competition and Charter Evolution in the Multibusiness Firm", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "We develop a theoretical framework for a specific form of <i>intrafirm competition</i>, namely the extent of overlap between the charters of two or more units in a single organization.

We found that groups with a prior TMS and experience with two tasks in the same domain were more likely to develop an abstract understanding of the principles relevant to the task domain—a critical factor for learning transfer in general. We did not, however, find strong support for our contention that a TMS facilitates learning transfer after experience with only a single task. Further examinations of our findings showed that the extent to which members maintained expertise across tasks influenced the degree of learning transfer, especially for groups whose members had previously developed a TMS with another group. Our findings show that a TMS has broader benefits beyond the task for which it first developed because a TMS affects members’ ability to apply prior learning and develop a collective, abstract understanding of the task domain.

This study develops and tests a model that examines how top managers’ sensemaking of rankings affects organizational change. Specifically, the model proposes direct and moderated effects of a perceived discrepancy between the position assigned to an organization in the rankings and the position implied by the organization’s identity in the minds of its top managers (referred to here as a “perceived identity-reputation discrepancy”), on the extent of change undertaken by the organization. The research context used for the study was U.S. graduate schools of business. The results show that, as expected, schools whose top managers believed that their rankings were discrepant from their own perceptions of their school’s standing in the industry, were more likely to undertake organizational change. This relationship was moderated by top managers’ perceptions of the strategic impact of the rankings, and by the strength and external orientation of organizational identity; the relationship was not moderated by the perceived validity of the rankings.

Within the framework of an evolutionary view of technological change, we develop the notion of technological <i>preadaptation</i> to describe that part of a firm’s prior experience that is accumulated without anticipation of subsequent uses. In particular, we hypothesize that (technological) performance differences are positively related to (1) firms’ stock of relevant skills and knowledge potentially available for applications other than those for which they were originally developed and (2) the extent to which firms actually build on these skills and knowledge in new domains. The empirical setting is fiber optics technology as it evolved for use in long-distance communications between 1970 and 1995.

This paper analyzes one type of temporary organization, film projects, exploring the way in which roles both organize immediate work and maintain continuity across different projects. On each film set, role expectations are communicated through practices of enthusiastic thanking, polite admonishing, and role-oriented joking, which enable crew members to learn and negotiate role structures. Two important structural characteristics of film projects provide the organizational context within which coordination takes place: interorganizational career progression and projects as temporary total institutions.

Second, routine performances are embedded in an organizational context that, while it may not restrict the flexible use of a routine, may constrain its ongoing adaptation. Finally, accounting for the relative power of individuals sheds light on the interaction between agency and context in routine performance and explains why the actions of some individuals, but not others, can change routines.

We argue that this separation of domains is problematic. The economics literature, for example, is unable to explain why organizations should find it difficult to change incentive structures in the face of environmental change, while the organizational literature focuses heavily on the role of inertia as sources of organizational rigidity. Drawing on recent research on incentives in organizational economics and on cognition in organizational theory, we build a framework for the analysis of incentives that highlights the ways in which incentives and cognition—while being analytically distinct concepts—are phenomenologically deeply intertwined. We suggest that incentives and cognition coevolve so that organizational competencies or routines are as much about building knowledge of “what should be rewarded” as they are about “what should be done.” We argue that this recognition has important implications for our understanding of organizational inertia in the face of environmental change, and that it opens up important new areas for further research."}, {"e:author": ["Mariann Jelinek", "Terri L.

We study the key personal attributes of the individuals responsible for innovations, namely the innovative users, to explain creation of value in this organizational context. The main question is why such users contribute to firm-hosted user communities. Analyzing data derived from multiple sources (interviews, a Web-log, and questionnaires), we find that innovative users are likely to be (i) hobbyists, an attribute that can be assumed to (positively) affect innovators' willingness to share innovations, and (ii) responsive to “firm recognition” as a motivating factor for undertaking innovation, which explains their decision to join the firm's domain. In agreement with earlier studies, we also find that innovative users are likely to be “lead users,” an attribute that we assume to affect the quality of user innovation.

This cognitive paradox is explored using a multilevel, longitudinal case study of a newspaper organization’s response to digital publishing. The results suggest that the competing frames of threat and opportunity can coexist within the firm when it creates organizationally differentiated subunits. Such a structure minimizes the need to integrate competing frames at the subunit level, enabling different behaviors to be enacted simultaneously across different units of the firm. This differentiated organizational form places an increased burden on senior teams that have to manage the inconsistencies across subunits.

Specifically, we consider the case of Learning Lab Denmark---a research institute that has experimented extensively with aesthetically informed organizational design---in light of the mobile art of Alexander Calder and other constructivist artists who championed flexible design. We conclude that in such organizations, (1) designers must strike an ongoing, interactive balance between centric and acentric design orientations and practices, (2) aesthetic consideration is fundamentally important when it comes to crafting effective design, and (3) designing processes should be given as much attention as design solutions."}, {"e:author": ["Timothy N.

Increased permeability enables more effective use of resources and capacities, better matching of capabilities with market needs, and benchmarking to improve efficiency.

This surmise creates no problem in groups or small organizations where everyone knows everyone else. However, it becomes troublesome in large organizations where the set of people one individual discerns may vary considerably from that of another. Social network studies of large organizations examine people an individual perceives, but focus on interpersonal communication through salient relationships. They tend to neglect the many distant others who populate an individual's social context: those known only through company newsletters or office gossip, those with whom the individual never has contact, and those who carry little immediate salience. Data from a large organization are used to explore whether organizational reference groups provide distinct, useful information about individuals' perceptions of their social context at work. The findings replicate those showing individuals' preferences for similar others, but also note previously unobserved systematic differences in the composition of close associations compared to the broader ones of organizational reference groups. Distant associations are considerably more homogeneous than close ones.

We focus on two specific turnover events, ownership transfers and contemporaneous exit-entry pairs (cases in which both outlet entry and outlet exit occur within the same market within the same time period), because these events are likely to generate and release information without altering the total number of outlets in a market. We find that the likelihood of a multiunit owner's outlet exit declines when there are many ownership transfers and exit-entry pairs in other markets where the owner also operates outlets. We conclude that these turnover events, even in just one market where a small multiunit organization is present, generate vicarious information substantial enough to increase the survival likelihood of all outlets of that multiunit organization.

On the one hand, good reputation could be a disadvantage because expectations about product quality are more likely to be violated by defects in highly reputed products.

We empirically test these competing hypotheses using data on product recalls in the U.S. automobile industry from 1975 to 1999. Our results support for the idea that reputation can be an organizational liability in that highly reputed firms suffer more market penalty as a result of their product recalls. We also propose that the reputational effects are moderated by two important factors: substitutability and generalism/specialism. Our results show that having few substitutes with an equivalent level of reputation, or a focused product identity stemming from specialism, buffers the negative market reactions to product recalls.

Building on institutional theory, we predict that MNEs will respond to pervasive and arbitrary corruption in a host country by selecting particular types of equity and nonequity modes of entry. Using data on 220 telecommunications development projects in 64 emerging economies, we find that firms adapt to the pressures of corruption via short-term contracting and entry into joint ventures. We also find that the arbitrariness surrounding corrupt transactions has a significant impact on firms’ decisions, in addition to the overall level of corruption.

Findings from a study of 96 project teams at an international development agency reveal that the roles of cosmopolitans and locals were complex and sometimes valuable, but that cosmopolitans offered greater benefits than locals. The study also revealed that too many of each could hurt.

The first is the tendency of participant organizations to construct observed macrostructure locally, through relational activities that involve only a small subset of possible network ties. The second is the tendency for different types of ties to overlap, concatenate, and induce a variety of local structures---or relational motifs---across network domains. A critical task in the analysis of organizational communities is to specify appropriate local dependence structures across multiple networks, starting from detailed observation of dyadic interaction among participants. In this paper we illustrate one way in which this analytical task might be accomplished in the context of a study of interorganizational networks. We use data that we have collected on different types of relationships among 106 organizations, located in Southern Italy, involved in the production of means of transportation to test hypotheses about patterns of local network ties and paths across multiple networks. Our empirical analysis is guided by the general claim that the formation of network ties is subject to endogenous and exogenous processes. We specify statistical models for random graphs that allow us to examine this claim, and to formulate and test specific hypotheses about the form that such network-based processes might take.

Although insights from creativity research have been integrated into models of work design to increase the stimulants of creativity (e.g., intrinsic motivation), this has not led to work design models that have effectively reduced the obstacles to creativity (e.g., workload pressures). As a consequence, creative output among professionals in high-workload contexts remains disappointing. In response, we offer a framework of work design that focuses on the design of entire workdays rather than the typical focus on designing either specific tasks or very broad job descriptions (e.g., as the job characteristics model in Hackman et al. 1975). Furthermore, we introduce the concept of “mindless” work (i.e., work that is low in both cognitive difficulty and performance pressures) as an integral part of this framework. We suggest that to enhance creativity among chronically overworked professionals, workdays should be designed to alternate between bouts of cognitively challenging and high-pressure work (as suggested in the original model by Hackman et al. 1975), and bouts of <i>mindless</i> work (as defined in this paper).

In this context, the paper develops a transaction cost economics (TCE)-based model that distinguishes between the verifiable and nonverifiable aspects of governance attributes (of safeguards, incentive intensity, and adaptability) in explaining supplier performance variations. The paper argues that the following factors prove valuable for suppliers: (1) the adaptive and collaborative orientation fostered by the original equipment manufacturer’s (OEM’s) credible commitment to the exchange and by information sharing on the part of the supplier, (2) the presence of certain nonverifiable safeguards, and (3) the incentives inherent in target pricing. These assertions have been tested using data from the home appliance industry. Results indicate that information sharing together with (1) OEM dependence and (2) target pricing does indeed enhance supplier performance.

Status influences the perceptions of the remote group, as well as the willingness to cooperate with its members.

What becomes more central are activities such as altering the codes, differentiating the codes, introspecting the coding process itself, and, most of all, reducing the overall dependence on coding and codes.

Dan Levinthal and Claus Rerup begin the conversation in their essay “Crossing an Apparent Chasm: Bridging Mindful and Less-Mindful Perspectives on Organizational Learning.” Karl Weick and Kathleen Sutcliffe continue the discussion in their response “Mindfulness and the Quality of Organizational Attention.”Levinthal and Rerup describe the tension between mindful and less mindful or routine-driven processes. Building on the concept of mindfulness developed in the psychological literature, mindfulness is conceived as involving attentiveness and the ability to respond flexibly to contextual cues. By contrast, less mindful behavior involves fewer cognitive processes and greater reliance on previous routines. Levinthal and Rerup note that although the consequences of invoking routines in inappropriate situations can be disastrous, routine-driven behavior has many benefits for organizations, including conserving attention and capturing knowledge accumulated from previous experience in the organization. Levinthal and Rerup argue that mindful and less mindful perspectives complement each other and call for research on their interrelationship.Weick and Sutcliffe push the discussion of mindfulness in an exciting new direction by bringing Eastern conceptions of mindfulness to the debate. According to Weick and Sutcliffe, the information-processing emphasis in Western approaches to mindfulness concentrates on concepts and making distinctions while the Eastern version emphasizes nonconceptual awareness and reduced distraction. Weick and Sutcliffe argue that it is the quality---not the quantity---of attention that affects outcomes. Further, Weick and Sutcliffe provide an insightful discussion of the question whether mindful and less mindful processes are best conceived as a continuum or as dual processes.We hope that these essays stimulate future research on mindful and less mindful processes in organizations. Should mindful and less mindful processes be conceived as distinct categories that organizations alternate between over time? Alternatively, do mindful and less mindful processes coexist and support each other? What are the conditions under which mindful processes are likely to arise? What factors favor less mindful, routine-driven behavior in organizations? When will mindful processes be effective? What are the conditions under which less mindful processes will be associated with positive outcomes? We believe that better articulation of these issues will advance our understanding of organizational processes and performance. Enjoy!"}, {"e:author": ["Andrew B. Hargadon", "Beth A.

The model is grounded in observations, interviews, informal conversations, and archival data gathered in intensive field studies of work in professional service firms. The evidence suggests that although some creative solutions can be seen as the products of individual insight, others should be regarded as the products of a momentary collective process. Such collective creativity reflects a qualitative shift in the nature of the creative process, as the comprehension of a problematic situation and the generation of creative solutions draw from---and reframe---the past experiences of participants in ways that lead to new and valuable insights. This research investigates the origins of such moments, and builds a model of collective creativity that identifies the precipitating roles played by four types of social interaction: help seeking, help giving, reflective reframing, and reinforcing.

A suboptimal equifinality situation exists when organizations must satisfy multiple and conflicting functional demands with a restricted set of design options; these restrictions force all organizations to operate suboptimally. Gresov and Drazin (1997) speculate that in such a situation legitimacy claims are made about one function being more important than the other(s) so that an increased quantity of acceptable organizational forms are established. Additionally, they argue that a misfit penalty is likely to exist for organizations that deviate from the preferred configurational design. With data from the medical group industry, these speculations about suboptimal equifinality situations are tested using multivariate regression analyses. Findings show that the configuration type aligning with the preferred functional demand of quality performs relatively higher than those aligning with operational efficiency or attempting to meet both demands. Additionally, the greater the organization’s deviation from that design, the lower the financial performance. In summary, this study demonstrates that it is useful to take a functional equivalence perspective when examining variance in firm performance that is caused by design differences. Such an approach allows a more complete understanding of the fit-performance relationship by explicitly considering three factors: (i) the number of and level of conflict(s) among functional demands placed on the organization, (ii) the structural design options available to the decision maker, and (iii) the trade-offs that exist."}, {"e:author": ["James B.

Second, we build on the idea that legitimated forms codify prescriptive sanctions for deviations from identity blueprints, and predict that when an emergent population overlaps with an established one in identity space, its early proliferation will manifest violations of established social identities and will trigger prescriptive sanctions. Third, we rely on the notion of a focused identity to argue that organization-level changes affect external perceptions of the population’s collective identity, and hamper legitimacy. Analysis of the survival rates of financial cooperatives in Singapore---a population overlapping the identity and resources of commercial banks---confirms our predictions."}, {"e:author": ["Zhiang (John) Lin", "Xia Zhao", "Kiran M.

Questions arise: How should organizations, with their complex processes and human involvement, be designed if they are to perform well in such crises? Would organizations benefit from structural changes during crises? From a neo-information processing perspective that views organizations as composed of cognitively restricted, socially situated, and task-oriented actors, we argue that the causes and consequences of crises may be better understood through the systematic examination of both environmental and organizational factors. We address our research questions using a rather unique approach: a matched analysis of 80 real organizational cases and 80 computer-simulated organizations. The findings show that a crisis can present critical challenges to organizational performance both externally and internally, and that there is no design guarantee that a high-performing organization will continue to perform well during a crisis situation. In addition, when organizations restructure to adapt to crisis situations, they often face the serious challenges of having to understand not only the external environment, but also organizational design traps."}, {"e:author": ["Michael J.

We focus on one form of private decentralized institution---trade association--sponsored industry self-regulatory programs. We advance two alternative hypotheses to explain the sustained existence of industry self-regulatory institutions: (a) Firms participate to gain a participation-contingent benefit, and (b) firms participate to maintain a generally beneficial institution.

We further argue that the realized level of cooperative exchange norms can deviate from the expected level because the development of such norms is the result of social processes that management cannot directly and fully control. This gap between realized and expected norms affects exchange performance. Performance suffers when the realized level of cooperative exchange norms falls below the expected level, but overshooting expectations lays a critical groundwork for repeat transactions.

To address this discrepancy, we decompose the recruitment process into objective selection, subjective selection, and self-selection and theorize that the likelihood of passing a particular recruitment stage increases with the performance of the referrer under objective selection and self-selection, but remains undetermined at a stage of subjective selection. Our analysis of unique comprehensive data on online recruitment of sales agents in a virtual call center supports these arguments. The effectiveness of personnel as a recruitment channel varies with the type of the recruitment stage and performance of the referrer. When the firm evaluates candidates by an objective criterion, the advantage of a referral increases with the performance of his or her referrer; those referred by relatively high-performing workers are significantly better than the applicants who learned about the job from Internet ads. When job candidates self-select into the next stage of the online application process, the referral of any agent is more likely to continue than a nonreferral, and this likelihood increases with the performance of the referrer. On a subjective stage, the outcome is contingent on the intricacies of the recruitment process. In our case, an applicant’s chances of being hired increase with the performance of his or her referrer because the firm rejects the referrals of low-performing workers at a higher rate than it does nonreferrals, while it treats equally the referrals of high-performing workers and nonreferrals.

Importantly, it was predicted that these effects would emerge even after accounting for the influence of people’s economic concerns, which have been the primary focus of previous efforts to understand whether people support union formation. The results confirm these predictions and demonstrate that respondents’ positions on the unionization issue are shaped by procedural justice (Studies 1 and 2) and social identity (Study 2) even after accounting for economic factors. Furthermore, Study 2 shows that the impact of procedural justice judgments on union certification was partially mediated by social identity.

In this paper, we investigate the relationship between two types of contractual provisions that are important in high-technology contracts, or contracts for which environmental uncertainty or technological complexity are significant, namely, contingency planning and task description. Previous research suggests that contracts can vary significantly in the degree of detail with which such key provisions are written, and that they are each subject to learning. In this paper, we find evidence from a sample of 386 contracts that contingency planning and task description behave as complements in contractual design. We argue that this complementarity reflects patterns of learning to contract. We also find that repeated exchange between two firms leads to greater effort at contingency planning in subsequent contracts, a finding that is also consistent with learning effects, but not with frequently made claims that contracts and trust are substitutes."}, {"e:author": ["Narda R.

Results demonstrated that the effect of group-oriented incentive systems on the knowledge provider was enhanced when more positive norms for knowledge sharing existed among dyad members.

However, in most of the cases studied, daily practices remained somewhat decoupled from the prescriptions of the ISO 14001 system, of which employees generally had only a vague understanding.

The model starts by identifying a key source of temporal inflexibility for these workers: an inability to hand clients off among one other. Hand-offs are impeded by high levels of client-to-worker specificity, stemming from three common characteristics of professional service work. The organizational processes that reduce that specificity, and therefore facilitate hand-offs, function by (a) reshaping client participation and expectations about the nature of their service interactions, (b) partly standardizing client-related work practices, and (c) facilitating the sharing of knowledge about clients between workers. The presence of these organizational processes represents greater bureaucracy---an interesting twist, given that they create more temporal flexibility for workers. The model is grounded in field research conducted with primary care physicians, and is also evaluated using a unique survey data set of physician organizations.

Organizational theories have the potential to contribute to a better understanding of emergent response groups and how they efficiently coordinate knowledge, people, resources, tasks, and technology, thereby substantially improving disaster response for future catastrophes. We apply one organization science theory toward better understanding of these groups---transactive memory systems theory---which is a theory about knowledge coordination in groups. Our application of this theory to emergent response groups requires extending the theory in three ways: the role of expertise in task assignment, how groups function when credibility in member expertise cannot be validated, and how expertise is coordinated.

By using a historically grounded typology of national polities depicting the organization of authority (statism) and society (corporateness), I suggest how these two dimensions carry distinct logics about the individual’s role and, in turn, shape people’s training orientation. Training attitudes of people in 16 European (EU) countries/regions are examined using data from the 1995 Eurobarometer Training Survey. Results from hierarchical models show that, beyond the influence of individual characteristics, people from nonstatist (i.e., collective authority is located in civil society rather than in the state) and noncorporatist (i.e., individuals are incorporated into the society as autonomous actors rather than members in collectives) countries are more likely to prefer the continuous learning model of training.

In this paper we argue that by embodying novel technologies in objects with specific functional, symbolic, and aesthetic properties, innovating firms also endow their products with cues that trigger a variety of cognitive and emotional responses. Drawing on psychological research we articulate how such cognitive and emotional responses underlie initial perceptions of value and theorize how innovating firms can influence them through product form design. Our framework explains how product form contributes to perceptions of value by modulating the actual technological novelty of a product innovation and facilitating how customers cope with it. Our theoretical framework makes an important contribution to innovation research and practice because it articulates how product form can be used strategically to achieve specific cognitive and emotional effects and enhance the initial customer perceptions of the value of an innovation."}, {"e:author": ["Adi Katz", "Dov Te’eni"], "e:volume": "18", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1060.0237", "e:keyword": ["CMC", "Organizational communication", "Collaboration", "ICT design", "Mutual understanding", "Performance", "Shared terminology", "Adaptive behavior", "Contextualization", "Communication complexity"], "e:pages": "261-279", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1060.0237", "e:year": 2007, "e:title": "The Contingent Impact of Contextualization on Computer-Mediated Collaboration", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Computer-mediated collaboration, a rapidly expanding form of work, introduces unique opportunities but problems as well.

However, we hypothesize that contextualization is beneficial in some situations but not in others. Treating contextualization as a form of adaptive behavior, we propose a model for understanding its contingent impact on performance in collaborative tasks. We explain the motivation for contextualization and argue that it can be predicted by the extent to which the perspectives of the collaborators are different or shared: A difference of perspectives between collaborators motivates them to contextualize to increase mutual understanding (MU) and thereby increase performance. Computer support should also motivate communicators to contextualize by making it easier for them to do so. A controlled experiment tests these relationships in a collaborative machine-assembly task performed by dyads. We manipulate the collaborators’ perspectives and the level of computer support, and we measure contextualization behavior, MU, and performance.

The findings in this study show, however, that both organization-level performance feedback and population-level comparisons to other organizations affected incremental change of an innovative practice during its execution. The effects of these two information sources are not independent. Instead, results support a substitutional cross-level interaction. In addition, the study discovered that, when learning from their own experience, organizations engage in superstitious learning and do not let sufficient time pass before assessing the effects of prior changes.

The objective is to explore the evolving architecture of problem-solving networks and the critical roles that different agents play in the process.

We use this rarely examined process of regeneration to explore the question of how we can regard an organization as being the same entity over time. We suggest that this sameness stems from a coherence and similarity of actions at the organizational level that is analogous to the psychological notion of individual character.

This paper analyzes biotechnology firms jointly engaged in technological innovation and open scientific research and proposes that the geography of their collaborations should reflect the distinctive social logics of these activities. I hypothesize that projects involving local ties are more likely to be patented by a firm than are projects involving distant contacts, both because proximity is conducive to innovation and because a small firm’s social capital is likely to be greatest in its home region. However, classic studies in the sociology of science show that scientific communities are socially stratified and geographically dispersed. As a result, I hypothesize that ties to distant partners and prestige in scientific communities are positively associated with scientific impact but negatively associated with firm patenting. The analysis focuses on 5,143 collaborative research papers published by a large sample of small biotechnology firms. The average distance among coauthors on a paper is some 1,500 miles, indicating that the firms are engaged in geographically far-flung research networks; however, the distribution of teams in space is strongly bimodal, revealing an important core of regional ties alongside a set of much more distant ties. Regression analysis show that the spatially clustered teams are more likely to publish papers that are subsequently cited in the authoring firms’ patents, whereas teams that are globally dispersed produce papers that are more highly cited in the scientific literature, but less cited in the authoring firms’ patents. Status in the scientific community has the expected positive effects on paper citations, but a negative effect on patent citations. The results give evidence of different---and in some respects conflicting---logics governing the creation of new technologies on the one hand and valuable ideas in science on the other, highlighting challenges faced by firms that aim to profit from knowledge created in open scientific communities."}, {"e:author": ["Tammy L.

We tested these hypotheses using archival data and interviews in a geographically dispersed professional service organization. We examined how managers staffed 493 local and dispersed projects over a five-year period, and the financial outcomes of these projects. Managers created dispersed projects comparatively rarely; they did so when scarce expertise from other sites was needed to match customers’ project requirements. Dispersed projects garnered higher net earnings than local projects when there was a better match of scarce expertise to project requirements. However, a curvilinear relationship was observed, such that a very high percentage of dispersed experts on a project increased coordination costs and reduced net earnings.

After describing the objectives and the structure of the model, we report a first experiment that explores how the ruggedness of the landscape affects the interplay of local payoff and cognitive considerations (preferred direction) in search.

This escalation was driven by fragmented, piecemeal reactions resulting from the organizational structure of the Greek administration, which shaped identities, defined repertoires of action, sustained routines, and filtered and interpreted information. The division of labor inevitably imposed local responses that were not well calibrated. More importantly, the escalation was driven by a lack of hierarchical intervention, which was due to the conditions at the time. Drawing on this case as a natural experiment, the paper highlights the threefold role of hierarchy, which consists of devising means to structure attention and identify how problems are perceived and responded to; control and rein in routinized responses through exception management in the realm of actions; and helping to reframe problems by performing exception management at the level of cognition. In our case study, the hierarchy failed resulting in the issue being poorly framed, responses being local and disaggregated, and each partial reaction worsening the problem, leading to an escalation. This paper articulates a potential raison d’être for hierarchy, and considers the conditions that allow it to play its role to the full.

In this paper we develop and empirically examine a third perspective: The potential interdependence of these two explanations. Our results strongly endorse this third perspective. We find that prior history does not directly affect trust; instead, the observed positive relationship between the two is mediated by expectations of continuity. Consistent with this result, analyses further show that a longer prior history makes the effect of continuity on trust much stronger than a shorter prior history. We interpret these findings as suggesting: (1) the criticality and centrality of a shadow of the future (i.e., a forward-looking calculus) in generating trust in interorganizational exchanges and (2) that a shadow of the past plays a facilitating, albeit indirect, role in trust building. Our conceptual model also extends the conventional use of the transaction cost logic to show how reciprocal investments in asset specificity and uncertainty drive expectations of continuity, and consequently, interorganizational trust. Our results also show, unexpectedly, that prior history has a direct negative effect on trust after specifying the mediating path of continuity. Our moderation analysis indicates when this effect occurs: When weak expectations of continuity exist, trust is lower for exchanges characterized by a longer prior history, suggesting a potential darkside of overembedded ties."}, {"e:author": ["Giovanni Gavetti", "Jan W.

Our perspective employs the variable <i>time</i> to frame the question of strategy’s origins in a distinctive way. Over time, the cognitive and physical elements that make up a strategy become less plastic, while mechanisms to search rationally for a strategy become more available. This generates a fundamental tension in the origin of strategy: Managers struggle to understand their environment well enough to search rationally for an effective strategy before their firms lose the plasticity necessary to exploit that understanding. A focus on time allows us to synthesize and extend the evolutionary and positioning models of strategic search. Toward this end, we couple induction and deduction. The inductive part of the paper uses detailed observation of the search for a strategy at one firm to identify constructs that play a crucial role in strategic search.

We investigate conditions whereby IT investments enable industries to be more loosely coupled through alliance formation and the use of contingent workers. We use transaction cost and modular systems theory to ground our theoretical development. The extent to which industrywide IT investment is associated with loosely coupled organizational forms depends on (1) limited asset specificity because of industry standards, (2) the level of industry uncertainty resulting from technological change, and (3) the overall complexity of the industry in terms of diverse inputs. Specifically, when industry standards exist, IT investment leads to greater use of both alliances and contingent workers. IT investment has a stronger positive relationship with the use of contingent workers when levels of technological change are low as compared to when levels of technological change are high.

Using grounded theory methodology, we conducted a three-year study of an enterprise system implementation. From the data collected, we identified embeddedness as central to the process of change. When embedded in technology, organizational elements such as routines and roles acquire a material aspect, in addition to the ostensive and performative aspects identified by Feldman and Pentland (2003). Our new theory employs the lens of critical realism because in our view, common constructivist perspectives such as structuration theory or actor network theory have limited our understanding of technology as a mediator of organizational change.

However, we find that the spread of innovation across firms and institutional levels is far from linear and straightforward, and that other well-regarded firms raised strong opposition to the institutionalization of corporate governance reforms. Eventually, the Ministry of Justice revised the Commercial Code to legitimize different systems, which led to the emergence of diverse corporate governance practices. Based on the results of our study, we construct an analytical framework to examine innovation diffusion in light of conflicting institutional pressures for change and continuity. Our analysis adds complexity to the convergence-divergence debate by identifying the creation of hybrid corporate governance systems and the nonlinear evolution of such systems as a result of interactions across multiple levels. We show the various degrees of decoupling from the Anglo-American model and identify the antecedents.

We hypothesize that firm-patenting output depends not only on research and development (R&D) resources, but also on the patent law expertise combined with R&D inside the firm. We predict that the specialization of this in-house legal resource to R&D enables firms to identify patentable inventions more effectively and to convert them into patents. We also argue that there may be a positive complementary relationship between patent law expertise and R&D, such that patent law expertise will have a larger effect on patent output when it is deployed with matching higher levels of R&D. Furthermore, we predict that the effect of internal patent law expertise on firm patenting will be moderated by organization- and industry-level contextual factors. To test our hypotheses, we examine the patenting performance of a sample of Fortune 500 firms from 1990 to 2000. Results suggest that in-house patent law expertise is a significant predictor of firm-patenting performance; furthermore, this effect is moderated by the firm's level of top management team (TMT) patent law background and industry-patenting pressures. However, our hypothesis of a complementary relationship between patent law expertise and R&D was not supported; instead, we found evidence of a counterintuitive (weak) negative interaction between these two variables.

The effect of turnover on performance, however, is mitigated by the nature of management at the store level. The particular aspect of management on which we focus is <i>process conformance</i>---the extent to which managers aim to reduce variation in store operations in accordance with a set of prescribed standards for task performance. At high-process-conformance stores, managers use discipline in implementing standardized policies and procedures, whereas at low-process-conformance stores, managers tolerate deviations from these standards. We find that increasing turnover does not have a negative effect on store performance at high-process-conformance stores; at low-process-conformance stores, the negative effect of turnover is pronounced.

In terms of personal attributes, individuals are more likely to participate if they trained at institutions that had accepted the new initiative and been active in technology transfer. In addition, we find that the longer the time that had elapsed since graduate training, the less likely the individual was to actively embrace the new commercialization norm. Considering the localized social environment, we find that when the chair of the department is active in technology transfer, other members of the department are also likely to participate, if only for symbolic reasons. We also find that technology transfer behavior is calibrated by the experience of those in the relevant cohort. If an individual can observe others with whom they identify engaging in the new initiative, then they are more likely to follow with substantive compliance.

For this purpose, we adopt a critical discursive perspective that allows us to discover how specific conceptions of strategy work are reproduced and legitimized in organizational strategizing. Our empirical analysis is based on an extensive research project on strategy work in 12 organizations. As a result of our analysis, we identify three central discourses that seem to be systematically associated with nonparticipatory approaches to strategy work: “mystification,” “disciplining,” and “technologization.” However, we also distinguish three strategy discourses that promote participation: “self-actualization,” “dialogization,” and “concretization.” Our analysis shows that strategy as practice involves alternative and even competing discourses that have fundamentally different kinds of implications for participation in strategy work.

We posit that task familiarity is more beneficial with more complex tasks (i.e., tasks that are larger or with more complex structures) and that team familiarity is more beneficial when team coordination is more difficult (i.e., for larger or geographically dispersed teams). Finally, we propose that the effects of task familiarity and team familiarity on team performance are complementary. Based on a field study of geographically distributed software teams, two of our hypotheses are disconfirmed: Our results show that the beneficial effects of task familiarity decline when tasks are more structurally complex and are independent of task size. Conversely, the hypotheses for team familiarity are confirmed as the benefit of team familiarity for team performance is enhanced when team coordination is more challenging---i.e., when teams are larger or geographically dispersed. Finally, surprisingly, we find that task and team familiarity are more substitutive than complementary in their joint effects on team performance: Task familiarity improves team performance more strongly when team familiarity is weak and vice versa.

We adopt a qualitative approach to guide the development of grounded theory across multiple levels of analysis, including the industry (consisting of multiple actors), organizational, and individual creator levels. Our study shows that business and production interests currently drive the rationalization of video game production. There is a maturing trend, with product designs becoming well established as genres, and consumers and publishers desiring incrementally innovative games. This leads publishers to focus on acquiring intellectual property, and publishers and studios alike to make incrementally innovative sequels. The increasing complexity of products leads to further rationalization in their development. However, the need to satisfy consumers' continually evolving tastes and game developers' inclinations to be creative also creates tensions with these rational forces. Different actors balance these tensions differently. Studios may seek to balance these by shifting between more and less innovative products, by creating original intellectual property to increase their bargaining power with publishers, and by iterating and repositioning products during development to adapt them to the market. Publishers may enhance their portfolio by hiring highly creative designers into their stable.

We argue that investments into different IT assets are guided by firms' strategies (e.g., cost leadership or innovation) and deliver value along performance dimensions consistent with their strategic purpose. We hypothesize that firms derive additional value per IT dollar through a mutually reinforcing system of organizational IT capabilities built on complementary practices and competencies.

Our results---based on data on IT investment allocations and IT capabilities in 147 U.S. firms from 1999 to 2002---demonstrate that IT investment allocations and organizational IT capabilities drive differences in firm performance.

Yet concepts and theories of organizational form and function remain remarkably silent about these changes. Our analysis offers five affordances---visualizing entire work processes, real-time/flexible product and service innovation, virtual collaboration, mass collaboration, and simulation/synthetic reality---that can result from the intersection of technology and organizational features. We explore how these affordances can result in new forms of organizing. Examples from the articles in this special issue “Information Technology and Organizational Form and Function” are used to show the kinds of opportunities that are created in our understanding of organizations when the “black boxes” of technology and organization are simultaneously unpacked."}, {"e:author": ["Geoffrey G.

We find that narrowly experienced teams have trouble adding functional expertise not already embodied in the team. We also find that firms beginning with a limited range of functional positions are less likely to develop complete functional structures. Importantly, we do not find functional structure and functional experience to be interchangeable. We find that firms beginning with more complete functional structures are likely to go public faster, and firms beginning with broadly experienced team members obtain venture capital more quickly regardless of the experience and structural composition of the top management team in place at the time of these outcomes. Further, broadly experienced founding teams that build an early team with a full complement of functional positions achieve important milestones faster than firms that start with neither experience nor structure. This suggests that creating positions as “placeholders” in new ventures, where positions are created and filled with the intent of bringing individuals with more relevant experience onboard later, is not obviously a path by which to succeed.

By varying the level of transaction costs and changing the structure of the correlation between upstream and downstream capabilities in the industry, learning curves, and the way in which profitability leads to capability improvement in the upstream and downstream segments, I generate numerical results to explain how vertical integration evolves over time. The results suggest that (a) with no capability differences, even if transaction costs are nil, firms remain integrated; (b) transaction costs catalyze the underlying capability differences to drive scope; (c) dynamic factors, such as learning curves, returns to investment in capabilities, or limits to expansion, exacerbate small, random capability differences and as such promote specialization. These dynamic factors can by themselves lead to substantial specialization when they <i>differ</i> between the upstream and downstream segments.

We document the existence of a norms-based IP system among a sample of accomplished French chefs. These chefs consider recipes they develop to be a very valuable form of IP. At the same time, recipes are <i>not</i> a form of innovation that is effectively covered by law-based IP systems. Via grounded research, we identify three strong implicit social norms related to the protection of recipe IP.

In our discussion, we compare the attributes of norms-based and law-based IP systems, arguing that each has different advantages and drawbacks.

Moreover, an individual's view of her network's TMS will be shaped not by specific policies or enforcement mechanisms, but by semistructures for how knowledge is disseminated, owned, and discussed. Our theory is supported based on a survey of security professionals responding to national security threats.

This phenomenon of “process virtualization” is happening in many contexts, including formal education (via distance learning), shopping (via electronic commerce), and friendship development (via social networking sites and virtual worlds). However, some processes are more amenable to virtualization than others. For example, distance learning seems to work better for some educational processes than others, and electronic commerce has worked well for some shopping processes but not for others. These observations motivate the central question posed in this paper: What factors affect the “virtualizability” of a process? This question is becoming increasingly important as advances in information technology create the potential for society to virtualize more and more processes. To provide a general theoretical basis for investigating this question, this paper proposes “process virtualization theory,” which includes four main constructs (sensory requirements, relationship requirements, synchronism requirements, and identification and control requirements) that affect whether a process is amenable or resistant to being conducted virtually. Recognizing that processes can be virtualized with or without the use of information technology, this paper makes explicit the theoretical significance of information technology in process virtualization by discussing the moderating effects of representation, reach, and monitoring capability. This helps explain how advances in information technology are enabling a new generation of virtual processes."}, {"e:author": ["Cynthia E. Devers", "Gerry McNamara", "Robert M.

Incorporating a behavioral perspective into our models of incentive alignment provides us with new and potentially more accurate predictions about how individual elements of CEO pay will influence risk selection, as well as how equity compensation interacts with cash compensation and with other factors to influence risk preferences. In general, this study provides evidence that CEO equity-based compensation significantly influences strategic risk, but that this influence is more nuanced and complex than conventional treatments of executive compensation assume. In particular, we find that different forms of equity-based pay exhibit dissimilar influences on strategic risk and that their influence changes as their value and vesting status change. Second, we find that cash-based forms of pay moderate the incentive properties of equity-based pay, indicating that cash-based pay may affect how executives perceive risks associated with equity pay. Finally, we find that stock price volatility and board actions each also moderate the incentive effects of equity-based pay.

Accordingly, form emergence is best characterized as contextual rather than as an inherent attribute of the categories of candidate organizations. Using data on the U.S. commercial television industry from 1940 to 1960, we explore how entry rates of TV stations were affected by audiences' expectations about the identity of the nascent domain and by the densities of organizations with different origins.

With recognition of the bounded rationality of decision makers and the goal-directed, rule-based nature of organizations, this model suggests that a comparison between firms' performance expectation and performance target translates the cognitive representation of the firms' future into their subsequent actions. By examining the research and development (R&D) expenditures of U.S. manufacturing firms from 1980 to 2001, this study explores how performance, aspirations, expectations, and slack affect decision making about firms' R&D search investments. The findings show that both performance feedback and performance prospect are important determinants of firms' search behavior after controlling for firm, industry, and time effects. In addition, backward- and forward-looking determinants have interactive effects on search behavior. Firms' problem-driven search activity further increases when firms feel unlikely to achieve the performance target for another year.

The model (1) identifies organizational complexity mechanisms underlying the development of trust in international strategic alliances, (2) points to alliance size as an important factor that conditions the trust-performance relationship, (3) incorporates a new, third-order conceptualization of interpartner trust in alliances, and (4) suggests a theory-based multidimensional assessment of alliance performance. Based on data collected through personal interviews in 177 international strategic alliances, the results suggest that, while interpartner trust is positively associated with alliance performance, this relationship becomes stronger when alliance size declines. We find that both distributive fairness and partner similarity are central to the achievement of a trusting alliance partnership. Managerial insights into developing successful trust-based international alliance exchanges are offered, and fruitful avenues of research are discussed."}, {"e:author": ["Liliana Pérez-Nordtvedt", "G.

We also consider how the creation of these narratives is relevant to courageous collective action in more common organizational circumstances, and identify how this analysis suggests new insights into our understanding of the core framing tasks of social movements, ways in which social movement actors draw on social infrastructure, the role of discourse and morality in social movements, the formation of collective identity, and resource mobilization."}, {"e:author": ["Anne Marie Knott", "Hart E.

Managers in some organizations facing actual or expected performance shortfalls tend to take risks, while managers in other poorly performing organizations avoid risky changes. This conflict is interesting because some level of risk taking appears necessary for organizations to remain competitive, adapt to their environment, and improve performance. This study examines several mechanisms that moderate risk taking following performance shortfalls. First, I draw from organizational learning theories to argue that organizations with limited operating experience are less buffered from failure, and hence that poor performance constrains risk taking at these organizations. Second, I argue that organizations with poor legitimacy are also less buffered, and hence that performance shortfalls also lead to risk aversion at these organizations. Third, I draw from structural inertia theory to suggest that older organizations are less able to support risk taking following performance shortfalls. A test of these hypotheses on the capacity expansion behavior of U.S. railroad companies generally supports these hypotheses, although the effect of age is weaker.

However, when opportunism creates exchange hazards, which escalate in nonrecurring transactions, individuals will be reluctant to take full advantage of the gains from switching to more valuable partners, thereby leading to “overembedded” exchanges. Instead of embracing new, valuable exchanges with strangers whose propensity to cooperate is uncertain, individuals may prefer to preserve recurring ties with familiar actors. Two mechanisms may encourage movement out of committed relationships in those conditions. First, formal contracts should serve as a safeguard to market participants, in the sense that they limit potential losses due to opportunistic behavior. Second, trust in general others (as opposed to trust in familiar people) reduces participants' perception of hazards in market exchanges, and hence promotes transactions among strangers. By increasing the propensity to initiate new exchanges, general trust also diminishes the role of contracts in causing movement out of committed relationships.

However, theories of technological evolution and innovation remind us that networks may undergo significant change as technological discontinuities exert pressures on existing relationships and firms engage in exploratory search. How can we incorporate sources of change into our theories of network evolution instead of focusing so squarely on sources of inertia? By using recent advances in graph theory, we develop a more flexible theory of network evolution by examining two patterns of partner selection that have the potential to change networks: “shortcut” formation between relatively unconnected partner clusters, and the entry of new firms into the “main component” of incumbent partners. Our findings suggest an important contingency for the endogeneity perspective: structural homophily predicts shortcut formation but not alliance formation within clusters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the pattern of alliance formation between incumbents and new entrants to the alliance network is driven by a combination of endogenous and exogenous mechanisms. New entrants attach to more prominent incumbents, but they are more likely to attach with an alliance deal that comprises multiple partners. We demonstrate these findings in an industry where systemic technology encourages cooperation and where network entry is prevalent---the mobile communications industry from 1993--2002."}, {"e:author": ["Sarah Kaplan"], "e:volume": "19", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1070.0340", "e:keyword": ["Cognition", "Cognitive frames", "Framing", "Strategy making", "Strategy process", "Strategy as practice", "Social movements", "Politics"], "e:pages": "729-752", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1070.0340", "e:year": 2008, "e:title": "Framing Contests: Strategy Making Under Uncertainty", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "I develop a model of framing contests to elucidate how cognitive frames influence organizational strategy making. By using ethnographic techniques to study the day-to-day practices of strategy making in one firm, I examine the ways actors attempted to transform their own cognitive frames of a situation into predominant frames through a series of interactions. Frames are the means by which managers make sense of ambiguous information from their environments. Actors each had cognitive frames about the direction the market was taking and about what kinds of solutions would be appropriate. Where frames about a strategic choice were not congruent, actors engaged in highly political framing practices to make their frames resonate and to mobilize action in their favor. Those actors who most skillfully engaged in these practices shaped the frame that prevailed in the organization. This framing perspective suggests that frames are not only instrumental tools for the ex post justification of actions taken through power, but rather are an ex ante part of the political process that produces decisions. Uncertainty opens up the possibility for new actors to gain power, and contesting frames is a way of changing the power structures in the organization. A principal contribution of the framing contests model is to locate a middle ground between cognitive and political models of strategy making, one in which frames are both constraints and resources and outcomes can be shaped by purposeful action and interaction to make meaning."}, {"e:author": ["Dovev Lavie", "Stewart R.

This study introduces the notion of alliance portfolio internationalization (API), which refers to the degree of foreignness of partners in a firm's collection of immediate alliance relationships. We develop a framework to explain how API impacts firm performance. We suggest that as a firm's API increases, financial performance is expected to initially decline, then improve, and finally decline again. This sigmoid relationship between API and financial performance is ascribed to evolving learning effects that shape the net benefits of API. When the firm's alliance portfolio, on average, consists of proximate foreign partners, the firm may fail to recognize latent national differences, but at moderate levels of API, its absorptive capacity and specialized collaborative routines support the exchange of valuable network resources. Nevertheless, high levels of API undermine firm performance because of the failure of collaborative routines and mounting liabilities of cross-national differences. We test the framework using data on the alliance portfolios of U.S.-based software firms from 1990 to 2001. The results provide support for the sigmoid relationship as well as for our predictions that firms, which have gained experience with foreign partners and maintained wholly owned subsidiaries in their partners' countries of origin, can overcome some of the liabilities of API and better leverage its benefits."}, {"e:author": ["Chi-Nien Chung", "Xiaowei Luo"], "e:volume": "19", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1070.0342", "e:keyword": ["Institutional theory", "Agency theory", "Corporate governance models", "Corporate restructuring", "Business groups", "Emerging economies"], "e:pages": "766-784", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1070.0342", "e:year": 2008, "e:title": "Institutional Logics or Agency Costs: The Influence of Corporate Governance Models on Business Group Restructuring in Emerging Economies", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Business groups, the leading economic players in emerging economies, have responded to the market-oriented transition primarily through corporate restructuring. Agency theory predicts that acquisition and divestiture would serve the interests of dominant families and foreign investors in different ways. Further, dominant families, foreign investors from shareholder-based countries, and foreign investors from stakeholder-based countries each operate under distinct institutional logics of appropriate restructuring strategies. We test hypotheses about agency and institutional mechanisms using large business groups in Taiwan between 1986 and 1998 as our empirical example. We find that, consistent with both mechanisms, family-controlled business groups are less likely to divest of unrelated businesses. However, the institutional logics mechanism can better explain the relative lack of unrelated acquisition in family-controlled groups and the difference in divestiture between groups with more shareholder-based foreign investment and those with more stakeholder-based investment.

This leniency applies to a select subset of workers and enhances their desired occupational identity.

We evaluate hypotheses using a novel three-stage switching regression model and a sample of 222 component-sourcing arrangements of two assemblers in the automobile industry. Analysis of our data broadly supports our hypotheses. High levels of preexisting interorganizational trust increased the probability that a less formal, and thus less costly, mode of governance was chosen over a more formal one. This finding suggests a substitution effect of interorganizational trust on governance mode choice that in turn shapes exchange performance.

Little research has addressed issues related to compensating nondedicated teams, where team members perform tasks assigned by their home departments while also completing team work. In this paper, we provide analytical models to describe the unique decision-making processes engaged both by the firm and by such nondedicated team members. Our game-theoretic approach incorporates interdependency among team members into cross-functional team yield functions and takes into account the social benefits generated from team interactions for both firms and individual employees.

This paper considers two research questions. The first is, “What is peer monitoring?” We found two types of peer monitoring. Direct peer monitoring occurs when workers notice their peers' behavior or results and respond in a forthright way, such as correcting coworkers who make mistakes. Indirect peer monitoring occurs when workers gossip about or avoid poorly performing peers. The second research question is, “Is peer monitoring associated with higher work-unit performance?” We examined the effects of both types of peer monitoring on the performance of 67 theme park work units. We considered supervisory monitoring, task interdependence, and cohesiveness as moderators. We measured performance as the degree to which the work unit is free of employee behavior problems and found a positive main effect of direct peer monitoring. The effect was stronger when supervisory monitoring was low or task interdependence was high. Indirect peer monitoring did not have a main effect on work-unit performance, but when supervisory monitoring or cohesiveness was high, indirect peer monitoring was associated with lower performance.

Our results from these experiments both formalize the intuition behind existing wisdom and provide new insights. We show that imposing a multitude of weakly correlated performance measures on even simple organizations (i.e., an organization comprised of independent employees) leads to a performance freeze in that actors are not able to identify choices that enhance organizational performance across the full array of goals. This problem increases as the degree of interdependence of organizational action increases. We also find that goal myopia, spatial differentiation of performance goals, and temporal differentiation of performance goals help rescue organizations from this status quo trap. In addition to highlighting a new class of organizational problems, we argue that in a world of boundedly rational actors, incomplete guides to action in the sense of providing only a subset of underlying goals prove more effective at directing and coordinating behavior than more complete representations of underlying objectives.

In this paper, I argue that firms with a wide scope of experience have superior absorptive capacity for dealing with heterogeneous information; hence, such firms will be able to extract performance improvements from network positions rich in structural holes. Furthermore, firms with a high level of historic multimarket contact (MMC) with their partners are able to reduce the risks of partner noncooperation, hence augmenting their performance compared to firms in open networks that do not enjoy MMC with their own partners. Finally, firms of low centrality in the industry's network of alliances will extract performance benefits from enhancing bargaining power as a result of exploiting brokerage opportunities in open networks.

The focus is on the determinants of a company's choice to outsource research projects to academic organizations. Because of the different institutional missions of academic organizations, outsourcing a project to a university allows a firm to commit not to terminate or alter a scientifically valuable project before it is complete. This commitment is potentially valuable for the firm in an environment where scientific value and economic value may not coincide, and scientific workers are responsive to the incentives defined by their community of peers. An economic model that formalizes these arguments is developed.

Firms founded in the Victorian Era actively sought alignment with the cultural elite and used pseudonyms to deceive observers into believing that their production of cultural products was consistent with their Victorian Era identity. In effect, pseudonyms allowed these firms to decouple their position in identity space from their position in product space by inflating production of identity-preserving products.

Narratives also enable people to translate emergent situations that are ambiguous or equivocal so as to promote real-time problem solving. With their accumulation, innovation narratives provide a generative memory for organizations that enable people to translate ideas accumulated from particular instances of past innovation to inform current and future efforts."}, {"e:author": ["Thomas Keil", "Rita Gunther McGrath", "Taina Tukiainen"], "e:volume": "20", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1080.0373", "e:keyword": ["Corporate ventures", "Performance", "Failure", "Capability life cycles", "Coevolution"], "e:pages": "601-620", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1080.0373", "e:year": 2009, "e:title": "Gems from the Ashes: Capability Creation and Transformation in Internal Corporate Venturing", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Our longitudinal study of the entire population of internal corporate ventures within a large European electronics manufacturer finds that the conventional focus in the corporate venturing literature to evaluate ventures based on business growth and financial performance may be misguided.

Ventures' main contribution was often to transfer valuable capabilities to other ventures or the firm's existing business units. The benefit from investing in ventures was therefore largely independent of their commercial success. Furthermore, estimation of success rates proved highly sensitive to the stage of the ventures at which sampling began. These findings suggest the need to reconceptualize the notion of early stage ventures and their success. We further found that the venturing process can be conceptualized as a nested system of simultaneous selection at both the venture and the capability level.

We hypothesize that resource variation in a market reduces entry but that not all firms are equally deterred by variation. In particular, firm experience with entry in general and with the target market specifically moderate the overall effect of market variation on entry. Our analysis of foreign market entry by U.S. telecommunications firms from 1985 to 2000 indicates that variation does deter entry and that experience moderates this effect, though not all dimensions of variation have significant effects.

We provide new insights based on an event study of the returns to 34 corporate investors from acquiring 242 technology startups. Consistent with predictions drawn from the absorptive capacity literature, we find that the effect of CVC investing on acquisition performance hinges critically on the strength of the acquirer's internal knowledge base: as CVC investments increase relative to an acquirer's total R&D expenditures, acquisition performance improves at a diminishing rate. We also find that firms consistently engaged in venture financing earn greater returns when acquiring startups than do firms with more sporadic patterns of investing, even controlling for firm profitability, size, and acquisition experience.

Our study of over 7,300 scientific publications by 177 research scientists working with more than 14,000 others over an 11-year period provides evidence that the relationship between a research scientist's professional network and knowledge creation depends on both ego network density and average tie strength.

Our analysis of these rare events, grounded in data collected through interviews and archival materials, reveals that the issue is not so much what organizations learn “from” rare events but what they learn “through” rare events. Rare events are interruptions that trigger learning because they expose weaknesses and reveal unrealized behavioral potential. Moreover, we find that three organizing routines---interpreting, relating, and re-structuring---are strengthened and broadened across a series of interruptions. These organizing routines are critical to both learning and responding because they update understanding and reduce the ambiguity generated during a rare event. Ultimately, rare events provoke a reconsideration of organizational identity as the organization learns what it knows and who it is when it sees what it can do. In the case of the B&O Railroad Museum, we find that the roof collapse offered an opportunity for the organization to transform its identity from that of a museum to that of an attraction."}, {"e:author": ["MB Sarkar", "Preet S.

Using data from 235 firms, we find that these three processes have a positive effect on a firm's alliance portfolio capital, and some of these effects are conditioned by a formal alliance function and diversity of the portfolio. Whereas the ability of proactive formation and relational governance processes to create value is further strengthened in the presence of an alliance function, that of the coordination dimension is weakened. Furthermore, the benefits of relational governance are strengthened for firms with diverse portfolios, whereas the benefits of coordination processes are weakened.

Building on transaction cost economics and the resource-based view, I argue that, because JVs often involve incomplete contracts, differences in wealth gains arise due to resource appropriation and private benefits. As a result, two factors become important in understanding whether a firm earns higher/lower wealth gains than its partner: (1) its <i>potential</i> for earning private benefits and (2) its <i>ability to extract</i> private benefits. As a test of the impact of the first factor, I propose that when a JV is formed, the partner that possesses more valuable resources is likely to earn lower wealth gains whereas the partner that possesses less valuable resources is likely to earn higher wealth gains because its potential for earning private benefits over the course of the venture is also higher. I then argue that the partner with less valuable resources is likely to extract higher private benefits and gain more when it has greater bargaining power and absorptive capacity. Conversely, the partner with more valuable resources is likely to protect itself better from appropriation when it has JV capabilities. I find support for these arguments in a sample of 344 ventures. The implications are that private benefits significantly influence value creation in JVs, and that a broad array of contingencies and factors affect these benefits which need to be considered when entering into a cooperation."}, {"e:author": ["Eero Vaara", "Philippe Monin"], "e:volume": "21", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1080.0394", "e:keyword": ["Merger", "Acquisition", "Discourse", "Legitimacy", "Legitimation", "Integration"], "e:pages": "3-22", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1080.0394", "e:year": 2010, "e:title": "A Recursive Perspective on Discursive Legitimation and Organizational Action in Mergers and Acquisitions", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "This paper challenges the predominant view that legitimation is merely a specific phase in merger or acquisition processes. We argue that a better understanding of postmerger organizational dynamics calls for conceptualization of discursive legitimation as an inherent part of unfolding merger processes. In particular, we focus on the recursive relationship between legitimation and organizational action. We have two objectives: to outline a theoretical model that helps one to understand the dynamics of discursive legitimation and organizational action in postmerger organizations, and to examine a revealing case to distinguish the inherent risks and problems in discursive legitimation. Our case analysis focuses on the merger between the French pharmaceutical companies BioMérieux and Pierre Fabre. We adopt a critical multimethod approach and distinguish specific discursive dynamics and pathological tendencies in this case. The analysis highlights the unintended consequences of discursive legitimation, the central role of sensegiving and sensehiding in discursive legitimation, the inherently political nature of legitimation and the risks associated with politicization, the special problems associated with fashionable discourses and the role of the media, the use of specific discursive strategies for legitimation and delegitimation, and the crucial role of actual integration results. This analysis adds to the existing research on mergers and acquisitions by treating discursive legitimation as part of the merger dynamics. In particular, our case analysis provides a new explanation for merger failure.

I study the question in two settings: the shift to digital technology in photography and the advent of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology in wireline telecommunications. I find evidence that analysts are more attentive and positive toward incumbents' strategies that extend and preserve the existing technology than toward strategies that respond directly to the new technology. In these settings, analysts largely ignore incumbents' strategies that directly incorporate the new technology for several years following the discontinuity.

Do organizations learn differently from rare disasters than they do from common minor accidents? In its present state, the organizational safety literature is poorly equipped to answer these questions.The present work begins to address this gap by empirically examining how prior organizational experience with disaster affects the likelihood that organizations will experience future disasters. It approaches the issue in the context of fatal U.S. coal mining accidents from 1983 to 2006. The analysis demonstrates that organizations do learn to prevent future disasters through both direct and vicarious experience with disaster. It also indicates that the mechanisms through which organizations learn from disasters differ from those through which they learn from minor accidents."}, {"e:author": ["Jeffrey J. Reuer", "Tony W.

The evidence shows that firms are more likely to partner with IPO firms possessing more valuable growth opportunities. Furthermore, this relationship is magnified for IPO firms that have obtained more visibility, either through various interorganizational relationships or media coverage on going public."}, {"e:author": ["Karen Locke", "Karen Golden-Biddle", "Martha S.

New-technology development projects are traditionally judged by market success---and most fail. If we examine their impact on existing-technology product development, a different interpretation arises. Drawing on the literature on the influence of social factors on interfirm search and adoption of new technologies, this study argues that similar processes occur intrafirm. Evidence from a field study on new-technology product development in high-technology firms shows that internal competition influences existing-technology product development groups to integrate the new technology into the next generation of their own products. The reason is twofold. First, these groups shift their search toward the new technology and allocate resources to gain a deeper understanding of it. Second, access to internal information and the mobility of workers across project boundaries benefit the existing-technology groups. The findings provide a model of innovation that illustrates an endogenous process of internal competition.

The second type deals with assessing whether the perceived capabilities of the actor meet the standard of desirability, which we call performance standard uncertainty. We propose and test that certifications will positively influence the long-term reputation of actors in situations that involve minimal technical uncertainty, and that, across levels of technical performance, certifications will have an inverted U-shaped relationship with assessments of actors such that certifications will have the greatest impact on assessments of actors who are close to the uncertain standard of desirability.

We find that attention toward the emerging technology and the affected industry is associated with faster entry, and attention to existing technologies is associated with slower progress. Second, we assess the extent to which the effect of cognition is dependent upon the levels of relevant organizational factors and find that CEO attention to the emerging technology may amplify the effects of industry orientation. Managerial cognition is important in understanding organizational outcomes, and considering both the direction of cognition and its interaction with organizational factors provides a more nuanced view of entry behavior.

We conducted 89 interviews in a high-tech multinational corporation with employees at multiple levels in two manufacturing and two R&D units that differed significantly on “speak up”-related items on a company-wide employee survey. Systematic analysis of the interview data led us to conclude that a broad spectrum of leaders from supervisors to senior managers influences individual employee voice perceptions in both direct and indirect ways. For example, informants referred to “skip-level leaders,” those leaders two to five levels above themselves, as reasons to view voice as risky or futile nearly as often as they referred to immediate bosses. We present evidence related to “how” and “why” these patterns of influence occur by reviewing the direct and indirect modes of influence identified and by outlining the managerial functions that provide occasions for skip-level leaders to have direct influences on employee voice perceptions. We also point to differences in the specific echelons of leadership that were most influential across the units studied. We propose that multilevel, multileader influences on voice perceptions result naturally from modern workflows, the essential functions performed by skip-level leaders, and deep-seated employee attitudes about authority in hierarchical organizations. We propose further that differences in which levels of skip-level leadership are most critical to employee voice perceptions in different units depend on which leaders have the power to handle strategic contingencies and to resolve key uncertainties within particular work environments.

Survey data from 62 additional teams in six other pharmaceutical firms are used, first to test the measurement model using structural equation modeling and second to test the relationships between external learning activities and team performance using random-effects regression models. Results show that vicarious learning activities are more strongly associated with performance when teams engage in more internal learning activities. Furthermore, vicarious learning activities in the absence of sufficient amounts of internal learning activities can hurt performance. The positive performance associated with contextual learning activities, by contrast, is unaffected by the level of internal learning activities.

Based on this idea, we delineate formal and informal senior team integration mechanisms (e.g., contingency rewards and social integration) and formal and informal organizational integration mechanisms (e.g., cross-functional interfaces and connectedness) and examine how they mediate the relationship between structural differentiation and ambidexterity.

First, identity serves as a filter, such that organizational members notice and interpret external stimuli in a manner consistent with the identity. As a result, identity-challenging technological opportunities may be missed.

These linkages are critical but overlooked elements of organizational ambidexterity. This paper develops a conceptual framework in which the ability to build and leverage organizational linkages involving the new technology and its complementary assets is essential for a successful technological transition. The framework also highlights the importance of middle management in creating and maintaining these linkages, which are critical to dynamic capabilities in technological transitions.

Stars hired in exploration roles can preserve some of their performance by moving with a group of colleagues from the originating firm. Investors view the hiring of a star analyst as value-destroying for the hiring firm regardless of whether the firm is hiring to exploit or explore, but the negative reactions are economically more extreme for exploration hires.

In a quasi-experimental setting, we examine the effects of configuration using a sample of 62 six-person teams in four different one- and two-site configurations. As predicted based on social categorization, we find that configuration significantly affects team dynamics---independent of spatio-temporal distance and socio-demographic factors. More specifically, we find that the social categorization in teams with geographically based subgroups (defined as two or more members per site) triggers significantly weaker identification with the team, less effective transactive memory, more conflict, and more coordination problems. Furthermore, imbalance in the size of subgroups (i.e., the uneven distribution of members across sites) invokes a competitive, coalitional mentality that exacerbates these effects; subgroups with a numerical minority of team members report significantly poorer scores on identification, transactive memory, conflict, and coordination problems. In contrast, teams with geographically isolated members (i.e., members who have no teammates at their site) have better scores on these same four outcomes than both balanced and imbalanced configurations."}, {"e:author": ["Haridimos Tsoukas"], "e:volume": "20", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1090.0435", "e:keyword": ["Knowledge creation", "Dialogue", "Innovation", "Tacit knowledge", "Boundary objects", "Creative cognition", "Metaphors", "Analogies", "Interaction"], "e:pages": "941-957", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1090.0435", "e:year": 2009, "e:title": "A Dialogical Approach to the Creation of New Knowledge in Organizations", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Despite several insightful empirical studies on how new knowledge is created in organizations, there is still no satisfactory answer to the question, how is new knowledge created in organizations? The purpose of this paper is to address this question by focusing on direct social interaction, adopting a dialogical approach. The following argument is advanced. From a dialogical perspective, new knowledge in organizations originates in the individual ability to draw new distinctions concerning a task at hand. New distinctions may be developed because practitioners experience their situations in terms of already constituted distinctions, which lend themselves to further articulation. Further articulation develops when organizational members engage in dialogical exchanges. When productive, dialogue leads to self-distanciation, namely, to individuals taking distance from their customary and unreflective ways of acting as practitioners. Dialogue is productive depending on the extent to which participants engage relationally with one another. When this happens, participants are more likely to actively take responsibility for both the joint tasks in which they are involved and for the relationships they have with others. Self-distanciation leads to new distinctions through three processes of conceptual change (conceptual combination, conceptual expansion, and conceptual reframing), which, when intersubjectively accepted, constitute new knowledge.

In this paper, we take these considerations as our starting point to build a dynamic feedback model of organization founding. According to the model, organizational founding is driven by expectations that entrepreneurs form about future levels of resources and, only indirectly, by current levels of population density. We explore the behavior of the model under a variety of experimental conditions. We show that the qualitative behavior of the model is consistent with studies that have linked the duration of preproduction stage with fluctuations in density during population maturity. Our simulation analyses sustains three main conclusions. First, historical trajectories of organizational populations that are consistent with empirical observations may be produced by mechanisms that are not directly dependent on density. Second, alternative hypotheses about how expectations are formed produce qualitatively different historical trajectories of density.

Thus, we theorize that a certain threshold of a given type of experience is required before each type of experience becomes valuable, with low levels of experience harming the organization. Furthermore, we propose that success and recovery experience will interact to enhance each other's value. These conditions can help overcome learning challenges such as superstitious learning or learning from small samples. We investigate our ideas using a sample of the U.S. commercial banks founded between 1984 and 1998. Our results indicate that both success and recovery experience of a firm generate survival-enhancing learning, but only after a certain level of experience is reached.

Although learning from rare events is statistically unusual, and effective learning from rare events is rare, both individuals and organizations can benefit significantly from active efforts to learn from rare events."}, {"e:author": ["Alistair Mutch"], "e:volume": "21", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1090.0441", "e:keyword": ["Information technology", "Information systems", "Critical realism", "Data warehouses", "Organizations and information", "Reflexivity", "Agency and structure"], "e:pages": "507-520", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1090.0441", "e:year": 2010, "e:title": "Technology, Organization, and Structure---A Morphogenetic Approach", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "This article relates Archer's morphogenetic approach, derived from the philosophical tradition of critical realism, to the use of information and communication technology in organizations.

In this study, we examine how competition affects the management of referral alliances over time. Because of the high level of inseparability of the professional service engagement, the nature of competition among specialists is complex. Building on the ecological view of competition, we model the degree of niche overlap in the specialist's home markets and the generalists' markets as well as the potential overlap due to the proximity of rivals vis-à-vis generalists. Using data on visiting consultant clinics involving cardiology specialty practices and rural hospitals from a Midwestern state over a 13-year period, we find that the various aspects of niche overlap influence the involvement of these specialist professional service firms in referral alliances as well as resources they allocate to these relationships. In addition to expanding our understanding of vertical, bilateral alliances between professional service firms, this study enhances our general understanding of strategic alliances by demonstrating how partner attractiveness and the actions of rivals affect the resource allocation decisions of firms managing multiple strategic alliances over time."}, {"e:author": ["Alfonso Gambardella", "Marco S.

We use an original data set of 146 U.S. cities to obtain variations in the extent to which they are populated by managerial firms or knowledge clusters. By utilizing city-level measures of managerial salaries, we test how the intensity of managerial corporation versus knowledge cluster characteristics affects the mean and dispersion of the “rewards” of cities. Our evidence suggests that higher managerial corporate characteristics lower the variability of rewards, while they have no effect on the mean of rewards. Higher-knowledge cluster characteristics produce both higher dispersion and higher expected rewards. We explain these results by looking at the different learning mechanisms of the two organizational types. In so doing, we highlight the role of intra- and interfirm knowledge processes as important sources of differences in the rewards of the two models.

Our model accounts for the effect of cognitive biases and hierarchical context on organizational interpretation. Because of their proximity to the interpretations of both strategic and front-line managers, middle managers can encourage divergence in interpretations of managers across hierarchical levels during early stages of the interpretation process and can blend and synthesize the divergent interpretations of managers during later stages. In this way middle managers contribute to a dynamic process of organizational interpretation in which multiple filters from throughout the organization help frame and enrich interpretations of rare and unusual events, which enables organizational learning."}, {"e:author": ["Gerben S.

I use a case study of the management of IT consultants in a financial services firm to explore how make-or-buy decisions are made. I find that senior managers at the firm focused on cost and organizational flexibility, whereas frontline managers concentrated on exploiting workers' existing knowledge. The narrow focus of these two groups interacted with the complex demands of transaction alignment to create three problems: separation of related decisions about internal capacity and project staffing, incomplete information when deciding on organizational capacity, and incentive misalignment in staffing consultants. These problems led the firm to become dependent on its consultants.

Teams comprised of individuals with diverse skills and expertise may be well suited to perform such work. However, as teams become more prevalent, organizations may struggle with ways to exercise control. <i>Formal controls</i>, with their focus on prespecified rules, performance targets, and hierarchical relationships, may be less effective in a teamwork environment than <i>clan control</i>, in which work-related behavior is motivated by shared norms and values, as well as a common vision, and individuals attempt to be accepted or “regular” members of a team. However, little is known about the antecedents of clan control. Much of the existing empirical research on the antecedents of control has been influenced by Ouchi's (Ouchi, W. G. 1977. The relationship between organizational structure and organizational control. <i>Admin. Sci. Quart.</i> <b>22</b> 95--113) framework, which posits clan control is used when managers lack knowledge of means--ends relationships and are unable to measure outcomes. This paper adopts the view that clan control is a “people” or social process and argues that social capital, a construct that reflects connections and relationships among individuals, is a missing, key antecedent of clan control. In particular, we posit that the existence of social capital enables team members, as well as project managers, to facilitate clan control within a team, i.e., team-based clan control. A model is developed and hypotheses are tested using survey data collected from 95 information systems project teams. The results suggest that social capital assets are associated with team-based clan control. Recognizing that the project manager typically has a different level of organizational authority than team members, additional hypotheses are developed relating characteristics of the project manager to team-based clan control. The results of these tests suggest that team-based clan control is also dependent on the manager's knowledge of business processes and the application area, coupled with the extent to which he observes the behaviors of the project team. Thus, our results suggest that there are conditions under which team-based clan control is facilitated by the project team as a whole (including team members and project managers), as well as conditions under which team-based clan control is facilitated by project managers in their role as team leaders.

These results provide an important caveat on the benefits of positive moods in work groups, and suggest that the study of trait × state affect interactions is an important avenue for future research."}, {"e:author": ["Denis A.

Likewise, research points to several factors that may facilitate the recognition of opportunities. Yet empirical observations have been limited by retrospective biases and other conceptual challenges. As a result, key questions remain not only about <i>what</i> factors facilitate the recognition of opportunities, but also about <i>why</i> these factors play such a role. To further understanding of these issues, we study the reasoning strategies that individuals mobilize for recognizing opportunities. We develop a model of opportunity recognition as a cognitive process of structural alignment, and analyze the think-aloud verbalizations of executive entrepreneurs as they try to recognize opportunities for new technologies. In contrast to prior research, the qualitative and quantitative data do not provide evidence that individuals use prototypes to recognize opportunities. Instead, we find that different kinds of mental connections play different roles in the process of recognizing opportunities, with different consequences. We also document why and how prior knowledge may facilitate this process. By drawing attention to the cognitive underpinnings of opportunity recognition, we cast light on why it constitutes such a challenging task for individuals and organizations. In turn, this provides a useful basis for exploring the factors that explain why some individuals/organizations are able to recognize opportunities that others simply fail to see."}, {"e:author": ["Simon C.

To test the model, an experimental methodology was used in which a member transfers from one group to another, transmitting knowledge in the form of a production routine. As predicted, work groups unlocked the knowledge transfer potential arising from personnel movement more often when they shared a superordinate identity than when they did not share such an identity, and this identity effect was moderated by knowledge demonstrability. When knowledge was less demonstrable with concealed merits, it was more likely to transfer between groups that shared a superordinate identity, compared to groups that did not share such an identity. By contrast, when knowledge was more demonstrable with apparent merits, it was as likely to transfer between groups that shared a superordinate identity compared to groups that did not share such an identity. As predicted, superordinate identity induced knowledge consideration, the focusing of group attention on determining the value of another's knowledge. Mediated moderation analyses revealed that this process underlies knowledge transfer. Superordinate social identity induced thorough knowledge consideration, which was more important for recognizing the value of knowledge when its merits were concealed rather than apparent.

Using data from an inductive study of two engineering occupations (hardware engineering and structural engineering), we analyzed engineers' <i>gap encounters</i> (episodes in which a technology gap appeared in the course of action) and found striking differences in how engineers minded the gaps. Hardware engineers minded the gaps by coordinating technologies via “bridges” that automated data transfers between technologies. Structural engineers, in contrast, allowed technology gaps to persist even though traversing gaps consumed significant time and effort. Our findings highlight a difference between task and technology in the degree of coordination necessary for success.

We argue that spin-offs can enable parent firms to realign with their environment, thereby avoiding the oncoming obsolescence arising from the combination of organizational inertia and environmental drift. Using data from the hard disk drive industry, we find evidence that although the main effect of having a spin-off on a parent firm's technological performance is positive, the overall impact of a spin-off depends upon the technological sophistication of the spin-off and the time since the spin-off occurred. Indeed, parent firms of technologically sophisticated (successful) spin-offs initially suffer poorer technological performance, but over time they outperform firms that had no spin-offs. Both effects are amplified to the extent that the spin-off is more successful, which we attribute to both increased environmental realignment and the positive signal that successful spin-offs transmit to the broader labor market about the parent organization's reputation as an incubator of entrepreneurs and a desirable place to work."}, {"e:author": ["Pierpaolo Andriani", "Bill McKelvey"], "e:volume": "20", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1090.0481", "e:keyword": ["Pareto", "Power law", "Gaussian statistics", "Oganization", "Average", "Extreme events", "Scale-free theory"], "e:pages": "1053-1071", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1090.0481", "e:year": 2009, "e:title": "<b>Perspective</b>---From Gaussian to Paretian Thinking: Causes and Implications of Power Laws in Organizations", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Although normal distributions and related current quantitative methods are still relevant for some organizational research, the growing ubiquity of power laws signifies that Pareto rank/frequency distributions, fractals, and underlying scale-free theories are increasingly pervasive and valid characterizations of organizational dynamics.

We define variability as any deviation in a production process yielding products or services whose attributes differ from the firm's stated target specifications. Firms pursuing products marked by low variability are more subject to maladaptation costs if production processes are not adjusted to avoid nonconformities. Furthermore, such adjustments often require idiosyncratic investments (e.g., dedicated information technology systems), thereby creating contractual hazards and potential underinvestment. We hypothesize that ownership of sequential activities in the value chain helps mitigate problems associated with maladaptation as well as suboptimalities in transaction-specific investment, thereby resulting in lower variability. Using data on delivery times from the Japanese international courier and small package services industry, we assess the variability-reducing role of ownership in two complementary ways. The first approach is parametric, allowing us to assess the impact of ownership on the variance associated with delivery time; here we focus on shipments that frequently fail to arrive precisely within the time period initially expected by customers. The second approach is more consistent with the notion of reliability, or the likelihood that shipments will not arrive later than expected: we nonparametrically estimate the distribution of deviations between actual and expected delivery time, and verify how distinct organizational choices change the distribution. Ownership of multiple segments yields a particularly pronounced effect on both variance and reliability.

We argue that each pole of a pair of opposing action strategies both energizes and detracts from elements of innovation. Thus, it could be expected that combining opposing action strategies leads to an impasse, as the negative effects of each strategy might offset the positive effects of the opposite strategy. There is currently no viable explanation in the literature for why this mutual neutralization may not occur. We aim to fill this gap by explicating why and how opposing action strategies, when implemented simultaneously, do not countervail each other's positive effects, but rather yield positive synergies that fuel team innovation."}, {"e:author": ["Scott F.

GPIs are substantial technical advances in the performance of products within technology regimes. Prior studies of innovation timing in the organizational strategy literature emphasize internally driven strategies of GPI. Although internally driven strategies may predominate when businesses face diffuse competition for their product lines, the literature largely overlooks the point that businesses need to be increasingly responsive to external events as market concentration increases. This study, which examines businesses competing in the U.S. packaged software industry in the 1990s, shows that increasing industry concentration raises the stakes surrounding market positions and leads to greater interdependence of innovation strategies in an industry---including interactions both with competitors and with other players in a larger system of complementary products. As concentration increases, therefore, organizations are less driven by historical patterns of innovation and become increasingly responsive to innovations by both types of external actors."}, {"e:author": ["Corinne Bendersky", "Kathleen L.

We suggest that phenomenological assumptions linking micro-processes to organizational contexts highlight the relevance of micro-process research findings to broader organizational questions and therefore increase the likelihood that the findings will disseminate to the larger field of organizational research. We test this assertion by analyzing studies of negotiation published in top peer-reviewed management, psychology, sociology, and industrial relations journals from 1990 to 2005. Our findings reveal a continuum of open systems to closed systems phenomenological assumptions in negotiation research. Analysis of the citation rates of the articles in our data set by non-negotiation organizational research indicates that more open systems assumptions increase the likelihood that a negotiation article will be cited in organizational studies, after controlling for other, previously identified effects on citation rates.

Controlling for past performance significantly weakens the positive relationship between brokering position and innovative performance. Furthermore, when inventor-level heterogeneity is controlled for through inventor fixed effects, the position-performance correlation disappears.

We propose that partners sometimes respond to an initial dissatisfaction with the venture result with a dysfunctional repetition of rearranging the ownership control structure. This continual change locks the organization into bad choices and sends it into a downward spiral. Acknowledging the mixed motive nature of inter-partner relationships, we incorporate cooperative versus competitive dynamics manifested in shared control arrangements. We propose that shared ownership control lends stability to the IEJV until the initial IEJV agreement is renegotiated; this stability is a result of the cooperative forces of mutual interdependence and mutual forbearance between the partners. However, when the power balance breaks down, the potential for inter-partner conflict increases. When the ownership control structure of the IEJV is restructured, especially multiple times, shared control arrangements become increasingly unstable as behavioral, cultural, and managerial differences are amplified."}, {"e:author": ["Amit Nigam", "William Ocasio"], "e:volume": "21", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1090.0490", "e:keyword": ["Events", "Attention", "Sensemaking", "Theorization", "Institutional logics", "Institutional change", "Organizational field", "Hospitals", "Health care reform"], "e:pages": "823-841", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1090.0490", "e:year": 2010, "e:title": "Event Attention, Environmental Sensemaking, and Change in Institutional Logics: An Inductive Analysis of the Effects of Public Attention to Clinton's Health Care Reform Initiative", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "We explore attention to Clinton's health care reform proposal, ongoing debates, and its political demise to develop theory that explains how events create opportunities for cognitive realignment and transformation in institutional logics.

In addition to theorization, highlighted by prior research, we propose a second mechanism of environmental sensemaking: representation of change through exemplars and environmental features. The interplay between theorization, representation, and ongoing event attention can lead to change in institutional logics over an event's life course. We found that the managed care logic did not emerge in a fully formed fashion, but that actors theorized individual dimensions of the logic consistent with changing representations of hospitals' relationships with other actors in the field. As the event unfolded, the individual dimensions came to be theorized as part of an overall managed care logic.

We use this argument to make three broad predictions: first, that interorganizational transitions are more likely to take place from larger to smaller workplaces, and into organizations in industries that employ a higher proportion of workers in the focal occupation; second, that such skill-based career paths are more common where the labor market provides more opportunities that reward those skills; and third, that the nature of external opportunities will disproportionately affect turnover from organizations on the lower rungs of the career ladder.

Second, we posit that firms selling in higher market segments, because they are attempting to differentiate their products by incorporating unique components with less-modular interfaces with other components, will tend to be more vertically integrated than their lower-price rivals.

In the early stages of institutionalization, analogy operates primarily as a normative mechanism, and adoption is driven mainly by an instrumental logic. This emphasis on similarity to existing institutions stresses conformity and promotes legitimacy. Yet analogies can also have a cognitive effect on institutional design, especially once initial acceptance from the environment has been secured, by directing attention toward incongruences between the emergent institution and its analogical source. Institutional entrepreneurship can spur innovation and departure from existing institutions by highlighting limitations of the analogical source and providing a compelling value-rational argument that underscores the worth of the new institution. This theoretical contribution helps explain how analogies to existing institutional practices can both provide legitimacy to novel institutions and constitute the basis for a creative process of institutional design."}, {"e:author": ["Justin M.

We find that for a significant number of inspectors, leniency is much higher for those customers with standard vehicles than for those with luxury cars, although a smaller group appears to favor wealthy drivers. We also investigate the psychological mechanisms explaining this wealth-based discriminatory behavior using a laboratory study. Our experiment shows that individuals are more willing to illegally help peers when those peers drive standard rather than luxury cars, and that envy and empathy mediate this effect.

We show conceptually how NSH tendencies develop and how they can influence the extent of outward knowledge transfer. We test five hypotheses regarding antecedents and consequences of NSH tendencies with data from 152 firms spanning multiple industries. The empirical findings show that NSH tendencies exist in organizations and that they constitute a major barrier to the implementation of external knowledge commercialization strategies.

In this paper, we first review these underlying theories and empirical studies of absorptive capacity. Given the size and diversity of the absorptive capacity literature, we subsequently map the existing terrain of research through a bibliometric analysis. The resulting bibliometric cartography shows the major discrepancies in the organization field, namely that (1) most attention so far has been focused on the tangible outcomes of absorptive capacity; (2) organizational design and individual level antecedents have been relatively neglected in the absorptive capacity literature; and (3) the emergence of absorptive capacity from the actions and interactions of individual, organizational, and interorganizational antecedents remains unclear. Building on the bibliometric analysis, we develop an integrative model that identifies the multilevel antecedents, process dimensions, and outcomes of absorptive capacity as well as the contextual factors that affect absorptive capacity. We argue that realizing the potential of the absorptive capacity concept requires more research that shows how “micro-antecedents” and “macro-antecedents” influence future outcomes such as competitive advantage, innovation, and firm performance.

We raise two questions. First, what is the relative effect of the gender composition and comparison level of career referents on such expectations? Second, what happens to career expectations when women and men identify career referents at the same comparison level? Current research suggests that women have lower career expectations than men because they compare themselves with women who hold lower-level positions than the career referents identified by men. Thus, if women and men identify with career referents at a similar level, their career expectations should be equal. However, this chain of reasoning has not been tested. Using data collected from a large organization, we identify both the specific individuals that women and men perceive as having similar careers and these referents' career levels, defined as their hierarchical level in the firm. The results show that the level of career referents is more important than their gender composition in explaining individuals' career expectations. In contrast to extant explanations, the results show that even when women identify career referents at the same levels as men do, they still exhibit significantly lower career expectations. Drawing on social comparison theory, we speculate that this occurs because men's expectations are bolstered by extreme upward comparisons, whereas women's expectations are dampened, perhaps because they see high-achieving others as representing a less probable goal."}, {"e:author": ["Matthew Bidwell", "Isabel Fernandez-Mateo"], "e:volume": "21", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1090.0509", "e:keyword": ["Brokerage", "Triads", "Long-term relationships", "Temporary employment"], "e:pages": "1141-1158", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1090.0509", "e:year": 2010, "e:title": "Relationship Duration and Returns to Brokerage in the Staffing Sector", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "We examine how long-term relationships affect brokers' returns, using project-level pricing data from an information technology staffing firm.

This paper not only challenges the current belief that sporadic and distant dyadic relationships (weak ties) foster individual creativity but also argues that diverse and strong ties facilitate the generation of creative ideas. From a knowledge viewpoint, our results suggest that ties that transmit a wide (rather than narrow) set of knowledge domains (within the same tie) favor creative idea generation if exchanges occur with sufficient frequency. From a social perspective, we find that strong ties serve as effective catalysts for the generation of creative ideas when they link actors who are intrinsically motivated to work closely together. Finally, this paper also shows that dyadic network cohesion (i.e., the connections from the focal dyad to common contacts) does not always hinder the generation of creative ideas. Our empirical evidence suggests that when cohesion exceeds its average levels, it becomes detrimental to creative idea generation.

Our analysis shows that the cumulative number of adoptions within industry increased the positive effect of state laws on the corporation's decision to provide the benefits.

The resource-based literature has stressed that only firm-specific human capital is likely to generate organizational rents, since those assets are more likely to be inimitable, rare, and therefore a better basis for sustained competitive advantage. Generalized investments in human capital (i.e., investments in capabilities that people can transfer and deploy to other firms or settings) are to be avoided. However, observing lessons from the literature on psychological contracts and organizational commitment, we argue that generalized investments may have value for the firm through their effects on worker commitment to the firm. The gain in worker commitment is valuable to firms given the fragile state of the contemporary employment relation, in which the lack of job security is likely to breed diminished employee commitment. This is particularly a concern for employment relations consisting of externalized labor (i.e., contract work or selfemployed professionals operating as agents of the firm), in which agent commitment is vital but likely to be more scarce. In this paper we focus on the externalized workers (independent agents) of two insurance firms in addressing these issues. A sample of 237 agents shows support for the benefits of generalized investments on agent commitment, questioning conventional wisdom that such investments should be avoided. We also examine the impact of relation-specific investments and other key antecedents on agent commitment, concluding that a mixture of strategic investments in human capital should be considered, taking into account their impacts on the firm-worker psychological contract.

Public opinion surveys show that many citizens are becoming greatly concerned about threats to their information privacy, with levels of such concern reaching all-time highs. Perhaps as a response to the growing concerns of citizens, the media are devoting more attention to privacy issues, and governmental regulation of the corporate privacy environment is increasing in many countries. Almost all developed countries have grappled with the trade-offs between open access to information—which enables economic efficiency—and an individual's right to privacy. Consistent with these trade-offs, many recent incidents suggest that regulatory approaches to information privacy, corporate management of personal data, and consumer reactions are becoming tightly interwoven around the world. To provide some insights into these relationships, we develop a conceptual model and test it with a cross-cultural sample from 19 different countries.In general, we find that a country's regulatory approach to the corporate management of information privacy is affected by its cultural values and by individuals' information privacy concerns. In addition, as governments become more involved in the corporate management of information privacy, internal management of such issues seems to tighten. This result supports previous observations that most firms take a primarily reactive approach to managing privacy by waiting for an external threat before crafting cohesive policies that confront their information practices. Moreover, when corporations are not perceived to adequately manage information privacy issues, and/or when privacy concerns rise, individuals are more inclined to prefer government intervention and be distrustful of firm self-regulation. As such, citizens may look to lawmakers to enact stricter regulation to reduce their privacy concerns. These findings and several international trends suggest that the self-regulatory model of privacy governance may not be sustainable over the long term.Findings from this research constitute an important contribution to the emerging theoretical base of information privacy research and should be particularly enlightening to those managing information privacy issues.

Although the literature identifies certain characteristics of strategic alliances that may lead to their unplanned dissolution, the extent of our understanding of this subject appears to be fragmented and incomplete. In this article we propose a comprehensive framework for adequately understanding alliance instabilities based on the notion of internal tensions. We suggest that strategic alliances are sites in which conflicting forces develop and which can be viewed as being constituted by three key pairs of competing forces—namely, cooperation versus competition, rigidity versus flexibility, and short-term versus long-term orientation. This tensions framework helps us in explaining the intrinsic vulnerability of alliances in terms of a wide range of internal contradictions and enables us to examine, in an integrated manner, the incidence, dynamics, and eventual dissipation of the inherent instabilities. We discuss the interrelationships among the different internal tensions and their impacts on different types of strategic alliances. We also examine the termination of alliances through mergers/acquisitions and dissolution.

Is that network form of social capital unique to Americans? France seemed to us a productive site for comparative research because the image from past research is that French managers are more regulated than Americans; more regulated by bureaucratic authority and more regulated by peer pressure, with both amplified by the greater reliance in France on internal labor markets. People comfortable with knowing their place in a chain of bureaucratic control could be uncomfortable with the negotiated control exercised by network entrepreneurs, so the positive association between structural holes and performance in the United States could be negligible or even reversed for French managers.We use network and performance data on two study populations of senior managers, one in France and one in the United States, to describe social capital similarities and differences between the populations. The network form of social capital is similar in the two populations: More successful French managers, like Americans, tend to have networks rich in structural holes. The French and American managers make similar distinctions between kinds of relationships. Relations that bridge structural holes are similarly detached from routine work activities for the French and the Americans. The interesting difference is that social capital develops differently in the two populations. The French managers operate with a less porous social boundary around their firm and associate negative emotions with bridge relations. Reinforcing Aix-en-Provence observations on the significance of adult education for Franco-German differences in organization, we find that exposure to peers in other firms via executive education is for our French managers the only factor positively associated with the social capital of bridge relationships."}, {"e:author": ["Jone L.

It was found that employees in a modernist political system (United States) did echo social scientists’ claims by reporting that their employers’ personnel practices were comparatively more universalistic than those in organizations operating in a neotraditional polity (Hungary).

Finally, communication media research has studied attitudes toward media, use of media, and only occasionally media choice. Yet, all three dependent variables are important.This comprehensive survey hypothesized and tested multiple influences (based on multiple theories) in a study of media attitudes and behaviors. The media included electronic mail, fax, letters, and face-to-face meetings. The outcomes included media choice (an individual's decision to use a medium in a particular communication incident), media use (an individual's general pattern of use over time), and media attitudes (an individual's general subjective evaluation of media).Results suggested that a number of factors differentiated among media choices, including medium symbolism, message equivocality, distance between message partners, perceived media richness, number of message recipients, and perceived message recipients' attitudes. General attitudes toward the different media were influenced most consistently by perceived medium richness. New media attitudes were also influenced by person/technology interaction factors. General medium use was influenced by different factors for the different media.The results generally supported a comprehensive theoretical approach to understanding media attitudes and behaviors. All of the theories have some merit in explaining media attitudes and behaviors. But different factors, derived from different theories, were more important in accounting for each of the dependent variables'media choices, attitudes, and use.

The two theories lead to opposite predictions on how the structure of an actor's network may affect his ability to adapt that network to a significant change in task environment. Using data from a newly created special unit within the Italian subsidiary of a multinational computer manufacturer, we show that managers with cohesive communication networks were less likely to adapt these networks to the change in coordination requirements prompted by their new assignments, which in turn jeopardized their role as facilitators of horizontal cooperation within a newly created business unit structure.

It also means that we are careful to avoid detailing specific design choices or offering organizational archetypes: this article is primarily about the process issues that surround redesign rather than organization design per se, as indeed any redesign is ultimately highly specific and context-driven.

Managers involved with the creation, production, marketing, and distribution of cultural goods must navigate tensions that arise from opposing imperatives that result from these industry characteristics. In this paper we outline five polarities that are shaping organizational practices in cultural industries. First, managers must reconcile expression of artistic values with the economics of mass entertainment. Second, they must seek novelty that differentiates their products without making them fundamentally different in nature from others in the same category. Third, they must analyse and address existing demand while at the same time using their imagination to extend and transform the market. Fourth, they must balance the advantages of vertically integrating diverse activities under one roof against the need to maintain creative vitality through flexible specialization.

Three basic types of selection systems are distinguished: market selection, peer selection, and expert selection. We show that the rise of a group of painters known as the Impressionists was facilitated by a change in the selection system of the visual arts industry from one dominated by peers into one dominated by experts. In the new selection system, innovativeness has become the most highly prized product characteristic, while a range of experts have begun to play an essential role, certifying the innovativeness of either individual artists or groups of artists."}, {"e:author": ["Glenn B.

In this depoliticized exploration of what Adorno (1991) had earlier characterized as the industrialization of high culture, and Powdermaker (1950) as Hollywood's “dream factory,” I emphasized the key roles of gatekeeper and distributor organizations as critical in connecting the artist/creators to audience/consumers of mass, or “popular” culture (as it had more acceptingly come to be called). Altogether, this network of organizations—from creators (artists, musicians, actors, writers) and brokers (agents), through the cultural product's producers (publishers, studios), distributors (wholesalers, theaters), and media outlets—collectively constitute <i>cultural industries</i>. This article on industries producing “cultural products”—defined as “ ‘nonmaterial’ goods directed at a public of consumers, for whom they generally serve an esthetic or expressive, rather than a clearly utilitarian function” (Hirsch 1972 p. 641)—appeared at the same time that organizational sociology's focus on what became known as the “production of culture” took off, and continued to flourish into the 1990s (Peterson 1994, Crane 1992).How has the study of cultural industries changed over the last generation? A simple answer is that the subject—the key role of distribution and the importance of organizational middlemen in the making and sale of popular culture—remains analytically the same. From actors, musicians, and writers; through studios, labels and publishers, to videocassettes, movie theaters, record stores, and booksellers (in stores or via the Internet)—cultural products flow. How this sequence is organized and traversed remains a fascinating forest of power plays and techniques, employed by role-occupants in the same positions as have existed since the advent of mass media. While this substantive field has changed little analytically, what we also see is a wondrous expansion in the disciplinary approaches being taken to examine the multitude of topics available for examination under the broad rubric and framing of the term, “cultural industries.” Because I was a graduate student at the time (my roommate dared me to submit the “Processing…” paper to the <i>American Journal of Sociology</i>), it is a great pleasure to find the concept has retained its value for other researchers since that time.In this article, I will (1) reexamine and discuss the original framing of the term <i>cultural industries</i>; (2) briefly review some of the more recent complementary perspectives which expand the possible arenas for studying this topic; and (3) append a short note on how the more recent inclusion of <i>nonprofit cultural products</i>(e.g., symphonies, museums) in this framework poses interesting analytical questions and opportunities."}, {"e:author": ["Thomas A.

The positive questions are: (1) Under what conditions is a stakeholder firm likely to emerge in the United States, (2) what are the critical determinants of performance in a stakeholder firm, and (3) what will determine the sustainability and diffusion of this organizational form in the American environment? The history, design features, and dynamics of the labormanagement partnership at Saturn are used to illustrate and interpret a specific case of employees as stakeholders. Saturn's original mission, governance structure, and internal processes fit the characteristics of a stakeholder firm. Employees establish themselves as influential, definitive stakeholders by using their knowledge to improve organizational performance. The local union likewise contributes to firm performance by organizing workers into a dense social network that contributes to problem solving, conflict resolution, and quality improvement. However, the legal and political environment in which the firm operates produces considerable uncertainty over the sustainability and diffusion of Saturn's features in particular, and the stakeholder organizational form in general. Additional hypotheses and research questions are proposed to continue theory building around the more general model of the stakeholder firm.

I use these findings to draw several implications that differ from those prevailing in the entrepreneurship literature, including: (1) entrepreneurs do not always select between alternative market opportunities for new technologies; (2) the source of entrepreneurship lies in differences in information about opportunities; (3) the results of prior studies of entrepreneurial exploitation may suffer from bias; and (4) individual differences influence the opportunities that people discover, how their entrepreneurial efforts are organized, and how the government can influence this process."}, {"e:author": ["Martha L.

Data were gathered using multiple methods, and qualitative methods were used to analyze them and generate a theory of global virtual team dynamics and effectiveness. First, we propose that effective global virtual team interaction comprises a series of communication incidents, each configured by aspects of the team's structural and process elements. Effective outcomes were associated with a fit among an interaction incident's form, decision process, and complexity. Second, effective global virtual teams sequence these incidents to generate a deep rhythm of regular face-to-face incidents interspersed with less intensive, shorter incidents using various media.

Race had both a direct and an indirect effect on these outcomes. Participation in company training significantly predicted reported promotion rates, but race remained a significant predictor. Additional analysis revealed that race moderates the relationship between human capital and promotion rate and suggests a type of treatment discrimination against blacks. Contrary to predictions, social capital did not predict promotion rate, although social capital mediated the relationship between race and psychosocial support.

This empirical study extends previous research on harmful workplace behavior by examining whether the situational variable of job status and the dispositional characteristics of aggressiveness and negative affectivity predict self-perceived victimization.

Study 1 examined the extent to which two firms that differed solely in the decision behavior of a routine would also differ in organizational (quasiresolution of conflict, uncertainty avoidance, problem-driven search, and organizational learning) and economic (profit, price, market share, cost) measures and impacts. Three such manipulations were separately examined, where each manipulation altered the relative propensity of the firm to be more or less reactive to three events: production growth pressure, price adjustment under organizational goal conflict, and initial price adjustment under profit goal failure. Analysis of the behaviors revealed how subtle changes in these key routines could generate complex organizational and economic effects that impact firm success. The dominant result demonstrated that organizations that did not perform well organizationally did not perform well economically. In addition, higher reactivity resulted in higher costs, in part because of quantified organizational constructs (e.g., slack, pressure). Study 2 examined the data from the first study to determine the extent to which the performance of the duopoly was consistent with a set of eight stylized economic facts drawn from the empirical literature on oligopoly. Study 2 demonstrated consistency with five of the eight stylized economic facts and provided partial support for two others.

What dynamics are associated with leadership succession in this type of group?

Dynamics evolved in ways that were partially consistent and partially inconsistent with organizational life-cycle literature.The group experienced ambivalence and tension surrounding the type of authority given to designated leaders. Members dealt with discomfort by shifting the focus of the group coordinator's attention to external relations and by rotating internal leadership responsibilities. This approach resolved tensions associated with authority and increased members' senses of their own power, even as it decreased the range of initiative-taking that was implicitly allowable within the group.This analysis of leadership succession in a women's group with an empowerment agenda offers a salient case for the study of dilemmas likely to be present in many change efforts.

When we do not separate the people who are doing the routines from the routine, we can see routines as a richer phenomenon. Change occurs as a result of participants' reflections on and reactions to various outcomes of previous iterations of the routine. This perspective introduces agency into the notion of routine. Agency is important for understanding the role of organizational routines in learning and in processes of institutionalization."}, {"e:author": ["Daniel Z.

Analysis yields three findings: (1) Quality improves over the production life of a car model with the same kind of regularity as an efficiency learning curve. Thus, there is a quality learning curve. (2) Unlike in the efficiency domain, however, learning in the domain of product reliability is primarily a function of time, and not of how many cars have gone down the assembly line. Thus, quality depends not on the accumulation of production experience per se, but on the intensity of “off-line”quality improvement activities and on the transfer of knowledge from the general environment over time. (3) In contrast to the traditional injunction, “do not buy a new car in its first year of production,”the opposite advice actually seems to apply: In any given year, the newest car models have the best quality. That is, new car-model designs typically include significant quality improvements that are more than enough to outweigh any disruption created in manufacturing by the new model's introduction and that even surpass the incremental improvements made to older, existing car models."}, {"e:author": ["Bruce Barry", "J.

In this paper we draw upon and extend those traditions to develop a model of how communication relationships develop within organizational dyads. The proposed model examines organization-based communication relationships through a synthesis of theoretical perspectives on communication richness, relational communication, interpersonal attribution, and social expectancy. We also call upon precepts of structuration theory to embed these microlevel processes in an organizational context.The relational outcome in the model is “interactional richness,” a dyad-level construct that assesses the extent to which communication within the dyad is high in shared meaning. Model antecedents are aspects of interaction through which communicators reciprocally define their relationships, including relational message properties, message patterns that emerge over time, and relational perceptions. We propose that these communication properties and behaviors give rise to relationship attributions. We then incorporate processes of expectancy confirmation and violation to explain how specific communication encounters lead individuals to reformulate attributions regarding the status of a given relationship. Research propositions articulate how attribution/expectancy processes mediate between relational communication behavior and relationship development outcomes. We also develop propositions addressing how relational communication behavior is influenced by macrolevel factors, including hierarchy, structure, and culture.In a concluding section we discuss the model's potential contribution to research and practice, address its limitations, and offer recommendations for future research aimed at testing its embedded hypotheses."}, {"e:author": ["Michel Avital"], "e:volume": "11", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.11.6.665.12532", "e:keyword": ["Temporal Factors", "Time", "Social Research Practices"], "e:pages": "665-673", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.11.6.665.12532", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Dealing with Time in Social Inquiry: A Tension Between Method and Lived Experience", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "In a series of interviews, organizational researchers acknowledged the key role of time in social inquiry, and their tendency to exclude it in practice.

The interviews also drew attention to a paradox that stemmed from an experience of ongoing tension between the methodologically prescribed sense of time and the experientially lived impression of time. Further analysis suggests that incorporation of time factors may significantly improve social process research. The study demonstrates that temporal elements do not merely change one's perception of a situation, but also provide a space for a richer and more meaningful interpretation by enabling an improved association of a particular event with one's personal frame of reference and lived experience. In addition, the study suggests that an awareness of the various approaches to time and the application of a consistent ontological framework to the analysis of social phenomena are likely to increase the coherence and congruity of the analysis.

Although researchers and practitioners have grappled with the issue of globalization for some time, there is no one model that encompasses the range of phenomena we observe in the global economy, nor have those models that do exist been precisely formalized.This paper provides an expanded approach to thinking about the organizational forms and linkages that exist in international business operations. Building on the popular integration-responsiveness framework of international strategic orientation, we develop a more expansive approach that is better able to account for the diversity of organizational forms and strategic choices open to managers. By adding a third set of environmental pressures, incorporating the beliefs of managers, and by employing the idea of efficient frontiers, we reformulate the integration-responsiveness framework, making it more consistent with modern economic models of the firm. Our integration-responsiveness-completeness (IRC) model argues that global firms can respond to these fundamental and competing pressures by configuring themselves in a variety of ways—rather than normatively prescribing that the transnational form is optimal. In addition, our model has methodological ramifications. Its formal structure suggests that empirical techniques that focus on the best rather than average performance are necessary to adequately investigate the performance differences among alternative organizational forms.

This is accomplished through the development of a framework based on the notion of <i>convention.</i> Organizations, in this view, are grounded in “effort conventions” of what constitutes “normal” effort at work, that structure the action of those who work within the organization, and in turn reinforce these structures. We show how humans can calculate within a context of socially constructed beliefs, and how these beliefs can evolve, provided that they remain essentially nonjustified and beyond the reach of rational calculation. It is this mix of rational calculation and nonrational beliefs that form the core of our model.We begin by defining the nature of a convention and its properties. We then describe the evolutionary dynamics of conventions, and show that conventions exist in competition with other conventions and evolve over time. Our model of convention is then linked to other notions, advanced in the managerial literature, which point to a kind of ‘deep structure’ that lies at the heart of organizations.

Because many scholars remain uncertain as to just what this controversial perspective is, the present article offers a straightforward explanation of postmodernism's basic themes. Additionally, the author attempts to provide some balance to the overwhelmingly sympathetic presentations of postmodernism in the organization theory literature by offering a critical assessment of how it would redirect the study of organizations. Consistent with an intellectual divide dating to the Enlightenment, while those engaged in “normal science” are concerned with the question of what is true, it appears that those who sympathize with postmodernism are addressing the question of what is good. Postmodernists, it is argued here, wish to engage in advocacy for values and preferences that they view as putting them in radical opposition to the status quo. To facilitate such advocacy they call for the repudiation of “modernism,” in particular the key modernist notion that there is an objective truth that can be sought out rationally and systematically. Postmodernists adopt, instead, a relativist philosophy, which contends that “truth” must be considered merely subjective, such that one's view of truth is only relative to one's circumstances. Although taking the position that no one can say what is or is not “true” puts them in opposition to mainstream science, it supports their ability to discredit views they oppose, and simultaneously provides a defense against those who would claim that the postmodernist's view is not “true.” Whether the postmodernist approach has the potential to enhance our understanding of organizations is addressed here by examining its philosophical and historical roots, the research and theory that it has so far inspired, and the critical commentary on our field that its adherents have offered."}, {"e:author": ["Stanley Deetz"], "e:volume": "11", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.11.6.732.12536", "e:keyword": ["Postmodernism", "Philosophy of Science", "Social Constructionism", "Knowledge Claims"], "e:pages": "732-738", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.11.6.732.12536", "e:year": 2000, "e:title": "Putting the Community into Organizational Science: Exploring the Construction of Knowledge Claims", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Like Weiss, I too dislike some of the postmodern writings on organizations.

Ethnography has at times aided colonization. Both social and physical sciences have at times produced bad theories and been put to very negative uses. Some early postmodernist theorists, Christians, <i>and</i> scientists, were Nazis, and elements of each of their fundamental conceptions could be co-opted to support this particular form of barbarism. This potential utilization, however, does not lead for me to a blanket condemnation of postmodernism, science, ethnography, religion, or statistics. Devotees of each have used their special understandings to fight tyranny. Both postmodernism and science also draw on fundamental conceptions that are productive, enable open choices, and help us see through the masters and ideologies of a particular time and place.

However, with very few exceptions, the specific organizational routines and processes that constitute AC capabilities remain a black box. In this paper, we propose a routine-based model of AC as a first step toward the operationalization of the AC construct. Our intent is to direct attention to the importance of balancing internal knowledge creating processes with the identification, acquisition, and assimilation of new knowledge originating in the external environment. We decompose the construct of AC into two components, internal and external AC capabilities, and identify the configuration of metaroutines underlying these two components. These higher-level routines are expressed within organizations by configurations of empirically observable practiced routines that are idiosyncratic and firm specific. Therefore, we conceptualize metaroutines as the foundations of practiced routines. The ability of organizations to discover and implement complementarities between AC routines may explain why some firms are successful early adopters and most firms are imitators. Success as an early adopter of a new management practice or an innovation is expected to depend on the extent to which an organization evolves, adapts, and implements the configuration of its internal and external absorptive capacity routines."}, {"e:author": ["Aija Leiponen", "Constance E.

Using firm-level data on R&D locations in Finland, we examine the conditions under which firms with multiple R&D locations also have greater innovation output. Our results indicate that multilocation of R&D activity is positively associated with imitative innovation output and is strongly correlated with greater external knowledge sourcing. We also find that the positive association between multiple R&D locations and innovative output does not apply to new-to-the-market innovations. The results are consistent with the interpretation that multilocation of R&D enables firms to access a broad set of external sources of knowledge in pursuit of imitative rather than new-to-the market innovation. Moreover, these findings imply heterogeneity in R&D strategies between firms pursuing new-to-the-market innovation and firms pursuing imitative innovation.

We test our hypotheses on a sample of high-technology acquisitions by U.S. firms during 1990--1998 using an event study methodology to assess abnormal stock returns. We find, unexpectedly, that no significant general effect emerges for acquisitions with prior alliances. However, international acquisitions following alliances show significantly better returns relative to both acquisitions without prior alliances and domestic acquisitions. Additionally, stronger forms of prior alliances lead to better acquisition performance than weaker forms of alliances. Together, the results broadly support our thesis that partner-specific absorptive capacity may be at work and suggest that under certain prior alliance conditions, acquisitions can indeed create value for acquirers."}, {"e:author": ["Paul M.

The third is to uncover strategies organizations might use to successfully develop a new technological artifact from the technology concept even if innovators never understand the nature of their own blindness.

Rather, a technology concept activates culture as it draws frames around resources that will guide people's problem construction practices.

It treats PowerPoint as a technology embedded in the discursive practices of strategic knowledge production and suggests that these practices make up the epistemic or knowledge culture of the organization.

Results from a genre analysis of PowerPoint use suggest that it should not be characterized simply as effective or ineffective, as current PowerPoint controversies do. Instead, I show how the affordances of PowerPoint enabled the difficult task of collaborating to negotiate meaning in an uncertain environment, creating spaces for discussion, making recombinations possible, allowing for adjustments as ideas evolved, and providing access to a wide range of actors. These affordances also facilitated cartographic efforts to draw boundaries around the scope of a strategy by certifying certain ideas and allowing document owners to include or exclude certain slides or participants. These discursive practices---collaboration and cartography---are part of the “epistemic machinery” of strategy culture.

To account for the even/odd effect, Study 3 focuses on the group's ability to provide members with certainty and identifies majority influence as the key instrument. We argue that groups struggle to provide certainty when they lack majorities (e.g., deadlocked coalitions) or contain unstable majorities (i.e., where small changes in opinion readily overturn existing power arrangements). Member uncertainty mediated the effects of coalition structure on cohesion. The results link structural variables (i.e., even/odd size and coalition structure) to psychological outcomes (i.e., member uncertainty and relational outcomes)."}, {"e:author": ["Raghu Garud", "Roger L.

By developing narratives, organizational actors create situated understandings of unusual experiences, negotiate consensual meanings, and engage in coordinated actions. Through the accumulation of narratives about unusual experiences, an organization builds a memory with generative qualities. Specifically, through narratives, actors evoke memories of prior unusual experiences and how they were dealt with, and this generates new options for dealing with emerging unusual experiences. We outline a framework detailing how narrative development processes enable organizational learning from unusual experiences and conclude by summarizing how this approach differs from and yet builds upon scientific and experiential approaches to learning."}, {"e:author": ["Violina Rindova", "Elena Dalpiaz", "Davide Ravasi"], "e:volume": "22", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1100.0537", "e:keyword": ["Cultural resources", "Innovation", "Product design", "Strategic change", "Alessi"], "e:pages": "413-431", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1100.0537", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "A Cultural Quest: A Study of Organizational Use of New Cultural Resources in Strategy Formation", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Our study was motivated by the growing influence in cultural sociology and organizational research of the view of culture as a “toolkit,” from which individuals draw resources flexibly to develop strategies of action that address different circumstances.

The results suggest several factors influencing the partner's perceptions of focal individual incivility during MC, including who initiates the conversation, whether one of the conversations being juggled is useful to the other conversation, the focal individual's performance during the conversation, whether the focal individual is more accessible to the partner, and whether the partner is certain of or only suspects the existence of the other conversation. Further, partners' perceptions of these factors are influenced by their individual orientations toward MC.

The stewardship perspective argues that family business owners and managers will act as farsighted stewards of their companies, investing generously in the business to enhance value for all stakeholders. By contrast, the agency and behavioral agency perspectives maintain that major family owners, in catering to family self-interest, will underinvest in the firm, avoid risk, and extract resources. This paper argues that both these views have application but under different circumstances, determined in part by the degree to which the firm and its executive actors are embedded within the family and thus identify with its interests. Stewardship behavior will be less common, and agency behavior will be more common the greater the number of family directors, officers, generations, and votes, and the more executives are susceptible to family influence.

We find that higher status at the end of the group's life is associated with higher performance.

Instead, those who gain status—including those who eventually attain high status—perform worse than those who maintain high-status positions for the whole quarter. They perform no better than those in stable low-status positions throughout. Those who lose status over time actually perform as well as those who maintain high status.

Individually, each organization must also establish its own distinctive identity to differentiate itself from competitors and secure resources. To explore the relationship between differentiation and the consolidation of recognizable identity element clusters, we examine the emergence of organizational form in the early years of the Arizona charter school industry. This industry is particularly interesting for scholars studying institutional processes because the legislative mandate of the new industry was for schools to experiment and provide education in an unconventional manner. Thus, the legislative definition of the organizational form or template for the charter school identity was intentionally underspecified. Using inductive analysis and regression models, we examine the process of identity realization occurring among charter schools and assess how the local institutional context of charter schools affected the realization process. The analyses demonstrate that new industries may come to be characterized by multiple element clusters; a single label for an organizational form may be linked to different combinations of identity elements. Our results also demonstrate that identity realization at the organizational level occurs through mimicry and differentiation processes and is facilitated by the local institutional context.

We propose that when exogenous uncertainty elevates the value of real options, firms are more likely to undertake CVC investments rather than acquisitions. Furthermore, we suggest that the value of real options under uncertainty is contingent upon several factors, which may also shape firms' choice between CVC and acquisition. The results indicate that market uncertainty is positively related to firms' choice of CVC versus acquisition. In addition, investment irreversibility strengthens the effect of uncertainty, whereas growth opportunities surrounding the investment weaken the effect.

Second, banks have long occupied a dominant position in this market, and we thus expect banks to be less affected by the negative coverage of fees than other mutual fund managers.

The notion of site supports the intuition that knowing is both sustained in practice and manifests itself through practice. It also evokes the idea of knowledge as being rooted in an extended pattern of interconnected activities that only when taken in its living and pulsating entirety constitutes the site of knowing. In this paper, I review the different ways to conceptualise the relationships between knowing and practice, and I show how the idea of site adds to the existing body of work. Building on the results of a longitudinal study in the field of telemedicine, I then offer suggestions on aspects of practice where knowing manifests itself, and I use the concepts of “translation by contact” and “at distance” to explain how dispersed knowings are woven together and the power effect that can derive from these.

This approach is in sharp contrast to other recent organizational research that emphasizes identity, path dependence, economies of specialization, and recursive practices. We juxtapose the idea of organizational fluidity with this latter stream of research. If taken to its final conclusion, then the idea of promoting organizational fluidity would imply losing the very essence of organizing. Nevertheless, achieving organizational flexibility remains imperative in increasingly complex and volatile environments. To deal with this dilemma, an alternative approach is needed. We suggest a conceptualization of this dilemma that emphasizes the complementary dynamics between the two perspectives.

I reason that because networking actions alter the cost-benefit calculus of using referrals, the extent to which entrepreneurs rely on referrals when searching for new exchange partners should vary with their networking actions. I then propose that entrepreneurs are likely to add fewer new exchange partners when they rely more on referrals to search. The empirical analysis employs a longitudinal design using data coded from the business cards of new contacts formed over a two-month period by a panel of Indian entrepreneurs operating business-to-business ventures. This study makes a theoretical contribution by identifying decision makers' networking style as a distinct mechanism shaping partner selection for their organization.

Multiplex triads are important drivers of network evolution, but their dynamics remains poorly understood. Although conventional wisdom suggests that horizontal ties between producers are driven solely by their prior interactions, we find that vertical ties drive the formation of horizontal relationships in a multiplex triad. We also find that these triads are affected by the agency of the customers who (a) force producers into horizontal relationships with those producers that have protected the customers' interests in the past and (b) prevent closure in triads containing strong horizontal relationships because of the divergent objectives of these triads' members.

Whether induced learning through the use of deliberate learning activities provides additional performance benefits has been neglected. We argue that the use of deliberate learning activities offers performance benefits beyond those of cumulative experience because these activities counter the learning challenges presented by rapid knowledge growth, uncertainty, and complexity in dynamic settings. We test whether there are additional performance benefits to using deliberate learning activities and whether the effectiveness of these activities depends on interdisciplinary collaboration in the workgroup. We test our hypotheses in a study of 23 hospital neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) involved in a quality improvement collaborative. We find that using deliberate learning activities is associated with better workgroup performance, as measured by NICUs' risk-adjusted mortality rates for 2159 infant patients, but only after two years. In the shorter term, using these activities is associated with worse performance. By the third year, the positive impact of using deliberate learning activities is similar to the benefit of cumulative experience (18% and 20% reduction in odds of mortality, respectively). Contrary to prediction, interdisciplinary collaboration mediates, rather than moderates, the relationship between using deliberate learning activities and workgroup performance.

Contrary to assumptions of prior studies, we found no evidence that time spent working mediates e-mail-related overload. Instead, e-mail's material properties entwined with social norms and interpretations in a way that led informants to single out e-mail as a cultural symbol of the overload they experience in their lives.

Drawing on a series of computational experiments and paired-case comparisons of six product development projects, we specifically examine how new product development performance is affected by project design and the technological environment. By triangulating across the computational experiments and case studies, we find the existence of performance trade-offs in product development as well as the importance of performance priorities in influencing project design. These findings permit us to elaborate on existing contingency-based perspectives of new product development and put forward a novel mediating model. In this mediating model of product development, we suggest that the technological environment shapes performance priorities, which in turn influence project design and ultimately the performance outcomes of new product development efforts. This model further highlights that project designs can evolve as a function of performance outcomes, although this process can be inhibited by the presence of design evolution constraints.

We make a general case about the importance of governance in adaptation, and we identify three mechanisms through which governance form may affect organizations' ability to manage the competency and failure traps that often frustrate the process. We look for evidence of these mechanisms through a study of the U.S. Savings and Loan (S&L) industry in the 1980s. This is an apt context because S&Ls were confronted by severe environmental changes that suggested a need for change of a relatively radical sort during this decade and because the industry contains a mix of governance forms (stock form firms and mutual associations). We examine whether mutuals and stocks differed in their propensity to move away from their traditional business and mission of residential mortgage lending in response to the challenges of the 1980s. We also consider whether stocks and mutuals differed in their performance outcomes during this decade. Results indicate that mutuals were slightly less prone toward change but were in no sense inertial. They also show that mutuals performed better overall and appeared to change more successfully than did stock firms. The overall pattern of results suggests that mutual governance was a resource that allowed S&Ls to better balance exploration and exploitation in the face of a changing and ambiguous environment.

By analyzing status rankings within an organization of open source software programmers, we find that the organization develops its own unique shared belief system, which inculcates actors with beliefs about status characteristics that are potentially unique within the boundaries of the organization.

Being in close proximity could either amplify or dampen the positive effect that social similarity can have on tie strength. Data on tie strength among teachers working in five public schools were analyzed to shed light on this theoretical question. The empirical results indicate that teachers who were similar in age were more likely to be connected by a strong tie, especially teachers for whom age similarity was more likely to be salient. Moreover, teachers who took breaks at the same time or who had classrooms on the same floor communicated more frequently and felt more emotionally attached. Among the public school teachers, propinquity amplified the positive effect that age similarity had on tie strength. The strongest network connections occurred among age-similar teachers who had classrooms on the same floor.

Our review of the theoretical and empirical literatures on power, status, and learning suggests that social hierarchy can complicate a rational system model of collective learning by disrupting three critical learning-related processes: anchoring on shared goals, risk taking and experimentation, and knowledge sharing. We also find evidence to suggest that the stifling effects of power and status differences on collective learning can be mitigated when advantaged actors are collectively oriented. Indeed, our review suggests that higher-ranking actors who use their power and status in more “socialized” ways can play critical roles in stimulating collective learning behavior.

This dual analytical lens helps establish that, in competitive and information-intensive settings, a small-world system could be a highly dynamic structure that follows an inverted U-shaped evolutionary pattern, wherein an increase in the small-worldliness of the system is followed by its later decline as a result of three factors: (1) the recursive relationship between the evolving social structure and individual actors' formation of bridging ties, which eventually homogenizes the information space and decreases actors' propensity to form bridging ties, creating a globally separated network; (2) self-containment of the small-world network, or increasing homogenization of the social system, which makes the small world less accepting of and less attractive to new actors, thereby limiting formation of bridging ties to outside clusters; and (3) fragmentation of the small-world network, or the small-world system's inability to retain current clusters.

We use merging multinational corporations (MNCs) as a case in point. Our empirical analysis focuses on a revelatory case: the financial services group Nordea, which was built by combining Swedish, Finnish, Danish, and Norwegian corporations. We distinguish three types of antenarrative that provided alternatives for making sense of the merger: globalist, nationalist, and regionalist (Nordic) antenarratives. We focus on how these antenarratives were mobilized in intentional organizational storytelling to legitimate or resist change: globalist storytelling as a means to legitimate the merger and to create MNC identity, nationalist storytelling to relegitimate national identities and interests, Nordic storytelling to create regional identity, and the critical use of the globalist storytelling to challenge the Nordic identity. We conclude that organizational storytelling is characterized by polyphonic, stylistic, chronotopic, and architectonic dialogisms and by a dynamic between centering and decentering forces.

In this article, we draw on a case of the introduction of text messaging in the United Kingdom to explore the role of consumers in catalyzing change in organizational fields. Text messaging has become a widely diffused and institutionalized communication practice, in part changing mobile telephony from a voice-based, aural, and synchronous experience to a text-based, visual, and asynchronous experience. As consumers innovated and diffused new practices around this product, their actions led to significant changes in the field. We suggest how and under what conditions consumers are likely to innovate at the micro level and, with the subsequent involvement of other actors, catalyze change at the field level. Our primary contribution is to show how the cumulative effect of the spontaneous activities of one important and particularly dispersed and unorganized group can lead to changes in a field.

To overcome these challenges, such research suggests that firms establish organizational separation between exploring and exploiting units or engage in temporal separation whereby they oscillate between exploration and exploitation over time. Nevertheless, these approaches entail resource allocation trade-offs and conflicting organizational routines, which may undermine organizational performance as firms seek to balance exploration and exploitation within a discrete field of organizational activity (i.e., domain). We posit that firms can overcome such impediments and enhance their performance if they explore in one domain while exploiting in another. Studying the alliance portfolios of software firms, we demonstrate that firms do not typically benefit from balancing exploration and exploitation <i>within</i> the function domain (technology versus marketing and production alliances) and structure domain (new versus prior partners). Nevertheless, firms that balance exploration and exploitation <i>across</i> these domains by engaging in research and development alliances while collaborating with their prior partners, or alternatively, by forming marketing and production alliances while seeking new partners, gain in profits and market value. Moreover, we reveal that increases in firm size that exacerbate resource allocation trade-offs and routine rigidity reinforce the benefits of balance across domains and the costs of balance within domains. Our domain separation approach offers new insights into how firms can benefit from balancing exploration and exploitation.

A product or an organization may acquire multiple status indicators in association with a multitude of market institutions. We argue that when status indicators are consistently positive, each exerts a greater positive effect on the valuation of a product or an organization; conversely, inconsistency among multiple indicators undermines the status claim. We test this theoretical proposition by examining patterns of product valuation in the California premium wine market. Our findings show that when an individual wine's tasting score rated by critics and another more general status indicator---classified appellation affiliation, extra designation on the label, or a winery's organizational status---are consistently positive, each makes a greater contribution to wine price. In contrast, when status indicators are inconsistent, the value of the positive status indicator is reduced. Our study explicates the scope conditions under which market status may yield different outcomes and sheds light on the interplay among status indicators in market valuation."}, {"e:author": ["Cheryl Gaimon", "Gülru F.

The literature offers insights to help explain this phenomenon. Evidence suggests that, while carefully considering the purchase cost, managers often underestimate the costs and planning necessary for proper implementation. Consequently, short-term problems arise and long-term benefits are not realized. A model is introduced that integrates workforce knowledge management with the technology upgrade decision. The manager upgrades technology or pursues general training of the workforce in response to depreciation in the ability of each resource to drive net income over time. Depreciation occurs because of changes in consumer preferences and competition. Although adding to technology capability, an upgrade makes a portion of workforce knowledge obsolete. The manager invests in preparatory training prior to the upgrade to reduce obsolescence. Whereas general training is pursued to respond to depreciation by enhancing the ability of the workforce to improve existing products or create new products, preparatory training is technology-specific and focused on preparing for a technology upgrade. We find that the rates of preparatory and general training follow entirely different paths over time. Conditions are given where a manager uses one training strategy as a substitute for or complement to the other. We show that training strategies are not only impacted by learning phenomena such as the rate of forgetting, but also by the rates of technology depreciation and advancement. We show how workforce learning phenomena impact the technology upgrade decision."}, {"e:author": ["Axel v.

Originally a domain of economics and finance (as well as law), the theme has spread to other areas such as strategic management and organization theory in recent years. This paper will first give a brief overview on major developments in the field of corporate governance. These developments encompass, on the one hand, the extension of the classical focus on formal systems and structures to perspectives that address behavioral as well as process issues. On the other hand, the terrain has been broadened from its traditional narrow interest in the principal agent problem between shareholders and management to the more comprehensive stakeholder approach of corporate governance. Building on these developments, this paper will subsequently elaborate on a further extension of the topic by emphasizing the concept of <i>stakeholder opportunism</i>. The classical principal agent problem results from possible opportunistic behavior of the management, which compromises the interests of the shareholders. However, as the notion of stakeholder opportunism points out, not only the management of a company can exercise opportunism; rather, all stakeholders of a company can (and will to some extent) have options to behave opportunistically and at the same time bear the risk of being victims of the opportunism of other stakeholders. This paper develops a conceptual framework for analyzing the determinants and dynamics of the various stakeholders' opportunism options and risks as well as of the actual opportunistic behavior of stakeholders. Employing this framework, implications of the notion of stakeholder opportunism for managers and regulators are discussed, and perspectives for further research are identified."}, {"e:author": ["Samer Faraj", "Steven L.

We propose that participation dynamics follow specific forms of social exchange: direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, and preferential attachment. We integrate diverse findings about individual participation motivations by identifying how individual behavior manifests in network-level structures of online communities. We studied five online communities over 27 months and analyzed 38,483 interactions using exponential random graph (<i>p</i><sup>*</sup>) models and mixed-effects analysis of covariance. In a test of competing models, we found that network exchange patterns in online community communication networks are characterized by direct reciprocity and indirect reciprocity patterns and, surprisingly, a tendency away from preferential attachment.

Knowledge to innovate is dispersed across ecologies, so no single firm or small group of firms can innovate alone. Moreover, many new products and services in ecologies such as health care or energy are complex or comprise many parts with unknown interactions. New products, knowledge, business models, and applications all emerge unpredictably over considerable time periods, as various agents in the ecologies of innovation interact with and react to the actions of others. However, the existing organizing structure in these ecologies stifles emergence and precludes much innovation, simply because theory and practice do not adequately address how to organize for complex innovation. We develop a preliminary model for organizing ecologies of complex innovation. We suggest that innovations can continually emerge productively if people work locally in ecologies to set and solve problems of orchestrating knowledge capabilities across the ecology, strategizing across the ecology to create new businesses and applications, and developing public policies to embrace ambiguity. Using examples from biopharmaceuticals and alternative energy, we develop specific organizing ideas that can be examined and elaborated upon.

Specifically, we conceptualize temporary and standard work as part of a naturally occurring status hierarchy in organizations and propose that blended workgroups have opposing effects on employees depending on employees' perceptions of their potential for upward mobility in that organization. We combine research on the blended workforce with theorizing from social identity and self-categorization theories to propose that when employees perceive the potential for upward mobility to be high, the proportion of temporary workers in the group will be negatively related to employee attitudes and behaviors, and the relationship will be positive when perceived mobility is low. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this relationship will be mediated by the valence of employees' perceptions of their workgroup's prototype. We test our hypotheses on a sample of 124 temporary and standard research scientists in an Australian organization. The results show that workgroup composition and perceived mobility jointly influence workgroup identification and organization-based self-esteem, mediated by the valence of workgroup prototype; however, workgroup composition and perceived mobility directly influence organizational citizenship behavior unmediated by prototype valence."}, {"e:author": ["Gregory B.

Frames may differ in the extent to which they lead reviewing to be viewed as an in-role duty or an extra-role choice, and the extent to which they lead reviewers to focus only on consequences to the self or consequences to others as well.

The results are striking. Despite the unanimous typecasting of the volumes as epitomizing either objectivist North American or subjectivist European traditions, the geographic distributions of researchers citing them are indistinguishable. Citations to each compendium are, however, clustered within particular journals and among authors with particular university affiliations---but neither the journals nor universities are neatly North American or European. Current associations of these traditions with North American and European scholarship thus seem driven more by academic rhetoric than authentic continental distinctions.

Specifically, we posit that legitimacy is more likely to be achieved when members articulate a clear <i>defining collective identity story</i> that identifies the group's orienting purpose and core practices.

We argue that a fundamental characteristic of OCs that affords collaboration is their fluidity. This fluidity engenders a dynamic flow of resources in and out of the community---resources such as passion, time, identity, social disembodiment of ideas, socially ambiguous identities, and temporary convergence. With each resource comes both a negative and positive consequence, creating a tension that fluctuates with changes in the resource. We argue that the fluctuations in tensions can provide an opportunity for knowledge collaboration when the community responds to these tensions in ways that encourage interactions to be generative rather than constrained.

An analysis of differences in R&D performance through a discontinuity requires assessment not only of old competence destruction but also of new competence access; that is, it requires assessment of both old capability obsolescence and new capability acquisition. I find evidence for this proposition in data from the biotechnology disruption to the anticancer drug market. In particular, my research design is a within-market matched pair of discontinuities: from chemotherapy to small-molecule targeted drugs, and from chemotherapy to large-molecule targeted drugs. Although equally competence destroying, the two discontinuities differ in the access incumbents have to the new capabilities required: whereas all new capabilities are available in the former, one new capability is inaccessible to incumbents (and to many entrants) in the latter. The contrasting results of these two discontinuities support my proposition: in the competence-destroying discontinuity with full access to new capabilities, incumbents did not fall behind entrants; in the other discontinuity, incumbents fell behind only those entrants that owned the difficult-to-access new capability.

It takes advantage of a rare opportunity to observe eight counterterrorism teams in the intelligence community that explicitly adopted an offensive or defensive strategic orientation in evaluating terrorist threats. The resulting inductive model suggests that the strength of a team's strategic orientation was enhanced or inhibited by its perception of oppositional strength and the problem scope it assumed in confronting the adversary. This in turn had effects on the work strategy the teams adopted, the extent to which they relied on internal versus external knowledge, and the norms for effort that evolved within the teams.

Decision makers will focus their attention on attaining and maintaining aspirations early in a period; however, as deadlines approach, decision makers in underperforming firms will increasingly be likely to focus on ensuring survival, whereas decision makers in outperforming firms will increasingly be likely to focus on experimenting with slack resources. We propose that the relationship between performance and risk taking should thus be moderated by deadline proximity within a performance period. We tested and found support for our hypotheses in the context of 22,603 fourth-down decisions made by the 32 National Football League teams during the 2000--2005 regular season games.

Discussions of <i>intra</i>-industry product diversification—generally, the province of marketing—typically focus on synergies obtainable from product bundling, which lowers producer costs or provides convenience for consumers. We take a different tack by linking interindustry diversification and consumer utility. We first separately examine two possible consumer benefits of interindustry diversification: (1) facilitating consumers' accomplishment of two tasks simultaneously or (2) attracting diverse consumer groups to a common platform when intergroup externalities exist. We then assess a simple empirical context that shows potential for simultaneous consumer utilities and two-sided market utility together. We analyze this context and concurrently develop a mathematical model showing how these demand-side synergies can create unique business value. We next introduce asymmetric preferences among consumer subgroups, and we refine our arguments by comparing their conclusions with the empirical data. We learn that combinations of otherwise mundane (i.e., commonplace) assets <i>can</i> create consumer value—“superior” assets are not necessary. Moreover, common ownership is necessary for the pricing flexibility required to deliver (and capture) maximum value through interindustry diversification, especially when consumer groups' preferences may change; the negotiations and settling up required for cooperation through alliances will, without common ownership, increase costs and reduce responsiveness.

This question is central to the resource-based view, and the answer depends not only on the direct returns on investment in each capability but also on the trade-offs in using those returns for future growth or survival in a competitive market. Through simulation experiments, this study examines firm-level capability development trade-offs in the context of a firm's market-level competition and growth. It is found that investing in operational capabilities (which enhance short-term performance) <i>gains priority</i> over investing in long-term dynamic capabilities <i>when the operational capability investment strengthens the reinforcing loop</i> between performance, investment flow, and capability development. Such operational capability investment provides growth opportunities and competitive advantage. Moreover, in strategic competition, firms anticipating rivals' focus on short-term growth need to further ignore dynamic (long-term) capability building in order to survive. Testable propositions are offered as to how trade-offs between short-term and long-term investments depend on different firm and industry characteristics.

Drawing from prior turnaround research, we identify several prominent forms of CEO fit/misfit that are especially germane to troubled firms.

We test these predictions in the market for U.S. wines.

We find that denial and defiance responses hinder the recovery of legitimacy on Main Street, and none of the responses has a positive effect on public perception, whereas Wall Street is unaffected by denial and defiance but views decoupling favorably.

We propose that bridging ties have accumulating effects as a result of learning and redeployment of cumulated knowledge. We also predict that bridging ties exhibit an imprinted effect whereby the founding conditions surrounding the formation of some, but not all, ties yield long-lasting network benefits. We test our theory in the context of Nashville's legal industry, studying the formation and evolution of the professional network of lawyers' coemployment ties between 1933 and 1978.

Based on the analysis, I induce that professionals (a) use individual metaphors to align themselves with the expectations of others and to mark particular roles for themselves that strictly meet those expectations (“strategic shifting”) when they perceive the social approval motive as strong; (b) engage in the extended use of a single metaphor to compress a situation into a frame that mediates between individual convictions and others' expectations (“framing”) when they know the views of others but are also strongly motivated to think through a circumstance as part of their professional role or previous commitments; and (c) systematically use a combination of metaphors that are blended and elaborated into a plausible narrative that attributes responsibility and prescribes a course of action (“narration”) when they are in a position (as part of their role) to define a circumstance, are unconstrained by past experiences, and do not directly know the views of others.

Empirically, we examine organizational response to the introduction of a government-sponsored but nonmandatory corporate governance code. Unable to comply with all of the requirements of this very specific and demanding code, many firms responded by developing their own internal corporate governance codes. We predict and show that adoption of these internal codes is driven by the visibility of a firm's corporate governance practices and by mimetic forces. We also find that internal governance codes differ in their degree of ceremoniality and that ceremoniality is inversely related to organizational dependence on stakeholders who value good corporate governance.

The routines generated hundreds of unique patterns that changed significantly during a five-month period without any apparent external intervention. Changes did not appear to reflect improved performance or learning.

Given how busy most managers are, and how much information their subordinates receive on a daily basis, this practice seems, initially, quite puzzling. We conducted an ethnographic investigation to examine the nature of events that compelled managers to engage in redundant communication. Our study of the communication patterns of project managers in six companies across three industries indicates that redundant communication is a response to unexpected endogenous or exogenous threats to meeting work goals. Managers used two distinct forms of redundant communication to mobilize team members toward mitigating potentially threatening discrepant events—unforeseen disruptive occurrences during the regular course of work. Managers with positional power over team members reactively followed up on a single communication when their attempt to communicate the existence of a threatening discrepant event failed, and they determined that a second communication was needed to enable its joint interpretation and to gain buy-in. In contrast, managers without positional power over team members proactively used redundant communication to enroll team members in the interpretation process—leading team members to believe that they had come up with the idea that completion of their project was under threat—and then to solidify those interpretations. Moreover, findings indicate that managers used different types of technologies for these sequential pairings based on whether their motivation was simply to transmit a communication of threat or to persuade people that a threat existed.

The causes of these deviations are behavioral factors that bound firms' ability to pursue and compete for superior opportunities. Because these bounds are systematic and diffused among firms, they ensure that latent opportunities are not competed away. In this setting, the behavioral bases of superior performance stem from a superior ability to overcome focal behavioral bounds. This analytical structure is used to identify the mental processes especially important to firm performance that strategic leaders can reliably manage. Its key insight is that superior opportunities are cognitively distant. They rarely correspond to common ways of thinking. The reason for this is that it is necessary to overcome strong behavioral bounds to pursue these opportunities. This insight contrasts with mainstream behavioral approaches to strategy, which focus on the virtues of local action, and it has two implications: the behavioral essence of superior performance corresponds to strategic leaders' superior ability to manage the mental processes necessary to pursue cognitively distant opportunities; and pursuing the cognitively distant implies a more expansive conception of strategic agency (e.g., the role of strategic leaders) than is acknowledged by mainstream behavioral approaches to strategy. The challenges posed by this conception require a model of human cognition that goes beyond the understanding of bounded rationality that is diffused in current behavioral strategy research.

(1) To solve the risk-averseness problem of middle and operational managers and unleash their entrepreneurial ideas, top management needs to encourage autonomous behaviors, which can also exacerbate a different type of agency problem: opportunistic behaviors.

Organizations, however, could not establish similar patterns among their customers, who, lacking connections with other routine participants, expected consistency and performed their part less flexibly. These observations lead us to develop a theoretical model that identifies the processes through which simultaneous ostensive patterns of consistency and flexibility are established and sustained among organizational members, as well as the challenges that arise from multiplicity of ostensive patterns among routine participants with different roles and connections.

In this paper, I contribute to this discussion by performing a qualitative case study investigating the accounts employees provide as they make sense of their identification with their workgroup, organization, and profession. Analyses of accounts from 31 members of an architecture firm reveal nine explanations individuals use to make sense of their identifications, which can be categorized using four sensemaking logics: similarity, familiarity, benefits, and investment. The explanations that informants provided differed markedly across targets. Whereas individuals relied heavily on personal relationships, and that their work actually happens in their workgroup in their accounts of workgroup identification, organizational identification was often explained based on the ideology of the organization, the support provided by the organization, the prestige of the organization, and the input the individual had into the organization. In further contrast, accounts of professional identification rested on explanations based in professional archetypes, the enjoyment informants found in their work, and professional norms about the work/life interface. These findings suggest that individuals may construct their identifications differently across targets. I theorize that these patterns are a function of target proximity and the characteristics that distinguish between targets. These findings open up the black box of identification by providing insight into how individuals interpret information about workplace targets.

We analyze the product and organizational architectures of three firms in the air conditioning industry through an original data set of 100 components and supply relationships.

Also, the performance of supply relationships depends on the amount of buyer–supplier information sharing but not on the degree of component modularity, which supports the relational view and confirms that product modularity does not have unambiguous effects on organizational performance. Moreover, the degree of component modularity negatively moderates the impact of buyer–supplier information sharing on supplier-relationship performance, which confirms that component modularity works as an ex ante, embedded substitute for high-powered interorganizational integration mechanisms. Finally, contingent on firms' strategies, organizational structures, and capabilities, we argue that <i>at the firm level</i>, higher product modularity may be associated either with <i>less</i> information sharing with suppliers, which implies that the mirroring effect might hold also at the firm level, or with <i>more</i> information sharing with suppliers, which implies that there may be increasing returns to modularity in design efforts because of interorganizational integration (the “complementarity” hypothesis)."}, {"e:author": ["Dovev Lavie", "Israel Drori"], "e:volume": "23", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1110.0656", "e:keyword": ["Knowledge", "Collaboration", "Partnering", "Alliance", "Application", "Network", "Resource", "Innovation", "University research", "Nanotechnology"], "e:pages": "704-724", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1110.0656", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Collaborating for Knowledge Creation and Application: The Case of Nanotechnology Research Programs", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "We study how collaboration and internal resources drive knowledge creation and application in university research programs.

Furthermore, the availability of internal resources can either complement or substitute for collaboration depending on the level of collaboration. In particular, we find that availability of internal resources mitigates the effect of academic collaboration on knowledge creation when collaboration is moderate and complements it as collaboration becomes excessive.

Whether or not resistance becomes productive depends on the skillful work of resisters and the creation of powerful “objects of resistance” that enable resisters to modify temporarily the power configuration of a situation and oblige top management to listen to their claims and accommodate to the new configuration.

Reaching beyond the usual domain of organizational and management research, we leverage findings from law and economics to offer a novel organizational perspective on litigation and private dispute resolution, and we develop hypotheses about the likelihood of litigation in different exchange settings. Our empirical analysis generates three sets of new findings: First, counter to the received wisdom, we see that the involvement of lawyers does not necessarily signal the bitter end of an exchange relationship, because firms frequently manage to avoid litigation and resolve their disputes privately, and they do so in a manner that accords with our theoretical predictions. Second, we see that familiarity with exchange partners does not automatically lead to increased willingness to work things out; rather, our empirical results suggest that the impact of exchange duration on parties' willingness to resolve disputes privately is contingent on the development of norms of cooperation: in the event that such norms do not develop, the probability of a litigated outcome actually increases over time. Finally, we see that firms' willingness to work things out privately is also influenced positively by the shadow of the future.

These rhetorical constructions of ambiguity follow a processual pattern that shapes the emergent process of strategic action.

Because increasing the number of alliance partners introduces additional complexities to managing an alliance, the appropriate governance mechanism for a multilateral R&D alliance is likely to differ from that for a bilateral alliance. Drawing insights from social exchange theory, we explore governance decisions in multilateral R&D alliances. First, we examine the potential for variance between multilateral and bilateral R&D alliances in governance decisions as a means of knowledge sharing and knowledge protection. Results based on our analysis of 2,423 R&D alliances, 1,690 bilateral and 733 multilateral, are consistent with predictions drawn from social exchange theory.

One approach in the literature for overcoming these difficulties, which we refer to as the traverse approach, is for team members to identify, elaborate, and then explicitly confront the differences and dependencies across the knowledge boundaries. This approach emphasizes deep dialogue and requires significant resources and time. In an exploratory in-depth longitudinal study of three quite different cross-functional teams, we found that the teams were able to cogenerate a solution without needing to identify, elaborate, and confront differences and dependencies between the specialty areas. Our analysis of the extensive team data collected over time surfaced practices that minimized members' differences during the problem-solving process. We suggest that these practices helped the team to <i>transcend</i> knowledge differences rather than <i>traverse</i> them. Characteristic of these practices is that they avoided interpersonal conflict, fostered the rapid cocreation of intermediate scaffolds, encouraged continued creative engagement and flexibility to repeatedly modify solution ideas, and fostered personal responsibility for translating personal knowledge to collective knowledge. The contrast between these two approaches to knowledge integration—traverse versus transcend—suggests the need for more nuanced theorizing about the use of boundary objects, the nature of dialogue, and the role of organizational embeddedness in understanding how knowledge differences are integrated."}, {"e:author": ["Kevin J.

The patterns indicate the link is closely related to the diversity and distinct specializations of producers. Also highlighting the role of heterogeneity and nonrandom entry and sorting, later cohorts generated less compelling software than earlier cohorts. Adding producers to a platform also shaped investment incentives in ways that were consistent with a tension between network effects and competitive crowding, alternately increasing or decreasing innovation incentives depending on whether apps were differentiated or close substitutes. The crowding of similar apps dominated in this case; the average effect of adding producers on innovation incentives was negative. Overall, adding large numbers of producers led innovation to become more dependent on population-level diversity, variation, and experimentation—while drawing less on the heroic efforts of any one individual innovator."}, {"e:author": ["Matthew S.

On one hand, various researchers have asserted that status improves performance. This line of work emphasizes tangible and intangible resources that accrue to occupants of high-status positions and therefore pictures status as an asset. On the other hand, a second stream of research argues that status instead diminishes performance. This alternative line of work emphasizes complacency and distraction as deleterious processes that plague occupants of high-status positions and thus portrays status as a liability. Which of these two perspectives best characterizes the actual performance of individuals in a competitive setting? And are they in any way reconcilable? In this paper, we summarize these two perspectives and test them in two empirical settings: the Professional Golf Association (PGA) and the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR). Using panel data on the PGA Tour, we model golfers' strokes from par in each competition as a function of their status in the sport. Using similar data on NASCAR's Winston Cup Series, we model drivers' speed in the qualifying round as a function of their status in the sport. We find curvilinear effects of status in both contexts. Performance improves with status until a very high level of status is reached, after which performance wanes. This result not only concurs with the view that status brings tangible and intangible resources but also provides empirical support for the contention that status fosters dispositions and behaviors that ultimately erode performance."}, {"e:author": ["Kira R.

Pre-entry experience in an activity increases the likelihood of its internalization and reduces the effect of enduring transaction hazards on the internalization choice. Importantly, we also distinguish between firm- and founder-level pre-entry capabilities (that is, the capabilities of firms versus those of founders). Diversifying entrants with firm-level integrative capabilities are more likely to internalize value chain activities than start-ups, and this effect persists over the industry's life cycle.

Network dissolution differs from network formation in that partners have already obtained direct information.

An analysis of the interlocking ties of S&P 1500 firms with Internet companies from 1996 to 2006 supports the view that fads and fashions have asymmetric effects on the evolution of networks and also shows that (1) fads and fashions have a strong impact on the formation of networks but not on their dissolution, (2) the networking behaviors of organizations with direct contact are less induced by fads and fashions, and (3) the networks formed by organizations with direct contact during the heyday of a fashion survive longer."}, {"e:author": ["Francisco Polidoro", "Matt Theeke"], "e:volume": "23", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1110.0684", "e:keyword": ["Innovations", "Knowledge-based competitive advantage", "Technological competition", "Imitation", "Substitution", "Scientific community", "Scientific publications", "Pharmaceutical drugs", "Top medical journals"], "e:pages": "1135-1153", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1110.0684", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Getting Competition Down to a Science: The Effects of Technological Competition on Firms' Scientific Publications", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Prior research about the interaction between private firms and the scientific community has largely viewed firms' articles in scientific publications as a means to improve research and development productivity—by encouraging their researchers to publish scientific papers, firms can maintain linkages with the scientific community, attract talent, and access external knowledge on which they can build to create innovations. This paper, in contrast, emphasizes the role of scientific publications in firms' battles for market dominance and examines how competitive conditions shape firms' propensities to publish scientific articles about their innovations. Focusing on the context of pharmaceutical drugs, we develop propositions about how the competition that one drug faces from similar drugs and potential substitutes influences the innovating firm's inclination to publish articles in the top medical journals about that drug to facilitate its assessment by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the medical community. We also propose that scientific articles about competing drugs compel a firm to highlight its own drug in scientific papers to assert the drug's uniqueness and mitigate the threat of substitution. Whereas prior research has elucidated how science contributes to enhancing firms' competence at creating innovations, which is critical to their ability to compete in technology-intensive environments, this paper draws attention to how competition, in turn, permeates into the scientific arena, creating inducements for firms to use scientific publications to position their innovations in the marketplace."}, {"e:author": ["Peer C.

We categorize product innovations according to whether they are enabled by changes in components or by changes in architectures. We test our predictions in the context of the global dynamic random access memory industry from 1974 to 2005, during which it transitioned through 12 distinct product generations. We find that vertically integrated firms had, on average, a faster time to market for new product generations than nonintegrated firms. The performance benefit that firms derived from vertical integration was greater when the new product generation was enabled by architectural change than when it was enabled by component change. We also find that although many nonintegrated firms extended their knowledge boundaries by developing knowledge of outsourced components, the performance benefits from such knowledge mostly accrued to “fully nonintegrated” firms (i.e., those that did not vertically integrate into any upstream component), rather than “partially integrated” firms (i.e., those that vertically integrated into some components but not others).

Our thesis is empirically tested in the context of industrial original equipment manufacturers employing branded component contracts with independent component vendors. Specifically, we investigate the conditions under which the price terms for branded components are agreed upon (more fixed) ex ante versus negotiated (more flexible) ex post.

Practicing managers who learned before making pay decisions that they could provide a social account—here, an explanation of circumstances justifying low raises—paid women less than men and less than women for whom they could not provide this account. Also as hypothesized, when an account was available, experienced managers paid women less than did inexperienced managers. In addition to pay decisions, participants' explicit beliefs about the value of accounts as substitutes for pay (Study 1) and in motivating male and female employees (Study 2) were examined. When participants expected the account to make the employee feel that he or she had been treated with a high level of procedural fairness (Study 1), or the language of the account explicitly acknowledged and apologized for unfair treatment (Study 2), participants assumed that the account would be significantly more valuable for women than for men.

Combining field data from a global consulting firm with an agent-based model, we examine how efforts to supplement one's knowledge from coworkers interact with individual, organizational, and environmental characteristics to impact organizational performance. We find that once cost and interpersonal exchange are included in the analysis, the impact of knowledge transfer is highly contingent. Depending on specific characteristics and circumstances, knowledge transfer can better, matter little to, or even harm performance. Three illustrative studies clarify puzzling past results and offer specific boundary conditions: (1) At the individual level, better organizational support for employee learning diminishes the benefit of knowledge transfer for organizational performance. (2) At the organization level, broader access to organizational memory makes global knowledge transfer less beneficial to performance. (3) When the organizational environment becomes more turbulent, the organizational performance benefits of knowledge transfer decrease. The findings imply that organizations may forgo investments in both organizational memory and knowledge exchange, that wide-ranging knowledge exchange may be unimportant or even harmful for performance, and that organizations operating in turbulent environments may find that investment in knowledge exchange undermines performance rather than enhances it.

Our study shows that the process of new category formation was driven by groups of architects with distinct clientele associated with institutional logics of commerce, state, religion, and family. These architects enacted different artifact codes for a building based on institutional logics associated with their specific mix of clients. “Modern architects” fought over what logics and artifact codes should guide “modern architecture.” Modern functional architects espoused a logic of commerce enacted through a restricted artifact code of new materials in a building, whereas modern organic architects advocated transforming the profession's logic enacted through a flexible artifact code of mixing new and traditional materials in buildings. The conflict became a source of creative tension for modern architects that followed, who integrated aspects of both logics and materials in buildings, expanding the category boundary. Plural logics and category expansion resulted in multiple conflicting exemplars within “modern architecture” and enabled its adaptation to changing social forces and architectural interpretations for over 70 years."}, {"e:author": ["Robin M.

Indeed, judgmental fallibility can lead to excess entry even when all potential entrepreneurs are underconfident. We further demonstrate that, as a group, individuals who decide to start a new business exhibit more confidence than those who do not and that successful entrants are less confident than failures. Our results therefore question general claims that overconfidence leads to excess entry.

This comparative case study of two hospitals demonstrates that implementing reform inside organizations may require internal reformers not only to mobilize with one another but also to stand up to internal defenders' countertactics in everyday encounters. Because reformer alliances across identity lines often require reformers with different statuses to collaborate with one another, defenders can divide reformer coalitions by linking reform practices to a status characteristic associated with lower-status reformers, denigrating higher-status reformers by associating them with these practices, and reintegrating higher-status reformers into the defender group. When status threat inside an organization is high to begin with, higher-status reformers are likely to be concerned about loss of privilege in the face of defenders' status-based countertactics and, in response, distance themselves from reform practices and align themselves with defenders to protect their identity and its rewards. This can undermine the multi-identity reformer coalition and cause change to fail.

Much of organizational scholarship holds that accompanying a shift toward increasingly modular product structures, component suppliers are engaging in relatively more design and invention around the components that they supply. We find that the evolution of digital controls may reverse this pattern, because in the wake of a major shift in the digital controls technology, suppliers actually engage in relatively less component innovation in comparison with their large manufacturing customers. To explain this shift, we characterize complex product structures in terms of two distinct product hierarchies: the inclusionary and the digital control hierarchy.

We address both of these shortcomings. First, we propose a typology of different types of workplace crimes (consisting of pro-organizational, nonaligned-organizational, and anti-organizational crimes) based on the intentions of the perpetrators. Second, we link these intentions to various identification “pathologies”—such as over-identification and over-disidentification, under-identification and ambivalent identification—and argue that these pathologies are linked to propensities to commit certain types of workplace crimes. Specifically, we contend that over-identification and over-disidentification have direct effects on workplace crimes, whereas under-identification and ambivalent identification indirectly influence the propensity to engage in workplace crimes. We suggest that this research aids us in clarifying the inconsistent conclusions in previous work in the domain of workplace crimes and that it emphasizes the importance of including organizational identification as a key factor in the extant models of workplace crimes. This research also highlights policy implications regarding workplace crimes in that it suggests that different agencies may be more effective in enforcing the law and disciplining those engaged in the different types of workplace crimes."}, {"e:author": ["Robert Gibbons", "Rebecca Henderson"], "e:volume": "23", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1110.0715", "e:keyword": ["Organizational economics", "Strategy"], "e:pages": "1350-1364", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1110.0715", "e:year": 2012, "e:title": "Relational Contracts and Organizational Capabilities", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "A large literature identifies unique organizational capabilities as a potent source of competitive advantage, yet our knowledge of why capabilities fail to diffuse more rapidly—particularly in situations in which competitors apparently have strong incentives to adopt them and a well-developed understanding of how they work—remains incomplete.

This review suggests that progress has been substantial and that the key elements of a promising dynamic synthesis have been identified. The paper then considers issues that call for attention if further progress is to be achieved. The first of these is the role of agency, which must be seen in expansive terms (relative to standard economic rationality) if its evolutionary significance is to be fully appreciated. The second is the role of structure, or more specifically, industry architecture, which affects capability development by way of its effect on the feedback that firms receive. After drawing on the recent financial crisis for an illustration of these ideas, this paper considers the rise of interest in business models as a useful field of application, and it concludes with a discussion of the role of organizational economics (beyond TCE).

The mutual causal influences in a coevolutionary relationship help explain why competing sets of firms or individual firms can capture dominant shares in product markets. Using a comparative historical method and drawing on evidence from five countries over a 60-year period, this paper inquires how precisely coevolutionary processes work in shaping the evolution of industries and important features of their environments. It identifies—in the context of the synthetic dye industry—three causal mechanisms (exchange of personnel, commercial ties, and lobbying) and suggests how they acted as levers on the fundamental mechanisms of evolution.

This study uses an experiment with three-person groups to examine how routines evolve in the interaction of problem-solving and internal integration dynamics. In line with previous work, we find that groups do indeed develop problem-solving routines over time and use them consistently. Furthermore, group members internalize and retain routines in their individual decisions. The formation and retention of these routines is, however, affected by social comparisons. Groups that have a strong sense of group identity use their problem-solving routines more consistently. Their members also better retain the routines in their individual decisions. In contrast, we find that differentiated status within a group distorts its problem-solving routines by overweighting the influence of the high-status member. Status also interferes with the formation and retention of routines, in that groups are relatively less consistent in using them and their members show lower retention of the routine in their individual decisions. Finally, a strong relationship between two of the three members in a group (leaving the third group member out) enables the two to engage in consistent problem solving, but concomitantly, the group as a whole is less able to apply its routines consistently, and group retention of routines also suffers."}, {"e:author": ["John P.

The model proposes that members undertake two identity comparisons to assess the value of organizational membership for identification purposes. In one, they compare the organization's current identity with their own identity, allowing them to assess the organization's ability to meet their motivation for self-continuity. In the other, they compare the organization's current identity with its expected identity, allowing them to assess the organization's ability to meet their motivation for self-esteem.

Findings from a study of 7,578 subordinates and their 335 general managers within a national restaurant chain indicate that <i>agreement</i> between employees and managers that employees display a high level of voice leads to favorable outcomes for employees.

We also propose that, because matching is two-sided, outside options have a greater impact on a firm's withdrawal when they are more likely to initiate new alliances.

Our focus on group interaction episodes as the engine of the group engagement process illuminates what individuals do when they are performing the focal work of the group (i.e., solving problems related to the task at hand) and how they develop and sustain the mutual focus of attention that is required for making collective progress on the task itself.

We expect that as prospective partners' technological value increases, the probability of alliance formation increases the most for firms residing in less corporatist countries. Likewise, as prospective partners' social value increases, the probability of alliance formation increases the most for firms in more corporatist countries. We further argue that norms regarding knowledge acquisition within an alliance vary across countries, with deliberate learning approaches serving as the norm in less—not more—corporatist settings. We expect that such differences will lead to more immediate interpartner knowledge acquisition in less corporatist environments.

Drawing upon the team theory and modularity literature, it argues that the degree of divisionalization is predicated not only on the extent of interdependence (complexity) among tasks but also on the extent to which those interdependent relationships are decomposable. As such, the feasibility and benefits of modularization in organizational design may be overstated when the underlying tasks are not decomposable. In addition, this paper argues that organizational hierarchy serves to mitigate the tension between complexity and decomposability by facilitating a higher degree of divisionalization. These arguments are tested using data on the business activities and organization structures of U.S. equipment manufacturers in 1993–2003. Results show that divisionalization increases with task complexity, suggesting that complex task systems encourage more division of managerial responsibilities. However, divisionalization decreases as task systems become less decomposable. Meanwhile, organizational hierarchy increases with task complexity, and it increases as task systems become less decomposable. These findings highlight the constraints firms face in designing modular organization structures and the role of hierarchy in coordinating complex task systems that are not fully decomposable."}, {"e:author": ["Robert J.

Pioneers of this organizational form seized opportunities arising from broad institutional change to discredit the status quo and legitimate their model of how to advise organizations on strategic and operational issues. Similar to institutional entrepreneurs seeking to change mature fields, those in this emerging field engaged in theorization, undertook collective action, and established affiliations with recognized authorities and elites. But unlike institutional entrepreneurs in mature fields, the actors we studied could not leverage logics, positions, or collectivities within their emerging field; instead, they drew on logics from outside their field, sought affiliations with external authorities and elites, and emphasized the benefits of their activities for society at large.

Comparing these strategies to firms' technological capabilities, we find that capabilities alone do not explain executives' label use. Instead, the data show that these strategies are driven by executives' aspiration to symbolically influence their firms' market categorization. In particular, executives' perception of the label's ambiguity, their avoidance of perceived credibility gaps, and their assessment of the label's signaling value shape their labeling strategies. In contrast to extant research, which suggests that executives should aim for coherence, we find that many executives hedge their affiliation with a nascent market label.

Such distances directly affect individual behavior and shape other features of the context that alter group processes (e.g., by forcing groups to adopt new communication tools). Prior research has examined isolated effects of various dimensions of virtuality without considering how these effects on individual behavior and group dynamics might have conceptually related underpinnings. To address this gap, we propose an extension of construal-level theory as a way to link the effects of virtuality through a common mediating mechanism. According to construal-level theory, events or objects that are physically or temporally distant are also distant psychologically and thus are likely to be described in terms of their general characteristics. In contrast, views of more proximal events or objects will be more detailed and nuanced. We develop propositions that illustrate how objective dimensions of distance create psychological distance and how that in turn affects how individuals view and interact with their teammates. We also develop propositions that show how the context of the distributed group (e.g., technology usage) affects this process over time. We compare and link this construal-based approach to alternatives based in theories of computer-mediated communication and social identity, and we thereby show that construal-level theory offers both parsimonious explanations and novel predictions about how and why distance alters perceptions of distributed group members (including oneself).

Having forecasters reflect on motivations normally experienced but not typically forecast produced behavioral predictions that were more consistent with the actual passive behavior of sexual harassment victims. Studies 4 and 5 reduce condemnation of passive sexual harassment victims by highlighting important motivations likely experienced by those victims (Study 4) and by having participants recall a past experience of not acting when being intimidated in the workplace, a situation related but distinct from sexual harassment (Study 5). The results from these studies add insights into the causes and consequences of victim condemnation and help explain why passivity in the face of harassment—the predominant response—is subject to so much scorn."}, {"e:author": ["Mary J.

We study the reactions of securities analysts, as important sources of institutional pressures for firms, to the similar product/market strategies undertaken by firms from different prior industries responding to industry convergence. Our empirical setting is the convergence between the wireline telecommunications and cable television industries in the period following the advent of voice over Internet protocol technology. Controlling for firm financial performance and capabilities, we find that analysts were consistently more positive toward the cable firms than toward the wireline telecom firms. Our findings further show that this divergence in reactions arises from differences in existing investor expectations and preferences concerning how firms create value; stocks owned by investors with a greater preference for growth receive more positive reactions than those owned by investors with a greater preference for margins. However, this divergence in reactions shrinks over time as convergence unfolds and as investors shift their shareholdings in response to misalignment between their preferences and firms' strategic changes. Reactions from analysts—reflecting inertial expectations of investors—may persist for a time despite changes to firms' strategies, thus creating challenges for some firms in responding to technological change and industry convergence while legitimating and enabling similar responses from their competitors."}, {"e:author": ["Xiaoqing Wang", "Brian S.

It is in this context that new forms of organizing, such as online groups, have emerged. However, the same factors that underlie the utopian narrative of Internet life also give rise to numerous online groups, many of which fail to attract participants or to provide significant value. This suggests that despite the potential transformative nature of modern information technology, issues of scarcity, competition, and context may remain critical to the performance and functioning of online groups. In this paper, we draw from organizational ecology theories to develop an ecological view of online groups to explain how overlapping membership among online groups causes intergroup competition for member attention and affects a group's ability to grow. Hypotheses regarding the effects of group size, age, and membership overlap on growth are proposed and tested with data from a 64-month, longitudinal sample of 240 online discussion groups. The analysis shows that sharing members with other groups reduced future growth rates, suggesting that membership overlap puts competitive pressure on online groups. Our results also suggest that, compared with smaller and younger groups, larger and older groups experience greater difficulty in growing their membership. In addition, larger groups were more vulnerable to competitive pressure than smaller groups: larger groups experienced greater difficulty in growing their membership than smaller groups as competition intensified. Overall, our findings show how an abundance of opportunities afforded by technologies can create scarcity in user time and effort, which increases competitive pressure on online groups. Our ecological view extends organizational ecology theory to new organizational forms online and highlights the importance of studying the competitive environment of online groups."}, {"e:author": ["Roxana Barbulescu", "Matthew Bidwell"], "e:volume": "24", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1120.0757", "e:keyword": ["Gender segregation", "Hiring", "Job applications", "Supply side", "Matching", "Careers", "Financial services industry", "Gender roles", "Identification", "Work–life balance"], "e:pages": "737-756", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1120.0757", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Do Women Choose Different Jobs from Men?

We develop and test an integrative theory of why women might apply to different jobs than men. We note that constraints based on gender role socialization may affect three determinants of job applications: how individuals evaluate the rewards provided by different jobs, whether they identify with those jobs, and whether they believe that their applications will be successful. We then develop hypotheses about the role of each of these decision factors in mediating gender differences in job applications. We test these hypotheses using the first direct comparison of how similarly qualified men and women apply to jobs, based on data on the job searches of MBA students. Our findings indicate that women are less likely than men to apply to finance and consulting jobs and are more likely to apply to general management positions. These differences are partly explained by women’s preference for jobs with better anticipated work–life balance, their lower identification with stereotypically masculine jobs, and their lower expectations of job offer success in such stereotypically masculine jobs. We find no evidence that women are less likely to receive job offers in any of the fields studied. These results point to some of the ways in which gender differences can become entrenched through the long-term expectations and assumptions that job candidates carry with them into the application process."}, {"e:author": ["Evan Rawley", "Timothy S.

In this study, we examine the allocation of collective attention to new organizations in a system of relationships, within which new organizations seek to attract attention through their sensegiving activities; the information properties of their sensegiving activities affect the level of attention they receive from different types of media; and media attention, in turn, increases their perceived value potential in the eyes of venture capital investors (VCs). We examine these relationships in a sample of 398 information-technology start-ups that have obtained different levels of venture capital funding. Our results show that new organizations that engage in more intense and diverse sensegiving activities attract higher levels of industry media attention and that these effects are enhanced by the human capital of their founders and leaders. Diverse sensegiving activities are also associated with higher levels of attention from the general media, but only the attention of specialized industry media is positively associated with the level of VC funding obtained. These findings extend current research on information intermediation and institutional legitimation by demonstrating that media attention early in the life of new organizations affects how they are valued by a well-informed expert audience, such as VCs.

Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrate that when disagreement occurs, social category diversity increases premeeting elaboration, with relationship focus as a central causal mechanism. Experiment 3 shows that premeeting elaboration has important implications for performance: disagreeing dyads with social category diversity elaborate more prior to meeting and, as a result, perform better on a decision-making task than those with social category homogeneity.

After surfacing three potentially viable approaches for conceptualizing performance, we find that most studies are internally inconsistent in their use of these approaches, a situation that creates substantial difficulty in effectively interpreting research. The primary source of inconsistency lies in the use of a generalized abstract conceptualization of performance in theory building (the latent multidimensional approach) coupled with the adoption of one or two narrow aspects of performance in the empirical work (the separate constructs approach). Follow-up analyses designed to determine the best path for resolving these mismatches indicate that our field’s heavy use of abstract performance in theorizing is not scientifically grounded and should be replaced with more specific aspects of performance to match existing practices in empirical work. Although this change would profoundly affect the field and would be resisted by many, it offers a concrete path away from indefensible practices. We offer several explanations for current practices but emphasize forces related to institutional theory. From an institutional perspective, it appears that firm performance is treated in a general fashion in many areas of our academic lives because it has been embraced as an instrument of legitimacy rather than as a scientific tool that facilitates dialogue and the accumulation of knowledge.

Management Rev.</i> 23(2):325–340], suggests that in teams with strong faultlines the mechanisms of homophilous selection of interaction partners and persuasive influence cause subgroup polarization, defined as the split of the team into subgroups holding opposing opinions. The second, from sociological and anthropological traditions, emphasizes that crisscrossing actors bridge faultlines because they share demographic attributes with several subgroups. Demographically crisscrossing actors help to prevent polarization in social groups. We argue that Lau and Murnighan’s theory implicitly factors in the effects of crisscrossing actors. However, we show that the authors overlooked crucial implications of their theory because they did not consider crisscrossing actors explicitly. Most importantly, we demonstrate that demographic crisscrossing implies that even teams with strong faultlines will overcome polarization in the long run, although they might suffer from it in the short term. We develop and analyze a formal computational model of the opinion and network dynamics in work teams to show the consistency of our reasoning with Lau and Murnighans’ theory.

I study this question using a qualitative study of outsourcing in the information technology department of a large financial services firm.Traditional transaction cost-based theories argue that decisions about which transactions to outsource should reflect the characteristics of those transactions, yet I find only a weak link between transaction characteristics and outsourcing decisions. Qualitative evidence suggests that managers' pursuit of their own intraorganizational interests helps to explain why outsourcing decisions were often divorced from transaction characteristics. I found that the consequences of outsourcing projects were consistent with the assumptions of transaction cost and capabilities-based theories: managers had less authority over outsourced projects than internal ones, those projects were subject to weaker administrative controls, and outsourced vendors provided different capabilities than internal suppliers. However, the way that those consequences were evaluated often reflected managers' own interests rather than those of the organization.I highlight three aspects of organizational structure that affected how managers evaluated outsourcing: the nature of differentiated goals and responsibilities, the administrative controls that managers faced, and the pressures caused by interdependent workflows within the organization. I also show how the distribution of authority and other resources shaped which projects were outsourced. The analysis highlights the value of understanding make-or-buy decisions as an endogenous consequence of the structure in which those decisions take place, rather than as isolated decisions that are maximized regardless of their context."}, {"e:author": ["Aleksandra J.

Based on unique data on hedge fund foundings between 1979 and 2006, this study documents that past entrepreneurial behaviors of university peers are an important driver of individual rates of entrepreneurship. Additional analyses show that social influence has a stronger effect on the transition to entrepreneurship when exerted by spatially proximate university peers and university peers who share gender with the focal individual. These findings provide evidence that the effect of university peers arises as a result of social influence rather than the institutional impact of universities.

These discontinuities, which often occur at the fringes of an industry, are usually driven by innovative and (often) venture capital-backed start-ups creating new products and transforming existing industries in ways that are difficult for incumbent managers to understand against the backdrop of their existing cognitive schemata. However, failing to appreciate and embrace successful technological discontinuities might endanger incumbents’ very existence. Extending the attention-based view, we explore whether and how interorganizational relationships guide top managers’ attention either to or away from technological discontinuities. We propose that homophilous relationships (e.g., alliances with industry peers) should exhibit a negative relationship with incumbents’ timely attention to technological discontinuities, whereas heterophilous relationships (e.g., with venture capitalists as a result of coinvestments) should exhibit a positive relationship. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the status of the partners strengthens the effect of homophilous and heterophilous relationships with the timely attention of top managers to technological discontinuities. Based on a longitudinal study of the incumbents in four information and communications technology industry sectors, we find that heterophilous ties through corporate venture capital (CVC), coinvesting with high-status venture capital firms, exhibit a strong positive relationship with timely attention. CVC, when it connects senior management to high-status venture capitalists through coinvestments, has a special role in directing top managers’ attention to technological discontinuities and ensuing business opportunities. Implications for the understanding of the role of interorganizational ties as structural determinants of top managers’ attention are discussed."}, {"e:author": ["Jordan I. Siegel", "Amir N.

We propose that this effect is accentuated when the firm expects that it cannot easily adapt to rivals’ technologies subsequently, specifically when rivals are a greater deterrent through being litigious or innovative.

We find that psychological safety mediates the positive relationship between team structure and team learning, and that task autonomy constraints mediate the negative relationship between organizational structure and team learning. Investigating the interaction effect between team and organizational structure, we find, unexpectedly, that organizational structure supports external team learning under conditions of less team structure. Specifically, when teams have less team structure, the relationship between organizational structure and external team learning is positive.

First, we show that several foundational studies purporting to provide empirical support for aspiration-level decision making may actually represent maximizing behavior. To consider this potential, we simulate a sample of subjectively rational agents who choose strategies by maximizing expectations.

In addition, the degree of overpayment increases with the frequency of prior exchanges. This adverse effect of exchange history grows if the uncertainty regarding the target firm rises. However, better prospects for future business with acquiring firms help mitigate this negative effect, although this moderating effect varies across the types of exchange experience. The findings suggest that a potentially complex and nuanced process underlies repeat exchanges, which are an oft-claimed precursor of relational embeddedness, to deliver tangible economic benefits.

Furthermore, we suggest that organizations can play a role in influencing employees’ discrete emotional reactions to the benefit of both employees and the organization.

In essence, employees are more likely to experience guilt (but not shame) if they feel they had control over a specific negative event and the event resulted in a negative outcome for others. Given these necessary preconditions, we identify a set of organizational characteristics—autonomy, specificity of performance feedback, and outcome interdependence—that can be modified to make the experience of guilt more likely than that of shame in the workplace.

Because corporate structure vertically differentiates performance goals and problemistic search, solutions to performance problems vary across corporate and business unit levels, with divergent implications for business unit adaptation. We examine business unit adaptation empirically through new product introductions in the global mobile device industry, finding that poor performance at the business unit level leads to greater new product introductions.

We test the hypotheses with a longitudinal study in a dynamic industry that combines objective measures of competition, firm size, age, and revenue performance with self-reported measures of product and market exploration and exploitation. The empirical results offer new insights with respect to several tensions at the heart of the ambidexterity challenge: (1) pure strategies that combine product exploration with market exploration or product exploitation with market exploitation have complementary interaction effects on revenue, (2) cross-functional ambidexterity combining product exploitation with market exploration also exerts complementary interaction effects on revenue, (3) product ambidexterity has positive effects on revenue for older and larger—but not younger and smaller—firms, and (4) market ambidexterity has positive effects on revenue for larger—but not smaller, younger, or older—firms.

We build on existing theory in the fields of organizational creativity and knowledge recombination, especially work relating context to creativity. The paper’s main theoretical contribution is to extend our understanding of the boundaries of employee creativity by adding to the discussion of how access to and exploitation of different types of resources—during work hours or during leisure time—may affect creativity. Based on survey data from more than 3,000 inventions from German employee inventors, we find that leisure time inventions are more frequently observed for conceptually based problems, in cases where interactions with people outside the organization are important for making the invention, and for smaller research and development projects. Our findings also suggest that employee inventions during work time may become more “embedded” in an environment of path-dependent resources than those made during leisure time."}, {"e:author": ["Sarah Kaplan", "Wanda J.

In a comparison of five strategy projects, we observed that organizational participants struggled with competing interpretations of what might emerge in the future, what was currently at stake, and even what had happened in the past. We develop a model of <i>temporal work</i> in strategy making that articulates how actors resolved differences and linked their interpretations of the past, present, and future so as to construct a strategic account that enabled concrete strategic choice and action. We found that settling on a particular account required it to be coherent, plausible, and acceptable; otherwise, breakdowns resulted. Such breakdowns could impede progress, but they could also be generative in provoking a search for new interpretations and possibilities for action. The more intensely actors engaged in temporal work, the more likely the strategies departed from the status quo. Our model suggests that strategy cannot be understood as the product of more or less accurate forecasting without considering the multiple interpretations of present concerns and historical trajectories that help to constitute those forecasts. Projections of the future are always entangled with views of the past and present, and temporal work is the means by which actors construct and reconstruct the connections among them. These insights into the mechanisms of strategy making help explain the practices and conditions that produce organizational inertia and change."}, {"e:author": ["Lasse B. Lien", "Peter G.

We evaluate the survivor principle in the context of corporate diversification, asking if survivor-based measures of interindustry relatedness are good predictors of firms’ decisions to exit particular lines of business, controlling for other firm and industry characteristics that affect firms’ portfolio choices. We find strong, robust evidence that survivor-based relatedness is an important determinant of exit.

Companies willing to make use of external resources can now outsource innovation-related tasks to huge “crowds” outside the company.

In two experimental simulations, we show that this understanding has to be amended: potential contributors not only want a <i>good</i> deal, they also want a <i>fair</i> deal. Fairness expectations with regard to the distribution of value between the firm and contributors (distributive fairness) and the fairness of the procedures leading to this distribution (procedural fairness) impact the likelihood of participation beyond considerations of self-interest. Fairness expectations are formed on the basis of the terms and conditions of the crowdsourcing system and the ex ante level of identification with the firm organizing it. In turn, they impact the individuals’ transaction-specific reactions and also inform their future identification with the firm.

Though the consolidation of volume may lead to productivity improvement, little is known about how this shift toward outsourcing influences learning by providers of outsourced services. When producing output, the content of the knowledge gained can vary from one unit to the next. One dimension along which output can vary—a dimension with particular relevance in outsourcing—is the end customer for whom it is produced. The performance benefits of such customer experience remain largely unexamined. We explore this dimension of volume-based learning in a setting where doctors at an outsourcing firm complete radiological reads for hospital customers. We examine more than 2.7 million cases read by 97 radiologists for 1,431 customers and find evidence supporting the benefits of customer-specific experience accumulated by individual radiologists. Additionally, we find that variety in an individual’s customer experience may increase the rate of individual learning from customer-specific experience for a focal task. Finally, we find that the level of experience with a customer for the entire outsourcing firm also yields learning and that the degree of customer depth moderates the impact of customer-specific experience at the individual level.

The rise of openly faith-based organizations and discourse surrounding the role and importance of spirituality are just a couple of the indicators that religion, in its various guises, is playing a role in organizational life. With few exceptions, however, scholarly research has sidestepped the issue of religion, and, perhaps unwittingly, discourse surrounding spirituality seems to imply that religion is a benign and positive force. Rather than implicitly or explicitly assuming that religion is a benign, positive force in organizations, in this paper, we suggest that organizational scholars need to rigorously address the potential consequences of religion at work in a dispassionate manner that acknowledges both the benefits/adaptive outcomes and the challenges/maladaptive outcomes. Specifically, adopting primarily a psychological approach, we theorize about two fundamental tensions produced by contemplations about religion and the concept of God at work and the conditions under which benefits versus challenges may prevail. These exemplary tensions, virtuousness versus “more-virtuous-than-thou” and prosociality and ethicality versus egocentrism, highlight the fact that religion has the potential to result in both adaptive and maladaptive outcomes for organizations and their members. Importantly, for each tension, we theorize about the initial conditions under which beneficial/adaptive or challenging/maladaptive outcomes will prevail. We also explore the critical role that the wider context plays in understanding these tensions and how religion affects organizational life."}, {"e:author": ["Emily D.

In contrast to economic models of commons, which argue that commons occur naturally and are prone to collective inaction and tragedy, we introduce a social constructionist account of commons. Specifically, we show that actor-level frame changes can eventually lead to the emergence of an overarching, hybrid “commons logic” at the field level. These frame shifts enable actors with different logics to reach a working consensus and avoid “tragedies of the commons.” Using a longitudinal analysis of key actors’ logics and frames, we tracked the evolution of the global climate change field over 40 years. We bracketed time periods demarcated by key field-configuring events, documented the different frame shifts in each time period, and identified five mechanisms (collective theorizing, issue linkage, active learning, legitimacy seeking, and catalytic amplification) that underpin how and why actors changed their frames at various points in time—enabling them to move toward greater consensus around a transnational commons logic. In conclusion, the emergence of a commons logic in a transnational field is a nonlinear process and involves satisfying three conditions: (1) key actors view their fates as being interconnected with respect to a problem issue, (2) these actors perceive their own behavior as contributing to the problem, and (3) they take collective action to address the problem.

These organizational characteristics affect the stringency of monitoring through reputation, customer loyalty, differential impacts of government sanctions, and the standardization and internal monitoring of operations. We test our theory in the context of vehicle emissions testing in a state in which the government has outsourced these inspections to the private sector.

In exploring this puzzle, I draw on detailed firm-level data from the semiconductor industry to analyze how integrated incumbents, beyond shifting to the specialized mode, reconfigured in the face of industry’s vertical disintegration so as to coexist with the specialized firms. I propose and find that the incumbents who persist with vertical integration increase their emphasis on systemic innovations and transact with specialized firms in both upstream and intermediate markets. The value-creating opportunities associated with integrated incumbents’ leveraging (a) their relative superiority in developing systemic innovations and (b) markets to pursue a broader menu of transactional choices may offset their costs of staying integrated.

Finally, these effects of dynamic capabilities are larger for activities directed toward initially accessing resources than those directed toward further developing them, which is consistent with the potential for firms to rely on knowledge gained through resource access activity when conducting subsequent activity to further develop resources."}, {"e:author": ["Abhirup Chakrabarti", "Will Mitchell"], "e:volume": "24", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1120.0811", "e:keyword": ["Mergers and acquisitions", "Target selection", "Geographic distance", "Business relatedness"], "e:pages": "1805-1826", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.1120.0811", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "The Persistent Effect of Geographic Distance in Acquisition Target Selection", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Valuable resources often exist at distant points from a firm’s current locations, with the result that strategic decisions such as growth have a spatial dimension in which firms seek information and choose between geographically distributed alternatives.

This enables the core business to shift productivity gains toward itself from the segment, which could lead to various inefficiencies within the related diversified firm. Using input/output flow data and a multilevel model with the segment as the unit of analysis, I first show that a segment’s productivity is <i>lower</i> compared with a single-business firm when it shares backward and forward complementarity (i.e., when it shares transactions with common suppliers and customers) with the core business. Correspondingly, I show that as a mirror image, the core business’s productivity is <i>enhanced</i> when the business shares backward and forward complementarity with segments and when segments are backward integrated with it (i.e., when the core business provides outputs to segments). These shifts in productivity and the attendant inefficiencies do not seem to be destroying the entire value from related diversification.

In a field study of a series of four sequential mergers, we find that the boundary negotiation process acts as an engine for identity creation in postmerger integration. Our analysis of the process through which postmerger identity is created reveals two stages of identity creation. In the first stage, boundaries are negotiated to leverage and import certain practices and values of the premerger firms; in the second stage, these boundaries are blurred as managers build on the set of imported practices and values to impose further systems that define the postintegration firm. Our research contributes to the identity literature by drawing attention to the important role of boundaries and practices that define the identities of the merging firms. We show how these boundaries get repurposed to create an organization whose identity ultimately represents a departure from the premerger firms while it preserves the aspects of identity that allow members to uphold key values. We also contribute to the literature on postmerger integration by demonstrating the steps through which identity evolves by the staged demarcation and negotiation of boundaries, thus complementing previous treatments of merging firms as a set of fixed organizational attributes in merger contexts."}, {"e:author": ["Hart E.

We theorize that the process of internal experiential learning facilitates learning from external knowledge, particularly for entrants. To test this theory, we examine learning using a comprehensive set of U.S. commercial banking firms, including a full census of entrants.

I then explore how two changes in organizations’ environments—a decline in union strength and increased turbulence from changes in technology and globalization—might have affected workers’ ability to secure such closed employment relationships over the last 30 years.My results support the argument that declines in tenure reflect the reduced power of workers to secure closed employment relationships. Recent declines in tenure have been concentrated in large organizations, and many of those declines are explained by controlling for the changing levels of industry unionization. I find little evidence that foreign competition or technological change affected mobility. The results are robust to measures of changing industry growth rates and within-industry reorganization.

Entrepreneurs create new profit opportunities by recombining existing assets into novel combinations based on their subjective judgment under conditions of uncertainty. In doing so, they become vulnerable to ex post appropriation by owners of uniquely complementary assets, especially where ex ante uncertainty translates into ex post causal ambiguity. Firms are a means by which entrepreneurs overcome this problem, maximizing the appropriation of pure profits from their actions. The paper formalizes this insight in an integrative model of entrepreneurial governance choice, highlighting the trade-off between the risk of appropriation and the incremental cost of asset ownership. Comparative statics from this model provide predictions about the conditions under which hierarchical governance will be preferred. In particular, they suggest that firms are preferred where entrepreneurial action results in the creation of combinations of assets that are rare, valuable, and difficult to imitate (i.e., the creation of strategic capabilities). The paper thus contributes to work on the dynamics of capabilities and transaction costs, highlighting the structurally uncertain nature of capability creation and its implications for the theory of the firm."}, {"e:author": ["Omar N.

An inductive study of the rise of Cubism, a revolutionary paradigm that overthrew classic principles of representation in art, results in a model where not only the periphery moves toward the core through collective action, as typically asserted, but the core also moves toward the periphery, becoming more receptive to radical ideas. The fragmentation of the art market in early 20th-century Paris served as the trigger. The proliferation of market niches and growing ambiguity over evaluation standards dramatically reduced the costs of experimentation in the periphery and the ability of the core to suppress radical ideas. A multilevel analysis linking individual creativity, peer networks, and the art field reveals how market developments fostered Spanish Cubist Pablo Picasso’s experiments and facilitated their diffusion in the absence of public support, a coherent movement, and even his active involvement.

Case studies of changes in business and IS strategies and structure over long time periods in three organizations suggest that the punctuated equilibrium model provides a valuable perspective for viewing these dynamics.The cases suggest that a pattern of alignment may continue over a long period, because either the level of alignment is high or the managers do not recognize the low alignment as a problem.

Rather, these contrary descriptions of knowledge reflect different, partial, and sometimes “balkanized” perspectives from which knowledge and organization are viewed. Taking the community of practice as a unifying unit of analysis for understanding knowledge in the firm, the paper suggests that often too much attention is paid to the idea of community, too little to the implications of practice. Practice, we suggest, creates epistemic differences among the communities within a firm, and the firm's advantage over the market lies in dynamically coordinating the knowledge produced by these communities despite such differences. In making this argument, we argue that analyses of systemic innovation should be extended to embrace all firms in a knowledge economy, not just the classically innovative.

This paper advances the discussion by distinguishing three ideal-typical forms of organization and their corresponding coordination mechanisms: market/price, hierarchy/authority, and community/trust. Different institutions combine the three forms/mechanisms in different proportions. Economic and organizational theory have shown that, compared to trust, price and authority are relatively ineffective means of dealing with knowledge-based assets. Therefore, as knowledge becomes increasingly important in our economy, we should expect high-trust institutional forms to proliferate.A review of trends in employment relations, interdivisional relations, and interfirm relations finds evidence suggesting that the effect of growing knowledge-intensity may indeed be a trend toward greater reliance on trust. There is also reason to believe that the form of trust most effective in this context is a distinctively modern kind—“reflective trust”—as opposed to traditionalistic, “blind” trust. Such a trend to reflective trust appears to threaten the privileges of currently dominant social actors, and these actors' resistance, in combination with the complex interdependencies between price, authority, and trust mechanisms, imparts a halting character to the trend. But the momentum of this trend nevertheless appears to be self-reinforcing, which suggests that it may ultimately challenge the foundations of our capitalist form of society while simultaneously creating the foundations of a new, postcapitalist form."}, {"e:author": ["Charles Heckscher"], "e:volume": "12", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.12.2.235.10112", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "235-237", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.12.2.235.10112", "e:year": 2001, "e:title": "Response to Adler, ‘Market, Hierarchy, and Trust’", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:issue": "2"}, {"e:author": ["Carroll Underwood Stephens"], "e:volume": "12", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.12.2.238.10110", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "238-240", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.12.2.238.10110", "e:year": 2001, "e:title": "The Ontology of Trust and the Transformation of Capitalism in a Knowledge Economy— A Commentary on Paul Adler's ‘Market, Hierarchy, and Trust: The Knowledge Economy and the Future of Capitalism’", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:issue": "2"}, {"e:author": ["Alfred Kieser"], "e:volume": "12", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.12.2.241.10109", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "241-246", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.12.2.241.10109", "e:year": 2001, "e:title": "Trust as a Change Agent for Capitalism or as Ideology?

Private ownership and owner management not only reduce the effectiveness of external control mechanisms, they also expose firms to a “self-control” problem created by incentives that cause owners to take actions which “harm themselves as well as those around them” (Jensen 1994, p. 43). Thus, shareholders have incentive to invest resources in curbing both managerial <i>and</i> owner opportunism. We extend this thesis to the domain of the family firm. After developing hypotheses which describe how family dynamics and, specifically, altruism, exacerbate agency problems experienced by these privately held, owner-managed firms, we use data obtained from a large-scale survey of family businesses to field test our hypotheses and find evidence which suggests support for our proposed theory.

There are two diametrically opposing viewpoints. Adaptation theories predict that change occurs as fluid organizations adjust to meet shifting environmental demands, while selection theories predict that change occurs through the differential selection and replacement of inert organizations as environmental demands vary over time. Our paper bridges these polar opposites by using a punctuated equilibrium framework to examine organizations' responses to discontinuous industry-level change. This framework recognizes that the histories of many industries are occasionally punctuated by dramatic exogenous shocks, such as radical technological innovation, social and political turmoil, major changes in government regulation, and economic crashes. Our central thesis is that such environmental punctuations dramatically reduce pressures and rewards for organizational inertia and thereby alter both organizations' propensities for change and their survival chances following change.We focus on one form of punctuation, major regulatory change, and study firms in two industries: general hospitals and savings and loan associations. For organizations in both industries, we examine three important outcomes: shifts in organizational domain, CEO succession, and changes in financial performance. Our analyses show that punctuational regulatory change prompts shifts in organizational domains and executive leadership. Additionally, post-punctuation domain change and post-punctuation CEO succession both affect subsequent performance. We discuss our results in light of current thinking about the content and process effects of core organizational change, which has been developed in the context of stable environments.

An agent-based simulation model clarifies the structural reasons that this is so. The model also shows how the wedge-maximizing level of complexity varies with the replicator's informational edge over the imitator.The results help to pinpoint situations in which strategies requiring replication are likely to defy imitation and generate sustained competitive advantage.

Attribution theory, the concept of cognitive load, and feedback dynamics are harnessed to explain how dispersed partners are likely to interpret failures of mutual knowledge and the consequences of these interpretations for the integrity of the effort.

In 1994 and 1995, this group of six large financial firms developed procedures for risk management, internal controls, and reporting for largely unregulated areas of finance, in cooperation with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The process succeeded despite strong competition among the firms themselves and incentives for both the public and private sectors to resort to adversarial lobbying and legal challenges. The Derivatives Policy Group was a path-setting event in the development of flexible regulation of financial innovation that is now the norm for related policy making.The case is important in and of itself--the financial markets are a major concern of national and international economic policy--but here we treat it as an instance of a larger class of problems. Organizational science constantly encounters settings that involve numerous participants who compete or have histories of conflicts; who are interdependent, and collectively would gain (and even individually gain long term) by cooperating rather than competing on an issue; who fall under different governance systems; and who try as a group to design rules and principles governing their behavior. Four factors appear repeatedly in the research on the success or failure of such arrangements. These are (1) the initial dispositions toward cooperation, (2) the extant issues and incentives, (3) leadership, and (4) the number and variety of organizations involved.

Rather, in organizational settings decision-makers are subject to a hierarchy of influences that affect the decision processes they use and their resulting decision choices. To test our ideas, we examined 900 borrower “risk rating” decisions and found general support for our hypotheses. Decision makers were more likely to use the prescribed practice when decisions were important, when the decision target was known, and when the decision maker was located in a larger subunit. Decision makers altered their decision practices in the short term, but in the long term they appeared to partially revert to their earlier practices. Reliance on prescribed practice fostered stability in decisions, but surprisingly appeared to negatively affect future judgments.

The optimistic view is founded on the hypothesis that teams that are characterized by high network heterogeneity, whereby relationships on the team cut across salient demographic boundaries, enjoy an enhanced learning capability. We test each of these hypotheses directly and thereby avoid the problematic assumption that they contradict one another. Our analysis of data on the social networks, organizational tenure, and productivity of 224 corporate R…D teams indicates that both network variables help account for team productivity.

We show how the reproduction of successful actions inherent in adaptive processes, such as learning and competitive selection and reproduction, results in a bias against alternatives that initially may appear to be worse than they actually are. In particular, learning and selection are biased against both risky and novel alternatives. Because the biases are products of the tendency to reproduce success that is inherent in the sequential sampling of adaptation, they are reduced whenever the reproduction of success is attenuated. In particular, when adaptation is slowed, made imprecise, or recalled less reliably, the propensity to engage in risky and new activities is increased. These protections against the error of rejecting potentially good alternatives on inadequate experiential evidence are costly, however.

Previous research showed that when larger groups play the game, they rarely coordinate on the Pareto-optimal (efficient) outcome, but small groups almost always coordinate on the efficient outcome. After two or three periods of playing the game, one subject who was randomly selected from among the participants to be the “leader” for the experiment was instructed to make a speech exhorting others to choose the efficient action. Based on previous studies, we predicted that small groups would succeed in achieving efficiency but that large groups would fail. Based on social psychological studies of the fundamental attribution error, we predicted that the subjects would underestimate the strength of the situational effect (group size) and attribute cause to personal traits of the leaders instead—leaders would be credited for the success of the small groups, and blamed for the failure of the large groups. This hypothesis proved true: Subjects attributed differences in outcomes between conditions to differences in the effectiveness of leaders. In a second experiment, subjects voted to replace the leaders more frequently in the large-group condition (at a small cost to themselves), showing that misattributions of leadership ability also affect actual behavior by subjects. Previous research has demonstrated a tendency to credit or blame leaders for unusual performance. The difference in our study is that subjects should be blaming a structural condition—the size of the group—but they blame the leaders instead.

I argue that a mechanistic organization archetype prevents people from seeing in their minds' eyes—from imagining—how to do the work of innovation organizationwide, but that theorists have failed to articulate an alternative to this archetype in its own terms. The study focuses on two elements of organizing: the differentiation and the integration of work. I build grounded theory for an alternate, innovative archetype of organizing by exploring the shared image of work differentiation and integration in twelve firms that vary in innovative ability. I find a fundamentally different image in innovative organizations that is centered on hands-on practice: People understand value creation as a long-term working relationship with customers, in which they apply the firm's skills to anticipate and solve customer problems. This practice is differentiated into distinct problems in value creation, each of which embodies the integral flow of work like a lateral slice, but which situates those problems in their own contexts. People understand themselves to be organized in an autonomous community of practice that takes charge of one of the problems. The communities of practice are integrated by standards for action: vivid, simple representations of value that frame work and that are reenacted in practice.The analysis details this different image of organizing by describing four autonomous communities of practice and contrasting them with the image of organizing found in noninnovative firms. The paper illustrates how this new image straightforwardly organizes and controls innovative work, and how the noninnovative image of differentiation and integration makes this work unimaginable. I conclude that innovation can be incorporated with continuing operations, provided that managers and theorists reimagine the differentiation and integration of work. I offer preliminary ideas for doing so, and suggest some next steps in this research stream."}, {"e:author": ["Matthew S. Kraatz", "Edward J.

We examine the predictive power of these four alternative arguments using extensive longitudinal data from a single industry context characterized both by substantial resource heterogeneity and environmental turbulence. Results indicate that organizations possessing greater stocks of historically valuable resources were much less likely to engage in adaptive strategic change, but also that this resource-driven disinclination towards change tended to have a benign or even beneficial effect on performance.

Using a definition of organizational forms as external identity codes, we focus on two answers drawn from contemporary organization theory. The first holds that formal institutions such as industry associations and standard-setting bodies will result in a taken-for-granted organizational form. The second answer contends that increasing organizational density (number of organizations) will generate a legitimated organizational form. As reported here, a historical case study of the disk array market and its associated technologies finds both arguments limited. Although significant collective activity in association building and standard setting occurs among disk array producers, these have not yet led to an organizational form. Similarly, an observed trajectory of organizational density showing rapid growth followed by stabilization has not yet generated an organizational form. In our view, the diversity of origins and other activities of those organizations operating in this market work against institutionalization of the disk array organizational form. We reason that if firms in the market derive their primary identities from other activities (implying that there are few highly focused firms deriving their primary identity from disk arrays), then the disk array producer identity cannot cohere into a code or form. This conclusion suggests a respecification of the legitimation component of the density-dependent model of organizational evolution."}, {"e:author": ["Christina L. Ahmadjian", "James R.

These changes are best understood through a combination of transaction cost and learning perspectives on alliance. Consistent with transaction-cost economics, the shift in purchase-supply relationships can be traced to changes in the nature of parts transactions and <i>keiretsu</i>-governance structures. A learning perspective on alliance complements and extends transaction-cost theory, providing additional explanation of the sources of change and the specific governance choices being made.Our first two cases document a drift in Toyota's <i>keiretsu</i> supply network toward a hierarchical form in the management of parts-supply transactions. Toyota has effectively internalized its transactions with Daihatsu by taking a controlling interest. Toyota's strategy toward long-term partner Denso, on the other hand, was very different. Toyota built, from the ground up, an in-house capability in electronic components, thus scaling down its dependence on Denso. A third case considers a general trend in the Japanese auto industry toward greater standardization of parts. With the routinization of quality, reliability, and speed in supply management, the need for <i>keiretsu</i>-style governance has declined. The withering of <i>keiretsu</i> obligations is also traceable to globalization and the continuing weakness of the Japanese economy, which have prompted Japanese firms to question received business practice."}, {"e:author": ["Katherine A.

The innovator may be unable to appropriate all of the benefits from information technology investments. Airlines have installed computerized reservations systems in travel agencies to appropriate the returns from their investments in information technology. The airlines expected to obtain a number of benefits from this strategy, including increased efficiency, possible bias in favor of the computerized reservations systems owner on the part of the travel agent, and fees from other airlines for making reservations for them. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the appropriation of value by computerized reservations systems owners from deploying systems in travel agencies. These benefits, beyond fees from travel agents, should be seen in the vendor airline's market share between cities and in the overall performance of the airline at an industry level. This paper models airline performance as a function of computerized reservations systems ownership at two levels: for selected city-pairs and at the overall level of the firm. The city-pair analysis employs a multinomial logit market share model that analyzes five years of data on 72 city-pair routes. The industry model uses longitudinal data for a panel of 10 airlines for 12 years. The results of both analyses support hypotheses that computerized reservations systems ownership is positively related to airline performance. It appears that strong airlines have appropriated the benefits of their computerized reservations systems, turning them into highly specialized assets for further travel-related innovation.

As a result of this neglect, replication is typically conceptualized as little more than the exploitation of a simple business formula. Such a view clouds the strategic subtlety of replication by sidestepping the exploration efforts to uncover and develop the best business model as well as the ongoing assessment that precedes large-scale replication of it. Empirical evidence supports an alternative view of replication strategy as a process that involves a regime of exploration in which the business model is created and refined, followed by a phase of exploitation in which the business model is stabilized and leveraged through large-scale replication.In this paper we present the key elements of a theory of replication strategy. We discuss key aspects of a replication strategy, namely the broad scope of knowledge transfer and the role of the central organization, and the analytical concepts of template and Arrow core as a preamble for specifying hypotheses about the conditions under which a replication strategy is more likely to succeed in a competitive setting.

Normative theories suggest particular heuristics, or cognitive representations, to find appropriate solutions. Heuristics permit faster solutions to real-time problems; they also suffer from the potential of negative transfer to inappropriate applications.The theory of real options provides the appropriate heuristic framing of competencies and exploratory search. A real options approach marries the theory of financial options to foundational ideas in strategy, organizational theory, and complex systems. We join these approaches to identify three pairs of concepts: scarce factor and the underlying asset in option theory, inertia and irreversibility, and the ruggedness of landscape and option values. Strategic theories of resources largely define a core competence as unique and nonimmutable. In doing so, this definition has wrongly forgotten Barney's initial insight into scarce factor markets as determining the valuation of a competitive asset. Financial theory of real options derives its heuristics of investing in exploratory search by inferring future value of today's investments from market prices.We apply the three conceptual pairs to the evaluation of capabilities as real options through a formal descriptive model. The valuation of core capabilities is derived from observing the price dynamics of correlated strategic factors in the market. Because of inertia, managers cannot easily adjust the wrong set of organizational capabilities to the emergence of market opportunities. However, firms that have made investments in capabilities appropriate to these opportunities are able to respond. From this description, we define core competence as the choice of capabilities that permits the firm to make the best response to market opportunities.

We argue that a powerful implicit assumption within the stakeholder literature—that priorities within role-based stakeholder groups are relatively homogeneous—blurs our understanding of organization-stakeholder relationships. Two important and related areas of concern are presented. The first involves the primacy of role in stakeholder definition. This role primacy approach to stakeholder definition is appropriate if, for a particular issue, role-based stakeholder group members have similar priorities. Individual and collective self-interest provides a rationale for this assumption. However, an important problem with this approach arises in situations in which self-interest is not the primary motivator of individuals' priorities. In these instances, subgroups within different role-based stakeholder groups might have more similar priorities than either subgroup has with others within their role-based stakeholder group. In these situations the role primacy approach impedes, rather than facilitates, an understanding of our environment. Our second concern is related to insufficient rigor in the application of stakeholder analysis. Most stakeholder studies, both theoretical and empirical, fall short in the determination of relevant interests and the subsequent subdivision of role-based stakeholder groups into rigorously defined specific stakeholder groups. Having suggested that the role primacy approach to stakeholder definition is less than ideal, we examine the extent to which, and the conditions under which, roles are likely to determine priorities, and thus, the likelihood of relatively homogeneous priorities within role-based stakeholder groups. In addition, we present an illustrative empirical analysis of stakeholder group priorities. The illustrative study is conducted within the context of intercollegiate athletics. Related literature and our empirical results indicate that role-based self-interest frequently is not a sufficient \"binding tie\" of stakeholder groups. Given this background, we present an alternative approach to stakeholder analysis that borrows heavily from the customer segmentation literature of marketing.

Analysis of patent citations by semiconductor companies points to the superiority of multinational firms over both alliances and markets in cross-border knowledge building. Interviews with engineers and managers in MNCs point to the intertwining of codified and tacit knowledge and; therefore, the need for both formal and informal mechanisms for successful knowledge building. Our findings suggest that the superiority of MNCs stems from the firms' ability to use multiple mechanisms of knowledge transfer flexibly and simultaneously to move, integrate, and develop technical knowledge. Our research, therefore, suggests that the challenge of knowledge management for MNCs extends beyond the creation of international information systems, to the design of organizational structures, systems, and culture capable of supporting the flow of knowledge."}, {"e:author": ["Bruce Kogut", "Gordon Walker", "Jaideep Anand"], "e:volume": "13", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.13.2.162.533", "e:keyword": ["Institutions", "Diversification", "National Convergence"], "e:pages": "162-178", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.13.2.162.533", "e:year": 2002, "e:title": "Agency and Institutions: National Divergences in Diversification Behavior", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "A fundamental theme in comparative crosscountry research is the convergence of organizational forms in diverse national settings. In this paper we examine a special instance of this theme: the pattern of diversification across industries. A common argument is that technical and market forces compel firms to adopt “coherent” strategies of diversification. This thesis implies that there should be a convergence in the patterns of interindustry diversification in all market-based economies. An institutional approach offers an alternative view. From this perspective, when diversification across industries is seen as subject to nation-specific governance and resource constraints, countries should vary widely in their interindustry diversification patterns.To test these alternative views, we analyze the diversification patterns of large corporations from five countries: France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Our results do not support the hypothesis of a common pattern of diversification across countries, and thus reject the technological thesis. By comparing two case studies in which entrepreneurs attempted to diversify by acquisition in France and the United States, we examine how institutions and agents interact to permit different diversification patterns to arise in diverse national environments.The statistical results and case studies imply that, given the fixity of certain institutions, even if countries are subject to globalization, convergence in diversification patterns is not necessary. The results cast doubt upon the merits of stylizing the debate as a choice between technical and institutional theories of organizational choice. Rather, the study points to the importance of two theoretical statements. The first is to inquire under what conditions there is likely to be consensus on a given “means-end” rationality for a specific managerial decision (e.g., diversification). The second is to understand the structural opportunities available to entrepreneurs for diversifying through acquisitions. Iterating between these cognitive and structural considerations shifts the focus from the false debate between technological and institutional arguments to the study of entrepreneurship situated in historically given national environments."}, {"e:author": ["Wenpin Tsai"], "e:volume": "13", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.13.2.179.536", "e:keyword": ["Knowledge Sharing", "Organizational Capability", "Social Network Analysis"], "e:pages": "179-190", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.13.2.179.536", "e:year": 2002, "e:title": "Social Structure of “Coopetition” Within a Multiunit Organization: Coordination, Competition, and Intraorganizational Knowledge Sharing", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Drawing on a social network perspective of organizational coordination, this paper investigates the effectiveness of coordination mechanisms on knowledge sharing in intraorganizational networks that consist of both collaborative and competitive ties among organizational units.

Results show that formal hierarchical structure, in the form of centralization, has a significant negative effect on knowledge sharing, and informal lateral relations, in the form of social interaction, have a significant positive effect on knowledge sharing among units that compete with each other for market share, but not among units that compete with each other for internal resources."}, {"e:author": ["Alain Pinsonneault", "Kenneth L.

Data were collected through 73 interviews, a questionnaire, and numerous documents. Four main findings emerged from the case studies. First, IT was found to facilitate organizational downsizing, but not to cause it. New City invested heavily in state-of-the-art IT over the years and more successfully downsized the organization than Old City, which lagged behind in IT investment and made no serious attempts to use IT as a tool to support strategic actions. Second, adverse environmental conditions triggered downsizing in both cities and determined the change strategies that managers used. When environmental pressures were mild (1985-1990), managers favored a convergent change strategy that resulted in limited downsizing efforts and small personnel reductions. In contrast, when environmental pressures were strong (1990-1995), managers of both cities engaged in strategic reorientation and in downsizing efforts that led to larger personnel reductions. Third, the role IT played in organizational downsizing varied according to the change strategy. IT was used to facilitate work redesign in a convergent change strategy and to facilitate more significant structural and work redesign in strategic reorientation. Fourth, more integrated and better use of IT allowed managers of New City to downsize more rationally and efficiently. It facilitated the transfer of personnel within departments, from middle management to the operations level, and across departments, from internally oriented to customer-oriented personnel. In doing so, managers of New City minimized operating costs while maintaining the same level of services. In contrast, IT in Old City did not facilitate such an agenda and managers downsized more superficially across the board, in all departments. Differences in IT consequences in the two cities are explained using the theory of slack resources in organizations."}, {"e:author": ["Marguerite Schneider"], "e:volume": "13", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.13.2.209.531", "e:keyword": ["Leadership", "Stakeholder Theory", "New Business Practices", "Complexity", "Effectiveness"], "e:pages": "209-220", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.13.2.209.531", "e:year": 2002, "e:title": "A Stakeholder Model of Organizational Leadership", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Organizations are evolving from the bureaucratic form based upon hierarchy to the new-form or radix organization that has the value chain as its relatively fluid foundation.

The core premise of this concept is that a proper understanding of effective interunit knowledge sharing in a multiunit firm requires a joint consideration of relatedness in knowledge content among business units and the network of lateral interunit relations that enables task units to access related knowledge. Results from a study of 120 new product development projects in 41 business units of a large multiunit electronics company showed that project teams obtained more existing knowledge from other units and completed their projects faster to the extent that they had short interunit network paths to units that possessed related knowledge. In contrast, neither network connections nor extent of related knowledge alone explained the amount of knowledge obtained and project completion time. The results also showed a contingent effect of having direct interunit relations in knowledge networks: While established direct relations mitigated problems of transferring noncodified knowledge, they were harmful when the knowledge to be transferred was codified, because they were less needed but still involved maintenance costs. These findings suggest that research on knowledge transfers and synergies in multiunit firms should pursue new perspectives that combine the concepts of network connections and relatedness in knowledge content."}, {"e:author": ["Wanda J.

Statistical analysis of questionnaire responses from 110 R&D unit managers show strong association between the dimensions of knowledge and organization structure. It also indicates partial support for the “fit” hypothesis in contingency theory.The paper makes two important contributions to the knowledge management literature. First, we find support for the contingency logic, suggesting that effective organization design has to take into account the underlying characteristics of the firm's knowledge base. Second, we shed light on a relatively neglected dimension of knowledge that we call <i>system embeddedness</i>. This is the extent to which knowledge is a function of the social and physical system in which it exists. In the statistical analysis it emerges as a strong predictor of organization structure. Moreover, it also appears to be conceptually distinct from the tacit-articulate dimension that is normally emphasized.

This conflicted role offers insights into why the phenomenon of organizational knowledge has been interpreted by researchers in multiple and possibly conflicting ways.

Others consider it a latent phenomenon, residing in the possibility for constructing novel organizational actions. This paper argues that while each of these qualities—empirical and latent—are intrinsic to knowledge in organizations, our understanding of organizational phenomena is essentially incomplete until the relationship between them is considered. Building on structuration theory, we propose a complementary perspective that views organizational knowledge as the product of an ongoing and recursive interaction between empirical and latent knowledge, between knowledge as action and knowledge as possibility. We ground this complementary model of knowledge in evidence from the field study of two firms whose innovation practices provide unique insights into how knowledge simultaneously enables and constrains behavior in organizations. We then discuss how a complementary perspective avoids the reification of knowledge by depicting it instead as an ongoing and social process and offers an alternative distinction between individual and collective knowledge."}, {"e:author": ["Steven Postrel"], "e:volume": "13", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.13.3.303.2773", "e:keyword": ["Knowledge", "Specialization", "Integration", "Shared Cognition", "Business Strategy"], "e:pages": "303-320", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.13.3.303.2773", "e:year": 2002, "e:title": "Islands of Shared Knowledge: Specialization and Mutual Understanding in Problem-Solving Teams", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Where should the boundaries of knowledge between economic actors be located in order to maximize the efficiency of their interactions? In particular, what circumstances determine whether it makes sense for adjacent stages in the value chain to invest in the development of common understanding, and when does it make sense for them to operate in mutual ignorance? To address these questions, it is necessary to construct a kind of production function which takes different forms of knowledge—<i>specialist capability and trans-specialist understanding</i>—as inputs and relates them to problem-solving output.Using a simple model of product design as a template, it is possible to derive such a production function. One can then use its properties in conjunction with plausible assumptions about the cost of acquiring different kinds of knowledge to develop general principles that explain when efficiency requires costly learning across specialties and when it is better to allow specialties to operate in mutual ignorance of one another's domains. The derived production function, contrary to some intuition and previous literature, implies that specialist capability can <i>substitute</i> for knowledge shared across specialties. This result in turn implies that the nature of learning costs, rather than the shape of knowledge benefits, plays the predominant role in determining when mutual ignorance is a good idea.The analysis also helps resolve the following paradox: The economy depends for its efficiency upon a drastic separation of knowledge across individuals and organizational units, yet studies of product development find that greater knowledge commonality is associated with better firm performance. An implication of the substitutability of specialized and trans-specialty knowledge is that situations where learning across specialties is desirable seem relatively rare in the economy as a whole. These situations are disproportionately common, however, in those areas where important managerial activity takes place. A key role of management is to attend to the strategic, operational, and governance needs of these “islands of shared knowledge in a sea of mutual ignorance.”"}, {"e:author": ["Akira Takeishi"], "e:volume": "13", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.13.3.321.2779", "e:keyword": ["Knowledge", "Partitioning", "Outsourcing", "Interfirm Division of Labor", "Innovation"], "e:pages": "321-338", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.13.3.321.2779", "e:year": 2002, "e:title": "Knowledge Partitioning in the Interfirm Division of Labor: The Case of Automotive Product Development", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Drawing on an empirical study on automakers' management of supplier involvement in product development in Japan, this paper shows that when the design of a component is outsourced to a supplier, how much automakers know about the component matters for them to gain a better outcome. While the actual tasks of designing and manufacturing components could be out-sourced, automakers should retain the relevant knowledge to obtain better component design quality. The paper argues that knowledge partitioning should be distinguished from task partitioning, and provides some implications for the knowledge-based theory of the firm.The results indicate that effective pattern of knowledge partitioning differs by the nature of component development project in terms of technological newness. For regular projects, it is more important for the automaker to have a higher level of architectural knowledge (how to coordinate various components for a vehicle) than of component-specific knowledge, which is supposed to be provided by the supplier. However, when the project involves new technology for the supplier, it is important for the automaker to have a higher level of component-specific knowledge to solve unexplored engineering problems together with the supplier. In innovative projects, effective knowledge partitioning seems to demand some overlap between an automaker and a supplier, rather than efficient and clear-cut boundaries that are optimal for regular projects. Such “fluid” nature of knowledge boundaries contingent on the project types poses a challenge for firms seeking both technological leadership and efficiency in established products.Developing and maintaining knowledge about an outsourced component is by no means easy. When the actual design tasks are outsourced, automakers miss substantial opportunities to gain relevant knowledge through learning by doing. Also, obtained knowledge may be diffused among competitors through shared suppliers. Another problem for automakers is that component-specific knowledge is important for only limited cases (innovative projects). Even worse, component-specific knowledge has a trade off relationship with architectural knowledge.Such an inherent dilemma of managing knowledge, however, may provide some automakers with the opportunity to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. Additional analysis shows that one automaker managed both types of knowledge better than others in a manner that deals effectively with the dilemma. Its organizational mechanisms include career development policies, extensive documentation of technological information, internal training programs, and incentive schemes. The difficulty in implementing those mechanisms in a consistent and complementary manner seems to explain why there was a significant variance among automakers in knowledge level, even when the actual tasks were carried out by a shared supplier."}, {"e:author": ["Maurizio Zollo", "Sidney G.

The argument is made that dynamic capabilities are shaped by the coevolution of these learning mechanisms.

The relative effectiveness of these capability-building mechanisms is analyzed here as contingent upon selected features of the task to be learned, such as its frequency, homogeneity, and degree of causal ambiguity.

This integration of knowledge typically takes place in groups. In our experimental study, we examine how individuals in groups engage in micro-level interactions to effectively integrate knowledge by examining the effects of using three formal interventions: Information Sharing, Questioning Others, and Managing Time. In particular, we observe that simple formal interventions can improve knowledge integration when they lead to “windows of opportunity” for group members to consider ways to improve their work process that go beyond the formal intervention instructions. The most effective groups used these formal interventions to focus their attention into organized clusters of activity, during which they significantly changed their work process and improved their subsequent knowledge integration. In particular, groups in the Questioning Others and Managing Time conditions exhibited greater knowledge integration than groups in the Information Sharing and Control conditions. Groups with high-knowledge integration paced their attention to both adaptive improvements to their process and task execution. Overall, this study identifies simple structures, interruptions, and time pacing as central to the emerging concept of group flexibility by which members enhance their performance on novel and/or ambiguous tasks.

By integrating different perspectives on firm boundaries, including transaction cost economics, a resource-based view, and an options perspective, we link characteristics of the technology (i.e., uniqueness, barriers to imitation, commercial uncertainty, technological dynamism) to the perceived threat of opportunism, the potential for sustainable advantage, and the pursuit of a licensing agreement vis-à-vis the outright acquisition of the firm that possesses the desired know-how. We use structural equation modeling to analyze 127 sourcing arrangements. Our results show that technological dynamism and barriers to imitation indirectly influence the governance mode decision by increasing the perceived threat of opportunism. Commercial uncertainty directly influences the governance mode and decreases the likelihood of an acquisition vis-à-vis a licensing agreement. Although uniqueness and barriers to imitation are also positively associated with the perceived potential for sustainable advantage, the potential for sustainable advantage had no direct effect on governance mode.

To speed development, tasks often proceed in parallel by relying on preliminary information from other tasks, information that has not yet been finalized. This frequently causes substantial rework using as much as 50% of total engineering capacity. Previous studies have either described coordination as a complex social process, or have focused on the frequency, but not the content, of information exchanges. Through extensive fieldwork in a high-end German automotive manufacturer, we develop a framework of preliminary information that distinguishes information precision and information stability. Information precision refers to the accuracy of the information exchanged. Information stability defines the likelihood of changing a piece of information later in the process.This definition of preliminary information allows us to develop a time-dependent model for managing interdependent tasks, producing two alternative strategies: iterative and set-based coordination. We discuss the trade-offs in choosing a coordination strategy and how they change over time. This allows an organization to match its problem-solving strategy with the interdependence it faces. Set-based coordination requires an absence of ambiguity, and should be emphasized if either starvation costs or the cost of pursuing multiple design alternatives in parallel are low. Iterative coordination should be emphasized if the downstream task faces ambiguity, or if starvation costs are high and iteration (rework) costs are low."}, {"e:author": ["Annette L.

In contrast, translation theory depicts how agents interpret and adapt cultural accounts as they fashion them into legitimating accounts for a local setting. An alternative would theorize accounts that are neither strictly borrowed nor idiosyncratically tailored. We advanced a third perspective, drawing on frame analysis as it is used in social movement theory. Framing theory attends to both the importance of cultural building blocks and the embedded ways in which agents relate to and shape systems of meaning and mobilize collective action to change social arrangements. We find that legitimating accounts are intertwined with the construction of social identities, which serve to legitimate, on the one hand, an account maker's participation in the discourse and set of claims, and on the other hand, the involvement of proponents and crucial audiences. We suggest that the mobilizing potential of legitimating accounts rests in part on their messages becoming “autocommunicational,” so that listeners identify themselves with the message."}, {"e:author": ["William P.

The results confirm that rebuilding cooperation is feasible.

At Bolsa de Valores de Guayaquil, actions that supported the development of the firm's capability to strategize seem to have contributed the most in the initial phase of the strategy formation and implementation; actions that helped the development of the firm's capability to be flexible appear to have contributed the most during the middle phase; and actions that supported the development of the firm's capabilities to integrate and engender trust seem to have contributed the most in the final phase.

If governance choices are discrete, as much of organization theory argues, then the consequent steady-state functionality delivered by these organizational forms is itself discrete. However, if the desired functionality lies in-between the steady-state functionality delivered by two discrete choices, then efficiency gains may be available by modulating between modes. We develop an analytical model of structural modulation and examine factors that influence when modulation is ef- ficiency enhancing, as well as the optimal rate of modulation.

The central question we address is as follows: What must organization(s) be like if change is constitutive of reality? Wishing to highlight the pervasiveness of change in organizations, we talk about organizational becoming. Change, we argue, is the reweaving of actors' webs of beliefs and habits of action to accommodate new experiences obtained through interactions. Insofar as this is an ongoing process, that is to the extent actors try to make sense of and act coherently in the world, change is inherent in human action, and organizations are sites of continuously evolving human action. In this view, organization is a secondary accomplishment, in a double sense. Firstly, organization is the attempt to order the intrinsic flux of human action, to channel it towards certain ends by generalizing and institutionalizing particular cognitive representations. Secondly, organization is a pattern that is constituted, shaped, and emerging from change. Organization aims at stemming change but, in the process of doing so, it is generated by it.

Specifically, several researchers have proposed identity-based models of organizational identification but few have operationalized and tested them. Furthermore, virtually no research has explored how members identify with multiple-identity organizations. This study addresses these gaps and makes three specific contributions to identity theory. First, we operationalize and test a model in which a member's organizational identification is conceptualized in terms of an identity comparison process, i.e., a cognitive comparison between what a member perceives the identity to be and what they think it should be. Second, we extend current thinking by operationalizing organizational identification in terms of multiple and competing identities. Third, as a theory-building exercise, we explore the possibility that a similar identity comparison process operates at the organizational form level of analysis, affecting members' identification with the encompassing form or social institution. We test our model via a survey of members of rural cooperatives—a prototypical ‘hybrid’ identity organizational form, embodying elements of both ‘business’ and ‘family’ identities. Results of the analyses show that organizational identity congruence has a significant effect on member commitment, and form-level identity congruence has significant effects on both cognitive and pragmatic legitimacy, lending support for the use of identity as a multilevel construct. These results provide empirical support for current identity-based models of organizational identification and expand their generalizability to include multiple-identity organizations."}, {"e:author": ["Janice M.

Given the increasing importance of innovation, it is vital to understand more about the alternative mechanism—such as alliances and acquisitions—that can be used to enhance the innovative performance of companies. Most of the literature has dealt with these alternatives as isolated issues. Companies, however, are constantly challenged to choose between acquisitions and strategic alliances, given the limited resources that can be spent on research and development. This paper contributes to the literature because it focuses on the choice between innovation-related alliances and acquisitions. We focus on the question of how the trade-off between strategic alliances and acquisitions is influenced by previous direct and indirect ties between firms in an industry network of interfirm alliances. We formulate hypotheses pertaining to the number of direct ties between two companies, their proximity in the overall alliance network, and their centrality in that network. In so doing, we distinguish between ties that connect firms from the same and from different industry segments, and those that connect firms from the same or from different world regions. These hypotheses are tested on a sample of strategic alliances and acquisitions in the application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) industry. The findings show that a series of strategic alliances between two partners increases the probability that one will ultimately acquire the other. Whereas previous direct contacts tend to lead to an acquisition, this is not true of previous indirect contacts, which increase the probability that a link between the companies, once it is forged, takes the form of a strategic alliance. In the case of acquisitions, firms that are more centrally located in the network of interfirm alliances tend to be acquirers, and firms with a less central position tend to become acquired. These findings underscore the importance of taking previously formed interfirm linkages into account when explaining the choice between strategic alliances and acquisitions, as these existing links influence the transaction costs associated with both alternatives."}, {"e:author": ["Ugo Merlone"], "e:volume": "13", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.13.6.734.500", "e:keyword": ["Teams", "Production and Organization", "Moral Hazard"], "e:pages": "734-736", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.13.6.734.500", "e:year": 2002, "e:title": "Incentives and Computing Systems for Team-Based Organizations: A Mathematical and Economic Analysis", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "This paper provides a mathematical and economic analysis “Incentives and Computing Systems for Team-Based Organizations” by A.

Briefly, trust is a social lubricant that reduces the friction costs of existing trade and/or serves to increase the scope of trade. In contrast to this universalistic view, we posit that the performance of trust-based governance is contingent on the ability of trading partners to “read” each other and learn about counterpart behavior. These information-processing abilities allow firms to assess partner trustworthiness better, which reduces the risk of misplaced trust. The increased efficacy of communication and learning from one another also enables them to better capitalize from the adaptation and revision possibilities uncovered through trust-based governance during the task-execution phase. Given the central role of these cognitive requirements, we assess these contingent effects with data from a knowledge-intensive task setting. Using a sample of 129 firms that have engaged outside contractors on client-sponsored R&D projects, we find strong support for our thesis. Specifically, we find that trust-based governance has a larger positive impact on task performance when the client is more skilled at understanding the outsourced tasks at hand, the task itself requires skills that are relatively more readily taught (less tacit), and the task itself is organized in parallel with work being done at the contractor as well as the client. As a corollary, we also find that firms adopt trust-based governance to a greater extent as these information-processing abilities increase, as well as with the colocation of the contractor and client.

This paper develops and tests a cognitive model of the trust transfer process, arguing that trust is transferred across hypertext links based on the perceived interaction and similarity of the linked organizations, and that institution-based trust is transferred from the traditional shopping channel to a Web-based organization based on evidence that the Web-based organization has a physical store. An experimental study shows that a hypertext link from one website to another increased the extent to which the linked organizations were perceived to have a business relationship and be similar, and these perceptions had a positive influence on trusting beliefs regarding the linked site. Associating with the physical shopping channel by showing a picture of a building on a website increased the extent to which subjects reported intention to buy from the site. The study provided empirical evidence that trusting beliefs regarding the website had a significant positive effect on intention to buy from it.

Our findings indicate that perceived trustworthiness reduces transaction costs and is correlated with greater information sharing in supplier-buyer relationships. Moreover, the findings suggest that the value created for transactors, in terms of lower transaction costs, may be substantial. In particular, we found that the least-trusted automaker spent significantly more of its face-to-face interaction time with suppliers on contracting and haggling when compared to the most trusted automaker. This translated into procurement (transaction) costs that were five times higher for the least trusted automaker. Finally, we argue that trust is unique as a governance mechanism because it not only minimizes transaction costs, but also has a mutually causal relationship with information sharing, which also creates value in the exchange relationship. Other governance mechanisms (e.g., contracts, financial hostages) are necessary costs incurred to prevent opportunistic behavior, but do not create value beyond transaction cost minimization.

Accordingly, “active trust development” is conceptualized as a strategy to strengthen the basis for trust. Empirical evidence is drawn from a survey of 615 Hong Kong firms that manage operations in mainland China.Confidence in China's institutional context was found to have a strong positive association with trust in the local staff working within that context. Active trust development was validated as a means of enhancing trust, though its effect on trust was not as strong as that of perceived institutional effectiveness.Active trust development initiatives are particularly valuable in an environment such as contemporary China, where the institutional foundations for trust remain underdeveloped.

Our analysis demonstrates that the vast majority of observed innovative activity was based on ideas sourced from outside the focal firm, and that innovations diffused very quickly across competing banks. As such, there were no periods during which any bank had proprietary possession of a major product or process innovation. We therefore ask how the banks' innovative activity could affect their relative financial performance positions. We answer this question by developing a set of hypotheses that relate specific features of their histories of innovative activity to their current financial performance. These hypotheses are tested using a detailed data set describing 1,297 modifications made to products and services, distribution technologies, and back-office processes within a sample of Australian retail banks over the sample period. Our results provide support for the general position that establishing an attractive competitive position depends on the specific history of a firm's innovative activity. Banks that undertook more innovative activity, that were more consistent in that activity, and whose composition of activity was somewhat differentiated from the industry norm tended to display superior financial performance. Rather than looking solely for internally generated, inimitable innovations to deliver competitive advantage, these results suggest that active and consistent innovative activity that is somewhat differentiated from competitors can also deliver superior financial performance."}, {"e:author": ["Kelly A.

However, except for some studies of family businesses that lack direct applicability to nonfamily CEO succession, the past studies of succession have not examined the very first succession event in a firm, when the Founder-CEO is replaced, on a large-scale basis. The critical differences between later-stage succession and Founder-CEO succession include the higher level of attachment between Founder-CEOs and the firms they create, the much larger equity holdings of Founder-CEOs (which give them much more control of the firm), the fact that many Founder-CEOs remain in the firm (even though it is being run by their successors), and the fact that nearly all early-stage succession events involve outside successors (in contrast to later-stage succession research, which has focused on the insider-outsider distinction). These differences make it hard to extrapolate from later-stage succession findings to Founder-CEO succession. Therefore, in order to examine Founder-CEO succession, I used field research and grounded theory building to study the factors that should affect Founder-CEO succession in Internet start-ups. I find that there are two central intertemporal events that may affect Founder-CEO succession: The completion of product development and the raising of each round of financing from outside investors. I develop testable hypotheses about how each of these events affect the rate of succession, and then test these hypotheses using an event-history analysis of a unique dataset containing the succession histories of 202 Internet firms.

One isolating mechanism that has been proposed for intangible assets is their accumulation process. The hypothesis is that intangible assets are inherently inimitable because would-be imitators need to replicate the entire accumulation path to achieve the same resource position. Thus, entrants can never catch up to incumbents.An interesting challenge to this hypothesis is counterfactual evidence that entrants sometimes outperform incumbents. Such counterfactual evidence should not exist if the theory is strictly correct. This paper attempts to reconcile resource accumulation theory with the counterfactual evidence. We do so by building an intermediate good-production function for a firm's intangible asset stocks. We test the contribution of the intangible asset stock to the firm's final good-production function and examine the extent to which that asset stock deters rival mobility in the pharmaceutical industry.We find that the asset accumulation process itself cannot deter rivals, because asset stocks reach steady state rather quickly. Entrants can achieve an incumbent's intangible asset stock merely by matching its investment until steady state. Thus, we conclude that the accumulation process per se is not an isolating mechanism.

Prior research has shown that firms tend to have successful IPOs if they go public with the endorsement of a prestigious lead underwriter. This paper examines the antecedents to receiving endorsement by a prestigious underwriter and links this to the experience base of a firm's upper echelon. We theorize that the amount and type of upper echelon experience serve as important symbols of a young firm's legitimacy to critical outsiders. We introduce a typology of upper echelon experience that distinguishes between upper echelon upstream, horizontal, and downstream employment-based affiliations and suggest that these different types of upper echelon affiliations allay different types of endorser concerns regarding firm legitimacy, affecting the endorsement process. Further, we theorize that the relationships between upper echelon experience and investment bank prestige will be moderated by technological uncertainty. We test our assertions on a comprehensive sample of public and private biotechnology firms that were founded between 1961 and 1994 and that went public between 1979 and 1996. Analyses of the five-year career histories of the over 3,200 executives and directors that make up the upper echelons of these firms show that firms with upper echelons with affiliations with prominent downstream organizations (i.e., pharmaceutical and/or healthcare companies) and with prominent horizontal organizations (i.e., biotechnology companies) are more likely to attract the endorsement of a prestigious investment bank. We also find that the greater the range of upper echelon affiliations across the categories of upstream, horizontal, and downstream affiliations, the more prestigious the firm's lead underwriter. We also find that these latter results are moderated by technological uncertainty.

The paper shows how elements of situated learning theory have been selectively adopted to fertilize or extend the established terrain of organizational learning. In this process, we argue, Lave and Wenger's embryonic appreciation of power relations as media of learning is displaced by a managerial preoccupation with harnessing (reified) “communities of practice” to the fulfillment of (reified) corporate objectives.

We also expect that as a firm learns about a technology, it will become more likely to make foreign investments.

We investigate empirical effects in a sample of investments in the memory segment of the semiconductor industry. Our predictions about the curvilinear effect of tacitness are supported.

In the beginning of the 1990s, Oticon became famous for its radical internal hybrid, the “spaghetti organization.” Recent work has interpreted the spaghetti organization as a radical attempt to foster dynamic capabilities by organizational means, neglecting, however, that about a decade later the spaghetti organization has given way to a more traditional matrix organization. In contrast, an organizational economics interpretation of Oticon organizational changes is developed. This lens suggests that a strong liability of the spaghetti organization was the above incentive problem: Frequent managerial meddling with delegated rights led to a severe loss of motivation, and arguably caused the change to a more structured organization.

The premise for this argument is that internal workers may view externalization as an indicator of the organization's low-level commitment to them. Internal workers would reciprocate by decreasing their attachment to the organization. Externalization might also be seen as violating the psychological contract between employees and employers, since externalization is associated with slowed upward mobility and poor work support for internal workers.

To create this deterrent capability, however, firms must enter each others' markets, which is just the kind of action that the deterrent is supposed to limit. This study explores the questions: Under what conditions are firms likely to behave aggressively toward their multimarket rivals by entering their markets and when will they engage in mutual forbearance? We describe how the effect of multimarket contact on the market-entry moves of a firm changes as the level of contact a firm has with its rivals increases. We draw on competitive intelligence and decision-making theory to argue that the competitive advantages associated with multimarket contact are supplemented by the fact that a firm's multimarket competitors serve as a readily available model to reduce the uncertainty associated with market-entry decisions. We hypothesize that these factors lead firms to prefer, up to the point where forbearance concerns become paramount, to enter the markets in which their multipoint rivals already compete. We also argue that once multimarket contact levels reach the point where forbearance begins to operate, these levels also serve to stabilize the structure through better competitive intelligence, with the result that the propensity of a firm to enter into additional markets of its multimarket rivals declines. We then extend multimarket theory by focusing on the role of the CEO. Specifically, we argue that newer and longer-tenured CEOs are likely to face different influences on their preferences for particular competitive actions. We test hypotheses that link the likelihood that CEOs will abide by the mutual interdependencies that their firm's multimarket ties represent to their tenure in the CEO position. Our findings produce support for an inverted-U-shaped relationship between multipoint contact and market entry. We also find evidence that longer-tenured CEOs are guided by their firm's multimarket relationships. Newer CEOs, however, do not seem to adopt a forbearance approach toward their firm's multimarket competitors.Our findings have important implications for multimarket theory. This study is among the first to examine the role of managers within a multimarket context. We show that it is not enough for a firm to be embedded within a multimarket structure, but that for a firm to benefit from its multimarket position, its managers must be aware of this positioning and free of other influences that could cause them to behave in ways that are inconsistent with it. Because our findings show that newer CEOs can direct their firms to act in ways that are inconsistent with their firm's multimarket position, we identify an area of potential competitive vulnerability for the firm."}, {"e:author": ["Vincenzo Perrone", "Akbar Zaheer", "Bill McEvily"], "e:volume": "14", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.14.4.422.17487", "e:keyword": ["Trust", "Role Autonomy", "Organizational Context", "Buyer-Supplier Relationships", "Boundary Spanner"], "e:pages": "422-439", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.14.4.422.17487", "e:year": 2003, "e:title": "Free to Be Trusted?

We argue that, in a buyer-supplier context, purchasing managers will be trusted to a greater extent by supplier representatives when they are free from constraints that limit their ability to interpret their boundary-spanning roles. We conceptualize and measure three key components of role autonomy: Functional influence, tenure, and clan culture. Taken together, these components of role autonomy shape and define the purchasing manager's willingness and capacity to make and uphold commitments to supplier representatives. Role autonomy permits purchasing managers to engage in discretionary behaviors that allow supplier representatives to learn about their underlying motives and intentions. We test hypotheses linking the components of role autonomy to trust on a sample of 119 buyer-supplier relationships. We use a dyadic research design that combines data from purchasing managers and supplier representatives. The results suggest that granting purchasing managers greater autonomy enhances supplier representative trust in purchasing managers. By drawing attention to role autonomy as a feature of organizations that influences trust we highlight the importance of organizational context in contributing to a deeper understanding of trust."}, {"e:author": ["Martin Schulz"], "e:volume": "14", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.14.4.440.17483", "e:keyword": ["Organizational Knowledge", "Organizational Learning", "Knowledge Relevance", "Knowledge Flows", "Knowledge Evolution"], "e:pages": "440-459", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.14.4.440.17483", "e:year": 2003, "e:title": "Pathways of Relevance: Exploring Inflows of Knowledge into Subunits of Multinational Corporations", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "To understand what determines knowledge flows into organizational subunits, the study reported here examines the relevance of the knowledge to the operations performed at the receiving subunit.

We present a critical test for two sets of contrasting predictions. The first draws on similarity attraction, social contact, and social identity theories to suggest that working with racially similar others enhances the work environment in terms of perceived career opportunities, mentoring relationships, and network ties, all of which would increase the likelihood of remaining in an organization. The contrasting predictions draw on group competition and group threat theories and propose that working with racially similar others might increase competition for resources and generate a backlash effect against minorities that would induce their turnover. We suggest the paradox that these two approaches might be compatible if the effect of demographic composition is nonlinear. Our data analyses show that individuals' likelihood of turnover decreases as the proportion of employees in a job from one's <i>own</i> race increases. Furthermore, this relationship is <i>nonlinear</i>: Members of minority groups with very small representation benefited more from the increased presence of their <i>own</i> race than minorities who already had a substantial presence. This finding suggests a potential backlash effect at higher minority proportions. Results also show that turnover decreases as the proportion of employees from one's <i>own</i> race increases in the level <i>above</i> an employee's job. Overall, these findings suggest that working with others of the same race reduces the likelihood of minority exits. Interestingly, the proportion of <i>other</i> minorities in a job has a marginally significant, negative effect on employees' voluntary turnover. Thus, increasing racial diversity from one's own race and other minorities appears to strengthen minority workforce retention."}, {"e:author": ["Stewart Thornhill", "Raphael Amit"], "e:volume": "14", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.14.5.497.16761", "e:keyword": ["Liability of Newness", "Resource-Based View", "Bankruptcy"], "e:pages": "497-509", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.14.5.497.16761", "e:year": 2003, "e:title": "Learning About Failure: Bankruptcy, Firm Age, and the Resource-Based View", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Systematic differences in the determinants of firm failure between firms that fail early in their life and those that fail after having successfully negotiated the early liabilities of newness and adolescence are identified.

This model provides a game-theoretical basis for contingent organizational design by relating empirical observations of real organizations to the solution of a rational choice model based on game theory. We constructed a multiple-player, noncooperative game in which players have full knowledge of, and universal communication access to, each other. These players allocate the scarce resource of their attention among potential interaction partners. It struck us that this game sometimes did and sometimes did not have a “core,” i.e., a confluence of individual optima (Nash equilibrium) that was also optimal for the whole group. Some circumstances allow the best structure to emerge from many individual decisions, whereas other circumstances require the imposition of structured communication channels by a central decision maker. Strong management control of communication structure adds no value in business environments where the game has a “core” i.e., where a centrally imposed optimum would dictate the same communications patterns as those defined by the Nash equilibrium that emerges spontaneously when each participant optimizes locally. Trade in an ideal market is the iconic example of such environments. In our model, other combinations of conditions fail to yield a core, even though a single stable Nash equilibrium always exists. The difference between aggregate effectiveness at the Nash equilibrium and the maximal feasible aggregate effectiveness that could be centrally dictated is the value that management can provide through enforcing the globally optimum communication regime. The predictions of this simple model about the conditions that favor more- or less-structured communications agree surprisingly well with accepted organizational contingency theory. Our simple model thus provides a sound theoretical foundation for many aspects of contingent organizational design."}, {"e:author": ["A. Georges L.

For example, empirical studies suggest that distributed teams experience high levels of conflict. These empirical studies offer rich and valuable descriptions of this conflict, but they do not systematically identify the mechanisms by which conflict is engendered in distributed teams. In this paper, we develop a theory-based explanation of how geographical distribution provokes team-level conflict. We do so by considering the two characteristics that distinguish distributed teams from traditional ones: Namely, we examine how being distant from one's team members and relying on technology to mediate communication and collaborative work impacts team members. Our analysis identifies antecedents to conflict that are unique to distributed teams. We predict that conflict of all types (task, affective, and process) will be detrimental to the performance of distributed teams, a result that is contrary to much research on traditional teams.

This challenge is particularly acute after firms have experienced an environmental change that has shifted the existing competitive landscape and created new, high-performing sets of activity choices. How should firms organize to explore and search such an altered performance landscape? While it has been noted that adaptive entities need to maintain a balance of exploration and exploitation, little is known about how different organizational structures moderate this balance. With the help of an agentbased simulation model, we study the value of three different organizational structures: a centralized organization, in which decisions are made only at the level of the firm as a whole; a decentralized organization, in which decisions are made independently in two divisions; and a temporarily decentralized firm, which starts out with a decentralized structure and later reintegrates.We find that if interactions among a firm's activities are pervasive, neither the centralized nor the permanently decentralized organizational structure leads to high performance. In this case, temporary decentralization—an organizational structure that has not found much attention in the literature—yields the highest long-term performance. This organizational structure allows the firm both to avoid low-performing activity configurations and to eventually coordinate across its divisions. Thus, even if the decision problem a .rm faces is not fully decomposable, a temporary bifurcation can lead to a higher long-term performance outcome. Initial decentralized exploration is, however, costly in the short run, as compared to centralized exploration. As a result, a tradeoff exists between the short-term costs of decentralized exploration and the longterm benefits of reaching higher performance. As interactions across and within divisions increase, the optimal length of decentralized exploration tends to grow.Paralleling our first result, we further show that even if a decision problem is decomposable, that is, can be perfectly modularized, it can be beneficial to create a temporary decision allocation that creates \"unnecessary\" interdependencies across the subsystems. This benefit arises in particular when the modules are complex by themselves. In both cases, an initial phase of exploration, enabled by an appropriate organizational structure, followed by refinement and coordination, enabled by a different structure, leads to high performance. To illustrate our general model, we focus on incumbent firms' responses to the Internet and discuss implications for the product design process."}, {"e:author": ["Carl F. Fey", "Daniel R.

The results indicate that founders' participation in the top management team and managers' past experience in the industry contribute to the competence of the team in seizing new growth opportunities. The results also show that, because of conflict effects, the positive effect of founders' participation in the management team on the rate of growth weakens as either the shared team-specific experience or industry-specific managerial experience in the team increases. For practitioners, the most important implication is that for sustained growth, entrepreneurial firms should learn to balance different levels of managerial experience in the top management team.

Although the “quality enthusiasts” discourse often reflects managers' “rhetoric of success” described by Zbaracki (1998) about the implementation of total quality programs, this rhetoric is not shared by the other respondent categories. Hence, this research project contributes to a better understanding of how institutional pressures, which create “isomorphic” organizations by leading them to adopt identical management models, are reinterpreted, renegotiated, and modified within organizations. The proposed typology casts doubt on the mechanistic, consensual, and monolithic view of the ISO 9000 system that underlies most of the work on this theme. In particular, this study demonstrates the relevance of adopting both the institutionalist and critical approaches in efforts to explain the respondents' opinions. In so doing, the personnel's support for the ISO 9000 system and the certification process can then be analyzed from different angles. This certification process would ultimately appear to be a rite of passage that gives rise to various strategies that depend on the respondents' category and their support for the standard."}, {"e:author": ["Elizabeth Eve Umphress", "Giuseppe (Joe) Labianca", "Daniel J.

If knowledge becomes completely embodied in technology, transfer across shifts should be complete since both shifts use the same technology. Methods that can be used for studying intra-plant transfer of knowledge are presented. The methods are illustrated by analyzing data from a plant that began production with one shift and then added a second shift several months into the production program. Three aspects of transfer are analyzed: (1) carry forward of knowledge when the plant makes the transition from one to two shifts, (2) transfer across shifts after both shifts are operating, and (3) transfer across time. Results indicate that substantial, but less than complete, transfer of knowledge occurred when the second shift was introduced. Once both shifts were operating, partial transfer across them occurred.

Four constructs related to organizational learning (knowledge acquisition, information distribution, information interpretation, and organizational memory) are articulated, and the literatures related to each are described and critiqued.The literature on <i>knowledge acquisition</i> is voluminous and multi-faceted, and so the knowledge acquisition construct is portrayed here as consisting of five subconstructs or subprocesses: (1) drawing on knowledge available at the organization's birth, (2) learning from experience, (3) learning by observing other organizations, (4) grafting on to itself components that possess knowledge needed but not possessed by the organization, and (5) noticing or searching for information about the organization's environment and performance. Examination of the related literatures indicates that much has been learned about learning from experience, but also that there is a lack of cumulative work and a lack of integration of work from different research groups. Similarly, much has been learned about organizational search, but there is a lack of conceptual work, and there is a lack of both cumulative work and syntheses with which to create a more mature literature. Congenital learning, vicarious learning, and grafting are information acquisition subprocesses about which relatively little has been learned.The literature concerning <i>information distribution</i> is rich and mature, but an aspect of information distribution that is central to an organization's benefitting from its learning, namely how units that possess information and units that need this information can find each other quickly and with a high likelihood, is unexplored. <i>Information interpretation</i>, as an organizational process, rather than an individual process, requires empirical work for further advancement. <i>Organizational memory</i> is much in need of systematic investigation, particularly by those whose special concerns are improving organizational learning and decision making."}, {"e:author": ["Harrison M.

Hypothesized linkages are advanced between nine elements of cultural leadership—drawn from the literature on charisma—and its consequences. The predictions made are derived from a synthesis of existing theory and insights gained from descriptions of leadership in the scholarly and popular literatures. Both descriptions and theoretical considerations suggest that, while cultural innovation and maintenance leadership differs in some ways, the behaviors of effective cultural leaders do not.

The official culture (crime-fighting command bureaucracy) was examined as an arbitrary set of symbols and meaning structures arranged according to top management preferences. Using qualitative and quantitative data, the organization's subcultures were profiled. It was demonstrated that top management was unable to impose organization-wide conformance with the official culture. There was close conformance to the official culture in only one of five distinct clusters of officers (“crime-fighting commandoes,” 21 percent of the sample). Officers in the other clusters (“crime-fighting street professionals,” “peace-keeping moral entrepreneurs,” “ass-covering legalists,” and “anti-military social workers”) substantially modified or rejected top management's dictates.

Two mechanisms were proposed for achieving greater convergence: (1) more frequent communication and (2) the use of richer communication channels. Here, convergence represents the degree of mutual understanding between the technology providers and the other business personnel about the firm's business activities and the importance of the technology in supporting those activities.Frequency of communication indicated the degree to which the technology providers and the business personnel had communication contact, while richness of communication was determined by the type of communication channel used. These means of communication ranged from face to face, computer mediated, to written channels of communication. The convergence construct was operationalized in terms of the value chain framework where 14 business activities (primary and secondary to the value chain) were identified. Convergence thus represents the degree of mutual understanding between the technology providers and the business personnel regarding the importance of these business activities and the importance of the technology in supporting these activities. Innovativeness was determined through expert evaluation of information technology innovativeness.This research was conducted in two United States divisions of a large multinational firm. The units of analyses for the research constructs were the departments in these two divisions. The constructs were measured over five periods of data collection so that longitudinal, causal analysis techniques (cross-lagged correlations and path analysis) were used to investigate the research model.The following results were obtained: (1) convergence was found to be a predictor of innovativeness, (2) communication richness was a predictor of convergence, and (3) communication frequency was a predictor of both convergence and communication richness. This study provided two important extensions to the often-studied relationship between communication behaviors and innovativeness. First, this research showed empirically that the richness of communication influences innovativeness and, in fact, may be the more relevant predictor variable. Secondly, this research showed that convergence is an important intervening construct in the communication activity/innovativeness relationship. Interestingly, the research model only suggested a causal relationship for convergence on the importance of the primary business activities. Thus, the intent of this study to examine the proposition that frequent and rich communication exchanges produce a convergence in understanding among technology providers and users and, that this convergence directly promotes organizational innovativeness was supported."}, {"e:author": ["Alan D.

In this paper we argue that firms can use employment and compensation practices to foster innovation and support for innovation by employees. Conversely, some employment and compensation systems will inhibit innovation.A system that allows gain sharing by employees and provides employment assurance will foster innovation in the firm. However, a system that compensates employees with a fixed wage and allows for termination at will contains anti-innovative incentives. The former system is the prototypical Japanese system (particularly in large firms), while the latter system is the prototypical American system.The commercial success of Japanese firms is increasingly attributed to successful innovation, particularly in processes. We argue that this success is partly attributable to the Japanese-style system of employment and compensation.None of this suggests, however, that the Japanese-style practices constitute a universally superior system of employment and compensation. The Japanese-style system will not necessarily be beneficial to firms, nor be preferred by employees. The preferences of both employees and firms will depend upon market circumstances.In stable domestic markets in relatively full employment economies, companies derive competitive advantage from mass production and scale economies. Under such circumstances, the American-style system is likely to be preferred by both employees and firms. However, when the firm operates in a volatile international market the preferences of both employees and firms will shift toward the Japanese-style system.

In this paper we describe and contrast three views of organizational politics (functionalist, interpretive and radical) according to their differing structures, processes and outcomes. Each view, or lens, directs attention to some aspects of politics and away from others, and each has strengths and weaknesses embedded in it. In order to assess whether multiple perspectives on politics can be fruitfully applied simultaneously, we describe and analyze a case of a hospital administration engaged in budgeting games and illusion making.The data for the case were collected using naturalistic inquiry and multiple methods including structured and unstructured interviews, review of documents, observation of meetings and casual interaction facilitated by frequent visits over a ten-month period.The case revolves around the hospital administrators' attempts to deal with what they termed a “disastrous deficit” and the most serious financial situation in the hospital's history. Strategies for dealing with the funding agency and board of directors included the management of meaning and communications about the term “deficit.” The three perspectives on organizational politics highlight different dynamics in the case.The interpretive perspective on politics assumes that parties exert influence by constructing the meaning of what others experience. Focusing on a deeper structure of power, the elements of politics which become highlighted are the use of language, information, metaphor, symbols, myths and humor. In the hospital case the administration managed meaning so that others believed that the hospital faced a significant deficit. The creation of illusions of financial crisis through use of linguistic games was supported by symbolic gestures, jokes, hit lists and other reality construction strategies.The functionalist perspective on politics is broken into two subsets, the rational and the pluralist. In this case the rationalist perspective was not operating to any great extent. Every effort was made to avoid both data-based debate or resolution of differences through the use of appeal to authority. The functionalist perspective does highlight the possible reasons for the extensive use of information manipulation by identifying the key players in the game and the bases of power they utilize.The radical perspective directs attention to the larger context of the case and asks at a deeper level why the Ministry of Health, Board of Directors and top administration are engaged in such game playing. Analysis of the political policy context of health care is suggested through this perspective.The analysis of the case using multiple perspectives reveals that a unidimensional critique is almost always going to be flawed. A richer understanding comes from the simultaneous use of all the perspectives. The question of a possible integration of perspectives is raised, and five possible approaches are briefly explored. The value for managers in the use of multiple perspectives lies in increasing their ability to understand and diagnose organizational events. Explicit use of more than one lens on politics heightens understanding of the dynamics and context of the situation and provides more options for action."}, {"e:author": ["W.

Although knowledge stocks in the different loci accumulate over time in day-to-day firm activities, empirical results suggest that the individual is the primary repository of innovative capability and that experience working together in teams has a secondary influence on productivity. Contrary to prior learning curve research, accumulated firm experience has no direct effect on productivity. However, when individuals possess relevant domain knowledge and have experience working together, they benefit from knowledge spillovers within the firm. This suggests that knowledge stocks in the different loci are complementary to one another and that the comingling of these disparate bins of knowledge is an important facet of innovative capability."}, {"e:author": ["Gurneeta Vasudeva"], "e:volume": "24", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2013.0822", "e:keyword": ["Government", "Norms", "Professionalization", "Social responsibility", "Sovereign wealth funds", "International investments"], "e:pages": "1662-1682", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.2013.0822", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Weaving Together the Normative and Regulative Roles of Government: How the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund’s Responsible Conduct Is Shaping Firms’ Cross-Border Investments", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Based on institutional theory, I extend research on the regulative role of national government in society and suggest that government exerts important influences on firms’ actions through the diffusion of norms.

Employing a quasi-natural experiment, I find that focal Norwegian firms are more likely to make responsible cross-border investments following the formation of the Council on Ethics in 2004 and its associated censorship announcements. Further, I find that the normative pressure for responsible investments is mediated by firms’ imitation or overlap with the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund’s investments. However, the mediated effect of normative pressure on responsible investments becomes weaker for government-owned firms. These findings highlight the importance of normative mechanisms through which government can influence firms’ behavior, especially in contexts where regulatory authority may not hold.

We test this theory using a 29-year panel data set on the exit of private venture capital firms. Our results indicate that observational learning does influence imitation in firm exit decisions, and they also suggest that a common belief—that uncertainty enhances imitation—does not apply to all types of uncertainty. Specifically, we find that uncertainty fosters imitation only when it is idiosyncratic to the firm; uncertainties that are common to all firms, in contrast, actually reduce reliance on observational learning. By decomposing uncertainty into different types and explicating their effects on imitation, we demonstrate that this relationship is more nuanced than previously assumed and, in addition, highlight the role of deliberate information processing in imitation."}, {"e:author": ["Daniel W.

As a consequence, few studies have been able to directly examine how contextual factors shape the accumulation of this relational asset or define its value in application. We directly measure the value of relationships between suppliers and a large buyer, using the buyer’s choices in Internet-enabled procurement auctions to estimate the degree to which stronger relationship histories with suppliers increase willingness to pay for high-volume commodity-like parts. Our setting also allows us to examine how this willingness to pay for relationships is shaped by the social context in which they develop and by the exchange context in which they are subsequently deployed, while minimizing the confounding influence any private individual interests have on the choice of exchange partners. Our empirical analysis suggests that, even for commodity parts, prior repeated exchange between firms constitutes a valuable relational asset.

This presents a puzzle that extant theories on institutions and reputations cannot fully explain. To solve this puzzle, we turn to the characteristics of the community in which the banks operate. We develop theory on how communities with diverse affiliation structures and economic inequality have weaker community cohesion and communication, making such communities less likely to experience widespread distrust and hence bank runs. We test hypotheses on the effects of community ethnic diversity, national origin diversity, religious diversity, and wealth inequality using data from the great bank panic of 1893, and we find strong community effects on bank runs.

We also predict that individuals who hold similar beliefs about their relationship with the organization will be more likely to nominate similar coworkers as friends or as influential in the organization, and that ideological contract similarity may provide a more compelling rationale for influence nomination than transactional or relational contract similarity.

Others argue that the penalty for category-spanning stems from the fact that those who do not focus their efforts narrowly tend to offer products that are of lower quality. Because these two mechanisms often co-occur, it has been difficult to provide definitive evidence of the perceptually driven component of the multiple-category penalty. We employ a natural experiment on a peer-to-peer crowd-funding website to address this gap.

Such coexistence, however, creates contradictions that must be managed. Here, I use microfinance as a strategic setting and gain analytic leverage from the random assignment across branches of loan officers who exhibit significant heterogeneity in rule enforcement styles: some enforce rules strictly, whereas others frequently bend them to respond to client needs. I find that loan officers with relational styles exercise discretion productively to enhance organizational performance. Yet their effectiveness is contingent on the presence of rule-enforcing peers, as evidenced by the significant underperformance of branches with a high concentration of officers of either type. In contrast, branches that contain discretionary diversity, or a balance between enforcement styles, perform best. This is not due to diversity per se, but because loan officers process decisions in local credit committees. Committees that contain discretionary diversity generate a productive tension that induces participants to justify decisions along broader organizational goals, thus maintaining a productive balance between standardization and flexibility.

Second, we propose that, in cases where the individual expects the nonbreaching firm to intervene and rectify the other firm’s breach as part of a regulatory obligation, there are direct and moderating effects of meeting (or failing to meet) these perceived obligations.

First, we examine how firm characteristics reflecting dependence on the government—including private versus state ownership, executives serving on political councils, political legacy, and financial resources—affect the likelihood of firms issuing CSR reports. Second, we focus on the symbolic nature of CSR reporting and how variance in the risk of government monitoring through channels such as bureaucratic embeddedness and regional government institutional development influences the extent to which CSR communications are symbolically decoupled from substantive CSR activities. Our database includes all CSR reports issued by the approximately 1,600 publicly listed Chinese firms between 2006 and 2009. Our hypotheses are generally supported. The political perspective we develop contributes to organizational theory by showing that (a) government signaling is an important mechanism of political influence, (b) different types of dependency on the government expose firms to different types of legitimacy pressure, and (c) firms face a decoupling risk that makes them more likely to enact substantive CSR actions in situations in which they are likely to be monitored."}, {"e:author": ["Priti Pradhan Shah", "John P.

This relationship is moderated by the house’s inward centrality in a network of personnel mobility stemming from hiring competitors’ employees, the tenure of its creative directors, the accomplishments of these directors, and the house’s status.

When they frame the issues strategically, their egocentric advice network consists of contacts they perceive to have more expertise and material resources. When they frame the issues politically, their egocentric advice network comprises contacts they perceive to have more influence and to be more trustworthy.

The findings show that consumers assign higher ratings to restaurants regarded as authentic, even after controlling for restaurant quality in several ways.

Study 2 reinforces these findings using an experimental design in which participants were presented with photos and minimal descriptions of fictitious restaurants and then asked to evaluate the likely authenticity, quality, and overall value of the restaurants in a predetermined sequence. Central to both studies is an authenticity scale that was developed through the use of an online survey that ascertains the specific language used by individuals in referencing authenticity in the restaurant domain.

We find that liberalization significantly affects and alters the relative importance of firm, industry, and group effects. Firm effects are always important, whether in a command and control regime, with benefits accruing from protectionism and political rent seeking, or in liberalized periods where firm-specific capabilities and dynamic efficiencies are valued. Industry effects are significant in the command and control regime, when mandatory sector placement benefits firms in industries with superior profits, and in the liberalized period, when the choice of the industry segment in which to operate is open to firms.

I contribute to this literature by theorizing about and empirically testing for such conditions. In particular, using data from the U.S. automobile industry spanning 1890 to 1986, I find evidence that spinouts are associated with enhanced parent performance when they increase the parent’s corporate coherence either through (a) the core competencies and capabilities domain by refocusing the parent’s resources on the core or (b) the cognitive path by resolving a conflict at the top level of the parent’s hierarchy.

Group polarization theory then suggests that when outside directors on average tend to support relatively high (low) CEO compensation prior to board discussions, they will support even higher (lower) focal CEO compensation after the discussions. In addition, this study proposes three important moderators of the group polarization effect. Specifically, (1) demographic homogeneity among outside directors and (2) the similarity of the minority’s prior decision context are proposed to weaken the group polarization effect, whereas (3) outside directors’ power relative to inside directors is predicted to strengthen it.

In this paper we examine how identification with particular social foci within organizations influences the propensity of advice-seeking ties to crosscut the boundaries of organizational subunits. We propose and test a theory of relationship formation based on the strength of organizational members’ identification with social foci. We expect that advice relations of organizational members identifying more strongly with local foci (organizational subunits) will be more likely to be contained within their boundaries. By contrast, we expect that advice relations of organizational members identifying more strongly with a global focus (the organization as a whole) will be more likely to crosscut the boundaries defined around local foci. We test these hypotheses on data we collected on advice-seeking relations among members of the top management team in an industrial multiunit group that comprises five distinct subsidiary companies. Results show that identification with social foci affects the formation of crosscutting network ties over and above the effect of the formal organizational boundaries that encircle the foci. More specifically, we find that organizational members who identify strongly with local foci (subsidiaries, in our case) tend to seek advice within such local foci, whereas organizational members who identify strongly with a global focus (corporate, in our case) tend to be sources of advice across the boundaries of the local foci in which they participate. Cross-boundary advice ties are less likely to occur among managers who identify strongly with their subsidiaries but weakly with the corporate group. As a consequence, identification with local foci constrains knowledge transfer relations within the boundaries of such foci. On the contrary, cross-boundary advice ties are more likely to occur among managers who identify strongly with the corporate group but weakly with their subsidiary.

Whereas extant theory on the origin of classificatory schemas emphasizes the role of agency, results from the model suggest that classificatory schemas can emerge somewhat unintentionally as practices diffuse.

Building on Penrose’s typology [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">Penrose E (2009)</xref> <i>The Theory of the Growth of the Firm</i>, 4th ed.

The analysis reveals the critical importance of separability, i.e., whether a supervisor can separately observe the outcomes of entrepreneurial and managerial services. If managers and their supervisor have symmetric information about separability, hiring a generalist dominates because managerial services, which are easier to assess, reduce the scope for opportunism associated with entrepreneurial services, which are harder to assess. Conversely, if managers have better information regarding separability and the probability of separability is low, hiring specialists dominates because hiring a generalist allows the potential for opportunism associated with entrepreneurial services to contaminate the provision of managerial services.

Drawing on theories of proactive creativity and innovation, we argue that these underground R&D efforts help individuals to develop innovations based on the exploration of uncharted territory and delayed assessment of embryonic ideas. After carefully assessing the direction of causality, we find that individuals’ bootleg efforts are associated with achievement of high levels of innovative performance. Furthermore, we show that the costs and benefits of bootlegging for innovation are contingent on the emphasis on the enforcement of organizational norms in the individual’s work environment; we argue and demonstrate empirically that the benefits of an individual’s bootlegging efforts are enhanced in work units with high levels of innovative performance and which include members who are also engaged in bootlegging. However, during periods of organizational change involving formalization of the R&D process, individuals who increase their bootlegging activities are less likely to innovate.

The case study demonstrates how spatial practices of appropriation, reappropriation, and disappropriation intersect with and inform what we call “spatial legacies” that function to establish or repair an alignment between organizational space and legitimacy. Spatial practices of appropriation and reappropriation build and manipulate spatial legacies, whereas spatial practices of disappropriation attempt to break away from such legacies. Appropriation and reappropriation involve managing spatial legacies to maintain the alignment between organizational space and legitimacy claims. Disappropriation involves trying to erase or alter these legacies to realign the space to changing legitimacy claims. This research adds to the literature on sociomateriality by adopting a longitudinal perspective that highlights legacies as nondeterministic outcomes of past imbrications of the social and the material, to research on legitimacy by conceptualizing it as a sociomaterial construction, and to research on organizational spaces by revealing the institutional underpinnings of spatial transformations.

We build a formal model of a vertical relationship between two parties that endogenizes the choice of the minimum performance necessary for continuation as a function of the values of contractibles, noncontractibles, and outside options. The model highlights a basic trade-off between providing strong incentives for the present (incentive effect) and safeguarding relationships for the future (termination effect). The stable relationships that follow from a more forgiving contract are more important under certain conditions (when a lot of value is jointly created by exchange partners, i.e., high contractible value, high noncontractible value, or unattractive outside options); however, strong incentives from a less forgiving contract are more important under other conditions (when a formal contract is insufficient and a relational contract is most important, i.e., high noncontractible relative to contractible value).

We thus predict that both the speed of learning and the experience threshold are higher in internal development than they are in licensing; the speed of learning and experience threshold in joint development fall in between. This means that the potential for improved performance through experiential learning should be greatest with internal development, moderate with joint development, and rather limited in licensing.

We do so by tracking all the start-up biotechnology firms founded to commercialize the then-emergent recombinant DNA technology (the sample of initial knowledge brokers) together with a contemporaneously founded sample of biotechnology firms that did not license the DNA technology (the sample of initial nonbrokers). Our results suggest that (a) ongoing knowledge brokering has an inverted U-shaped relationship with innovative performance in general; (b) initial knowledge brokers have a positive imprinting effect on their organizations’ search patterns over time, resulting in superior performance relative to nonbrokers; and (c) initial nonbrokers rely more on external channels of sourcing knowledge, such as hiring technical staff, relative to initial brokers, reinforcing the imprinting interpretation.

Results also suggest that higher levels of average organizational tenure of the TMT will modestly attenuate this negative effect.

On close examination (both qualitative and quantitative), we find that high concentration in the center of the market is not sufficient to generate a partition. Rather, we see a long delay between the heightening of concentration in the industry and the emergence of a cluster of peripheral producers that claim an identity in opposition to the dominant generalists. We explain the source of the delay as a function of the nature of the audience, which until recently did not regard conglomerate or foreign ownership of distilleries as an impediment to producing authentic whisky. Only when critics started to question how ownership of distilleries related to authenticity did the revival of the traditional form of ownership begin to occur. By analyzing entries of focused firms in the recent period, we find that widespread ownership of distilleries of diversified corporations (but not foreign ownership) supported the formation of more traditional types of whisky distillers. But endurance of identity-based resource partitioning might require development of a collective identity and collective strategy by producers. In the case we studied, each focused producer has an idiosyncratic identity, which may be insufficient to cause audiences to agree on a code that excludes the mainstream producers from membership in the new category and thereby maintain a partitioned market."}, {"e:author": ["Andrew P.

In the first half of the team’s life, when team members are relatively task-focused, I argue that team positive mood (i.e., a positively valenced affective state shared by team members at a given point in time) stimulates, whereas team negative mood (i.e., a negatively valenced affective state shared by team members) suppresses, exploratory search. At the temporal midpoint, however, when team members’ focus on performance heightens, team positive mood acts as a shutoff switch for search, leading to a decline in exploratory search over the second half of the team’s life. Team negative mood at the midpoint, on the other hand, leads team members to persist in exploratory search, even as a deadline draws near. A team’s trajectory of exploratory search over time, I propose, influences team performance such that it is highest when teams engage in high exploratory search early in the team’s life and decline in exploratory search over the second half of the team’s life.

First, inventors who join a spinout increase the extent of exploration in their inventive activities. Second, they decrease the extent to which they rely on the parent organization’s knowledge. Third, because long-tenured employees, through socialization, tend to progressively adopt more exploitative behavior than short-tenured members, they benefit relatively more from the spinout experience. These results are robust to several econometric specifications that try to account for the endogeneity of the inventors’ decision to join the spinout, for the fact that spinouts’ inventive activity may be intrinsically different from that of the parent company, and for the possible presence of novel external stimuli for those who join spinouts.

Here we define open collaboration (OC), the underlying set of principles, and propose that it is a robust engine for innovation and production. First, we review multiple OC ventures and identify four defining principles. In all instances, participants create goods and services of economic value, they exchange and reuse each other’s work, they labor purposefully with just loose coordination, and they permit anyone to contribute and consume. These principles distinguish OC from other organizational forms, such as firms or cooperatives. Next, we turn to performance. To understand the performance of OC, we develop a computational model, combining innovation theory with recent evidence on human cooperation. We identify and investigate three elements that affect performance: the cooperativeness of participants, the diversity of their needs, and the degree to which the goods are rival (subtractable). Through computational experiments, we find that OC performs well even in seemingly harsh environments: when cooperators are a minority, free riders are present, diversity is lacking, or goods are rival. We conclude that OC is viable and likely to expand into new domains. The findings also inform the discussion on new organizational forms, collaborative and communal."}, {"e:author": ["Emilie R.

The central tension considered in this work is that the historical presence of a firm’s legacy business should simultaneously make that unit very interdependent with the company’s remaining operations and make the firm’s managers highly likely to take those same interdependencies for granted. Consistent with these predictions, the post-divestiture operating performance of firms that divest their legacy businesses falls short of that of firms that retain comparable legacy units, especially when the divested unit operates in the same industry as others of the divesting firm’s businesses. Newer chief executive officers (CEOs) are more likely to undertake legacy divestitures than their longer-tenured peers, and the most recently appointed CEOs undertake the most costly legacy divestitures. In summary, this paper provides insights into how historical interdependencies create value in diversified firms, as well as the decision-making processes that managers follow in overseeing these companies."}, {"e:author": ["Eugene Kang", "Mark Kroll"], "e:volume": "25", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2013.0874", "e:keyword": ["Corporate governance", "Boards of directors", "Corporate elite", "Directorial labor market", "Executive entrenchment"], "e:pages": "1662-1683", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.2013.0874", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Deciding Who Will Rule: Examining the Influence of Outside Noncore Directors on Executive Entrenchment", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "We examine the contingencies that sway independent noncore directors of S&P 500 firms to heed the norms of the corporate elite or the disciplining forces of the efficient directorial labor market in the context of executive entrenchment.

However, the positive association is moderated by contextual factors that influence whether these directors reflect the expectations of the corporate elite or the efficient directorial labor market.

What has not been explored, despite its significance for strategic action, is whether (and if so, why) incumbent, diversifying, and de novo firms might invest differently across variants of a new technology through a discontinuity. This paper uses unique quantitative, archival, and interview data on the investment choices of incumbent, diversifying, and de novo firms around three variants of biotechnology—small-molecule, large-molecule and gene therapy drugs—to show there are differences in investment choices across groups of firms and to suggest that these can be explained through differences in volatility of outcomes across variants. When volatility in product performance generates volatility in firm-level outcomes, de novo firms can cap negative consequences through bankruptcy, an alternative that is extremely costly for established firms (whether incumbent or diversifying), given their complex corporate structure. By keeping indirect bankruptcy costs low, de novo firms’ simple corporate structure allows them to extract option value from volatility, making established versus de novo firms the key groups for analysis of investment choices, not incumbent versus entrant firms. This article thus identifies the interaction between a technological investment’s volatility and de novo firms’ simple corporate structure as the explanatory variable for the observed investment differences.

All six teams crafted three types of representations: stories, metaphors, and prototypes. However, merely using representations did not ensure a shared repertoire and concept coherence—a common understanding of desired product attributes. Teams that failed to consistently engage in three practices—(1) collective scrutiny of representations, (2) linking representations to design constraints, and (3) active editing of representations—produced concept disunity, with disparate understandings of desired product attributes.

Thus, we investigated the possibility (hitherto neglected in the network literature) that biases in friendship networks are triggered not just by the complexity of social relationships but also by the gender of those being perceived. Study 1 showed that, after controlling for actual network positions, men, relative to women, were perceived to occupy agentic brokerage roles in the friendship network—those roles involving less constraint and higher betweenness and outdegree centrality. Study 2 showed that if a team member misperceived a woman to occupy such roles, the woman was seen as competent but not warm. Furthermore, to the extent that gender stereotypes were endorsed by many individuals in the team, women performed worse on their individual tasks. But teams in which members fell back on well-rehearsed perceptions of gender roles (men rather than women misperceived as brokers) performed better than teams in which members tended toward misperceiving women occupying agentic brokerage roles.

Our model is the first to provide an integrative account of how vision communication may stimulate the pursuit of the vision by individuals and collectives, and it complements and extends prior research in three important ways. First, in contrast to an earlier emphasis on the role of individual perceptions of the <i>current</i> self, our model puts perceptions of the <i>future</i> self at the forefront. It captures how vision communication can invite social <i>sharedness</i> of these perceptions, thus doing justice to visions’ nature as images of a future for the <i>collective</i>. Second, in contrast to earlier work on vision communication focusing on general indicators of leadership effectiveness, our model puts what is arguably the most important outcome for vision communication center stage: vision pursuit, the followers’ actions aimed at making the vision reality. We argue that the creation of collective possible selves by followers is crucial for vision communication because collective possible selves explain how vision communication relates to vision pursuit. Third, our model also addresses aspects of vision communication that may facilitate the processes through which visions become internalized as possible selves, and it captures the processes through which such possible selves become shared among members of a collective and lead to collective vision pursuit."}, {"e:author": ["Mooweon Rhee", "Tohyun Kim"], "e:volume": "26", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2013.0892", "e:keyword": ["Early success trap", "Exploration–exploitation", "Organizational learning", "Organizational evolution"], "e:pages": "180-197", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.2013.0892", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Great Vessels Take a Long Time to Mature: Early Success Traps and Competences in Exploitation and Exploration", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "This study warns organizations against falling into an “early success trap.” The timing of initial success may lead organizations to divergent evolutionary paths as their experience at early ages has a greater consequence for their evolution than does their experience at later ages.

To investigate the consequences of the timing of success, we developed a model of organizational learning and adaptation that examines what happens after success, when a success trap occurs, and whether and how the timing of initial success matters. The results from the simulation of our model indicate that the phenomenon of (early) success traps is a complex product of interactions among organizational learning of competences in exploitation and exploration and adaptations of historical and social aspiration levels.

Based on a qualitative study of distributed collaboration in two contexts—an organization effectively coordinating work across two continents and a pair of scientists working together to develop a new theory—we examine how writing supports dialogue, and thus collaboration, among distant partners. Our analysis of the correspondences exchanged in these two historical distributed collaborations identifies four mechanisms of writing—objectifying, contextualizing, specifying, and reflecting—and shows how they support dialogue and so address the dialogical challenges involved in distributed collaboration.

Technology ecosystems require stability and homogeneity to leverage common investments in standard components, but they also need variability and heterogeneity to meet evolving market demand. Although the required balance between stability and evolvability in the ecosystem has been addressed conceptually in the literature, we have less understanding of its underlying mechanics or appropriate governance. Through an extensive case study of a business software ecosystem consisting of a major multinational manufacturer of enterprise resource planning software at the core and a heterogeneous system of independent implementation partners and solution developers on the periphery, our research identifies three salient tensions that characterize the ecosystem: standard–variety, control–autonomy, and collective–individual. We then highlight the specific ecosystem governance mechanisms designed to simultaneously manage desirable and undesirable variance across each tension. Paradoxical tensions may manifest as dualities, where tensions are framed as complementary and mutually enabling. Alternatively, they may manifest as dualisms, where actors are faced with contradictory and disabling “either…or” decisions. We identify conditions where latent, complementary tensions become manifest as salient, contradictory tensions. By identifying conditions in which complementary logics are overshadowed by contradictory logics, our study further contributes to the understanding of the dynamics of technology ecosystems, as well as the effective design of technology ecosystem governance that can explicitly embrace paradoxical tensions toward generative outcomes."}, {"e:author": ["Kristin Smith-Crowe", "Danielle E.

Nonetheless, multipartner alliances do benefit from built-in stabilizing third-party ties that mitigate opportunism and conflict between partner pairs. Previous empirical research on multipartner alliance stability has been inconclusive. We shed some light on these inconsistencies by recognizing that within multipartner alliances, schisms can occur not only between a pair of partners but also between subgroups of partners that are divided by faultlines. We suggest that divisive faultlines can form between subgroups of partners within a multipartner alliance as a function of their prior experience with one another. When a subgroup of alliance partners has relatively strong ties to each other and weak ties to other partners, destabilizing factions can develop that hamper reciprocity among the partners. Using a longitudinal analysis of 59 multipartner alliances, we found that, in general, faultlines (as modeled by the dispersion of tie strength within multipartner alliances) increase the hazard of unplanned dissolutions. We also found that multipartner alliances comprising a mix of centrally and peripherally positioned partners within the industry network were less apt to suffer the effects of divisive faultlines. We suggest that this is due to the greater opportunity costs of dissolution and the presence of relatively high-status partners who can act as peacekeepers and coordinators of their lower-status partners."}, {"e:author": ["Daniella Laureiro-Martinez"], "e:volume": "25", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2014.0899", "e:keyword": ["Cognitive control capabilities", "Attention", "Decision making", "Strategy", "Microfoundations", "Routines", "Routinization propensity", "Cognition"], "e:pages": "1111-1133", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.2014.0899", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Cognitive Control Capabilities, Routinization Propensity, and Decision-Making Performance", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "This paper examines the cognitive and behavioral foundations of decision making at the individual level.

Study 1 finds that a wide range of employees perceive ostracism, compared with harassment, to be more socially acceptable, less psychologically harmful, and less likely to be prohibited in their organization. Study 2 surveyed employees from a variety of organizations to test our theory that ostracism is actually a more harmful workplace experience than harassment. Supporting our predictions, compared with harassment, ostracism was more strongly and negatively related to a sense of belonging and to various measures of employee well-being and work-related attitudes. We also found that the effects of ostracism on well-being and work-related attitudes were at least partially mediated by a sense of belonging. Study 3 replicated the results of Study 2 with data collected from employees of a large organization and also investigated the comparative impact of ostracism and harassment on employee turnover.

Experts rarely consent to such a situation; therefore, attempts to reduce dependence on experts and control their work are more often aspirational than actual. Drawing on an ethnography of an organization that was required by a government agency to transfer the work responsibilities of experts to employees throughout the organization, this paper describes how a network of actors developed a discursive, political process to renegotiate control of expert work practices. Through <i>censure episodes</i>, long-standing and largely successful expert practices were examined one by one and relabeled as problematic in relation to established goals. The constructed breaches opened expert practices to evaluation, questioning, and eventual delegitimation within the organization.

What determines firms’ intertemporal choices between different alliance time horizons? Shadow of the future theorists suggest that when an alliance has an explicitly set short-term time frame, there is an increased risk that partners may behave opportunistically. This does not readily explain the high incidence of time-bound alliances being formed. Reconciling insights from the shadow of the future perspective with nascent research on the flexibility of temporary organizations, and shifting the focus from the level of individual transactions to that of strategic alliance portfolios, we argue that firms may be willing to accept a higher risk of opportunism when there are offsetting gains in strategic flexibility in managing their strategic alliance portfolio. Consequently, we hypothesize that environmental factors that increase the need for strategic flexibility—namely, dynamism and complexity in the environment—are likely to increase the relative share of time-bound alliances in strategic alliance portfolios. Our analysis of longitudinal data on the intertemporal alliance choices of a large sample of small and medium-sized enterprises provides support for this argument.

Using a matched sample of 604 observations of Chinese listed firms between 2002 and 2008, our findings show that an observing firm is deterred from committing fraud if the peers in its industry are caught and punished. We further find that such deterrence effects are subject to how the observing firm evaluates the possibility of being caught and the likelihood it will be punished the same way if it violates similar prohibitions. In particular, inhibitive learning effects are positively moderated by punishments of prominent firms and model–observer similarity but negatively attenuated by the development of the legal system.

We find that heavier activity loads exact a smaller toll on performance when firms have larger and more homogeneous stocks of prior experience.

I advance a process-based explanation for evaluative outcomes. Individuals make evaluations as a result of relative judgments on a subset of objects, comparing each object under consideration against a small set of others. Categorical boundaries matter to individuals perhaps because of personal preferences but also, importantly, because fit within boundaries determines how strictly to apply performance results. Simply by different individuals examining different subsets of objects, evaluative outcomes can vary dramatically, such that the same object may have different evaluations by audience members. Using recommendations by analysts at U.S. brokerages, I find support for the hypothesis that lower performance of a stock relative to other stocks already rated by a given analyst is associated with a lower likelihood of a high rating by an analyst, but this effect applies only to those stocks that fit clearly into industry boundaries.

Prior efforts at providing a unified theory that can accommodate these patterns as special cases have not dealt properly with obsolescence. We tackle this problem by proposing a new model that builds on the most recent unification attempt while integrating the core intuition behind obsolescence: organizations have trouble adapting to drifting environments, which leads to declining performance and, in turn, to decreasing viability. In doing so, we develop a comprehensive representational framework to precisely characterize obsolescence. Our perspective builds on recent theory and research that treats categories as constructions by audiences. We characterize environmental drift as changing audience tastes in a multidimensional feature space and organizational inertia as a decreasing ability for producers to move quickly in that space. This combination creates obsolescence with aging. We then integrate this perspective with prior theory to make novel predictions regarding the age dependence in life chances over the life courses of organizations. We also show how the predictions of our theory can be tested empirically by adapting Levinthal’s random walk model [Levinthal DA (1991) Random walks and organizational mortality. <i>Admin. Sci.

I find that organizational members address this dilemma (1) by harnessing artifacts and communities to establish two sets of ostensive patterns and performances, one supporting alignment (replication) and one improvement (innovation), and (2) by striving to maintain a dynamic balance between them by enacting them in different proportions. This allows offsetting competing goals and the related pressures both at specific points in time and over time. Building on these findings, I develop a theoretical framework that adds to the extant replication and routines literatures, and the Carnegie account of routine transfer and goal balancing, by capturing (1) the microlevel, performative dynamics by which organizations unravel the replication dilemma in routines transfer while addressing competing goals and the associated pressures and (2) the role of the social and material features of context in the (re)production and transfer of routines."}, {"e:author": ["Min Liu", "Filippo Carlo Wezel"], "e:volume": "26", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2014.0914", "e:keyword": ["Resource partitioning", "Producers’ identities", "And audience preferences"], "e:pages": "293-309", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.2014.0914", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Davids Against Goliath?

Emerging organizations augment their imprinted forms by using ancillary forms aligned with their organizational values and reinforce their core features by differentiating themselves from antagonistic forms that conflict with their values. We contribute to the literature on organizational formation by developing a process model that details how imprinted forms are subsequently modified.

We develop a causal model of the multiple mechanisms that sustain generalized reciprocity in an organization, drawing together disparate literatures in the social, organizational, and biological sciences. We conduct the first-ever critical test of two key mechanisms: paying it forward and rewarding reputation. These are fundamentally different grammars of organizing, either of which could sustain a system of generalized reciprocity. In an organization, paying it forward is a type of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) that occurs when members of an organization help third parties because they themselves were helped. Rewarding reputation is a type of OCB that occurs when peers monitor one another, helping those who help others and refusing to help those who do not. Using behavioral data collected from members of two organizational groups over a three-month period, we found that reputational effects were strongest in the short term but decayed thereafter. Paying it forward had stronger and more lasting effects. Dominant theories assume that rewarding reputation is the main cause of generalized reciprocity, but our analysis demonstrates that generalized reciprocity in an organization occurs for multiple reasons.

This paper seeks to fill that gap by extending the theoretical conceptualization and empirical specification of the socially derived performance targets against which organizations compare their performance. Drawing on insights from the social psychology literature, we argue first that organizational decision makers monitor two socially derived performance benchmarks: an upwardly focused “top performance threshold” marking the highest levels of performance in the reference group and a downwardly anchored “reference group threshold” marking the performance level below which organizations can not consider themselves members of the reference group. Building on these arguments, we also motivate a new, and more complete, way to conceptualize performance comparison. Integrating socially and historically derived sources of performance feedback, we propose the <i>historically based social aspiration threshold</i> (HiBSAT) as an additional aspiration point representing the socially derived performance threshold closest to the organization’s prior performance. In an empirical analysis of German soccer league (Bundesliga) clubs between 1992 and 2004, we find that organizations have both upward and downward socially derived performance targets and that performance relative to the HiBSAT is particularly salient in motivating organizational change."}, {"e:author": ["Uri Gal", "Tina Blegind Jensen", "Kalle Lyytinen"], "e:volume": "25", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2014.0924", "e:keyword": ["Organizational identity orientation", "Social exchange", "Information technology", "Affordances", "Interorganizational collaboration"], "e:pages": "1372-1390", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.2014.0924", "e:year": 2014, "e:title": "Identity Orientation, Social Exchange, and Information Technology Use in Interorganizational Collaborations", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Advances in information technologies (IT) are creating unprecedented opportunities for interorganizational collaboration, particularly in large-scale distributed projects.

Specifically, we consider the case of alliances between resource-rich and resource-poor firms and examine the capability development opportunities and threats that face the resource-poor focal firm as by-products of a link alliance. We use data on the population of independent motion picture production studios in the United States and their alliances with the major studios during 1990–2010 to test our proposed theory. The results show that the number of major partners exhibits an inverted U-shaped effect on an independent studio’s capability. We also find contingent effects: both an independent studio’s alliance experience with major partners and its level of specialization intensify (positively moderate) this relationship.

We learned that employees report engaging in courageous workplace actions when they feel responsible for dealing with a challenging situation such as a workplace error, an abuse of power, an ambiguous situation, or someone in need. We interpreted the stories of courage as suggesting that workplace courage may be a two-stage process, where actors first determine their level of personal responsibility to respond to the challenging situation and then determine the potential social costs of acting. Our model of the courageous workplace action appears to challenge the conventional wisdom of courage as being attributed to a person’s disposition, may enrich theories of intrinsic motivation, and may help clarify the role of cognition in courageous action.

The exogenous nature of the shock allows us to empirically identify the effect of preshock interdependence structures on postshock adaptation outcomes. We find that the locus of coordination inside a firm can explain differential postshock adaptation performance: because interdependencies spanning organizational boundaries are more difficult to manage than those contained within such boundaries, coordination across product areas creates greater adaptation challenges compared with coordination within product areas. We further investigate the moderating effects of product complementarity and organizational grouping, finding results consistent with our hypothesized mechanisms.

In an empirical test among the population of automobile carburetor manufacturers during a technological discontinuity, we observe that organizations developing intergenerational hybrids capture spillback benefits—knowledge spillovers from an emerging technology generation to the current generation.

Most inventors benefit by sourcing knowledge from, or collaborating with, other Indians and hence enhance innovation quality, but at a diminishing rate. For those who are very heavily embedded in the community, ethnic community knowledge decreases the quality of innovation.

First, the positive effects associated with diversity often decay over time, in part because heterogeneous people may <i>homogenize</i> with repeated exposure. Second, diverse groups are <i>fragile</i> and experience higher turnover than nondiverse groups. Recruiting similar (redundant) pairs within a heterogeneous group can solve these two problems but also gives rise to a third: fault-line <i>fragmentation</i>. We propose a different structural solution: <i>redundant heterogeneity</i> (RH), in which not only are team members heterogeneous <i>within</i> a hierarchical level of a group or organization but their diversity is matched by similar critical team member characteristics at other hierarchical levels. Thus, we suggest that organizations and teams can take maximal advantage of diversity when each of their hierarchical subgroups are similarly diverse on the same critical dimensions. Analyses of 23 years of panel data from the National Basketball Association provided a first test of the effectiveness of this solution. We focused on professional players’ experience with a particular style of play in their college careers as the critical dimension of diversity within these teams. Our findings indicate that RH led to better performance, for three reasons. First, the positive effect of heterogeneity among teams’ core players on team performance decays more slowly for teams with RH; second, teams with RH are less negatively affected by turnover among core players; and third, teams with RH exhibited more coordination and cooperation.

Using data on nanotechnology patents, we test this argument by analyzing two dimensions of approval: time to approval and citations by subsequent patents.

Using data on the business activities and supervision relationships within U.S. multinational manufacturers in 1996–2008, I find that frontline subsidiaries in countries with weaker institutions are more likely to be supervised by foreign rather than domestic supervisory units. Foreign supervision is even more likely when subsidiaries in weak-institution countries conduct activities that are more central to or interdependent with their parents’ global operations. These findings confirm that MNCs use differential supervision to enhance global coordination.

We ask the question of which of these drivers is more pronounced as an explanation of employee entrepreneurship and what technological factors matter in this relationship. Analyzing a unique data set, we find that the likelihood of employee entrepreneurship increases with the inventor’s assessment of the value of a patent for an invention developed while at the incumbent firm but dramatically decreases when the invention protected by the patent is commercialized by the firm, licensed to third parties, interdependent with other firms’ inventions protected by patents, or technologically broad. We also find that conditional on high valuation by the inventor, a matching high valuation by the firm further increases the likelihood of transitioning to entrepreneurship. In combination, we show that a situation when both the inventor and the firm consider the invention valuable but the firm ends up not commercializing the invention is more predictive of employee entrepreneurship than simple differences in assessing the value of the invention.

We tested this theory with full-network data collected over three years from employees in a small functional-form organization, which we analyzed with a methodology drawing from the social relations model of interpersonal perception and Bayesian models for social network analysis. We found that, over time, the affective value of social relationships influences both perceptions of instrumental value and the formation of task-related ties through multiple paths not accounted for by either perceived instrumental value or formal-structural requirements.

We test our theory using longitudinal analysis of 181 dyads involving 26 firms participating in 17 SSOs in the global mobile handset industry. We find that interorganizational learning, as measured by patent citations, involving corporatist firm dyads significantly increases when the dominant logic within the arena is also corporatist. By making cooperative schemas more accessible, a dominant corporatist logic also enhances interorganizational learning across technologically distant dyads. When a pluralist logic dominates the arena, corporatist dyads learn less because firms in the dyad activate a contradictory logic that decouples them from their natural processes for interorganizational learning.

We develop these ideas in a multimethod study of a hospital emergency department (ED) redesign. Before the redesign, people coordinated in ad hoc groupings, which provided flexibility because any nurse could work with any doctor, but these groupings were limited in effectiveness because people were not accountable to each other for progress, did not have shared understanding of their work, and faced interpersonal risks when reaching out to other roles. The redesign introduced new mesolevel structures that bounded a set of roles (rather than a set of specific individuals, as in a team) and gave them collective responsibility for a whole task. We conceptualized the mesolevel structures as team scaffolds and found that they embodied the logic of both role and team structures.

From a theoretical perspective, we develop propositions related to microlevel processes that lead to the institutionalization of new rules or those that leave existing arrangements unchanged.

Our contribution is threefold. First, we extend the theory of organizational information disclosure to incorporate the possibility of undue modesty about a firm’s environmental, social, and governance practices. Second, we hypothesize about the drivers of exaggeration and undue modesty based on which of a firm’s stakeholders are salient at a given point in time; to do so, we place the firm within a dynamic context that has largely been missing in the prior literature.

We find no evidence of a professional Oscar curse; male and female Oscar winners and Oscar nominees appear in more films following their Oscar experiences than do other actors.

This study identifies limits to that assertion by identifying conditions under which i-deals are sought, despite employee participation in ILMs. Furthermore, we develop and test theory reconciling the roles of ILMs and firm-specific human capital in employee requests for i-deals. Employee reports of ILM practices are negatively related to i-deal requests, whereas firm-specific human capital is positively related to these requests. In addition, we find an interaction between the two such that the suppressive effects of ILM reports on i-deal requests hold largely for workers with low firm-specific human capital. Individuals with high firm-specific human capital tend to seek i-deals despite reported ILM practices. I-deal requests also increase with group-level heterogeneity in firm-specific human capital.

Selection occurs over expressed behavior. As a result, plasticity, the capacity to adapt behavior, poses a trade-off as it offers the possibility of adaptive learning but at the same time mitigates the effectiveness of selection processes to identify more or less superior underlying roots of behavior.

In an attempt to resolve the inconclusive findings, we provide a more fine-grained view of alliance experience by examining characteristics such as relatedness and diversity, which are defined based on the functional focus and the industry of the partner. Furthermore, we argue that since leveraging alliance experience is a learning process, a firm’s knowledge integration capabilities enabled by information technology (IT) should influence the extent to which the firm benefits from alliance experience. Using data from 1,030 alliances made by 89 firms across 11 industries, we test the effects of relatedness and diversity on abnormal returns following alliance announcements. We find that functionally related experience is positively related to abnormal returns, whereas partner industry-based related experience affects the expected value negatively. We also find that a firm’s IT-enabled knowledge integration positively moderates the effects of both related and diverse experience on abnormal returns. Our findings highlight that although knowledge gained through prior experience is important, complementary capabilities that enable firms to leverage and utilize such knowledge are also necessary for ex ante value creation in alliances.

To consider how value shifts from one part of the sector (such as computer assemblers) to another (such as software and microprocessor makers), we look at how conditions within a segment (such as software developers) affect changes in the value share of that segment compared with the entire sector in terms of market capitalization. We find that the presence of what we call “kingpins”—firms with superior capabilities, modeled in our study as having superior market capitalization and as being disproportionately important in terms of research and development (R&D)—is correlated with a higher share of total sector value, suggesting that kingpins can help a segment to become a “bottleneck.” Sales concentration and the <i>level</i> of R&D expenditure are not always reliable predictors. Kingpins exert a positive externality on their direct competitors, yet their segments display increasing internal inequality over time, making the presence of kingpins a double-edged sword for their peers.

Our altercentric perspective builds on earlier evidence that the construct of self-monitoring is associated with brokerage, but it suggests that the effect of self-monitoring on brokerage is amplified in those perceived as highly empathic and attenuated in those perceived as lower in empathy.

We propose that gender-biased attributions about the charismatic leadership of men and women are facilitated by the operation of a leader-in-social-network schema. Attributions of charismatic leadership depend on the match between the gender of the leader and the perceived structure of the network. In three studies encompassing both experimental and survey data, we show that when team advice networks are perceived to be centralized around one or a few individuals, women leaders are seen as less charismatic than men leaders. However, when networks are perceived to be cohesive (many connections among individuals), it is men who suffer a charismatic leadership disadvantage relative to women.

We also illustrate the value of our distance-based approach in a reanalysis of Sørensen and Stuart’s study of age variations in firms’ patenting behavior [Sørensen JB, Stuart TE (2000) Aging, obsolescence, and organizational innovation. <i>Admin.

Based on an investigation of 7,162 scientific teams in the biotechnology sector between 1973 and 1999, we argue and demonstrate that the degree of teams’ innovative novelty is curvilinear: it increases and then decreases as the geographic dispersion of the team members increases. We also establish that the effect of geographic dispersion on the novelty of a team’s innovation depends on the team’s social environment. The greater the relational strength among research and development team members, the stronger the initial positive effect of their geographic dispersion, and the weaker the negative effect at higher levels of dispersion. Furthermore, the greater the status asymmetry in a team, the weaker the initial positive effect of geographic dispersion, and the stronger the negative effect at high levels of dispersion.

A technology shock may simultaneously unleash significant innovation opportunities while creating great uncertainty in the economic environment. Though it is well known that firms often use alliances both to respond to uncertainty and facilitate innovation, little is known about how technology shocks affect the collaboration behavior of firms and how these two factors separately influence innovation outcomes. I integrate an inductive study of collaboration activity and a technology shock with existing research on economics, alliances, and networks to build a set of arguments about how technology shocks will influence alliance behavior, how changes in alliance behavior will influence the global technology collaboration network, and about how each of these changes is likely to influence the innovative outcomes of firms.

Much less is known about the preceding process through which organizations decide to adopt an ambidextrous orientation. In this paper we focus on this first step—the <i>charter definition process</i> through which the activities and responsibilities of an organizational unit are agreed. Most prior studies implicitly assume that senior executives at some point identify the need to become ambidextrous and subsequently design supportive structures and contexts to implement their choice. Based on an inductive multilevel case study of four alliances, we show how this mandated (or top-down) charter definition process can be complemented with an alternative emergent (or bottom-up) charter definition process in which frontline managers take the initiative to adopt an ambidextrous orientation in their part of the organization. This emergent process is important because it enables frontline managers to respond in a timely manner to changing requirements of which senior executives are still unaware. We use the findings from our case study to develop potentially generalizable observations on the level of initiation, the tensions, the management approaches to deal with the tensions, and the outcomes that characterize this emergent charter definition process. We then put forward a multilevel process framework of how organizations initiate an ambidextrous orientation, and we discuss theoretical implications for the general ambidexterity literature, the nascent dynamic view on ambidexterity, and the broader research on how charters in organizations evolve."}, {"e:author": ["Ruolian Fang", "Blaine Landis", "Zhen Zhang", "Marc H.

We argue that this fact can be explained by looking at market categories from the producer perspective. Lenient market categories have more flexibility and allow for a wider range of fit. As a result, we expect to see high rates of entry into lenient categories. At the same time, lenient market categories have drawbacks: they do not clearly convey what an organization does and do not identify specific sets of potential consumers. This means organizations are more likely to exit. When entry rates are higher than exit rates, lenient market categories will endure over time. We also predict that organizations exiting lenient categories will enter other lenient categories, further fueling the persistence of such categories. Finally, this trend is exaggerated when influential external agents favor leniency.

Drawing on theoretical mechanisms from the social network and knowledge transfer literature, as well as on recent empirical advances in exponential random graphs models of social networks, we examine how the presence of a common third party in the communication network affects the likelihood of technical communication between interdependent teams designing the components of a large commercial aircraft engine. Although task interdependence has a strong and significant effect on the likelihood of communication between teams, this effect is moderated by the presence of common third parties. The nature of this moderation depends on the position of the common third party within the triadic communication structure. When the common third party seats in the middle of a communication chain between the potential source and the potential recipient of technical communication, its presence increases the likelihood of communication between these two teams. However, when the communication between the source and recipient can trigger cyclic exchanges between the three teams, the presence of the third party reduces the likelihood of communication between the two interdependent teams, increasing the risk of coordination disruptions.

Analyzing 115 interviews, performance evaluations, and turnover data, I trace how and why people manage their deviance differently across audiences within the organization, show the interdependence of these efforts, and illuminate consequences for how they are perceived and evaluated.

Surprisingly, unshared third parties have been ignored in empirical analysis, and so we do not know if or how much unshared third parties contribute to the process. Using knowledge transfer data from an online technical forum, we illustrate how unshared third parties affect the rate at which individuals initiate and sustain knowledge transfer relationships. Empirical results indicate that unshared third parties undermine knowledge sharing, and they also indicate that the magnitude of the negative unshared-third-party effect declines the more unshared third parties overlap in what they know. Our results provide a more complete view of how third parties contribute to knowledge sharing. The results also advance our understanding of network-based dynamics defined more broadly.

In this paper I show that contacts are differently beneficial for job seekers depending on the stage of the job search process that job seekers are engaged in. Specifically, three stages of the job search process can be distinguished in which social contacts fulfill different roles for the job seekers: deciding the types of jobs for which to apply, submitting job applications, and preparing for interviews. I propose that contacts who are spread across different occupations are conducive to applying to more types of jobs, yet it is contacts who are more focused across occupations that are beneficial for being invited to more interviews—relative to the number of job types applied for—and for converting the interviews into offers. In addition, contacts with lower relationship depth with the job seeker are more helpful for getting invited to interviews, whereas contacts who have more frequent interactions with the job seeker are more helpful for converting interviews into offers. Analyses using a unique longitudinal data set on the job searches of 226 participants in an MBA program offer robust evidence in support of the hypotheses.

Our results show that network clustering has opposite effects for these two important and complementary forms of exploration. Dense clustering encourages members of a network to generate more diverse information but discourages them from generating diverse theories; that is, clustering promotes exploration in information space but decreases exploration in solution space. Previous research, generally focusing on only one of those two spaces at a time, has produced an inconsistent understanding of the value of network clustering. By adopting an experimental platform on which information was measured separately from solutions, we bring disparate results under a single theoretical roof and clarify the effects of network clustering on problem-solving behavior and performance.

Specifically, we theoretically assess how varying magnitudes of industry regulatory changes affect the optimum level of firm exploration, and propose—counterintuitively vis-à-vis past literature—that the more radical (i.e., competence destroying), as opposed to incremental (i.e., competence enhancing), these changes are, the more the optimum intensity of firm exploration recedes. Based on quantitative as well as qualitative empirical analyses from the Formula One racing industry, we precisely trace the observed performance outcomes back to the underlying logic of our theory, stressing that impaired capabilities to integrate the new component in the architecture redesign and time-based cognitive limitations both operate to inhibit the otherwise positive relationship between firm exploration and performance.

By adopting a narrative approach, we show the shared sensemaking of such a team to be impacted by the locally differentiated nature of its interpretive and relational contexts, leading to context specific interpretations of center-led change and locally distinct responses, with consequences for change outcomes. We found that because of their dual role, senior managers construct two sets of interwoven and interacting change narratives which mediate the relationship between the wider organizational change and local change actions.

The model represents how members of a collective interact to interpret their environment. Current theories of collective interpretation focus on how heedful communication among members of a collective (i.e., how much individuals pay attention to others’ interpretations) improves interpretive performance; their general assumption is that heed tends to be uniformly beneficial. By unpacking the micromechanisms that underlie such performance, our model reveals a more complex story. Heedfulness can benefit interpretive performance. It can help collectives properly interpret situations that are especially ambiguous, unknown, or novel. Conversely, heedfulness also generates conformity pressures that induce agents to give too much weight to others’ interpretations, even if erroneous, thereby potentially degrading interpretive performance. These two effects join into a nonmonotonic trajectory that represents how heed relates to interpretive performance: due to its beneficial properties, performance increases with heed until it peaks before degrading due to conformity pressures. The form of this nonmonotonic relationship is contingent on the nature of the task: ambiguous situations make collectives vulnerable to too much heed: ambiguity ignites conformism; novel situations make collectives dependent on heed: novelty requires multiple eyes to be seen. In addition to these results, our model offers a flexible platform that future work can use to explore collective interpretation in a variety of organizational and supraorganizational contexts."}, {"e:author": ["Tiziana Casciaro", "Sigal G.

Nevertheless, it is in each party’s best interest to find a structure that protects its interests, while also allowing its partner to protect its interests sufficiently. Drawing from the alliance management capabilities literature, we argue that firms with more alliance experience are better able to protect their interests under any given alliance structure, making the choice of structure less consequential to them.

We identify the scope of institutional changes, business group attributes, and affiliate characteristics as sources of such (mis)alignment. The results from panel data on 298 firms from the Indian pharmaceutical industry for the 1992–2007 period show that the constraining effects of business group affiliation are observed only when institutional changes are specific to the affiliates’ industry and not when broad institutional changes affect the business group as a whole. Moreover, we observe heterogeneity in the search behavior of group affiliated firms. First, the degree of misalignment is greater in the case of affiliates belonging to older business groups and those that are more distant in terms of age and industry since the group’s founding. Second, by contrast and suggesting an alignment in outlook, we find that affiliated firms that occupy a prominent position within a group or industry are able to bargain for and receive attention and support from the business group to undertake international search.

In this study, we focus on racial dissimilarity in choice relationships both outside and inside of work and find that greater racial heterogeneity in choice relationships outside of work is related to positive affiliative outcomes at work, such as trust in supervisor and extra-role behaviors, through its effects on relationships inside of the workplace. This has implications for the research on choice and relational demography in organizations, suggesting that relational demography that is a function of choice has benefits for affiliative outcomes at work and that relational demography that is a function of assignment or structure does not.

To account for this difference in fairness perceptions following an unfavorable outcome, we show that the mere presence of a group as a decision-making body serves as a cue that increases the accessibility of negative group-related associations in a perceiver’s mind (Study 3). Moreover, in a sample of recently laid-off workers—representing a broad range of organizations and demographic characteristics—we demonstrate that those who received a layoff decision made by a group of decision makers (versus an individual) are marginally more likely to perceive the decision as unfair and are marginally less likely to endorse the organization (Study 4).

We develop two types of escalation process in organizations: accumulation and perturbation. Under ordinary conditions, it is perturbation rather than the accumulation that is more likely to trigger subsequent discontinuous change. Consistent with complex adaptive systems theory, organizations are more sensitive to both accumulation and perturbation in conditions of heightened disequilibrium. Contrary to expectations, highly interconnected organizations are not more liable to discontinuous change.

In the current study, we asked executives to seek advice on an important work project from two dormant ties (their first, most preferred choice plus one selected randomly from their next nine most preferred choices) and to respond to surveys before and after their reconnections. This two-stage design allowed us to make causal inferences about the executives’ advice-seeking preferences and the value of reconnecting certain types of dormant ties. Our results show that the most valuable reconnections are to people who provide novelty (by not having spent much time together in the past and having higher status) as well as engagement (by being trustworthy and willing to help). Our executive participants, however, preferred neither novelty nor engagement. Rather, the prospect of reconnecting can make people feel anxious. To avoid this discomfort, executives preferred contacts with whom they had spent a lot of time together in the past, thereby actually reducing novelty.

This beneficial effect is attenuated (1) when audience expectations about what type of product should have an oppositional name are violated and (2) when a firm develops a strong organizational identity and audiences rely on this identity to make inference about the firm’s production process.

Although evidence suggests that firms have increasingly shifted market risks onto their workforce, to date, there have been few detailed analyses exploring what factors have driven this phenomenon. This study adds to our understanding of why firms have transferred risk to their employees by examining the decline of a highly institutionalized practice wherein large U.S. firms used to bear retirement risk: the defined benefit (DB) pension plan. Through a detailed analysis, I show that variance in the presence, power, and interests of shareholders and employees at the firm level differentially affect a firm’s willingness to shift the risk of retirement onto its workers. Specifically, I demonstrate empirically that different types of shareholders have differential effects on a firm’s retirement practices, suggesting that the changing equity ownership structure of large U.S. firms has played a key role in how risk is allocated between workers and firms. Declines in employee power have also played a role because firm levels of unionization positively affect rates of DB participation for both unionized and nonunionized workers."}, {"e:author": ["Gabriel Natividad", "Olav Sorenson"], "e:volume": "26", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2015.1002", "e:keyword": ["Diversification", "Corporate strategy", "Volatility", "Uncertainty", "Movies"], "e:pages": "1721-1733", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.2015.1002", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Competitive Threats, Constraint, and Contagion in the Multiunit Firm", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Do unexpected events experienced by one line of business adversely affect other lines of business in diversified firms?

The analyses yield evidence consistent with assimilation and contrast effects. Below the middle level of status inequality, the relationship between status inequality and stadium attendance is positive for low-status bowls but negative for high-status bowls.

Further, we propose that as participants acquire experience in exchanging knowledge, they learn to rely more on expertise similarity and less on categorical similarities, such as location or hierarchical status. As a result, boundaries based on categorical attributes are expected to weaken, and boundaries based on expertise are expected to strengthen, as participants gain experience in the online community.

Although existing learning research recognizes errors as disruptive, this dual effect has not been theorized.

We draw on qualitative data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s <i>Challenger</i> and <i>Columbia</i> accidents to build theory about why organizations oscillate between safety and other foci, and how serious errors trigger these shifts. We then test this theory using a data set of all pharmaceutical firms that introduced Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs in the United States from 1997 to 2004.

To address this question, we propose that de novo (i.e., newly founded) and de alio (i.e., diversifying) organizations respond differently to the categorical imperative. Specifically, de novo organizations are more likely to enter and fit in high-contrast categories than in low-contrast ones, whereas the opposite is true for de alio entrants. To test these hypotheses, we follow technological entry dynamics within the semiconductor industry between 1976 and 2002.

Parties, we argue, sought to handle this situation through two broad strategies that we call identity affirmation and reformation. Identity distinctiveness was affirmed by identity claims that sought to counter and neutralize competing claims on aspects that were thought central to the identity of the party. To alter the identity, parties also sought to reform it by expanding identity claims to elements that were considered to be popular.

The resulting formal model builds a parsimonious theory regarding the segregating effects of network recruitment, resolving the puzzles and inconsistencies revealed by recent empirical findings. This revised theory also challenges conventional understandings of how network recruitment segregates: in isolation, network recruitment—even with segregated networks—is more likely to <i>desegregate</i> rather than segregate. Network recruitment segregates primarily through its interactions with other supply-side (e.g., gendered self-sorting) or demand-side (e.g., gendered referring rates) biasing mechanisms. Our model reveals whether and to what extent network recruitment segregates or desegregates, and it reveals opportunities for organizational intervention. There is an easily calculable tipping point where demand-side factors such as gender differences in referring can counteract and neutralize other segregating effects from referring. Independent of other personnel practices, organizational policies affecting employees’ referring behaviors can tip the balance to determine whether network recruitment serves as a segregating or desegregating force.

Using a longitudinal database that tracks the social movement challenges faced by 300 large companies between 1993 and 2007, I provide evidence that overt corporate-sponsored activism is used by companies that are chronically targeted and losing ground to activists, especially when those companies are facing a reputational deficit.

Five studies demonstrate that power without status leads to interpersonal conflict and demeaning treatment, both in specific dyadic work relationships and among organizational members more broadly. Study 1 provides initial support for the prediction that employees in low-status/high-power roles engage in more conflict with coworkers than all other combinations of status and power. In Studies 2a and 2b, a yoked experimental design replicated this effect and established low-status/high-power roles as a direct source of the interpersonal conflict and demeaning treatment. Study 3 used an experimental manipulation of relative status and power within specific dyadic relationships in the workplace and found evidence of a vicious cycle of interpersonal conflict and demeaning treatment within any dyad that included a low-status/high-power individual. Finally, Study 4 utilized survey and human resource data from a large government agency to replicate the power without status effect on interpersonal conflict and demonstrate that power interacts with subjective status change to produce a similar effect; increasing the status of a high-power role reduces conflict whereas decreasing its status increases conflict.

The costs and benefits of the various governance alternatives are then weighed for each configuration to identify when each alternative is likely to be most efficient. Our analysis suggests that patent assertion entities are most efficient in allocating intellectual property rights when there is substantial patent complementarity such that value is created through patent bundling, and these bundles are applicable across a broad range of product lines such that the costs of measuring infringement and its damages are substantial.

Hippel–Krogh argue (a) that problems and solutions cannot always be separated because they often emerge as problem–solution or need–solution pairs that are discovered serendipitously, and (b) that deliberately formulating or choosing a single, fixed problem restricts the firm from accessing the vast array of external problem solvers and restricts the firm from valuable reformulations of the problem and “rich landscape search.” Although Hippel–Krogh raise interesting and important arguments, we claim that they miss what is most central about the problem-solving approach: the comparative, organizational, and strategic aspects of the theory. However, their critique is also important because it draws attention to a critical void in the problem-solving perspective, namely, the need for firms to possess a theory to guide their efforts at value creation.We argue that this theory for the firm links problem solving with a broader theory of value creation, thus responding to the concerns raised by Hippel–Krogh. We discuss how firms theorize the process of value creation by articulating an overall architecture and bundle of problems around which each firm uniquely organizes and governs as a path to value creation. We provide two brief, informal examples (Starbucks and Apple) to illustrate our points, linking these examples to the need–solution landscape proposed by Hippel–Krogh.

In such a case, problem identification and formulation, if done at all, come only after the discovery of the need–solution pair.We propose the identification of need–solution pairs as an approach to problem solving in which problem formulation is not required.

In four studies with mixed methods and a causal chain design, we manipulate and measure group members’ (the “senders”) expressions of debates and disagreements, others’ (the “receivers”) perceptions of the senders’ receptivity to dissenting opinions, and receivers’ information sharing intentions and behavior.

We do this by extending existing work on new firm creation to investigate entry and performance in different product markets. Our findings, based on a dataset of start-ups in the semiconductor industry over a 10-year period (1997–2007), show that user-industry spinouts are more likely both to enter and to survive in market-specific product categories.

Furthermore, stakeholder perceptions of corporate philanthropy as being more symbolic or substantive are influenced by firm characteristics—the type of products or services that a firm provides and the life-cycle stage that the firm is in—which provide stakeholders with a context to better assess the nature of a firm’s philanthropic actions and the substantiveness of its giving.

We relate observed differences in the generativity of routine interactions to whether actants become mediators or intermediaries.

We identify three generative effects mediators can lead to: (1) the creation of innovative outcomes, (2) the adaptation of existing routine performances, and/or (3) the emergence of new routine performances.

Specifically, whereas <i>reflective spaces</i> are set apart by social, physical, and temporal boundaries and involve interactions that are geared toward developing novel conceptualizations of a routine, <i>experimental spaces</i> enable the integration of new actions into routine performances by locating them within the original routine, while establishing symbolic and temporal boundaries that signal the provisional and localized nature of experimental performances. As both types of spaces contribute to achieving change in complementary ways, they need to be enacted iteratively in relation to each other. The study offers a model of intentional routine change that articulates the role of spaces in interrupting and reorienting their recursive dynamics."}, {"e:author": ["Waldemar Kremser", "Georg Schreyögg"], "e:volume": "27", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2015.1042", "e:keyword": ["Routine", "Complementarity", "Interdependence", "Interrelatedness", "Path dependence", "Innovation", "Qualitative research"], "e:pages": "698-721", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.2015.1042", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "The Dynamics of Interrelated Routines: Introducing the Cluster Level", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "This paper explores interrelationships between organizational routines and their effect on routine dynamics. We introduce a more aggregate perspective on routines, the cluster level, and develop a theoretical framework that helps understanding the dynamics of routine clusters. The framework combines thoughts on the division of labor, modularity, and the consequences of complementarities. It explains why single routines are grouped into clusters and how complementarities between the specialized routines of a cluster will affect its evolution. It is the main argument of this paper that, in contrast to the expanding dynamics of single routines, which continuously bring about variations, the dynamics of clusters are restricting, amounting to a selection mechanism in organizational practice. To illustrate and substantiate our argument, we use a historical case study on CEWE, the European market leader in photofinishing. We analyze how the cluster for 35mm photofinishing—the core routines of the analog years—reacted to the upcoming digital revolution in the 1990s. Our paper offers three contributions: First, we theorize on the interrelationship between routines and the anatomy of clusters. Second, we provide a conceptual framework for analyzing the dynamics of routine clusters that builds on complementarities and the related misfit costs.

First, intersecting routines have shifting salience in the performance of a focal routine, and this shifting salience is enacted through professional skill and judgment. Second, each intersection amplifies pressure toward one or the other ostensive pattern thus introducing dynamism into the balancing of competing ostensive patterns.

Analysts’ forward-looking performance forecasts can serve as powerful motivation for managers, but may also encourage them to undertake short-term actions detrimental to future competitiveness and performance. To identify whether managerial reactions to earnings pressure suggest evidence of intertemporal trade-offs, we explored how companies respond to earnings pressure under different conditions of corporate governance that shape the temporal orientations of managers. Using data on competitive decisions made by U.S. airlines under quarterly earnings pressure, we examined the effect of earnings pressure on competitive behavior under different ownership structures (ownership by long-term dedicated investors versus transient investors) and CEO incentives (unvested incentives that are restricted or unexercisable in the short term, versus vested incentives). The results suggest that companies with more long-term-oriented investors and long-term-aligned CEOs with unvested incentives are less likely to soften competitive behavior in response to earnings pressure, relative to companies with transient investors and CEOs with vested, immediately exercisable stock-based incentives. Using a difference-in-differences (DiD) specification for stronger identification, we also found that firms respond to their rivals’ earnings pressure shocks by increasing capacity and prices, particularly when those rivals do not have long-term-oriented investors and CEO incentives.

Across two studies of interacting groups, we examined several different types of status disagreement and found that disagreements in which two group members both viewed themselves as higher in status than the other, or <i>upward disagreements</i>, were uniquely harmful for groups. These types of disagreements led the involved members to reduce their contributions to the group, substantially decreasing group performance.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, our analysis suggests an overlooked mechanism by which routine-level inertia may help, rather than hinder, organization-level adaptation. We demonstrate this mechanism by using a simple theoretical model in which the organization is characterized as a configuration of interdependent routines and study the process by which this configuration adapts to cope with its task environment. We find that inertia in routines may engender potentially useful variation in the process of organizational adaptation because reduced rates of routine-level changes may lead to temporal reordering when these changes are implemented. In our nuanced perspective, inertia is not only a consequence of adaptation or selection as perceived in prior research, but also a source of variation that turns out to be useful for adaptation. This logic is helpful to better understand why apparently inertial organizations keep surviving and from time to time exhibit outstanding performance.

Our analysis suggests that the relative performance of these two strategies depends on nontrivial interactions among the costs of communication, the distance to the offshoring location, and the level of noise in the firm’s performance function. In particular, the difficulties of interpreting performance signals in noisy situations suggest that there are benefits of making changes to the configuration <i>after</i> the offshoring implementation (host-based learning). In contrast, when coordination costs and distance dominate, the strategy of gearing the organization for offshoring <i>prior</i> to separating them across country borders prevails (home-based learning). Thus, by formalizing these two learning strategies for acquiring architectural knowledge in offshoring, we show that important contingencies can lead to significant performance trade-offs in the search for new organizational configurations that span international borders."}, {"e:author": ["Paul Tracey"], "e:volume": "27", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2016.1061", "e:keyword": ["Institutional logics", "Institutional work", "Persuasion", "Conversion", "Emotion", "Ritual"], "e:pages": "989-1009", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.2016.1061", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Spreading the Word: The Microfoundations of Institutional Persuasion and Conversion", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "I examine the microlevel processes involved when members of an organization seek to persuade others to internalize a new institutional logic.

An intriguing thread in this literature pertains to the influence of social networks on standards setting processes. While scholars acknowledge networks’ importance, their relevance to sponsors’ efforts to diffuse their technologies and establish them as de facto standards have been neglected. We theorize that sponsors choose alliance partners according to their location in the networks that connect potential adopters and that the network position that enhances a partner’s attractiveness depends on a technology’s stage of development. We hypothesize that sponsors of technologies that are early in their development and unproven commercially choose partners to create multiple points of contact between previous and potential adopters, called wide bridges. These redundant ties can foster the broad acceptance of a new technology that is essential to drive its diffusion. Sponsors of technologies in later stages of their development, with a commercial track record, can rely on a sparser network of ties to activate peer-to-peer diffusion. In line with our predictions, we found that during the battle to establish a 2G wireless standard in the U.S. market, Qualcomm, sponsor of the unproven CDMA (code division multiple access) technology, formed alliances that conformed to a wide-bridge pattern, while Ericsson, sponsor of the proven TDMA (time division multiple access) technology, formed alliances consistent with a peer-to-peer pattern of diffusion."}, {"e:author": ["Martina Montauti", "Filippo Carlo Wezel"], "e:volume": "27", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2016.1064", "e:keyword": ["Recombination", "Market uncertainty", "Entrepreneurship", "Music industry"], "e:pages": "954-971", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.2016.1064", "e:year": 2016, "e:title": "Charting the Territory: Recombination as a Source of Uncertainty for Potential Entrants", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "In this paper, we conceptualize categories as regions of a cognitive map that structure the market and guide the investment decisions of potential entrants—i.e., of new and established organizations.

We test this claim in a setting where firm dissolution extinguishes internal opportunities, using a new hand-collected data set of career histories in the automatic speech recognition (ASR) industry. For nondefunct firms, we replicate the “small-firm effect.” However, the small-firm effect no longer holds within the subsample of defunct firms: entrepreneurship rates among individuals present at firm dissolution are in fact higher for larger firms. Additional analyses indicate that this effect is unlikely to be driven by the early departure of higher-skilled workers who anticipate the firm’s demise. Finally, we find preliminary evidence consistent with the notion that large organizations may not only retain but also “mold” workers into entrepreneurs.

We start with the baseline predictions that firm age is related to the development of better exploitative innovations and worse explorative innovations. However, the tenure of employees intervenes in these relationships, by way of bringing in new knowledge, mental models, and beliefs. We predict that longer firm-specific and industry tenure of employees enhances the positive effect of firm age on the quality of exploitative innovations, while amplifying the negative effect of firm age on the quality of explorative innovations. In addition, for both the baseline and the moderating effect, we also formulate a prediction comparing the quality of explorative innovations with those of exploitative innovations. We find support for the moderating effects of human capital tenure for the quality of explorative innovations, but not for the quality of exploitative innovations. We reason that the latter may be due to the need for some level of exploration even in exploitative innovations, at least in the setting we study—the video game industry.

We find that as organizations stretch an initially misfitting exchange analogy from financial markets to online advertising, they iteratively bend their activities in superficial, structural, and generative ways to match the analogy and position themselves for advantage in the new space being created.

While prior research has focused on mismatch due to labor market frictions, workers may also enter mismatches for other reasons, such as family obligations or a change in career interests. Different reasons, in turn, may relate in distinct ways to wages and job satisfaction and thus to the opportunity costs of entering entrepreneurship. Moreover, mismatch may also affect human capital development, including the formation of a broader range of skills that is beneficial in entrepreneurship. Using longitudinal data from over 25,000 scientists and engineers, we document a broad range of reasons for educational mismatch and show that the relationships between educational mismatch and wages, job satisfaction, and skill variety differ significantly depending upon the reason for a mismatch. Mismatched individuals are more likely to enter into entrepreneurship in a subsequent period, an effect that goes beyond higher labor mobility per se. Both lower opportunity costs—primarily low job satisfaction—and greater skill variety appear to link educational mismatch to subsequent entrepreneurship.

I examine this dynamic in the context of Major League Baseball, where appreciation for traditional stadium features seemingly arose after the advent of free agency heightened awareness and coverage of the economic rewards in the sport. Experimental analysis validates the proposed mechanism, whereby increased fan exposure to extrinsic rewards increases concern about player inauthenticity, which increases preference for traditional stadium features. Quantitative analysis of attendance patterns provides external validation for these experimental findings by showing that authenticity was more highly preferred, in the form of higher relative attendance in traditional-style ballparks, by those fans more exposed to free agency.

We argue that such structure affects termination in two ways: directly, through coordination, and indirectly, by shaping the interpretation of performance feedback. Our baseline models indicate that as performance increases above aspirations, the rate of phaseout decreases. We find that as performance declines below aspirations, the rate of phaseout decreases, but then increases when the product falls below a certain sales threshold. We also find evidence that centralization amplifies the feedback effect above aspirations but attenuates it below aspirations. This study links two pillars of the Carnegie school, aspiration levels and hierarchy, to explain the complexity of phaseout following perceived success or failure.

In the conceptual framework, social identity theory explains how hybridity generates both positive and negative demand-side externalities.

By comparing six longitudinal cases of large firms’ new business initiatives, we find that corporate businesses that scale undergo a graduation process in which they meet the varying expectations of multiple organizational resource providers. At the unit level, they convince established core units that the potential value from combining their resources exceeds the cost of cannibalization and internal competition. They do so by initially differentiating themselves to develop distinctive capabilities, but subsequently integrate these capabilities with those of the core units. At the corporate level, the new units demonstrate their value by adding strategic capabilities that complement those of their main organizations. They initially integrate with their corporate parents to ensure resource flows, but then differentiate themselves to develop their own strategic profile.

In contrast, achieved political connections are more likely to serve a binding function that facilitates donation, particularly in state-monopolized industries and more market-oriented regions, but in less market-oriented regions, they buffer firms from the pressure to donate.

In this Perspectives piece, we argue that these inconsistent findings can be resolved if scholars take a more expansive view of the consequences of conflict management strategies: whereas existing research considers how individual strategies influence a single group conflict type (relational, status, process, or task), we consider the impact of individual strategies on all four conflict types. After building a typology by organizing strategies according to the conflict type that each is best equipped to manage, we argue that the strategies most appropriate for managing one type of conflict may systematically backfire by escalating other conflict types. For example, the adoption of a superordinate identity is likely to resolve relational conflict, yet exacerbate status conflict. In addition to uncovering these instances of “negative spillovers,” we shed light on the rarer phenomena of “positive spillovers,” which occur when conflict management strategies resolve conflict types they were not originally designed to influence.

We observe that systems men followed the path traditionally advocated in the occupations and professions literature by seeking autonomy through differentiating their task domains from other groups and by trying to get other groups to recognize their control.

Second, because the tendency toward immediate results could reflect stock market pressures, we consider how the interaction of investor patience and firm horizon relates to firm performance.

Measuring horizon as the expected useful lives of capital expenditures, we find empirical support for the hypothesized quadratic relation in a large-scale, multiyear sample of U.S. publicly held manufacturing firms and confirm that a majority of firms have horizons in the region where our models predict increases in horizon positively influence performance.

As a consequence, debt becomes a vital instrument in directing innovation along the optimal trajectory, while preventing the balance from shifting too far toward suboptimal exploration. To support our arguments, drawing on patent data, we first demonstrate that a firm’s leverage is positively related to knowledge exploitation activity as reflected in its self-citations. Next, we show that firms that have potentially engaged in suboptimal exploration, as manifest in underutilized stocks of proprietary knowledge, are likely to experience leverage increases in the short run, and these leverage increases in turn result in subsequent increases in self-citations. These effects are consistent with firm value indicating that equity holders value the role of debt in stimulating exploitation.

Firms at the periphery of communication networks are slower to adopt.This paper develops an alternative model which emphasizes the role of know-how and organizational learning as potential barriers to adoption of innovations. Firms delay in-house adoption of complex technology until they obtain sufficient technical know-how to implement and operate it successfully.In response to knowledge barriers, new institutions come into existence which progressively lower those barriers, and make it easier for firms to adopt and use the technology without extensive in-house expertise. Service bureaus, consultants, and simplification of the technology are examples. As knowledge barriers are lowered, diffusion speeds up, and one observes a transition from an early pattern in which the new technology is typically obtained as a service to a later pattern of in-house provision of the technology.Thus the diffusion of technology is reconceptualized in terms of organizational learning, skill development, and knowledge barriers. The utility of this approach is shown through an empirical study of the diffusion of business computing in the United States, reporting survey and ethnographic data on the spread of business computing, on the learning processes and skills required, and on the changing institutional practices that facilitated diffusion."}, {"e:author": ["Mary J.

We argue that executive succession can fundamentally alter the knowledge, skills and interaction processes of the senior management team. These revised skills and communication processes improve the team's ability to recognize and act on changing environmental conditions. Especially in turbulent environments, succession may be critical for improving or sustaining the performance of the firm. We explore continuity and change of CEOs and their executive teams as associated with first- and second-order organization learning, which are differentially important under stable versus turbulent environmental conditions. We also link these organization learning ideas to the nature of organization evolution. A series of hypotheses link executive-team succession and strategic reorientation to subsequent organization performance.Results in a study of 59 minicomputer firms, all founded between 1968 and 1971, indicate that succession exerts a positive influence on organization performance. We also show that it is important to distinguish between CEO succession and executive-team change, which independently improve subsequent organization performance. The positive impact of succession is accentuated when it coincides with strategic reorientation. Finally we examined how longer term patterns in succession and reorientation affect organization performance. We discovered two modes of organization adaption in this turbulent industry. The most typical mode combines CEO succession, sweeping executive-team changes, and strategic reorientations. A more rare, and over the long-term more effective, adaptational mode involves strategic reorientation and executive-team change, but no succession of the CEO. Consistently high-performing organizations are managed to sustain a relatively high level of learning (through turnover of senior executives and strategic reorientation), and at the same time to maintain links with established organizational competencies (through retention of the CEO)."}, {"e:author": ["Andrew H.

They claim, for example, that uncertain environments–those with high degrees of change and unpredictability in technology and in customer and competitor behavior–require more delegation of authority to highly trained specialists and quicker, more responsive decision making. However, such experts usually favor a slower, more analytical approach. Here, internal and external requirements appear to be inconsistent. These and similar inconsistencies indicate that the alignment among structural and process variables needed for good environmental fit seems sometimes to violate the dictates of internal consistency. It is reasonable, therefore, to expect that where such inconsistencies occur, organizations will choose between achieving internal match and external match: firms that closely match the demands of their environment will lack internal complementarity, and vice versa. The empirical research reported here demonstrates exactly this: organizations that achieve the best fit with environmental uncertainty have the weakest linkages among structural and process variables. An exploratory taxonomy supports these results. However, internal and external fit are not always incompatible. We found, for example, that fit with environmental diversity did not have any implications for internal fit.

Numerous case studies have found that organization structure (e.g., centralization of decision making) changes when firms introduce AMT, but the findings from such studies have been inconsistent. This paper reports the findings of a large-sample study of the relationship between AMT and organization structure. Two alternative patterns in the relationship between these two concepts were considered. The Marxist perspective, which holds that automation is used by managers as a tool to subordinate the workforce, leads to predictions that AMT will be associated with increasing differentiation (more hierarchical levels and job classifications), centralized decision making, and high levels of formalization (management by rules). The Idealist perspective, which involves the belief that managers should use new technologies to empower the workforce, leads to predictions that AMT will be associated with less differentiation, decentralized decision making, and limited formalization. The study was conducted using questionnaires, which were returned by general managers from 185 firms in the metalworking industries (SIC codes 33-37). The findings provide some support for both perspectives, as AMT was associated with both decentralization of decision making and formalization. We interpret these results as stemming from the characteristics of AMT, particularly integration, flexibility, and risk. Seen in this light, organizations have less need to centralize decisions, as AMT's capacity for integration allows information to be brought together at lower levels of the firm, and its flexibility allows departments to more easily adapt to decisions made by other departments. The risk and expense associated with AMT, however, may lead firms to institutionalize those practices associated with effective use of the technology through formal rules. In other words, formalization may be a mechanism for safely decentralizing. In general, researchers are urged to strike a balance between focusing on the intentions of management and the constraints of the technology when they study technology and organization."}, {"e:author": ["Robert Drazin", "Lloyd Sandelands"], "e:volume": "3", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.3.2.230", "e:keyword": ["Process", "Organizing", "Simulation"], "e:pages": "230-249", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.3.2.230", "e:year": 1992, "e:title": "Autogenesis: A Perspective on the Process of Organizing", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "This paper presents a perspective on organizational theory called ‘autogenesis’.

A decision-making process may need to be distributed across multiple participants, each of whom contributes to the final decision by performing one or more tasks. A participant may be a person, a group, a team, or an artifact such as a computerized decision-support system. Computers are routinely used to support individual decision making. However, their potential for supporting distributed decision making is only beginning to be actualized. Further progress in exploring and realizing this potential can benefit greatly from a formal model that accounts for the diverse phenomena that can occur within a distributed decision maker.When considering computer-based support for distributed decision making, the issue of coordinating the multiple participants becomes the central concern. Coordination defines the structural and dynamic patterns of inter-participant relationships in an organization. It has several aspects including planning, control, and review. Planning involves task decomposition, subtask allocation and synthesis. Control indicates mediation, negotiation and execution. And review deals with performance evaluation which will then contribute to organizational learning. Moreover, coordination occurs in a context of concurrent problem-solving tasks where multiple decisions are pending simultaneously. Bits and pieces of these coordination facets have been somewhat supported by existing computer technologies, such as decision-support systems and computer-mediated communication systems. However, systematic study of such support possibilities depends on formal models of distributed decision making as organizing paradigms.In this paper, we present a model of distributed decision making that is particularly concerned with the ongoing coordination among participants in multiple simultaneously active decision processes. Basic outlines of the model are presented as an initial foundation for understanding the possibilities of computer-based support for distributed decision making. The model takes the view that an organization is dynamic in terms of its capacity for improved coordination over time and through experience. It accommodates a bidding perspective as the context for coordination. The use and adjustment of entity reputation offers a means for improved coordination over time, and for capturing the phenomenon of organizational learning."}, {"e:author": ["Marcie J.

First, the paper measures the degree of uncertainty associated with a given technological change by examining (1) the novelty of specific new features and functions, and (2) the required departure from established operating assumptions and organizational relationships. Second, the paper identifies three modes of problem solving that organizations use in dealing with technological change: modification prior to implementation (preparatory search), joint work with external technical experts during production start-up (joint search), and integration of engineering and manufacturing functions engaged in start-up (functional overlap). The effectiveness of these approaches is then tested on a sample of 48 new process introductions undertaken in eight plants by a leading global producer of precision metal components. Results indicate that the measured characteristics of technological change are significant predictors of the difficulties encountered in introducing new process technology. Findings also suggest that intensive problem solving efforts can significantly improve change outcomes, both shortening the period of disruption experienced and increasing the operating gains achieved. In addition, there was some evidence that the three organizational problem solving activities discussed here are not equally effective for responding to all types of process change. Specifically, the higher the level of technical novelty involved, the less useful was overlap between engineering and manufacturing functions. This challenges the general prescription that cross-functional team involvement in major technical projects always should be maximized, regardless of the nature of the change involved."}, {"e:author": ["Deborah Gladstein Ancona", "David F.

Should they be formed completely of engineers or should they include a range of specialists? Should they be made up to people who have long tenure in the organization, or those with a wide range of experience? As teams increasingly get called upon to do more complex tasks and to cross functional boundaries within the organization, conventional wisdom has suggested that teams be composed of more diverse members. This study suggests that the answer may not be so simple.Using 409 individuals from 45 new product teams in five high-technology companies, this study investigates the impact of diversity on team performance. We found that functional and tenure diversity each has its own distinct effects. The greater the functional diversity, the more team members communicated outside the team's boundaries. This communication was with a variety of groups such as marketing, manufacturing, and top management. The more the external communication, the higher the managerial ratings of innovation.Tenure diversity had its impact on internal group dynamics rather than external communications. Tenure diversity is associated with improved task work such as clarifying group goals and setting priorities. In turn, this clarity is associated with high team ratings of overall performance.Yet diversity is not solely positive. While it does produce internal processes and external communications that facilitate performance, it also directly impedes performance. That is, overall the effect of diversity on performance is negative, even though some aspects of group work are enhanced. It may be that for these teams diversity brings more creativity to problem solving and product development, but it impedes implementation because there is less capability for teamwork than there is for homogeneous teams.These research findings suggest that simply changing the structure of teams (i.e. combining representatives of diverse function and tenure) will not improve performance. The team must find a way to garner the positive process effects of diversity and to reduce the negative direct effects. At the team level, greater negotiation and conflict resolution skills may be necessary. At the organization level, the team may need to be protected from external political pressures and rewarded for team, rather than functional, outcomes."}, {"e:author": ["Michael W.

This focus emphasizes one particular view of the champion role, and leads to a constrained set of alternatives to manage technology championing. We propose instead that champions can be seen as agents of potential users, and implementation described in terms of constructs familiar in the agency model. This approach challenges some fundamental premises in the existing literature and introduces new propositions to the research on technology champions.

Among these we distinguish technological and networking skills. We examine two aspects of innovating firms: their inclination to adopt a technological innovation, and their propensity to implement innovation alone or with other firms. Historical conditions pertaining to organizational skills are examined to account for these aspects. Among the most important are a firm's cumulative stream of technological projects that have some affinity to the new technology. A second important antecedent can be inferred from a firm's history of technological networking. Networking includes licensing, joint ventures and long-term contracts and can be formed for technological reasons, or for reasons having to do with the delivery of products and services. Networking is deemed important for facilitating access to strands of technology that are alien to a firm. Linkages are also conducive for contemplating strategic partnerships through which a firm can share the risks of innovation with others and which make such partnerships comparatively easy. The study examined a sample of United States commercial banks during the period 1977–1987, some of which were engaged in a new technology: home banking. The findings indicate that technological networking is the best predictor of technological innovation. They reveal also that firms with extensive networking are more likely to implement the innovation with strategic partners.

A prevailing view has been that they serve to keep in check the transaction costs arising from the self-interested motivations of individuals. We develop in this article the argument that what firms do better than markets is the sharing and transfer of the knowledge of individuals and groups within an organization. This knowledge consists of information (e.g., who knows what) and of know-how (e.g., how to organize a research team). What is central to our argument is that knowledge is held by individuals, but is also expressed in regularities by which members cooperate in a social community (i.e., group, organization, or network). If knowledge is only held at the individual level, then firms could change simply by employee turnover. Because we know that hiring new workers is not equivalent to changing the skills of a firm, an analysis of what firms can do must understand knowledge as embedded in the organizing principles by which people cooperate within organizations.Based on this discussion, a paradox is identified: efforts by a firm to grow by the replication of its technology enhances the potential for imitation. By considering how firms can deter imitation by innovation, we develop a more dynamic view of how firms create new knowledge. We build up this dynamic perspective by suggesting that firms learn new skills by recombining their current capabilities. Because new ways of cooperating cannot be easily acquired, growth occurs by building on the social relationships that currently exist in a firm. What a firm has done before tends to predict what it can do in the future. In this sense, the cumulative knowledge of the firm provides options to expand in new but uncertain markets in the future.We discuss at length the example of the make/buy decision and propose several testable hypotheses regarding the boundaries of the firm, without appealing to the notion of “opportunism.”"}, {"e:author": ["Wanda J.

If the innovating firm does not license its new technology, competitors may quickly develop their own, possibly better, version of the technology. On the other hand, if imitation of the new technology is difficult, by denying its technology to competitors the innovating firm may be able to establish a competitive advantage. If the innovating firm does license its new technology to competitors, it runs the risk of losing control over that technology (of giving away its competitive advantage to competitors). On the other hand, if competitors are able to rapidly imitate the new technology anyway, by licensing its technology the innovating firm may ensure that its version of the technology becomes the dominant design in an industry. Moreover, the innovating firm will receive royalty payments in this scenario.Given these different scenarios, what should an innovating firm do?

This article tests whether using communication media that differ (1) in media richness or social presence (2) in conditions of differing task analyzability (3) affects self-reported performance components such as quality of work, effectiveness, productivity, ability to obtain information, decision-making ability, access to others, etc.The article first reviews the theoretical constructs of media richness and social presence, task characteristics, and performance, with particular reference to organizational computer-mediated communication media. It also identifies important but untested assumptions that media richness theory has, to date, made about the forms of the relationships among these variables. The theory assumes that use-performance relationships are <i>nonmonotonic</i>, that is, that the relationship between use and outcomes is positive when a medium's richness “fits” task requirements, and negative when it does not. The theory also assumes that use-performance relationships are <i>symmetric</i>, that is, that the relationship between use and outcomes in different task conditions is similar but opposite for “rich media” and “lean media.”Hypotheses test the direction and form of relationships involving use of online databases in several pooled organizations, electronic mail in one organization, voice mail in two organizations, and videoconferencing in one organization, in task conditions varying in analyzability.Results are mixed, depending on analytical method and dataset used, but show modest support for the contingent effect of task condition on the relationship between use of these new media and performance components. Results are stronger for information-lean media than for information-rich media. The results are generally monotonic and asymmetric, thus qualifying prior media richness assumptions.Implications for theory and research include slight support but conceptual qualification of media richness theory, and an improved understanding of new organizational media. Implications for management and practice include a need to appreciate appropriate uses of and opportunities for different communication media in organizational contexts.This paper is written with the assistance of: Paul J.

Rites of integration are defined as planned social interactions that have the objective of achieving “a temporary sense of closeness” between customers and service providers. We argue that such rites help to establish the appropriate level of psychological involvement or the appropriate degree of psychological closeness between the service provider and the customer. Psychological involvement facilitates (a) the sharing of information by customers and employees that is necessary for service production and (b) the favorable evaluation, by customers, of the service delivery process. We describe (and give examples of) different types of rites that result in varying levels of involvement.

Using data from 74 U.S. high technology firms, this research investigates the relationship between organizational performance and adoption of an organizational innovation, the decision to join an R&D consortium. The central premise of the study is that a firm's propensity to innovate fluctuates with organizational performance, rather than stemming solely from a firm's inherent characteristics (such as size, structure, leadership, etc.).The study found that substandard performance stimulated early joiners of R&D consortia. More risk-averse, high performing firms were found to be late adopters of R&D consortia. However, the relationship between performance and innovation was somewhat more complex than traditionally envisioned. First, a distinct institutionalization effect occurred as R&D consortia became a commonly accepted method of conducting certain types of R&D projects. While substandard performance was necessary to stimulate the early adopters, over time, institutionalization of R&D consortia occurred, risks associated with adoption were lowered, and later adopters were no longer stimulated solely by substandard performance. Second, an adoption decision was observed to involve more than a single, dichotomous organizational choice, but included both an initial adopt/nonadopt component and a related decision involving the timing of adoption (early/late). The relationship between organizational performance and innovation emerged only when the effects of the initial adoption decision (adopt/nonadopt) were separated from the effects of adoption timing (early/late).The results here point rather strongly to the need to expand inquiry into the decision-making processes of late adopting firms, which are essentially “imitators,” to complement the existing prodigious literature on early adopting, firms, perceived in the traditional literature as “innovators.”"}, {"e:author": ["Zehava Rosenblatt", "Kathryn S.

Few studies have examined the specific managerial activities that lead to the more flexible course. This study reanalyzes a case of organizational decline in a small midwestern school district that coped successfully by implementing a carefully structured participation process. Administrative leaders in the district, in particular the superintendent, “opened a conversation” through a carefully arranged and supported task force with a broad group of citizens, staff, teachers and students about the goals and priorities of the district. The citizens' committee efforts continued for six months and resulted in a strong consensus for action (a tax levy, closing a school, restatement of program priorities and staff rollbacks).The case points to managerial actions that other organizations could follow to remain flexible and vitalized during decline. Critical steps included: shaping the perceptual fields of participants through information and disclosure in order to help participants recognize a serious and urgent problem without introducing crisis; careful management and operational support of task formats for broadened participation, with minimal influence on the substance of their recommendations; leadership through coaching of submanagers who facilitated the process indirectly; anticipating and dealing directly with conflicts by balancing views and channeling different interests into shared governance opportunities where heterogeneity was valued and institutional knowledge could be gained.The authors advance a political model, based on management as a process of governance, to explain how the leadership in this organization conceptualized its role. Management acted as a steward for decisions about organizational goals and legitimacy that others would make. By surrendering the power to shape reality for others and instead allowing them through discourse to establish a coherent policy out of heterogeneity, the superintendent created commitment to the organization during a time of stress and eventually a robust consensus which became the basis for action. A model of shared governance that was in harmony with the community's history and values and that reflected the superintendent's personal philosophy was implemented through specific activities.The shared governance model provides a unified conceptual explanation for why the superintendent acted as he did, and it highlights the specific functions managers might perform if the organization is to respond flexibly during decline. The political interpretation extends and refines current theoretical models of organizational decline processes and suggests approaches that are potentially applicable to other organizations."}, {"e:author": ["Allen G.

Its purpose is to examine the relationship between auditors' perceptions of oganizational decline and audit firms' specification of clients' audit risk. Based on relevant organizational decline and accounting literatures, we propose that perceptions of greater decline are associated with higher firm assigned audit risk. We also propose that larger, public and longer-term audit clients would make this connection stronger. The results reveal that the relationship of perceived decline to audit risk is quadratic (curved) rather than linear as anticipated. Assigned audit risk is high for smaller, privately held firms perceived to be rapidly declining or rapidly growing. Audit risk is even higher for larger, public client firms perceived to be in rapid decline. However, audit risk is relatively low for larger, public firms perceived to be rapidly growing. The time a firm is an audit client is not important. An implication of these findings is that research on the reactions of an organization's exchange partners to decline should be extended to include their reactions to rapid growth for certain types of organizations."}, {"e:author": ["Richard A.

In the past, researchers have suggested that the manner in which firms respond to takeover attempts may be, in part, a function of managers' personal motivations. We contribute to this line of research by questioning whether other factors might be involved. Specifically, we examine whether cooperation may be a function of the friendliness of the bidding company and the social networks shared by executives in the two firms (i.e., bidder and target). We examine how the power and connections of managers affect their responses to tender offers. Our results suggest that these factors do indeed play a role. We found, for example, that target managers are more likely to cooperate under two conditions: (1) if they have less prestigious connections than managers in the bidding firm, and (2) if the target and bidding firms' share numerous ties to the same prestigious networks. In contrast, we found that target managers are more likely to resist a bidder's advances if: (1) the managers in both firms are poorly connected, or (2) the targets' managers hold more prestigious connections relative to the bidders. Together these findings suggest that cooperation and resistance may be a function of the social networks and power relationships that exist between and within firms. We discuss our findings within the framework of numerous organizational theories such as social class and social network theory, agency theory, and resource dependence. Although each of these perspectives suggests somewhat different results, we propose a reconciliation of these various perspectives. Specifically, we suggest that the variables of managerial power and connections may have different effects depending on whether we are observing firms before or after tender offers are made. It may be, for instance, that before a takeover offer is received, the power and prestige of target managers is associated with adoption of anti-takeover defenses (i.e., defenses designed to thwart takeover attempts). In fact, this finding has already been well documented in the literature. On the other hand, our findings suggest that after an offer is received, these same factors of prestige and power appear to be associated with resistance. Finally, our results call into question previous views that corporate takeovers are a mechanism for disciplining or ridding the company of incompetent managers. Instead, our findings suggest that the nature of the takeover process (i.e., cooperative versus resistant) may do little more than perpetuate existing social structures. Powerful and prestigious managers may not suffer the same negative effects of takeovers as their less prestigious and less powerful counterparts."}, {"e:author": ["Will Mitchell", "Kulwant Singh"], "e:volume": "4", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.4.2.152", "e:keyword": ["Related diversification", "Organizational survival", "Technological change", "Industry evolution"], "e:pages": "152-180", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.4.2.152", "e:year": 1993, "e:title": "Death of the Lethargic: Effects of Expansion into New Technical Subfields on Performance in a Firm's Base Business", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "This paper finds that industry incumbents that do not expand into new technical subfields tend to fare poorly in their established businesses, even if the market for the established products continues to exist.

In evolutionary research, inertia is frequently invoked as an explanation for why organizations delay or completely fail to respond to changes in competitive pressure. Inertia is thus seen as a primary antecedent of strategic consequences such as impaired performance and organizational mortality. Such explanations, however, cannot be tested empirically without a satisfactory method for measuring levels of inertia. This paper draws on techniques from catastrophe theory to explore a means of assessing organizational inertia by modelling organizational response to competitive pressure. Specifically, this paper looks at competitive response in terms of the aggressiveness of an organization's strategy, and models this as a function of environmental pressure and the inhibiting or enabling effects of organizational design. This paper also reveals a method for measuring the level of inertia associated with organizational response to environmental pressure. The proposed methodology takes into account the rich, multidimensional nature of these constructs and accounts for effects that delay response in the face of radical change in competitive pressure. The method also captures both incremental and radical shifts in competitive response intensity. Key benefits of the methodology include the ability to measure inertia and to assess the effects of different design elements on this measure. It thus provides a means by which researchers can enrich their understanding of the antecedents of inertia and test its effects on such outcomes as performance and survival.

Organizational culture is hypothesized to consist of three interrelated dimensions: a sociocultural system of the perceived functioning of the organization's strategies and practices, an organizational value system, and the collective beliefs of the individuals working within the organization. Organizational culture is operationalized by several latent variables: organizational structure and purpose, organizational values, task organization, climate, and individual values and beliefs. These variables, in turn, are hypothesized to affect organizational performance. Analysis of data from 392 respondents who participated in the study confirms the fit of the proposed model to the data. The model presented in the study represents an initial attempt to describe and evaluate the effects of various dimensions of organizational culture. It appears that the comparison of visible aspects of culture across and within organizations can provide useful information for guiding the directions of organizations. By investigating the variables defined in this study further, it may eventually be possible to explain why some organizations are not performing at desired levels of productivity.

The model draws upon <i>social exchange theory</i>, which depicts social interactions in terms of the relative influence of actors, and upon <i>categorization theory</i>, which considers how information relating to social interaction is cognitively organized and processed. While the social arena can be categorized along any number of dimensions, the core proposal of the model is that, in the interest of reducing the complexity of the organizational world, people employ a schema (i.e., cognitive map) in which social interactions are categorized according to the relative influence of actors. The schema for participation is posited to be an individual-level knowledge structure with a strong shared component. The consensual aspect of the participation schema varies across cultures and subcultures, accounting for the wide cross-cultural variation in attitudes, norms, and values about participation. The model further proposes that the participation schema resembles the structure of much other world knowledge in that it organizes social situations into increasingly abstract and inclusive categories. Finally, the participation schema is posited to link to both emotion or affective information, as well as to action-oriented knowledge. Schema-based processing reduces the cognitive complexity of a workplace interaction because it enables individuals to 1) efficiently determine their relative influence in a workplace situation; 2) respond efficiently to the situation on an emotional level; and 3) call upon scripted sequences of appropriate behavior.

Yet such alliances are enormously complex to manage successfully, in part because of the opportunity and incentive to cheat, and profit at the partner's expense, that is an inescapable part of these relationships. Consequently, strategic alliances are frequently subject to high instability, poor performance, and premature dissolution.Thus, an important question arises: Is it possible to promote more stable cooperation and higher alliance performance through a realignment of companies' incentives? This question is addressed empirically in the present paper using recent work in game theory, which suggests that high performance is linked to specific elements of the alliance structure. Further, this study applies insights from international business literature, suggesting that alliance partners from different countries are often characterized by sharp cultural, national, and organizational differences, to test this linkage in an international context.The study's data strongly support the hypothesis that alliance performance is linked to alliance structure. This finding has broad implications both for managers and management scholars, in suggesting that “up front” attention to alliance structure may help arrest the high failure rates, and improve alliance stability and performance levels. However, the data also support the hypothesis that the linkage between structure and performance varies by partner nationality. This finding points to the need for: (a) systematic assessment of salient characteristics of potential international partners; (b) development of programs to effectively deal with important differences between partner firms; and (c) attention to different key alliance structure dimensions, depending upon partner nationality. Finally, this study shows game theory to provide an extremely useful perspective in understanding crucial aspects of strategic alliances, although in the analysis of cross-border strategic alliances, the perspective must be enriched by an appreciation of interfirm diversity."}, {"e:author": ["Robert E.

This paper reviews theory and hypothesizes that division managers' incentive compensation that is based on financial performance is negatively related to risk taking as measured by R&D intensity. Results of a study of 184 major U.S. firms suggest that incentives based on short-term (annual) division financial performance are negatively related to total firm R&D intensity after controlling for industry R&D intensity, firm diversification, size and group structure. Furthermore, the results suggest that an emphasis on long-term financial incentives may mitigate the negative relationship between these incentives and R&D intensity, but does not promote risk taking. The results suggest the importance of emphasizing strategic controls [evaluating division managers based on operational understanding of strategies proposed (strategic criteria)] as opposed to the use of financial controls [evaluating division managers based on financial performance (often annual ROI)]. However, the use of financial controls becomes more common as firms diversify. Diversification increases the span of control of corporate executives and the diversity among divisions. In highly diversified firms, corporate executives are no longer able to fully understand the operations of the multiple and diverse divisions. Thus, they must not only decentralize operating authority to divisions, but they also cannot use strategic criteria to evaluate division managers. As a result, they begin to emphasize financial controls. The shift toward risk aversion caused by the use of incentives based on short-term financial outcomes can have important implications for long-term firm performance. The results of this study have implications for long-term competitiveness, especially for firms in R&D intensive industries where R&D expenditures may affect a firm's competitive position."}, {"e:author": ["Sim B.

One group of factors suggests that employee consideration of litigation is motivated primarily by <i>self-interest</i>, as employers perceive they have more to gain than lose by going to court. A second group of factors suggests that employees' decision to go to court is influenced largely by the perceived <i>fairness</i> of their dealings with the organization. In a survey of 141 currently employed workers, we found that the perceived fairness of organizational rules and procedures was the primary factor influencing whether employees consider a litigious response. In particular, employees were concerned about how the rules and procedures were implemented and the quality of interpersonal treatment received from managers. Job satisfaction also had an impact on employees considering litigation. We argue that while our findings support organizational efforts to create more formalized policies and procedures that emphasize due process or procedural justice, such efforts, in and of themselves, may undermine the intended goal of ensuring fairness and reducing employee litigation. The solution to this dilemma is not in the creation of formal procedures per se, but in the moral and interpersonal conduct of those implementing the procedures.

The most profound change has been in the area of director liability. New legislation and regulations and a series of court decisions increased the extent to which directors are held accountable for their actions and those of their organizations. These changes resulted in increased liability exposure for directors and a crisis in director liability insurance. Corporations have successfully developed strategies to manage the adverse consequences of these changes in the legal environment.This paper develops an extension of resource dependence theory to enable us to analyze events surrounding the director liability crisis from the perspective of the corporation. It then reviews the legal forces which have affected boards of directors. The concept of director liability is discussed, including the business judgment rule, which has historically protected the decision making discretion of boards. Indemnification and director liability insurance, which provide protection from monetary penalties against directors arising from liability suits, are also described. Recent environmental changes which have affected director protection from liability are then examined. These include legislation specifying certain director responsibilities and granting additional enforcement powers to federal regulatory agencies, court decisions which expanded the personal liability of directors in several important ways, and changes in director liability insurance policies and markets.These developments increased the liability exposure of corporate directors and precipitated the director liability crisis of 1986. Corporations responded to this threat by making changes in board composition, director compensation, and board decision making structures and processes; by developing alternative forms of director liability insurance; and by lobbying for legislation providing greater liability protection for directors.

The widely accepted theoretical rationale is provided by transaction-cost theory which indicates that the total costs of going-to-market, inclusive of distribution as well as its administration, is likely to be lower for the direct option when the sales transactions require investments in unique assets for effectively serving the end customer. Examples of unique assets are account-specific sales teams and account dedicated repair and maintenance facilities. Conversely, transaction-cost theory indicates that an indirect option would be the more efficient one for sales transactions that require investments only in nonunique assets, such as an inventory of standard parts. Since its formulation in 1975, the transaction-cost framework has been empirically confirmed in a variety of marketing channel settings.It has been our observation, however, that most of these verifications have been of the easier rather than the more difficult problems in the field. Two such complex problems are: (1) the issue of hybrid channels, i.e., channel arrangements involving a sharing of going-to-market tasks between the direct and indirect channels, and (2) the evolution of channels from one form to the other, i.e., a direct channel evolving into an indirect channel and vice versa.To resolve our curiosity regarding the applicability of transaction-cost theory to these complex channel issues, we interviewed 50 key informants in 15 carefully selected manufacturing firms and 20 key informants in 7 related distribution firms. Because the purpose of our field research was to enhance our understanding of complex channel phenomena rather than to test existing theory, we did not gather structured quantitative data. Instead, we let managers describe to us the rationale for their channel choice decisions.In comparing the fit of our field observations to existing wisdom on transaction-cost theory, we reached the conclusion that the theory needs broadening in order to explain the variety and complexity of the real world channels we studied. In this paper, we attempt to suggest some useful directions for such enhancements. Specifically,(1) transaction-cost analysis is more meaningful when applied at the level of a channel function,(2) channel investments are influenced by a firm's uncertainty absorption mechanism, and(3) channel investments serve to raise competitive entry barriers."}, {"e:author": ["Steven L.

Why are most transactions arrayed neither at the pure “market” nor at the pure “hierarchy” end of the continuum, but rather in the “swollen middle,” incorporating features of both “market” and “hierarchy”? Why don't firms make greater use of price incentives? This paper addresses these three questions by developing a model of the choice of institution.One key building block is the distinction between organizing methods (hierarchy and the price system) and institutions (firms and markets). Hierarchy and the price system are two distinct methods for organizing transactions, each with particular costs and benefits. Markets and firms are institutions which use one or both of these methods. Although markets predominantly use prices and firms rely principally on hierarchy, there is not a one-to-one correspondence between prices and markets or between hierarchy and firms. Indeed, the paper argues that it is generally more efficient to use a mix of both methods than to specialize in either.The paper focuses on the enforcement properties of prices and hierarchy. Hierarchy controls individuals directly by constraining their behavior (by imposing behavior constraints) while prices do it indirectly by measuring their outputs (through price constraints). Under hierarchy, individuals receive a salary to do as told, while self-employed individuals governed by the price system are rewarded on the basis of their output. Each system has its own biases: using prices maximizes effort (minimizes shirking) but incites individuals to inflate the price and/or reduce the quality of their output. (It encourages cheating.) Relying on hierarchy results in the opposite bias: under hierarchy individuals are not paid in function of their output, but instead are rewarded for following directives. They have, thus, strong incentives to minimize effort (to shirk) unless properly supervised, but, being paid a fixed sum to follow orders, they have few incentives to cheat. Hence the price system experiences low shirking, but potentially high cheating costs, while hierarchy faces low cheating but high shirking costs.Organizing costs are the sum of shirking and cheating costs. Any given transaction will be organized by the mix of price and hierarchy (i.e., by the mix of price and behavior constraints) that minimizes organizing costs. A transaction will be organized within a firm if the reduction in cheating costs achieved by replacing price constraints by behavior constraints exceeds the resulting increase in shirking costs and by the market in the opposite case.The paper shows that cheating and shirking costs increase more than proportionately as one concentrates in either pure price or behavior constraints. Hence using a mix of both methods generally minimizes the sum of cheating and shirking costs. This explains why most transactions exhibit features of both markets and hierarchy. The paper shows clearly the tradeoff involved between price and behavior constraints. It explains the costs and benefits of using two types of price incentives in firms, piecework and profit centers, and predicts when they will be used."}, {"e:author": ["Rajiv Sabherwal", "Daniel Robey"], "e:volume": "4", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.4.4.548", "e:keyword": ["Information systems", "Implementation processes", "Event sequence analysis"], "e:pages": "548-576", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.4.4.548", "e:year": 1993, "e:title": "An Empirical Taxonomy of Implementation Processes Based on Sequences of Events in Information System Development", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "A widely accepted and usable taxonomy is a fundamental element in the development of a scientific body of knowledge. However, the creation of good empirical taxonomies of implementation processes is complicated by the need to consider the dynamics of the implementation process. This paper addresses this difficulty by using an optimal matching procedure to measure the pairwise distances among event sequences occurring in 53 computer-based information system (IS) implementation projects. Cluster analysis based on these inter-sequence distances is used to generate the empirical taxonomy of implementation processes.The resulting taxonomy includes six distinct archetypical processes. One of the process types is labeled <i>textbook life cycle</i> (type 4) due to its close resemblance to the detailed, rational approach commonly prescribed in IS textbooks. The <i>logical minimalist</i> process (type 1) follows some of the basic steps of the textbook approach, but is characterized by little project definition and infrequent assignment of personnel. Whereas both textbook life cycle and logical minimalist approaches use external vendors and consultants to some extent, external dependence is much greater in <i>traditional off-the-shelf</i> (type 2) and <i>outsourced cooperative</i> (type 5) processes. The traditional off-the-shelf process simply involves purchasing the system from an external vendor, with little system construction or assignment of personnel. In contrast, the outsourced cooperative process consists of joint system development by internally assigned personnel and external vendors. The remaining two process types—<i>problem-driven minimalist</i> (type 3) and <i>in-house trial and error</i> (type 6)—are both considerably influenced by performance problems. The problem-driven minimalist process is initiated by such problems, with little project definition, and results in a reassignment of organizational roles. The in-house trial-and-error process begins like textbook life cycle, with a clear project definition, but involves frequent system modifications to respond to the performance problems encountered during the project.The paper demonstrates how an empirical taxonomy that incorporates the dynamics of event sequences may be developed. The archetypes comprising the taxonomy are related to other implementation process models available in the literature.

In particular, it highlights the role of rhetoric in the readers' interaction with and interpretation of the accounts. Extending relevant work in the literatures of organization studies, anthropology and literary criticism, the paper develops three dimensions—authenticity, plausibility and criticality—central to the process of convincing. Further, through the analysis of a sample of ethnographic articles, it discloses the particular writing practices and more general strategies that make claims on readers to engage the texts and to accept that these three dimensions have been achieved. Through authenticity, ethnographic texts appeal to readers to accept that the researcher was indeed present in the field and grasped how the members understood their world. Strategies to achieve authenticity include: particularizing everyday life, delineating the relationship between the researcher and organization members, depicting the disciplined pursuit and analysis of data, and qualifying personal biases. Through plausibility, ethnographic texts make claims on readers to accept that the findings make a distinctive contribution to issues of common concern. Plausibility is accomplished by strategies that normalize unorthodox methodologies, recruit the reader, legitimate atypical situations, smooth contestable assertions, build dramatic anticipation, and differentiate the findings. Finally, through criticality, ethnographic texts endeavor to probe readers to re-examine the taken-for-granted assumptions that underly their work. Strategies to achieve criticality include: carving out room to reflect, provoking the recognition and examination of differences, and enabling readers to imagine new possibilities. The empirical analyses, which highlight both the rhetorical and substantive aspects of convincing, suggest that at a minimum ethnographic texts must achieve both authenticity and plausibility—that is, they must convey the vitality and uniqueness of the field situation and also build their case for the particular contribution of the findings to a disciplinary area of common interest. These analyses also suggest that the most provocative task and promising potential of ethnography is the use of richly-grounded data to not only reflect on the members' world, but more importantly to provoke an examination of the readers' prevailing assumptions and beliefs."}, {"e:author": ["Diana C.

The study develops fourteen ethics-related selling scenarios and assesses, via projective questioning, how 446 salespeople would react to them. Findings indicate that organization design does influence the behavior a salesperson considers appropriate to cope with ethical conflicts. In particular, salespeople operating under a more bureaucratic, input-based control system advocate more ethical behavior than do salespeople operating under a more output-based, laissez-faire control system. Also, salespeople who perceive the market to be competitive recommend less ethical behavior. However, the proportion of salary versus commission in the salesperson's compensation system does not have an effect on response. Differences are also discovered with respect to the salesperson's seniority, rank, and certain features of the task environment."}, {"e:author": ["S. Lioukas", "D. Bourantas", "V.

That is, the administrator is viewed as an individual learner operating within an ecology of other learning administrators.Researchers have assumed that skills (information processing abilities gained from learning by doing) are more important than knowledge (the relatively formal and established facts, rules, policies, and procedures within the organization) in predicting how the individual and context effects of experience affect administrators' information-processing performance. However, using a survey of administrators in a multi-unit organization (<i>N</i> = 415), it is demonstrated that a model that assumes that knowledge is the primary intervening variable between experience and enhanced information processing correctly predicts both the individual and context effects of experience on information processing, such as the negative relationship between individual experience and the need for breadth and depth of information and getting less information than needed, and the negative relationships between average experience of an administrators' unit and receiving more information than needed. A model based on skills-acquisition as the primary intervening variable between experience and information-processing performance predicts contrary, and hence incorrect, results, leading us to conclude that knowledge is the primary result of experience for administrators.

Considerable support for the congruence concept is provided via an analysis of data on over 100 labor arbitrators. The findings indicate that (1) arbitrators work in a predominantly professional context and (2) professional motivation is closely associated with various indexes of arbitrator effectiveness. Effective arbitrators are more motivated to provide help to others, more desirous of status, more interested in acquiring knowledge and learning, more professionally committed, and to a somewhat lesser degree more desirous of acting independently. These patterns are found to characterize the lawyers within the sample to at least an equal degree. The data indicate that the professional organizational form encompasses professional components of otherwise bureaucratic organizations such as universities and governments, professional organizations such as law firms, and private professional practices.

Afterwards, modification of new process technologies by users is limited by the increasing routinization that occurs with experience.

Developers and users of these systems hold high hopes for their potential to change organizations for the better, but actual changes often do not occur, or occur inconsistently. We propose <i>adaptive structuration theory</i> (AST) as a viable approach for studying the role of advanced information technologies in organization change. AST examines the change process from two vantage points: (1) the types of structures that are provided by advanced technologies, and (2) the structures that actually emerge in human action as people interact with these technologies. To illustrate the principles of AST, we consider the small group meeting and the use of a group decision support system (GDSS). A GDSS is an interesting technology for study because it can be structured in a myriad of ways, and social interaction unfolds as the GDSS is used. Both the structure of the technology and the emergent structure of social action can be studied.We begin by positioning AST among competing theoretical perspectives of technology and change. Next, we describe the theoretical roots and scope of the theory as it is applied to GDSS use and state the essential assumptions, concepts, and propositions of AST. We outline an analytic strategy for applying AST principles and provide an illustration of how our analytic approach can shed light on the impacts of advanced technologies on organizations. A major strength of AST is that it expounds the nature of social structures within advanced information technologies and the key interaction processes that figure in their use. By capturing these processes and tracing their impacts, we can reveal the complexity of technology-organization relationships. We can attain a better understanding of how to implement technologies, and we may also be able to develop improved designs or educational programs that promote productive adaptations."}, {"e:author": ["Diana L.

Using a broadly based sample of Fortune 1000 firms, the study supports both bottom-up and top-down processes including a special dual-role principal champion, who acts both as product champion and organizational sponsor. The functions or roles of these top management and dual-role champions are quite different from bottom-up champions and represent relatively unexplored top-down championing processes. Preliminary results show support for an emerging theory that top management champions arise when ventures are expensive and visible and when they represent new strategic directions or resource reconfigurations for the firm. In contrast, dual-role champions emerge from the firm's upper ranks when an innovative idea is highly uncertain but not technology-driven.

This is particularly true for more highly applied R&D, which tends to involve incremental technological change and often entails alterations and enhancements to existing firm assets, production processes, and products. The often firm-specific nature of corporate R&D tends to receive relatively little attention in the study of technological innovation. This article outlines the primary characteristics of firm-specificity in R&D, and discusses two interrelated consequences of such firm-specificity: (1) heterogeneity in the R&D applications of firms within an industry, and (2) increased ability of firms to earn returns to R&D (often termed “appropriability”).

Shifting the focus from the observable similarity of products provided by the firm, to the less observable underlying resources required in different industries, can be a useful and interesting way of looking at patterns of diversification. The theory outlined in the paper suggests that firms diversify within groups of industries that are related to one another in the types of human skills and expertise required in each industry. Within these resource-related industry groups, firms can more efficiently utilize their resources by sharing and transferring them across similar products. The theory was tested with a sample of 12,781 diversified firms operating in all sections of the U.S. economy. Across the firms studied, much of a firm's diversification was found to be on average within resource-related industry groups and was consistent with the efficiency arguments developed.

Product innovation, therefore, is illegitimate. This means that to enhance their innovative abilities, managers must weave the activities of product innovation into their institutionalized system of thought and action, not merely change structures or add values. We use insights from 134 innovators to identify the different ways that product innovation is illegitimate, and to consider alternate ways to overcome these problems. Exploratory results suggest that successful product innovators experience as many instances of illegitimacy as others, but creatively reframed their activities more often to legitimate their work.

This single level focus makes these theories incomplete representations of how strategic decisions are actually made in organizations. We believe an integration of these two levels is necessary for a comprehensive view of choice. This paper thus proposes a parallel process model of strategic decision making that integrates organizational and individual level information processing perspectives. The integrated, comprehensive view afforded by the proposed model enhances understanding of strategic decision making by identifying (1) multiple ways in which bias can enter into choices and (2) dual level influences on decision activities such as information gathering and alternative generation.The proposed model portrays strategic decision making as complex, multilevel information processing and choices as emergent outcomes of that processing. The model is developed as follows. First, the individual level of the model is generated by recognizing that people process information in stages. The notion of stages is used because it depicts the basic structure of information processing and is widely supported by empirical research. Second, the organizational level of the model is articulated by acknowledging organizations (1) process information in stages and (2) exhibit information processing activities analogous to those at the individual level. Third, a series of linking mechanisms connecting individual information processing stages to analogous organizational level ones is proposed. These linking mechanisms thus conceptually operationalize the integration of the two levels. Fourth, three contingency variables are presented to flesh out the model and formulate propositions. Contingency variables specifically acknowledge differences in information processing across organizations.

This paper addresses this neglect by focusing on culture's manifestation in individuals' sensemaking structures and processes. Building off the social cognition literature, I propose that organizational culture's influence on individual sensemaking is revealed in the operation of a patterned system of organization-specific schemas. Schemas refer to the cognitive structures in which an individual's knowledge is retained and organized. In addition to being knowledge repositories, schemas also direct information acquisition and processing. They guide answering the questions central to sensemaking efforts: “What or who is it?,” “What are its implications; what does it mean?,” and “How should I respond?”After a brief review of schema theory, the categories of schema knowledge relevant to understanding sensemaking in organizations and the cultural influences on their emergence are examined. The conscious and unconscious operation of these schemas in the actual process of making sense of organizational stimuli is framed within a schema-directed, intrapsychic, mental dialogue perspective on social cognition. Specifically, I propose that in the social setting of organizations, individuals make sense out of their experiences based in large part on the outcomes of contrived mental dialogues between themselves (e.g., “I think it means this and I would be inclined toward this response”) and other contextually-relevant (past or present; real or imagined) individuals or groups (e.g., “What would my boss and peers think about this? What would they want me to do?”). The content of the argument provided for others is guided by the individual's schemas for those others. I close the paper by discussing the ways in which this schema-based perspective enhances our under-standing of the individual experiences of cultural sharing, subcultural boundaries, and psychological attachment."}, {"e:author": ["Mauri Laukkanen"], "e:volume": "5", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.5.3.322", "e:keyword": ["Cognitive mapping", "Cause mapping", "Comparative cognitive analysis", "Industry cognition", "Management cognition", "Organization cognition", "Computerized social research methods", "CMAP"], "e:pages": "322-343", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.5.3.322", "e:year": 1994, "e:title": "Comparative Cause Mapping of Organizational Cognitions", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Increasingly, thoughtful managers recognize the role of knowledge and learning in corporate action and performance. Concurrently, a new field, management and organization cognition (MOC), has emerged producing useful insights and findings. Thus far, empirical studies have largely focused on single cases or actors, using often archival data and sometimes ambiguous methods. To advance the field will require pragmatic tools for eliciting data on thinking in real organizations and for conducting rigorous and more comparative studies of management and organization cognitions.This paper describes a method for comparatively studying real-life managerial thinking, defined here as the respective manager's beliefs about key phenomena and their efficacy links in their strategic and operative situation. The applicability of such a definition will depend on the requirements of research at hand. The payoff is that, thus defined, key elements in managerial and organizational cognitions can be usefully captured by cognitive mapping, an established approach in MOC research.The approach contains, first, a method for eliciting comparison-enabling interview data of several subjects. Then, using researcher-based, interpretive standardization of the individual natural discourses, databases of standard concepts and causal links, constituting the cause map elements, are distilled. This facilitates a text-oriented description of the thinking patterns of single actors like managers or organizational groups, which can be used in traditional-type mapping studies, which typically assume unitary or quasi-unitary actors. However, the method is intended for comparative analyses, e.g., for pinpointing the cognitive differences or similarities across organizational actors or for constructing and comparing groups, assumed cognitively homogenous. Also, it is applicable for longitudinal studies or aggregated, e.g., industry-level, descriptions of MOC. A PC application is available for the technique, although many of the processing tasks are amenable to general-purpose relational database software.The paper presents a study case comparing the cognitive structures of managers in two interrelated industries in terms of their concept bases and causal beliefs. The objective was to understand the substance of management thinking, as well as the formative logic behind how managers come to think in the shared ways. It is shown that patterns of industry-typical core causal thinking, manifestations of a dominant logic or recipe, can be located, operationalized and comparatively analyzed with this method. Substantively, the contents of management thinking are typically products of complex long-term mechanisms. These consist, first, of organizational problem-solving, recurrently facing a specific, adequately stable constellation of strategic tasks and environment elements, similar within industries and systematically different across them, and, second, of various social processes, which directly transfer and influence management thinking. The paper concludes with discussing the cause mapping method and suggests some options for further studies."}, {"e:author": ["Raghu Garud", "Michael A.

Our model focuses on the relationship between the beliefs researchers hold about what is and is not technically feasible, the technological artifacts they create, and the routines they use for evaluating how well their artifacts meet with their prior expectations.The historical development of cochlear implants serves as an illustration of the model. The evidence suggests that there is a reciprocal interaction between beliefs, artifacts, and routines that gives rise to two cyclical processes. One is a process of inversion at the micro level of individual cognition wherein evaluation routines designed to judge specific artifacts begin reinforcing researchers' beliefs. Once evaluation routines become the basis for constructing individual reality, technological claims are perceived as relevant only to those who employ the same routines while appearing as noise to those who employ different routines.The other is a process of institutionalization at the macro level of shared cognition. By institutionalization we mean the development of a common set of evaluation routines that can be applied to all technological paths. Commonly accepted evaluation routines represent a shared reality that strongly shapes the direction of future technological change.The micro- and macro-level processes that shape individual and shared realities place paradoxical demands on researchers in their efforts to develop a new technology. On the one hand, researchers must create and believe in their own realities in order to make progress in their chosen paths and convince others. On the other hand, researchers must also be ready to disbelieve their realities and be willing to embrace the emerging shared reality even if it does not match theirs. How well this paradox is managed can profoundly influence who emerges as the victor or the vanquished during the genesis of a technology."}, {"e:author": ["Dennis A. Gioia", "James B.

It employed an ethnographic/interpretive approach in examining the ways that symbols, metaphors, and various subtle influence processes were used to lend meaning to concepts and possible courses of action by a task force instrumental to the strategic change process. Two distinct researcher perspectives were used: an “insider” perspective employing several informants along with an active participant-observer and an “outsider” perspective employing several researchers. Both perspectives were brought to bear as a means of countering the “researcher arrogance” that typifies organizational study by lending balanced voice to both insider and outsider interpretations of events. The findings showed that sensemaking and influence emerged as fundamental processes in the instigation of strategic change. Both processes were symbolically based and varied in directionality over the life of the task force (internally directed in the embryonic phases, and externally directed in the mature phases). Contrary to common wisdom, sensemaking and influence emerged as frequently coincident, interdependent processes that were difficult to distinguish from each other. The discovery of the common symbolic base for scnsemaking and influence also indicated that symbols served both expressive and instrumental roles: suggesting that the accepted view of symbols as predominantly expressive devices does not present a complete picture of their dynamic nature. The use of symbolism also was shown simultaneously to reveal and conceal different aspects of the change process, thus providing task force members the means to circumvent resistance while accomplishing desired action. Symbols and metaphors thus facilitated both cognitive understanding and intended action in attempting to “reinstitutionalize” a major public university via the strategic change process. Overall, the study suggests that efforts to stabilize an organizational system in flux from the systematic upheaval represented by strategic change can be understood as the symbolic interplay between sensemaking and influence."}, {"e:author": ["Margaret E.

In this paper, the existence of <i>industry</i> cultures is explored. Previous studies of industry-based cognitive constructs have narrowly focused on top managers' mental models for strategic decision making. Here, broad-based assumption sets comprising the cultural knowledge widely shared among organizational participants within two industries (fine arts museums and California wineries) are surfaced and compared. A cognitive definition of culture and a modified ethnographic methodology frame the inquiry. The research process balances the requirements of the inductive method with the logistics of doing research in settings as broad in scope as “industry” and into issues as amorphous as “culture in modern organizations.” This process involves the selection and in-depth interviewing of 96 informants in 12 organizations, representing a cross-section of members of these two industries. The distinct assumption sets that surface for each industry demonstrate, among other things, substantial differences in conceptualizations of membership, competition, the origins of “truth,” the purpose of work, and the nature of work relationships. The findings suggest that the current narrow focus in research on industry-based cognitive constructs can be productively broadened to include a fuller range of cultural elements and a wider set of industry participants. The surfacing of distinct industry mindsets reinforces the emerging belief that a multiplicity of dynamic, shared mindsets exist within an organization's environment.

Unlike individual learning, however, collective learning also involves developing enough consensus around those diverse interpretations for organized action to result. Traditional measures of organizational consensus are unable to capture the multiplex nature of collective agreement that encompasses both unity and diversity. Traditional wisdom thus suggests that to achieve unity in groups, one must sacrifice diversity.This study breaks the notion of consensus into two component parts: consensus around interpretations embedded in the content and in the framing of communications. Communicated content consists of the labels people use to convey their “pictures” of reality, e.g., pictures of issues as threats or as opportunities. The framing of communications refers to the form people use to construct a picture, regardless of its content, e.g., rigid or flexible perceptions of an issue. People may hold very different pictures of reality and still agree on the way they frame them. It is thus possible for groups to simultaneously agree and disagree, an essential component of collective learning.Simultaneous agreement and disagreement is especially important in corporate innovative efforts. Successful corporate innovation requires that decision makers develop a collective understanding that incorporates the new and the different. This paper describes the changing pictures and frames communicated in a new-venture development process in a large financial institution over a two-year period. Several linguistic analyses show how the venture team members developed unified ways of framing their arguments, while at the same time maintaining diversity through differences in the content of team members' interpretations. The results reveal one way that organizations manage to combine the unity and diversity needed for collective learning. The managerial implications present a challenge for anyone wishing to promote learning as a community: managers must actively encourage the development of different and conflicting views of what is thought to be true, while striving for a shared framing of the issues that is broad enough to encompass those differences."}, {"e:author": ["Richard L.

First, judgment—defined as an individual's understanding of relationships among objects—governs the strategic choices made by top managers. Second, prescriptive strategy theories recommend the judgments that executives “should” use, but there is little evidence specifically tying executive judgment to firm performance.Part of this research is essentially a “laboratory” study of executive judgment that was conducted in the field.

The second part of the study was a field survey wherein other top executives of each firm reported on their firm's actual strategy, strategy making processes, structure, competitive environment and performance. Both the chief executives' judgments and the actual alignments were compared to the matches recommended as “best” by contingency theory. The hypotheses tested link the two parts of the study. Some predict relationships between judgment policies, realized alignments, and firm performance. Others attempt to identify factors that may lead to differences in executives' judgments.Results indicate that chief executive judgment is strongly related to the actual organizational alignment. Further, judgment policies that favor the strategy-structure-environment matches recommended by contingency theory produce higher performance than do other judgment policies.

Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) and Vice-Presidents of Corporate Development (VPs) in the diversified foods industry were tape recorded as they thought aloud while evaluating four restaurant chains which were candidates for corporate acquisition. The experiment was designed so that these four acquisition candidates varied with respect to key financial and profitability data and such measures of a firm's strategic business position as product concept, markets, distribution channels, labor relations, and managerial expertise and loyalty. The attributes of financial performance and strategic position embedded in the descriptions of candidate firms were validated by an expert panel. The executives also provided rating-scale evaluations of the strategic, financial, and overall desirability of the four candidate firms.The taped thought processes (verbal protocols) were analyzed to determine whether CFOs and VPs differed when evaluating the overall desirability of the acquisition candidates in their use of such lines of reasoning as assessments of the candidate's competitive environment, financial strength, management, operations, and the potential financial, managerial, and operational synergies offered by the proposed acquisition. The probability of generating these assessments during the evaluation process did not appear to be related to expertise based on experience or organizational role.When the protocols were analyzed with respect to specific business issues identified by CFOs and VPs when evaluating acquisition candidates, however, there was a role/experience effect. Overall ratings of candidate-firm desirability were straightforward functions of the executive's ratings of the candidate's strategic position and financial performance. On average, VPs tended to be more optimistic in their evaluations than CFOs.There is modest statistical evidence that VPs and CFOs differ in the emphasis they place on strategic and financial ratings in evaluating a candidate's overall promise. VPs tend to take a balanced view in forming their overall ratings, whereas CFOs place the predominant weight on financial matters.The similarity in lines of reasoning used by CFOs and VPs presents evidence of shared expertise at the corporate level. The difference in the attention that CFOs and VPs place on specific business issues suggests that collectively these different perspectives constitute an adaptive survival mechanism which evolves in successful organizations. The mechanism complements the shared expertise and protects organizations from making flawed strategic decisions. Analyzing these role/experience-based differences has value in developing an understanding of how organizations do and should integrate recommendations from executive officers of various functional areas."}, {"e:author": ["Richard J.

Organizational learning or organizational cognition are familiar terms, but it is only the individual persons in an organization who create interpretations and test understandings, as they think and learn in their organizational setting. Coordinated outcomes emerge in organizations when individuals think and act in ways that take others in the organization and their interdependencies into account.We argue that much of the effort to design information technology to support cognition in organizations has not addressed its distributed quality. Such systems have tended to focus either on the individual as an isolated decision maker, or on the group as a producer of a decision or policy statement in common. In distributed cognition, by contrast, the group is a set of autonomous agents who act independently yet recognize that they have interdependencies. To guide the design of information technology, we propose that distributed cognition be viewed as a hermeneutic process of inquiry, emphasizing the importance of individual interpretation and group dialogue.Hermeneutics provides a theory of the interpretive process through which an individual gives meaning to organizational experience. Inquiry systems provide a theory of how a community of inquirers build and test knowledge representations through dialogue. Together, hermeneutics and inquiry systems are used to propose a set of design principles to guide the development of information technology that supports distributed cognition. The design principles we describe in the paper are ownership, easy travel, multiplicity, indeterminacy, emergence and mixed forms.Applications of information technology which embody these design principles would support distributed cognition by assisting individuals in making interpretations of their situation, reflecting on them, and engaging in dialogue about them with others. The objective is to refine their own understanding of the situation and better appreciate the understandings of others, enabling them to better take their interdependencies into account in their individual actions.

Organizational niches characterize the different resource requirements and productive capacities of individual organizations in a population. Depending on which organizational niches are targeted, entrepreneurs will face different competitive landscapes. For a population of day care centers (DCCs), we measure organizational niches and compute organizational niche overlaps in terms of the ages of children they are licensed to enroll. Using weights based on organizational niche overlaps, we disaggregate population density (i.e., the number of DCCs) into <i>overlap</i> density and <i>nonoverlap</i> density to measure the potential for competition and cooperation among DCCs. The overlap density of an organizational niche is equal to population density weighted by the overlaps of the focal organizational niche with all other organizational niches. Conversely, non-overlap density is equal to population density weighted by the absence of overlaps of a focal organizational niche with all other organizational niches. We hypothesize that overlap density will be negatively related to the founding rate. We expect entrepreneurs will be much less likely to target or be capable of founding organizations in crowded parts of the resource space than parts that are less densely populated. We also hypothesize that nonoverlap density will be positively related to the founding rate. This is because differentiated DCCs do not compete directly for resources, and, at the same time, their presence can have facilitative influences through complementary demand enhancement and widening social acceptance of the organization form. Supporting these predictions, a dynamic analysis showed that overlap density had a competitive effect on the founding rate, while nonoverlap density had a positive effect. Parallel effects were obtained when overlap and nonoverlap densities were further disaggregated on the basis of geographic proximity into local and diffuse components. Overall, our findings are consistent with earlier research on organizational founding at the population level, but reveal intrapopulation patterns of mutualism and competition that influence the likelihood of organizations being established in different organizational niches. The key result of this study, that location in a multidimensional resource space, together with the distribution of other competitors and noncompetitors, has a significant impact on founding probabilities serves to illuminate some of the underlying dynamics of competition and mutualism that impact strategic and entrepreneurial processes."}, {"e:author": ["M.

This paper examines how and why managers use electronic mail. Today, one of the more influential theories of media choice in organization and information science is information richness theory, which has stimulated much empirical research on media selection and has clear implications for how managers should use media. Despite numerous modifications and elaborations, information richness theory remains an individual-level rational choice explanation of behavior, and as such it differs fundamentally from theories that emphasize the social context of managers' communication and media choice behavior. While the weight of informed opinion seems to be shifting toward social theories of media selection and use, much empirical research continues to test individual-level rational choice models.A multi-method investigation was designed to assess the power of information richness theory, relative to alternative social theories, to explain and predict managers' use of email. Managers were found to perceive various media in ways that were relatively consistent with information richness theory, but to use email more and differently than the theory predicted. In particular, effective senior managers were found to use email heavily and even for equivocal communications tasks. These results cannot be explained by information richness theory or by simple modifications of the theory. Rather, they suggest that the adoption, use, and consequences of media in organizations can be powerfully shaped by social processes such as sponsorship, socialization, and social control, which require social perspectives to understand them. These processes can result in differences across organizations and other social units in the patterns of using traditional media like the telephone, but such differences are even more likely for new media, like electronic mail."}, {"e:author": ["Pamela R.

Three factors that may create commitment to a particular target were investigated: (1) personal responsibility for the decision to acquire the target, (2) competition for the target, and (3) whether the decision to acquire the target is public. These factors were varied in a simulated corporate acquisition where participants began an acquisition and then were given negative information about the target. They were later given the choice of continuing with the acquisition or withdrawing and investing elsewhere. As predicted, personal responsibility for the decision to acquire the target, competition for the target, and a public decision context all increased participants' commitment to acquiring the target, despite the negative information. Participant work and acquisition experience did not affect these results.Field studies of acquisitions suggest that commitment to acquiring a specific target occurs during the acquisition process. Since the acquisition process is a potentially important determinant of acquisition outcomes, commitment to targets has negative implications for these outcomes. This study adds a systematic empirical investigation of the determinants of commitment in acquisition situations. Studies in nonacquisition settings have demonstrated that personal responsibility affects commitment. However, the presence of competition has not previously been studied, and a public decision context has only been studied in a limited way. These are important factors in generating commitment to acquisitions. These results suggest that managers should recognize that overcommitment can and does occur during acquisitions. Further, the factors that cause overcommitment to targets have implications for managers who wish to avoid this commitment. Activities that should help avoid overcommitment problems include assigning target choice and due diligence activities to different individuals, and limiting news of impending acquisitions."}, {"e:author": ["Art Budros"], "e:volume": "5", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.5.4.541", "e:keyword": ["Density dependence", "Entrepreneurship", "Life insurance", "Organizational births", "Organizational ecology"], "e:pages": "541-553", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.5.4.541", "e:year": 1994, "e:title": "Analyzing Unexpected Density Dependence Effects on Organizational Births in New York's Life Insurance Industry, 1842–1904", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Organizational ecologists argue that numbers of firms (density dependence) significantly affect industrial development. Rising numbers of firms are thought to legitimize a young industry, leading persons to launch new firms in the industry; but in a more crowded, older industry, increasing numbers of companies are expected to intensify competition, producing a decline in organizational births. Since this argument dominates ecological theory, results that challenge it must be explained. I identify six reasons for such results. Only a few of these explanations have been evaluated empirically and the ideas rarely have been assessed with respect to organizational births. Therefore, I address these explanations in order to resolve unexpected density dependence effects on foundings in New York's life insurance industry from 1842 to 1904. Measuring numbers of life insurance operators at both the state (New York) and national (U.S.) levels of analysis resolves the unexpected density dynamics in this study and produces a coherent pattern of density findings. Further, numbers of mutual savings banks and numbers of small life insurers in New York created competitive pressures in the life insurance business, leading persons to abandon carrier entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship also suffered when the life insurance industry was dominated by a few large sellers. More generally, the evidence shows that New York was divided into two insurance submarkets and that carrier organizers reacted to legitimation and competition trends in the submarket occupied by domestic insurers. I conclude that once we consider the reasons for unexpected density dynamics, the core model of density dependence offers a cogent explanation for industrial evolution."}, {"e:author": ["Michael D.

It is memory for how things are done that is relatively automatic and inarticulate, and it encompasses both cognitive and motor activities.We report an experiment in which paired subjects developed interlocked task performance patterns that display the chief characteristics of organizational routines.

Modern organizations—even those Kerr specifically criticizes as “fouled-up”—frequently need to serve two contradictory goals at the same time.Three conditions in particular require sophisticated organizations to reward A while nonetheless hoping for B. First, <i>operative</i> goals—e.g., for a police department—may require practical activities like “social work” that do not conform to the <i>official</i> culture of “crime fighting command bureaucracy.” Attempting to reward only these police activities which support the official goals would harm both the force and the citizens they serve. Second, times of great change—e.g., for environmental clean-up in Eastern Europe—require short-term inconsistencies such as supporting a highly polluting factory in order to accomplish long term ends. At one moment in time, a snapshot exposes a “foolish” inconsistency, but a long-term view reveals the wisdom of not attempting to treat complex problems with simple solutions. Third, some conditions of the real world will always require the individual to serve two masters, as in a classic matrix structure. Product and functional demands cannot be made perfectly consistent with each other, and to expect the organization to make them so is to wish for the impossible.Under the above conditions, it is better to teach individuals how to handle complex, inconsistent demands than it is to hold organizations responsible for eliminating them. While Kerr would work towards an organization in which “no one needs goodness,” we would hold our teaching and training systems responsible for making “goodness” and complexity part of the talent an individual brings to the organization. To put complexity and goodness beyond the individual and entirely in the province of the organization is to demand of the organization the impossible, and demean the human beings who are its substance and soul."}, {"e:author": ["Gordon Walker"], "e:volume": "5", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.5.4.583", "e:keyword": ["Supplier performance", "Institutional economics", "Transaction costs", "Comparative studies"], "e:pages": "583-593", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.5.4.583", "e:year": 1994, "e:title": "Asset Choice and Supplier Performance in Two Organizations–US and Japanese", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "The problem of vertical integration is a venerable but increasingly important focus of attention in profit-seeking organizations. Over the past ten years, many industries have seen increased cooperation between buyers and suppliers to achieve more difficult goals caused by rising product market competition. In many firms, this cooperation is balanced against the putative advantages of diminishing but still substantial in-house operations.One way to compare the performance of cooperative suppliers with in-house operations is to focus on the buyer's choice of assets used to produce the inputs needed for the final product. For strategic reasons, some of these assets will be highly specialized and others standardized. The question this paper asks is whether this choice of specialized or standard assets influences the performance of the supplier, controlling for whether it is in the market or in-house.The hypothesis is that the choice of specialized assets, for strategic reasons, is associated with lower supplier conformance with the buyer's target price for the input. In other words, for these assets the supplier's price, which is higher than the buyer would have liked to pay, reflects some of the strategic value of the input to the buyer. The supplier is simply appropriating some of this value, since it can raise its price with a low threat of termination by the buyer. For standard assets, in contrast the threat of termination is omnipresent, so that the choice of assets is irrelevant for supplier price performance.The test is performed using data on both in-house operations and market suppliers from a quite large US manufacturing firm and on market suppliers to a very successful Japanese manufacturing firm. Interestingly, there is no difference between these firms in the applicability of the hypothesis. Also, in-house and market suppliers differ in price performance only for standard assets, market suppliers performing better. Organizations can therefore gain quite a bit from outsourcing the production of less specialized inputs but achieve roughly the same performance from in-house and market suppliers for more specialized inputs. This last result is controversial and should bc tested repeatedly using other micro-level data.This study therefore addresses three sides of the current debate surrounding modern questions of vertical integration. First, does the strategic value of the input make a difference in supplier performance? The answer is yes, but only for specialized inputs. Second, do in-house and market suppliers differ in their performance? The answer is yes, but only for standardized inputs. Third, do US and Japanese firms differ in the performance of their suppliers, given variation in asset specialization and strategic importance? The answer is no, at least for the two firms studied here. All caveats regarding the generalizability of results from small sample studies apply."}, {"e:author": ["Robert C.

Past research has examined each of these concepts individually without considering potential interactive effects. Moreover, most past studies have used global measurements ignoring critical dimensions within each concept. For example, most studies of ownership/control have examined the effects of dominant control by one partner versus shared influence. This approach overlooks the possibility that joint venture parents may exert varying degrees of control over decision making in the different functional areas.Personal interviews of 98 managers involved in oil and gas exploration and production joint ventures are used in an investigation of the three joint venture concepts. In this industry, complementarity had little if any effect on joint venture performance. In fact, complementarity actually appeared to have a negative impact on several dimensions of joint venture performance. Qualitative data suggest that joint venture partners with distinctive competencies in different functional areas may experience difficulties in implementing potential complementarities. Moreover, it may be important for all joint venture partners to perceive some influence over the strategic decisions of the joint venture, regardless of their actual influence over those decisions.Perhaps the most important implications of this study are for future joint venture research. First, a dimensionalized approach to the issues of implementation and performance is justified. Examining ownership/control over each functional area provided additional insights into issues of joint venture management and aided in explaining the results of tests using global measures. Second, analyses of joint venture autonomy and ownership/control produced different results based on the functional area under consideration. Thus, the use of global measures is likely to result in the loss of information.Third, joint venture performance is a multidimensional concept. The results of the analyses related to performance varied according to the dimension of performance under consideration. Some measures of performance were actually negatively related to others. It is believed that this outcome is appropriate. Performance is measured relative to the various goals established for a joint venture. Some goals may be in conflict with others or present managers with tradeoffs to consider. Research that fails to consider multiple dimensions of performance may lose some of the richness of the performance concept. Finally, joint ventures are particularly likely to be subject to goal conflicts since they are formed by two or more firms, each with its own set of goals. Ultimately, a joint venture is measured by the extent to which the venture meets the goals and expectations of the individual partners. As a result, it is necessary for joint venture research to examine performance related issues from the perspective of the individual partners."}, {"e:author": ["Alfred Kieser"], "e:volume": "5", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.5.4.608", "e:keyword": ["Organization theory", "Historical analysis", "Putting-out systems", "Transaction cost economics", "Labor process theory"], "e:pages": "608-620", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.5.4.608", "e:year": 1994, "e:title": "Why Organization Theory Needs Historical Analyses—And How This Should Be Performed", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:issue": "4"}, {"e:author": ["Paul Goldman"], "e:volume": "5", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.5.4.621", "e:keyword": ["Critical organizational theory", "History of organizational theory"], "e:pages": "621-623", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.5.4.621", "e:year": 1994, "e:title": "Searching for History in Organizational Theory: Comment on Kieser", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:issue": "4"}, {"e:author": ["Mitchell P.

Modern Japan was the first major industrial economy to emerge from outside the Western tradition. Economically devastated in 1945, by 1990 Japan had the world’s second largest economy and a GDP per head 20 percent greater than that of the United States. In this paper it is argued that one reason for Japan’s success is that the costs of achieving cooperation and specialization are lower in Japan than in the West. Cooperation and specialization have been acknowledged to have a beneficial impact upon productivity ever since Adam Smith wrote about cooperative specialization in the context of the division of labor. Modern economic theory, however, suggest that in a world of self-interested individuals the costs of achieving cooperation and specialization are substantial. In this paper it is argued that the cultural value system that Japan has inherited from its preindustrial past, and particularly the Tokugawa period, helps facilitate cooperation between individuals and encourages them to undertake productivity-enhancing investments in specialization. This lowers the costs of achieving cooperative specialization. In turn, the lower costs of achieving cooperative specialization have helped Japanese enterprises adopt practices such as self-managing work teams and long-term supplier relations that are consistent with obtaining a productivity-based competitive advantage in the world economy."}, {"e:author": ["John Van Maanen"], "e:volume": "6", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.6.1.133", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "133-143", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.6.1.133", "e:year": 1995, "e:title": "Crossroads Style as Theory", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "A small but significant portion of writing in the still expanding domain of organizational research and theory is devoted to debunking the essentialist and (allegedly) scientifically grounded ideas and programs of our peers.

When in a chaotic domain, organizations are likely to exhibit the qualitative properties of chaotic systems. Several of these properties---sensitivity to initial conditions, discreteness of change, attraction to specific configurations, structural invariance at different scales and irreversibility---are used to establish six propositions. First, because of the coupling of counteracting forces, organizations are potentially chaotic. Second, the path from organizational stability to chaos follows a discrete process of change. Third, when the organization is in the chaotic domain, small changes can have big consequences that cannot be predicted in the long term. Fourth, from chaos, new stabilities emerge---the strange attractors---which are assimilated to organizational configurations. Fifth, similar patterns should be found at different scales.

European institutional-cultural conditions favored a centralized, hierarchical, obedience-based organizational form with little uncertainty tolerance emphasizing loyalty. In the US, by contrast, the primacy of the large business organization which operated in volatile markets under the cultural imperative of equality favored flatter, less hierarchical, and more nearly decomposable organizations in which compliance was based on a temporary contract.

There are five designing principles that define a procedural justice model of strategic decision making. These are: bilateral communication between the head office and subsidiary units; the subsidiary units’ ability to challenge and refute the strategic views of the head office; head office familiarity with the local situation of subsidiary units; a full account for the head office’s final strategic decisions; and application of consistent decision making procedures across subsidiary units. To examine the above effect, here we introduce information processing as an intervening concept to assess the match between the information processing requirements of multinationals’ global strategic objectives and the information processing capabilities provided by the proposed procedural justice model of strategic decision making. Here multinationals’ global strategic objectives are defined as global learning, the balancing of global efficiency and local responsiveness, global strategic renewal, and rapid global strategic decision making. The underlying assumption in this analysis is that if the dimensions of procedural justice facilitate the kinds of strategic information necessary to achieve the multinational’s global strategic objectives, the exercise of procedural justice can be judged to have a salutary effect on the content of global strategies. The results of this study, which are based on the experiences of 63 global strategic decision units, provide support for the effectiveness of this model of strategic decision making."}, {"e:author": ["Hervé Laroche"], "e:volume": "6", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.6.1.62", "e:keyword": ["Decision-making", "Organizational action", "Social representation"], "e:pages": "62-75", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.6.1.62", "e:year": 1995, "e:title": "From Decision to Action in Organizations: Decision-Making as a Social Representation", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "How should we understand decision-making in organizations? And how important is it for our understanding of organizations? A wide body of empirical and theoretical research---labeled here as the decision-making perspective---assumes that decision-making is a fundamental element of organizational processes, and aims to identify different types of decision-making processses in organizations. But what exactly is decision-making? The paper argues that this perspective suffers from insufficient debate on the definition of its research object. One of the main limits of the decision-making perspective is its understanding of organizational decision-making as series of separate decision-making episodes. Stressing the continuity of organizational processes, an emerging “action perspective” challenges this view. It argues that decision and decision-making are either rare, marginal phenomena, or artificial constructs producing biased observations. Thus, some authors suggest that we would better do without decision-making. The paper argues that, because people in organizations think of decision and decision-making as realities, the concept of organizational action should not be opposed to decision and decision-making. Decision and decision-making are best understood as social representations: they influence organizations’ members’ ways of understanding and behaving in organizations. They influence processes, they facilitate action, and they give meaning to what happens in organizations. As organization members think and act in terms of decision-making, a theory of organizational action cannot simply do without a theory of decision-making."}, {"e:author": ["Udo Zander", "Bruce Kogut"], "e:volume": "6", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.6.1.76", "e:keyword": ["Organizational capabilities", "Knowledge", "Imitation"], "e:pages": "76-92", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.6.1.76", "e:year": 1995, "e:title": "Knowledge and the Speed of the Transfer and Imitation of Organizational Capabilities: An Empirical Test", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "The capabilities of a firm, or any organization, lie primarily in the organizing principles by which individual and functional expertise is structured, coordinated, and communicated. Firms are social communities which use their relational structure and shared coding schemes to enhance the transfer and communication of new skills and capabilities. To replicate new knowledge in the absence of a social community is difficult. A classic demonstration is the well-studied problem of the transfer across country borders of manufacturing capabilities that support production of new product innovations. We show in this article that the degree of codification and how easily capabilities are taught has a significant influence on the speed of transfer. What makes the question of knowledge codification particularly interesting is that firms compete not only through the creation, replication, and transfer of their own knowledge, but also through their ability to imitate the product innovations of competitors. The capacity to speed the internal transfer of a production capability to new markets (e.g., those in other countries) is, consequently, of fundamental significance in a competitive environment. In the attempt to speed the internal transfer of knowledge, the dilemma arises that capabilities which can be easily communicated within the firm are more likely to be easily imitated by competitors. This relationship is tested by analyzing the effects of the ease of codifying and communicating a manufacturing capability not only on the time to its transfer, but also on the time to imitation of the new product. ’The determinants of the time to imitation are found to be the extent to which knowledge of the manufacturing processes is “common” among competitors, and the degree of continuous recombination of capabilities leading to improvement of the product or the manufacturing process. We support this interpretation by a discussion of the results from field research. A wider implication of these findings is the proposition that the transfer and recombination of organizational capabilities are the foundation of an evolutionary theory of the firm. A critical element limiting the expansion of a firm is that the competitive value of codifying knowledge leads to the selection of organizing principles that are not functional in all competitive environments. The pressure of speed is of critical importance to understand the evolutionary advantage of nonoptimal rules of coordinated action within a social community."}, {"e:author": ["John R.

Plant history (conversion from a hierarchical system as opposed to STS from start-up) and plant manager style (autocratic as opposed to participative) were posed as potential sources of inertia. As counterproductive inertial forces, a conversion plant history and an autocratic plant manager style were hypothesized to be associated with less participative communication between lower level managers and subordinates in the plants. Using a coding scheme to analyze and compare actual work interactions, we found that when both inertial forces were present, participation between manager and subordinates as equals was less (i.e., there were fewer challenges by subordinates of managers’ statements, more manager led discussion, and more subordinate approval seeking). When these inertial forces were absent, subordinates assumed a more assertive, equal role in communication. Subordinates challenged manager assertions, more often led discussion that was copied by the manager, and experienced fewer control attempts by the manager in discussions led by the subordinate. The implications of these findings for advancing our understanding of population ecology dynamics within the firm are discussed.

This study explored the effects of computer conferencing on the interpersonal messages with which people define their relationships, known as relational communication. Observers rated the relational communication from transcripts of CMC conversations or from videotapes of face-to-face three-person groups who had worked in several sessions. Analyses showed that CMC groups achieved more positive levels on several dimensions of interpersonal communication than did face-to-face groups. On other dimensions, no differences between conditions were found. In no case did CMC groups express less intimacy or more task-orientation than face-to-face groups.

The results show support for the predictive value of the traits, and help to illustrate the complementarity of qualitative and quantitative methods for studying organizational cultures. Two of the traits, involvement and adaptability, are indicators of flexibility, openness, and responsiveness, and were strong predictors of growth. The other two traits, consistency and mission, are indicators of integration, direction, and vision, and were better predictors of profitability. Each of the four traits were also significant predictors of other effectiveness criteria such as quality, employee satisfaction, and overall performance. The results also showed that the four traits were strong predictors of subjectively-rated effectiveness criteria for the total sample of firms, but were strong predictors of objective criteria such as return-on-assets and sales growth only for larger firms. This paper suggests that culture can be studied as an integral part of the adaptation process of organizations and that specific culture traits may be useful predictors of performance and effectiveness.

Second, the decision maker is opened up to history and experience, to affect and inspiration, and especially to the critical role of insight in transcending the bounds of cerebral rationality.

The communication systems we propose emphasize that narratives can help construct strong perspectives within a community of knowing, and that reflecting upon and representing that perspective can create boundary objects which allow for perspective taking between communities.

We hypothesize that due to the collaborative nature of their work and the way they are organized in work groups, technical employees, as compared with administrative employees, will communicate laterally, and will use the telephone and email for this purpose. We studied technical and administrative employees in seven departments of a large telecommunications firm. From logs of communication over two days, we examined vertical and lateral communication inside and outside the chain of command and department, and the use of telephone, email, and voice mail for this communication. Technical employees did have more lateral communication than administrators did, but all lateral communication (not just that of technical employees) tended to be by telephone. Over 50% of employees’ communication was extradepartmental; extradepartmental communication, like lateral communication, tended to be by telephone. When employees used asynchronous technology, technical employees used email whereas administrators, especially those at high levels, used voice. Differential boundary-crossing by technical and administrative employees could be explained in part by the flatter structure of the technical work groups. Our results are consistent with Powell (Powell, W. W. 1990. Neither market nor hierarchy: Network forms of organization. <i>Res. Organ. Behavior</i> <b>12</b>295--336.), Barley (Barley, S. 1994.

This view assumes that organization structure and form can be defined in terms of communication linkages among organizational units. Communication is a social process, however. Therefore, to better understand the potential for these technologies to enable fundamental organizational change, we must understand how existing structures and social contexts influence patterns of organizational communication. This research examined the use of electronic messaging by ongoing management groups performing a cooperative task. By means of an in-depth multimethod field study of the editorial group of two daily newspapers, it examined the influence of the groups’ social context on the patterns of face-to-face and computer-mediated communication. The results show that different groups using the same functional structure and performing the same task with identical communication technologies, but operating within different social contexts, appropriated the communication technology differently and in a way that was consistent with and reinforcing to their existing social structure. This finding suggests that researchers must, at the very least, explicitly take into account social context when studying the effects of introducing technologies which may alter group interaction. Additionally, researchers should look to social context as an important explanatory construct to be explicitly varied and investigated with regard to effects and outcomes of these technologies.

ICMC can be expected to evolve into the mainstream of existing communications infrastructure, but this evolution is not occurring uniformly across organizations. ICMC infrastructure appears to be most strongly supported, at least in this early stage, among organizations dependent on the maintenance of external weak social ties among employees who are members of professional, dispersed occupational communities. This can be seen in the experience of research-oriented organizations. Two strong forces---the professionalism of key occupational communities seeking autonomy, and a persistent desire by organizations to reduce fixed costs and organizational size---are posited as encouraging growth of ICMC infrastructure. Such growth might provide an important “bootstrapping mechanism” of long-predicted shifts from hierarchical to market forms of organization, at least in professionalized sectors of the economy."}, {"e:author": ["Anitesh Barua", "C.-H.

The theoretical model provides a set of propositions showing how interactions between the chosen reward system, system design features and organizational factors determine members’ behavior (e.g., the extent of free riding and shirking) and subsequently the organizational payoff.

A subset of organizational climate is an ethical climate, embodying normative values and beliefs involving moral issues shared by the employees of the organization. Researchers have found multiple ethical climates present in an organization. This research explores a plausible explanation for the discovery of multiple ethical climates, or subclimates, within an organization. Specifically, the research tests the assumptions that the departmental task and stakeholder relationships influence and differentiate the ethical decision-making framework used by employees and the resulting ethical subclimate. Categories developed by Thompson (Thompson, J. D. 1967. <i>Organizations in Action</i>. McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York.) are extended to identify distinct departmental tasks and stakeholder relationships in order to assess their influence upon the employees’ ethical decision-making process and departmental ethical subclimate. In order to uncover the various ethical subclimates within each workgroup, the Ethical Climate Questionnaire, developed by Victor and Cullen (Victor, B., J. B. Cullen. 1987.

The original instrument required the subjects to rate, on a Likert scale, the relevance of each ethical climate statement. In this project, a ranking of the statements was performed by the subjects, which minimizes the social desirability bias in the subjects’ responses. This research found that the departmental task and stakeholder relationships so strongly influence employee decision making in all three department types that the ethical subclimate was also affected. Employees in a technical core department tend to use an individual locus of analysis and an egoistic criterion for decisions, emphasizing an instrumental ethical climate type. Buffer department employees exhibit a mix of ethical decision characteristics, but clearly manifest a caring ethical climate type. Employees in boundary spanning departments show a preference toward a cosmopolitan perspective and principle ethical reasoning, as well as a law and code ethical climate type."}, {"e:author": ["Daniel R.

This paper examines the development of these ideas in the literature and attempts to clarify what influence they might have on empirical research. One general implication of the paradox perspective, that more effective leaders generally display a more complex and varied set of behaviors, is then examined empirically with respect to Quinn’s (Quinn, R. E. 1984. Applying the competing values approach to leadership: Toward an integrative model. J. G. Hunt, R. Stewart, C. Schriesheim, D.

E. 1988. <i>Beyond Rational Management: Mastering the Paradoxes and Competing Demands of High Performance</i>. Jossey-Bass Inc., San Francisco, CA.) model of leadership roles. This model is one of few that allows for an empirical test of some of the central ideas developed by the paradox perspective. The paper also contrasts the recent emphasis on cognitive complexity in the organizational literature (Weick [Weick, K. 1979. <i>The Social Psychology of Organizing</i>. Random House, New York.], Kiesler and Sproull [Kiesler, S., L. Sproull. 1982. Managerial response to changing environments: Perspectives on problem sensing from social cognition. <i>Admin. Sci. Quart.</i> <b>27</b>548--570.], Streufert and Swezey [Streufert, S., R. W. Swezey. 1986. <i>Complexity, Managers and Organizations</i>. Academic Press, Orlando, FL.]), with the relative lack of attention given to behavioral complexity. Cognitive complexity, the paper argues, may well be a <i>necessary</i> condition for the effective practice of leadership. Behavioral complexity, however, must certainly be the <i>sufficient</i> condition. Leadership must inevitably be performed through action, not cognition, and it would thus appear to be time for leadership researchers to begin to develop theories of behavioral as well as cognitive complexity. The paper also examines several existing leadership theories that are consistent with this point of view (Mintzberg [Mintzberg, H. 1973. <i>The Nature of Managerial Work</i>. Harper and Row, New York; Mintzberg, H. 1975. The manager’s job: Folklore and fact. <i>Harvard Bus. Rev.</i> <b>53</b>49--61.], Yukl [Yukl, G. 1981. <i>Leadership in Organizations</i>. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.]; Bass [Bass, B. M. 1981. <i>Stogdill’s Handbook of Leadership: A Survey of Theory in Research</i>. Free Press, New York.]), and have (in effect) already offered useful definitions of behavioral complexity. The empirical results of this study come from a study of 176 executives whose leadership role behavior is rated by their subordinates, and whose effectiveness is rated by their superiors. The analysis relies upon a nontraditional analysis technique based on multidimensional scaling that is well suited to this unorthodox analytic problem. The results show that the more effective executives exhibit a greater variety of leadership roles than their less effective counterparts, and that these roles are much clearer to their subordinates. The results also show that more effective executives show much more of the underlying structure of leadership roles proposed by the Quinn model than do less effective executives. Finally, this paper suggests that the concepts of paradox and behavioral complexity are instrumental to a fuller understanding of managerial leadership, and concludes with a discussion of the future research agenda in this area."}, {"e:author": ["Brian T.

A grammatical model starts with a lexicon of elementary actions (called moves) and specifies the ways in which they can be combined to create a process. Unlike other sequential data analysis techniques, grammatical models provide a natural way of describing the layering and nesting of actions that typifies organizational processes. The example of a simple retail sales transaction is used to illustrate the underlying concepts.

This is quite understandable and yields recognition of those internal factors most instrumental in the change process. From this organizational perspective, external factors seem to play a marginal role in change, at most a catalytic role. Change is always relative, but not simply to what the organization has done before. Organizational change should also be relative to what is going on outside the organization. What appears to be major progress from an organizational perspective may look like stagnation in a wider context. This paper suggests that notions of the “learning organization” have often emphasied internal aspects of the change process and neglected the external. In particular, they seem to have paid little attention to the essential contribution of external information to internal change. Information is so fundamental to the learning required for deliberate change that it is not unreasonable to see change as an information process. This view affords an information perspective of change in the organization, and a revealing contrast to the usual organizational perspective. Change in the organization is seen as a process in which the finding and acquisition of external information are critical. So, too, is mixing these external bits of information with those already in use within the organization. The result is not just another model of what is already understood about change in the organization. It has profound implications for those who seek to understand and manage the process of change. The information perspective indicates that organizational change is largely dependent on the information activities of individual employees acting on their own account as much as that of the organization. These activities may be---and sometimes must be---beyond the control of the organization. Thus, those who would manage change face the challenge of managing without control. The information perspective suggests that the concentration on structure and control inherent in notions of the learning organization may be mimical to the real learning required for organizational change."}, {"e:author": ["Anne T.

As more organizations increasingly explore possible applications of GDSS in ways that have the potential to alter managerial routines, the extent of managerial openness to change will be tested at least as much as the new technology. The relation of managerial openness to the successful introduction of GDSS was studied by analyzing a survey of participants in 26 decision conferences hosted by the Decision Techtronics Group of the State University of New York. The perceived benefit of each conference was assessed by a global outcome scale. Eight additional scales were employed to measure group decision process effectiveness, based on the Competing Values Approach to organizational analysis. Results indicated that conferences were evaluated as most beneficial by flexible client organizations that appeared open to the initial use of GDSS. As expected, positive outcomes also were found to be associated with conferences that involved fewer participants and in which participants believed that important decisions had been made. To the extent that the <i>process</i> of GDSS introduction can be managed to avoid failures, the research findings strongly encourage the design of meetings that both efficiently focus on the task (i.e., are highly goal centered) while simultaneously engaging the full involvement of every group member (i.e., are highly participatory). While new technology must be repeatedly modified following adoption to suit the unique demands of each workplace, an organizational unit also must be able to change appropriately its established structures and processes to make accommodation. Such mutual adaptation suggests that the eventual assimilation of new technology will become threatened wherever it is rigidly introduced or wherever management teams are not flexible enough to alter their decision-making routines at the time of initiation."}, {"e:author": ["Debra E.

Scholars and organizational consultants maintain that organizations need such systems to prosper in an increasingly competitive and turbulent world, and that such changes are now taking place. Yet, participative techniques have diffused minimally. Why is there such a discrepancy between the endorsements and adoption of participative methods, despite the strong arguments for them and their intuitive appeal? This paper maintains that barriers to participative systems are embedded in social, economic, and political principles deeply valued in their own right. Writings on participative systems treat these barriers as difficult problems that can be overcome through patient, well-designed behavioral and organizational interventions. In contrast, we suggest that the structures and attitudes impeding participative systems are usually valued more highly than the prospective gains from the systems, and that, in the future, true participative systems will have difficulty sustaining themselves in an organizational landscape that continues to favor systems of centralized control. Similar impediments operating in areas as different as management and government regulation suggest basic processes that rise above specific contexts. The paper draws on two pertinent but heretofore disconnected scholarly literatures---the literatures on <i>cooperation</i> and on <i>collaboration</i>---to analyze the experiences with participative systems in management and regulatory policy. Four themes---prior dispositions toward cooperation, social and political organization, the nature of purposes, issues, and values, and leadership capacity and style---are critical to understanding each area. Generally, participative systems bump into problems of collective action: dispositions against cooperating with prior adversaries, the costs of collaboration in complex social and political systems, the difficulties of engaging deep conflicts, and leadership incentives favoring control that develop in this context. These conditions repeatedly undermine incipient, fragile participative systems. The study of participation would benefit from closer attention to how social, economic, and political structures constrain or facilitate such systems, and more extensive links among the various literatures on the subject."}, {"e:author": ["Denis Collins"], "e:volume": "6", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.6.6.628", "e:keyword": ["Gainsharing", "Participatory management", "Power", "Class conflict"], "e:pages": "628-644", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.6.6.628", "e:year": 1995, "e:title": "A Socio-Political Theory of Workplace Democracy: Class Conflict, Constituent Reactions and Organizational Outcomes at a Gainsharing Facility", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "This article examines the role of class conflict and group processes during the transitional stage of an organization experimenting with a high involvement management system and a group-based bonus.

The presence of easily accessible, reliable information contributes to effective decision making. Sources of information may be oral, written, or computer-based. The computer-based information sources remain the least studied in the context of executive decision making because executives have tended to use other managers and their own intuition as their primary information sources. Recently though, computer-based information systems directly tailored for use by executives have begun to be implemented within organizations. Such systems, referred to as Executive Information Systems, may help executives make faster and higher quality decisions, an increasingly important requirement for executives given such trends as globalization and heightened competition. This study uses survey responses of 91 high level managers to empirically examine the relationship of executive information system use by managers with decision making speed, problem identification speed, information availability, and the involvement of subordinates in decision making. The study found that when used frequently and over time, executive information systems are positively related to perceived problem identification and decision making speed for senior and middle managers. Whether such effects lead to higher quality decisions are topics for further study. In addition, the frequency of use of executive information systems is shown to be related to a perceived increase in information availability although the length of time the system is in use is not related to perceived information availability. This suggests that the information needs of senior and middle managers is malleable and systems designed to support the decision making of managers need to be flexible to adapt to changing information needs. Lastly, the study found that the use of executive information systems does not reduce the reliance of senior or middle managers on their subordinates to help in decision making. This may be because the involvement of subordinates does not necessarily connote a consistent positive or negative behavior among American managers, whereas speed and information are consistently considered as positive.

In particular, it proposes that knowledge of the task is a key determinant of type of control.Four modes of control (behavior, outcome, clan, and self) art identified from the organizational literature; each high-lights different aspects of control in organizations. Building on prior empirical work, this paper integrates the different theoretical perspectives and predicts the circumstances under which each type of control will be implemented. Survey responses from 96 participants of 32 systems development efforts suggest that the extent to which behaviors are monitored interacts with the project sponsor's level of systems development knowledge to determine the amount of behavior control; that outcome control is a function of the extent to which behaviors are monitored and outcomes are measurable; and that self-control is dependent on the extent to which outcomes are measurable and the level of the project sponsor's knowledge about systems development activities. No relationship between clan control and the independent variables was found."}, {"e:author": ["Rhonda K. Reger", "Timothy B.

The results suggest that cognitive inertia affects judgments in both modes, but the effect is stronger with automatic processing. Specifically, the authors conducted two studies examining executives' cognitive maps of competitive positioning. First, they explored differences in ways strategists categorize competitors in a cross-sectional field study conducted during a period of significant environmental upheaval. They found that managers relied on cognitive maps that reflected obsolete industry boundaries rather than configurations representative of the deregulated marketplace. Hence, managers must be <i>mindful</i> to incorporate new information proactively from many sources and to actively discard old, automatic maps in order to develop reliable maps for changing environments. In a second study, managerial competitive schemas of competitive positioning were compared longitudinally across three research projects conducted in the financial intermediary industry. An eight-year time frame provided a unique opportunity to explore the content of mental models in an industry undergoing an accelerating rate of change. The longitudinal results indicate that change creates diversity of thought across managers in the same environment. Managers at competing firms are therefore apt to view competition quite differently in turbulent environments. Implications of the study findings for strategic decision making, consensus and conflict, and organizational learning and executive succession in turbulent environments are discussed.

The Management of Consumer Emotions in Service Encounters", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "This paper examines the interplay between emotions expressed by patients and their families (consumers) and those expressed and recruited by physicians (service providers) in the pediatric department of a subspecialty medical setting. Detailed observations made during a year of fieldwork demonstrate that physicians enacted comedic performances in response to patient families' negative emotions. These comedies are a vehicle for the display and generation of fun: incompatible with the anxiety, fear, and despondence patient families typically bring to medical encounters. They further invite a move to positive emotions because the performances themselves are cues for optimism. Four comedies were identified, selectively presented by physicians at various emotional junctures in the service delivery process. Sociability comedy is initiated as physicians and patient families first come face-to-face, and it invites the former to like and feel comfortable with the performing physicians. Mastery comedy induces feelings of reassurance in families at the moment when physicians lay hands on the patients' bodies. Ostentatious Celebratory comedy promotes feelings of joy as it marks treatment successes while carefully modulated Magical performances bid for resilience at those times when patient families find it difficult to be hopeful about the medical prognosis.The positive feelings engendered by these comedies likely expedite physicians' and patient families' dependence on each other. For example, liking, feeling comfortable with, and reassured with their physicians will make patient families less likely to hesitate about cooperating with the diagnostic and treatment procedures the former suggest. Reciprocally, confident of these feelings, physicians can be assured that families will continue in the service relationship and follow through with their medical recommendations.The account provided in this paper has several implications for the study of organizational emotions and of service encounters. For example, the emotional exchanges described in this paper underscore the appropriateness of understanding clients as co-participants in the service process because the emotional displays of physician providers arise in response to various feelings that clients bring to encounters. Additionally. where previous studies of emotion in service encounters highlight the relationship between providers' emotional displays and client satisfaction, this study suggests the emotions that prevail in service encounters influence client cooperation with the service delivery process. And, they may be important to the quality of services generated."}, {"e:author": ["John Child", "Lu Yuan"], "e:volume": "7", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.7.1.60", "e:keyword": ["China", "Decision making", "Institutions", "Investment"], "e:pages": "60-77", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.7.1.60", "e:year": 1996, "e:title": "Institutional Constraints on Economic Reform: The Case of Investment Decisions in China", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "The paper examines the process of investment decision making in six Chinese state enterprises during the economic reform which combined moves towards a market system with a continuing role for the state in industrial governance. This placed investment at the boundary between bureaucratic control and market forces, the theory being that enterprise managers would advance investment proposals in response to the market while government authorities retained the right of final approval in the light of broader-based priorities.This mixed “market socialism” model has been treated with considerable scepticism by the so-called “reform economists” in Eastern Europe who doubt that enterprises can pursue policies which are rational in terms of market forces so long as they remain subject to significant administrative influence. Resource dependence and institutional perspectives, in drawing attention to higher administrative agencies as providers respectively of critical resources and of legitimacy for the state enterprises under their purview, also predict that institutional constraints will continue to operate on enterprise decision making. North's discussion of informal institutional arrangements and incremental change gives rise to similar expectations.Detailed examination of the investment decision process at the three major stages of initiation, design and detailing, and final authorization does in fact indicate that it remains heavily dependent upon higher authorities.

In the field of organization behavior, Herriot (Herriot, Peter. 1992. Selection: The two subcultures. <i>Eur. Work and Organ. Psychologist</i> <b>2</b>(2) 129--140.) has examined how the psychometric subculture within organizational behavior can lead to its own demise and irrelevance.I propose to examine how the theories used and research conducted by scholars can feed back to make them unaware of gaps in their theories. I hope to show that these counterproductive consequences are tacit and taken for granted. These factors combine to inhibit the production of valid knowledge.I will focus primarily on my defenses as exhibited in my role in the development of the Theory of Action (TOA). I hope to illustrate that the assumptions and claims that I made, that only double-loop learning will lead to liberating alternatives and changing the status quo, were based on defensive reasoning. Defensive reasoning includes making premises and inference processes tacit; crafting conclusions in such a way that they are not falsifiable by reasoning external to the one used to create the conclusion. Such defensive reasoning not only produced gaps in the theory of which I was unaware. It also hindered seeing important connections with other relevant organizational theories, in this case the Behavioral Theory of the Firm (BTF).For the sake of comparison, I will also focus on the reasoning and research of a few leading scholars of BTF, primarily James March. I hope to show that he too, used defensive reasoning which made it unlikely that BTF scholars will see certain important gaps in BTF, and that, in turn, hindered seeing important connections with TOA.If my analysis is correct, these gaps are especially puzzling since both theories hold similar premises about the nature of organizational reality. For example, the human mind is a finite processing system; organizational life is often dominated by quasi-resolution of conflict and limited learning; that reality is constructed in the form of designs (Simon [Simon, Herbeit A. 1969. <i>The Science of the Artificial</i>. M.I.T. Press, Cambridge, MA.]) or life space (Lewin: see Cartwright [Cartwright, D., ed. 1951. <i>Field Theory and Social Science</i>. Harper & Bros., New York.], p. 19,511); and societal cultures are constructed with features that are consistent with the designs (Berger and Luckmann [Berger, P., T. Luckmann. 1967. <i>The Social Construction of Reality</i>. Doubleday, Garden City, NY.], Geertz [Geertz, C. 1973. <i>The Interpretation of Cultures</i>. Basic Books, New York.]). How is it that two theories that exhibit similar premises lead to significantly different if not, at times, antagonistic views about the alterability and changeability of the universe that each purports to represent?"}, {"e:author": ["Anne S.

Such a perspective looks at organizations as platforms, or contexts, out of which specific structures arc extracted, tried out and discarded in a pragmatic manner. A platform is a meta-organization, a formative context that molds structures, and routines shaping them into well-known forms, such as the hierarchy, the matrix and even the network, but on a highly volatile basis. Hence, the platform organization may appear to be confused and inefficient but its value lies in its readiness to sport whatever organizational form is required under the circumstances Platforms are characterized by surprises, and organization members, no matter how they see them-selves after the fact, are busy improvising and tinkering.

A survey of advice seekers and those who replied was conducted to test hypotheses about the viability and usefulness of such electronic weak tie exchanges.Theories of organizational motivation suggest that positive regard for the larger organization can substitute for direct incentives or personal relationships in motivating people to help others. Theories of weak ties suggest that the usefulness of this help may depend on the number of ties, the diversity of ties, or the resources of help providers. We hypothesized that, in an organizational context, the firm-specific resources and organizational motivation of people who provide advice will predict the usefulness of advice.We investigated these theories in a study of employees of a global computer manufacturer. We collected survey and observational data on the relationships between information seekers and information providers; the number, diversity, resources, and motivations of information providers, and subjective ratings of the usefulness of the advice (from both parties in the exchange) and whether or not the advice solved information seekers' problems.We found that information providers gave useful advice and solved the problems of information seekers, despite their lack of a personal connection with the seekers.

The traditional theoretical answer has been transaction cost explanations. Yet, these explanations which center on transaction characteristics, static efficiency, and routine situations do not capture the strategic and social factors which propel many firms into alliance formation. In this study, however, we combine these alternative social and strategic explanations for alliance formation. Consistent with these explanations, we find that alliances form when firms are in vulnerable strategic positions either because they are competing in emergent or highly competitive industries or because they are attempting pioneering technical strategies. We also find that alliances form when firms are in strong social positions such that they are led by large, experienced, and well-connected top management teams. The underlying logic of alliance formation is, thus, strategic needs and social opportunities.We develop these findings by extending the resource-based view of the firm to alliance formation and then examining the resulting hypotheses using product development alliances. The study is longitudinal and focuses on entrepreneurial semiconductor firms. Overall, strategic and social explanations of organizational phenomena as well as industry, firm, and top management team factors emerge as central in the paper.

There is ample evidence that members of organizations sabotage processes, steal company property, harass others, cheat the government, or mislead customers. Companies and the public pay dearly.What are the motivational forces that drive organizational members to exhibit such varied forms of misconduct? Are these forces different from those that drive them to engage in constructive behavior? What kinds of personal and organizational factors influence such acts of intentional misbehavior?Our basic objectives in this paper are three-fold; first, to formally define a new construct of Organizational Misbehavior (OMB), and to discuss the theoretical implications of the definition; second, to identify different types of OMB; and third, to develop a conceptual framework that would allow the inclusion of OMB in a comprehensive theory of work motivation, applicable to both proper and improper conduct.We define Organizational Misbehavior as “any intentional action by members of organizations that violates core organizational and/or societal norms.” A crucial element in the definition is the <i>intention</i> underlying the misbehavior. It therefore serves as the basis for the distinction among three types or organizational misbehavior: (a) OMB Type S, misbehavior that intends to benefit the self; (b) OMB Type O, misbehavior that intends to benefit the organization; and (c) OMB Type D, misbehavior that intends to inflict damage.In order to integrate these forms of misconduct within a comprehensive motivational framework, we use the distinction between normative and instrumental sources of motivation. We propose that people who engage in OMB Type S are primarily motivated by self-interest consideration (i.e., instrumental processes), whereas those that perpetrate OMB Type O do so mostly because of strong identification with and loyalty to their organization (i.e., normative processes). OMB Type D, however, may he triggered by either instrumental or normative forces, or by both at the same time.The various instrumental and normative factors that influence misbehavior are not only personal; they can also be organizational. On the individual level, we refer to such factors as the stage of moral development and personal need satisfaction At the organization level, we examine the role of such factors as organization culture and cohesiveness. We finally use the instrumental-normative framework to derive a set of formal propositions about the effects of some of these factors on the form and intensity of OMB."}, {"e:author": ["Richard A.

The results indicate that, depending on their status in the opinion of different constituencies, the schools engaged in different degrees of student input creaming, scrambling for inputs, input targeting, input avoidance, and output streaming (all terms developed as part of the model proposed herein). The results suggest that in Ph.D. markets, status hierarchies tend to make groups of schools a closed system, leading to homosocial reproduction of senior faculties and social isolation and immobility for certain Ph.D. graduates. Barriers appear to be created between the subsystems of schools. One major theoretical implication of the study findings is that status hierarchies define patterns of social ecology of business schools and limit competition for resources.One practical implication of the study findings is that schools are at a disadvantage in competing for student inputs and placing MBA and Ph.D. graduates if they lack status in the national business community. High status in the opinion of students and academics is not associated with all of the advantages afforded by status in the national business community. Hence, teaching and research strategies designed to achieve status among students or academics alone may not be as successful as those that have relevance to the broader “real world.”"}, {"e:author": ["Peter J.

Variously interdependent divisions are “chartered” to look after one or more business areas, in effect defining the “turf” of the division and its purpose within the corporation, and collectively defining the corporate domain. However, once created, these divisional charters should not be regarded as rigid; they are susceptible to change. Particularly in fast-paced environments, such as in high-technology industries, divisional charters are liable to change as divisions add or subtract businesses to their charter responsibilities. These charter changes are seen as an adaptive device for large, multidivisional corporations in fast-paced environments.This paper presents a process model of how divisions change their domains in hypercompetitive contexts, focusing on the specific question of how divisions lose all or portions of their business charters. The paper is based on a larger inductive study of charter changes in ten divisions, both domestic and foreign, of a large, multinational, high-technology corporation. Data were collected over an 18-month period and included formal interviews, questionnaires, company documents, group interviews, media publications and direct observations of strategy formation sessions. Over 80 informants were interviewed across several managerial levels.Our data revealed three distinct patterns and logics of charter loss depending upon what phase of core business development a division found itself: (1) Divisions starting-up new core businesses lost these charters because of a combination of their failure in the new area and competition with other divisions in the company---the process revealed a competitive market for new charters; (2) Divisions rapidly growing new core businesses lost peripheral business areas in order to focus on the core business---the process emphasized a focus logic for charter change: finally (3) Divisions with mature charter areas were found to shed their core business areas because of an emerging misfit between their skills and culture and the nature of competition in the industry---the process emphasized the emerging nature of corporate mis-alignment and the abrupt charter changes that can follow. This paper contributes to organizational theory by exploring the evolution of large, diversified corporations, focusing on the organizational responses to fast-moving, competitive environments. It also contributes to strategy by revealing a “re-combinant” multidivisional organizational form, by which timely charter changes can be used by large corporations to keep pace in these turbulent contexts."}, {"e:author": ["Dong-Jae Kim", "Bruce Kogut"], "e:volume": "7", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.7.3.283", "e:keyword": ["Platform technology", "Diversification", "Technological trajectory", "Knowledge accumulation", "Option"], "e:pages": "283-301", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.7.3.283", "e:year": 1996, "e:title": "Technological Platforms and Diversification", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "As the invention of fundamental new sciences spawns subsequent research, discovery, and commercialization, core technologies branch into new applications and markets. Some of them evolve over time into many derived technologies, whereas others are essentially “dead ends.” The pattern of evolution and branching is called a “technological trajectory.” An intriguing question is whether some firms can ride the trajectory by developing proprietary experience in a “platform technology.” Because the knowledge is proprietary, firms that originate in industrial fields based on a platform technology acquire the technological skills to diversify and to mimic the branching of the underlying technological trajectory.The ability to compete in hypercompetitive markets depends on the acquisition of know-how that is applicable to a wide set of market opportunities. Such capabilities serve as platforms into quickly evolving markets. To respond rapidly to market changes, a firm must have already acquired fundamental competitive knowledge. In a high-technology industry, such knowledge invariably is derived from experience with the underlying science and related technological fields.The authors examine capabilities as platforms by analyzing the temporal sequence of diversification as contingent on market opportunities and previous experience. The pattern of diversification of firms reflects the evolutionary branching of underlying technologies. In that sense, the aggregate decisions of firms are driven by the technological trajectories common across an industrial sector. Certain technologies have wider technological and market opportunities, and consequently experience in those technologies serves as a platform for expansion. The authors propose that a firm's experience in platform technologies increases the likelihood of diversification when environmental opportunities are favorable.The proposition is tested with the sample of 176 semiconductor startup companies founded between 1977 and 1989. Evidence from multidimensional scaling of expert opinion and from an analysis of patent records was gathered to identity relatedness among subfields and the evolutionary direction of the technologies. A discrete hazard model is specified to estimate the effect of technological histories on subsequent diversification. The results confirm the relationship between relatedness and directionality of technologies and the industrial path of diversification. The finding that diversification depends on technological experience and market opportunity has important implications for firms' entry decisions. The authors discuss those implications by describing experience as generating options on future opportunities and distinguishing between the historical path by which the stock of knowledge is accumulated and the path by which new knowledge is generated and commercialized."}, {"e:author": ["Tim Craig"], "e:volume": "7", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.7.3.302", "e:keyword": ["Hypercompetition", "Japanese beer", "New product development", "Organizational capabilities"], "e:pages": "302-321", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.7.3.302", "e:year": 1996, "e:title": "The Japanese Beer Wars: Initiating and Responding to Hypercompetition in New Product Development", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "In the mid-1980s, the Japanese beer industry, a stable oligopoly in which competition had traditionally been limited to well understood nonprice dimensions, experienced an outbreak of new product “hypercompetition” which saw a ten-fold increase in the industry's new product introduction rate, produced a major shake-up in firms' competitive positions, and forced firms to transform themselves in fundamental ways in order to compete effectively. Surprisingly, this hyper-competition occurred despite heavy government regulation of the industry. Driving it were a variety of demographic, dietary, social, economic, and distribution trends which affected demand for beer, plus the existence of a major player, Asahi, on the edge of bankruptcy and therefore sufficiently desperate to risk a frontal attack on the industry leader, Kirin.At the firm level, substantial internal change and the building of new organizational capabilities were required both to initiate and respond to hypercompetition. Examining in detail the process and difficulty of overcoming inertia and effecting change within the Asahi and Kirin organizations, two distinct types of hypercompetition-appropriate capabilities are identified. One is <i>specialized</i> capabilities, which allow a firm to compete effectively on the competitive dimension that a particular <i>round</i> of hypercompetition is based on (such as new product development). The other is <i>general</i> capabilities which allow a firm to efficiently carry out the continual recombination and reemployment of resources which a hypercompetitive <i>state</i>, in which shifts in the nature of competition are frequent and continuous, requires. Both types of capabilities are shown to be difficult to build and imitate, and for this reason to be potential sources of sustainable advantage.The paper identifies three broadly defining characteristics of hypercompetition: (1) continuing, nonmarginal change in the nature of competition, (2) required nontrivial organizational change, and (3) significant effects on firm performance and competitive position. Conceptually, it is argued that hypercompetition is Schumpeterian in nature, featuring recurring and fundamental competitive change, but that hypercompetition is most accurately seen as a particular combination of Schumpeterian, Industrial Organization, and Chamberlinian competition, with Schumpeterian instability weakening, but not replacing, the more stable aspects of Industrial Organization and Chamberlinian competition."}, {"e:author": ["Javier Gimeno", "Carolyn Y.

The authors study two critical dimensions of intra-industry heterogeneity: strategic similarity, which captures similarity in competitive orientation, and multimarket contact, which captures the degree of overlap between rivals in the multiple markets of the industry. Theory predicts that both variables influence the intensity of rivalry and competitive disruption.The predictions in the literature about the effect of strategic similarity on the intensity of rivalry are mixed. While strategic group theory proposes that strategic similarity may lead to lower rivalry, other theories (focusing on product differentiation, the resource-based view of the firm, and hypercompetitive escalation) predict that strategic similarity may actually increase rivalry. Those diametrically opposed propositions are captured as alternative hypotheses of the effect of strategic similarity. With respect to the effect of multimarket contact on the intensity of rivalry, the existing literature on multiple point competition predicts that multimarket contact should decrease rivalry, since it provides credible threats which discourage competitive escalation.The paper performs an empirical analysis of these hypotheses with data on over 3,000 city-pair markets of the U.S. airline industry. The paper focuses on the effects of changes in strategic similarity and multimarket contact in a city-pair market on the prices charged by airlines in that market. Other important factors which influence prices, such as service attributes, market characteristics, cost positions, market structure and firm-specific advantages, are rigorously controlled. The methodology used for the empirical analysis, a panel data regression with fixed-effect intercepts, also serves to control for other sources of stable differences across airlines and city-markets.The results show that strategic similarity moderately increases the intensity of rivalry, whereas multimarket contact strongly decreases it. Interestingly, the findings suggest that the effect of strategic similarity on intensity of rivalry may be biased if the effect of multimarket contact is not explicitly accounted for. This is due to the fact that strategic similarity may capture some of the strong de-escalation effect of multimarket contact when this variable is not controlled. This finding explains and challenges prior literature which found that strategic similarity reduces rivalry.The findings have important theoretical implications. For strategic group theory, they suggest two distinct dimensions of strategic heterogeneity (strategic similarity, multimarket contact), which <i>should not</i> be aggregated because they have opposite effects on the intensity of rivalry. These two dimensions should be separately considered to produce more rigorous analysis of rivalry within and between strategic groups. For hypercompetition theory, the findings indicate that hypercompetition in the cost-quality arena and stronghold invasion arena may lead in the future to greater competitive restraint. If hypercompetition in the cost-quality arena leads to greater differentiation in the market positions of firms, this could de-escalate competition. In addition, if hypercompetition in the stronghold invasion arena leads firms to obtain a broader multimarket overlap with their rivals, this condition could also provide the basis for deterrence and hypercompetitive de-escalation."}, {"e:author": ["Barrie R.

Given the pace of technological and other types of change, such strategy often requires creating next-generation advantages while the current advantages are still profitable---that is, trading current profits for future market leadership.We capture the tradeoff between a market leader's willingness to reap profits with its current set of advantages and its desire to maintain market leadership by investing in the next generation. Using a competitive model that determines the equilibrium launch time of a next generation advantage, we find that, in absence of lower launch costs for an entrant, the incumbent will be first to launch to maintain its market leadership. That is, regardless of the severity of penalties for being a follower in the next generation, it is optimal for the incumbent to preempt the entrant by launching early---even if the incumbent consequently loses money at the margin. We derive a straightforward condition to determine when an incumbent will make negative incremental profits from its investment in the next-generation advantage. The fact that the condition does not depend on the size of the incumbent's investment costs indicates that the severity of competition, rather than the costs of developing and introducing a next-generation advantage, is what forces firms to cannibalize at a loss.Finally, we find that a preemptive launch can result in an earlier launch of the next generation than is socially optimal, and provide a sufficient condition for that to occur. Although customers are better off as a result of an earlier launch, their gain may be outweighed by the additional costs firms incur from launching prematurely."}, {"e:author": ["Henk W.

Flexible forms, in contrast, can respond to a wide variety of changes in the competitive environment in an appropriate and timely way. The author examines several alternative flexible forms for coping with hypercompetitive environments.Flexibility derives from the repertoire of managerial capabilities (management challenge) and the responsiveness of the organization (organization design challenge).

The paradox of flexibility is portrayed in a conceptual model that relates competitive environments, certain types of flexibility, and organizational conditions.The author develops a rich typology of organizational forms for coping with hypercompetition, each of which reflects a particular way of addressing change and preservation.

For two of the seven RBOCs, the international activities led to new skills; learning and capabilities developed inside their stodgy bureaucracies. By the early 1990s, the RBOCs' local telephone service was facing dramatic change. Powerful potential entrants such as long-distance, wireless, and cable companies were surrounding and converging on the local telephone service industry through their new wireless licenses, collaborations crossing traditional industry borders, and new network development. The RBOCs saw clear signs of impending hypercompetitive conditions.How the two RBOCs changed over an eight-year period and prepared for hypercompetition illustrates several aspects of Volberda's model of organizational transformation. The two RBOCs proceeded through two parallel trajectories of change, which after several years converged and necessitated reorganization. Only through a major organizational change were the two RBOCs able to redeploy the capabilities acquired from international activities into their regulated core business, thereby creating the flexibility they needed to prepare for advancing hypercompetition.

Xenophon's <i>Anabasis</i> documents the successful retreat of a Greek army trapped in Persia in a setting that is comparable to the hypercompetition of today. Spontaneous reconfiguration is seen here to be a vital survival element in hypercompetitive environments, past and present. As a result, a historical case is used as a time-bridge to reveal the importance of rapid and substantive organizational redesign when confronting highly competitive and quickly shifting environments. The Anabasis is also used to animate several of Gareth Morgan's (Morgan, G. 1986. <i>Images of Organization</i>. Sage Publications, Newbury Park.) metaphors. In particular, metaphors pertaining to a biological organism, the brain, and culture are used to parallel the Greek emphasis on body, mind, and spirit. While Xenophon's army is depicted here in terms of being an organic, biological organism, as well as a brain with holographic properties, it is culture that emerges as the truly defining metaphor.The Greek supraculture appears to have played a vital role in facilitating nearly instantaneous organizational restructuring. This was a culture that emphasized an integrative balance between the ethic of community and individuality. Such redesigning properties were essential for an isolated, leaderless army which faced a variety of hostile competitors, rapidly shifting environmental conditions, and starvation. The culture metaphor enables us to see how widely shared values and beliefs can facilitate an organic type of behavioral programming capable of enabling Xenophon's army to transcend the formal attributes of organizational structure. Ultimately, it was culture, not strategy, qualitative and informal properties, not well defined roles and structures, that produced the Greek success. Contemporary organizations that attempt to become more horizontally focused, team oriented, and process driven are adopting a paradigm that is now 2,400 years old.

Its thesis is that the organizational mode through which individuals cooperate affects the knowledge they apply to business activity. We focus on the polar cases of organization within a firm as compared to market contracting. There will be a difference in the knowledge that is brought to bear, and hence in joint productivity, under the two options. Thus, as compared to opportunism-based, transaction-cost theory, we advance a separate (yet complementary) answer to the question: why do firms exist? Our aim is to develop an empirically relevant and complementary theory of why firms are formed: a theory based on irreducible knowledge differences between individuals rather than the threat of purposeful cheating or withholding of information. We assume limited cognitive abilities on the part of individuals (bounded rationality), and assume that opportunistic behavior will not occur. The latter allows us to determine whether resource-based theory has independent force, as compared to the opportunism-based, transaction-cost approach. The paper predicts choice of organizational mode, identifying whether firm organization or market contracting will result in the more valuable knowledge being applied to business activity.

But why should their boundaries demarcate quantitative shifts in the knowledge and capability of their members? Should not knowledge reside also in a network of interacting firms?This line of questioning presents the challenge to state an alternative view to the “theory of the firm,” a theory that has moved from Coase's early treatment of what firms do to a concern with ownership, incentives, and self-interest. We return to Coase's original insight in understanding the cost and benefits of a firm but based on a view that individuals are characterized by an “unsocial sociality.” Does the perception of opportunism generate the need to integrate market transactions into the firm, or do boundaries of the firm lead to the attribution of opportunism?This basic dichotomy between self-interest and the longing to belong is the behavioral underpinning to the superiority of firms over markets in resolving a fundamental dilemma: productivity grows with the division of labor but specialization increases the costs of communication and coordination. The knowledge of the firm has an economic value over market transactions when identity leads to social knowledge that supports coordination and communication. Through identification, procedural rules are learned, and coordination and communication are facilitated across individuals and groups of diverse specialized competence.A firm is distinct from a market because coordination, communication, and learning are situated not only physically in locality, but also mentally in an identity. Since identity implies a moral order as well as rules of exclusion, there are limitations and costs to relying upon a firm for exchange as opposed to the market. These costs are not necessarily those traditionally assigned to the category of decreasing returns to hierarchy. For example, an identity implies that some practices, and businesses, may be notionally <i>inconsistent</i> with each other. Norms of procedural justice that are identified with a firm imply that not all technically feasible complements are permissible within the logic of a shared identity. There is consequently a cost to an identity that offsets the benefits. Because the assemblage of elements that compose an organization are subject to requirements of consistency, identities rule out potentially interesting avenues of innovation and creativity.We illustrate these ideas by returning to the original prisoners’ dilemma game and by an analysis of the coherence of a firm as a search for complements that are consistent with norms of procedural justice. We argue that the underlying dynamic of a prisoners' dilemma game reveals the problems of coordination, communication, and conflicts in norms of justice when players are deprived of social knowledge and shared identity. Similarly, the determination of a firm's coherence arises out of the demand for a moral and notional consistency in the “categorization” of its activities, as opposed to a technological necessity. These ideas are illustrated through an empirical examination of logical complements in high performance work systems."}, {"e:author": ["Nicolai J.

Further, they cite reduced risk-taking as a primary contributor to further decline. Scholars with an interest in risk per se come to the opposite conclusion: low performing firms often take more risks than other firms and such risks reduce subsequent performance. This study attempts to resolve these conflicting views by examining the risk of firms in decline.Our model, based on Cyert & March's (Cyert, R. M., J. G. March. 1963. <i>A behavioral theory of the firm</i>. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.) behavioral theory of the firm, includes six basic variables: (1) performance, (2) slack, (3) aspirations, (4) expectations, (5) risk (income stream uncertainty), and (6) organization size as a measure of decline. The estimated model includes prior levels of risk and performance in the risk and performance equations respectively as controls. This study uses data on 344 low-performing firms in 19 manufacturing industries to estimate a time-series model that addresses both decline's influence on risk and risk's influence on performance while controlling for firm slack resources and industry factors.The results suggest (1) organizational decline and potential slack (debt/equity) positively influence risk whereas recoverable slack (SGA/Sales), and the difference between performance aspirations and expectations negatively influence risk; and (2) recoverable slack and risk negatively influence performance. We also examined the influences of performance and slack on organizational decline and found that performance associates negatively whereas recoverable and potential slack associate positively with decline.These results challenge the argument that declining firms reduce risk and so hurt their subsequent performance. Instead, the results suggest a cyclical process with positive feedback in which decline and the loss of certain slack resources increases risk which in turn reduces performance and results in further organizational shrinkage. Thus firms facing decline fall into a trap of taking unprofitable risks that ultimately exacerbates the decline. In addition, results relating slack to risk and performance exhibited inconsistent relations across the measures raising questions about the role slack resources play in risk and decline. Previous discussions of this slack implicitly assume all forms of slack have similar influences but our results demonstrate different forms of slack have very different effects."}, {"e:author": ["David A.

Little research, however, has investigated this aspect of power. The author explores how power is embedded in manners of speech exchanged in everyday interaction among superiors and subordinates. He draws upon the sociolinguistic theory of “politeness.” Politeness, linguistic behaviors used to demonstrate regard and consideration for others, is hypothesized to be sensitive to the social distribution of power. Low power actors are most likely to use linguistic politeness behaviors because such behaviors minimize the possibility of conflict with superiors. Results of a laboratory study confirm that politeness behaviors are sensitive to the distribution of formal authority in organizations. When superiors use politeness, they are more likely than subordinates to employ a subtype of politeness that demonstrates consideration by intimating social familiarity and camaraderie. The hypothesis that egalitarian values moderate the overall effect of power politeness is not supported, perhaps because of the constraints of the experimental situation.Overall, the study demonstrates how abstractions such as authority and equality can be measured in terms of the manners of comportment that actors bring to bear on one another in face-to-face contexts. Given the possibility that egalitarianism can be operationalized at a linguistic level of analysis, the findings have important ramifications for the study of the presumed status leveling associated with programs of workplace participation.

Results showed that the operating units pursued the four values defined by the model, but did not emphasize them equally. Certain environmental characteristics (information and resource scarcity and technological uncertainty) and aspects of the units' technology (their task routineness, workflow interdependence, and training complexity) were associated with organizational value sets. The values emphasized were associated in turn with the coordinating structure (vertical or horizontal coordination) adopted by the units.The study attempted to move the competing values model beyond theoretical concepts. The results confirm the competing values at work in organizations and also suggest that value sets differ from unit to unit. Certain patterns of values appear to exist within particular environmental and technological contexts. These findings indicate tradeoffs among values. Emphasizing some values may hamper pursuit of others. So when managers decide to give priority to programs designed to strengthen to the human relations value, efficiency and short-term profitability may drop off.

Relying on Williamson's comparative institutional approach, which studies economic organization from a transaction cost minimizing point of view under the assumption of opportunism, the argument was made that transaction cost (TC) logic provides a complete theory of the organization of economic activity. In this paper, I argue that, with its purely incentive-based logic governed by assumptions of opportunism, TC economics is <i>fundamentally incapable</i> of being a complete theory of economic organization. The notion of the firm as a bundle of transactions or contracts is an inadequate and shallow basis for a theory of the firm since it basically ignores the essential notion of the firm as a bundle of knowledge, and the underlying processes therein.My arguments are based on the organizational capability (OC) view of the firm, which provides a central role to bounded rationality and to organizational routines in the organization of economic activity. In the paper, I show how OC-based logic can provide an alternative (and complementary) explanation to TC theory for understanding boundary and governance decisions. TC reasoning does not realistically address issues pertinent to firms' capabilities, both as a source of competitive advantage and constraint, and has a static approach towards the benefits of a particular governance form. A more complete theory of economic organization needs to also address the more dynamic costs and benefits of an organizational form. The paper demonstrates how the OC perspective contributes towards a more balanced view.After arguing why TC does not provide a complete understanding of economic activity, and the contribution of organizational capabilities in this regard, organizational capability logic is applied to a transaction between two firms. Here, I examine in some detail the impact of a firm's resource/capability attributes on governance decisions, and the difficulties of contracting posed therein. In particular, I show how the transaction will not be effectuated, i.e., the market fails, but for reasons which have nothing to do with opportunism.The paper shifts the pivotal focus of governance decisions from the failure of markets due to the prevalence of opportunism to the failure (or success) of firms due to bounded rationality. Furthermore, it broadens the focus from minimizing the costs involved in the organization of an activity under a particular governance arrangement to also incorporate the managing of value inherent in a firm's knowledge base, in terms of both erosion and enhancement. These two inter-related concerns of firm failure and management of value are argued to be critical to a fuller understanding of firm behavior with respect to governance decisions. In general, it is argued that by replacing less restrictive assumptions in trying to understand economic organization and governance, that of bounded rationality alone, while simultaneously being able to explain the same economic phenomena as TC, and even some that TC explanations may face difficulty in fully explaining, the OC perspective has both greater and more realistic explanatory capacity."}, {"e:author": ["Yu-Ting Cheng", "Andrew H.

Various diagnostics are applied to distinguish periodic, chaotic, and random patterns in time series data on innovation development events. We find that the actions and outcomes experienced by innovation teams exhibit a chaotic pattern during the initial period of innovation development, and an orderly periodic pattern during the ending development period: however, exogenous context events exhibit a random pattern during both the beginning and ending periods of innovation development. These research findings, if substantiated in other studies, significantly alter prior views of innovation and learning processes. The two most commonly-used explanations of the innovation process, that it follows either an orderly periodic sequence of stages or a random sequence of “blind” events, are not valid where chaos is found. Chaos tells us that the innovation process consists of a nonlinear dynamical system, which is neither orderly and predictable nor stochastic and random. The findings of chaos also expand existing definitions of organizational learning. Learning in chaotic conditions can be viewed as an expanding and diverging process of discovery. Learning during more stable and periodic conditions is viewed as a narrowing and converging process of testing. Timing of transitions from chaos to periodic patterns may explain whether decision or action rationality prevails.

While such diversity tends to increase turnover, its effects on cognitive task performance are more mixed, sometimes enhancing performance and sometimes impairing it. An understanding of how diversity leads to these outcomes may help managers enhance work group effectiveness. Thus, in this paper I develop a theoretical model to explain the turnover and mixed performance consequences of demographic diversity in work groups.The proposed model suggests that each demographic diversity variable (e.g., diversity with respect to age, gender, race, group tenure, organization tenure, education, or functional background) can be classified according to its level of visibility and its level of job-relatedness. Visibility is the extent to which the variable is easily observed by group members, and job-relatedness is the extent to which the variable directly shapes perspectives and skills related to cognitive tasks. The model then suggests that the visibility and job-relatedness of a diversity variable indirectly influence how much turnover and/or performance enhancement the variable yields. More specifically, the visibility and job-relatedness of a diversity variable influence the levels of affective (emotional) and substantive (task) conflict in the group, and the levels affective and substantive conflict, in turn, influence the amount of turnover from the group and the group's performance.After generating six research propositions based on the model, including three addressing demographic diversity variable- conflict linkages and three addressing conflict-turnover and conflict-performance linkages, I discuss boundary conditions of the model and offer recommendations for future research."}, {"e:author": ["M.

Comparative data are offered which indicate that U.S. firms rely largely on markets and hierarchies to facilitate exchange, whereas Japanese firms rely largely on “hybrid” governance or alliances. The empirical findings suggest that Japanese automotive firms (value chains) have been able to achieve a competitive advantage over their U.S. counterparts by effectively using hybrid/alliance governance for three primary reasons: (1) <i>Japanese automotive value chains are characterized by greater interfirm asset co-specialization than U.S. chains</i>. In particular, greater human asset co-specialization between firms results in superior coordination, information sharing, and learning which is critical in complex-product industries, (2) <i>hybrids/alliances as employed by Japanese automakers realize virtually all of the advantages of hierarchy</i> (e.g., asset co-specialization) <i>without the disadvantages</i> (e.g., loss of market discipline, loss of flexibility, higher labor costs), and (3) <i>Japanese automotive value chains incur lower transaction costs than U.S. value chains</i>. Thus, alliances, as structured in Japan, simultaneously realize the benefits of decentralization and competition without sacrificing economies of scale, coordination, or co-specialization of assets. These findings support transaction cost theories which suggest that effectively aligning governance structures with transactions will result in efficiency advantages. However, inconsistent with extant transaction cost theory, findings from this study suggest that: (1) hybrid governance may be more efficient than hierarchical governance under conditions of uncertainty, and (2) transaction costs do not necessarily increase with an increase in asset specificity."}, {"e:author": ["Felix Alvarado"], "e:volume": "7", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.7.6.667", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "667-681", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.7.6.667", "e:year": 1996, "e:title": "Crossroads---Concerning Postmodernity and Organizations in the Third World: Opening a Debate and Suggestions for a Research Agenda", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "A large part of writing concerning postmodernity has originated, either implicitly or explicitly, in “developed” countries.

Scholars map the relationship between demographic variables and organizational outcomes, examining such questions as whether increasing work group diversity leads to greater turnover and whether decreasing tenure similarity within a top management team leads to more numerous strategic reorientations. Asking such questions requires only a demographic predictor and an outcome, but answering them often requires additional theoretical constructs. For example, the relationship between work group diversity and turnover might be explained by communication and conflict. As work group diversity increases, communication within the group may become more difficult, resulting in greater conflict and thus increasing turnover.Despite the important, sometimes critical, role of such additional theoretical concepts, researchers often leave them loosely specified and unmeasured, creating a “black box” filled with vague, untested theories. This article presents a critical analysis of this approach. The results show that simple demographic explanations may generate multiple, mutually exclusive, often implicit theories involving numerous additional concepts. An evaluation of these more complex theories against previous research shows that they receive only weak support.

Because computer networks are increasingly being used to support the flow of information between and within organizations, their use both influences and has consequences for interorganizational relationships. An important and widespread application of interorganizational computer networks is Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), which refers to the computer-based exchange of standardized business-related information between buyer and supplier firms. The following theoretical framework addresses the role that power and trust play in EDI adoption and use. Firms with greater power can influence their trading partners to adopt EDI. But power can be exercised in different ways. Because computer networks provide a way for certain information to be more accessible to outside parties, their use makes organizational boundaries more permeable. When firms use coercive power to force trading partners to adopt EDI, less powerful partners may be left more vulnerable. And, over time this perceived vulnerability becomes a constraint in interorganizational relationships that prevents improvements in coordination through expanded use of EDI. On the other hand, when the event of EDI adoption is viewed as an opportunity to build and reinforce trust between firms, the relationship is able to support organizational changes (e.g., restructuring operational processes or new modes of distribution) related to EDI use which contribute to improving interorganizational coordination. The role of power and trust in EDI adoption has important implications for interorganizational theory.

The labels attached to these categories coalesce when individuals triangulate their perceptions of category members with the perceptions that credible peers and powerholders have of category members. Labels distill a complex and perhaps contradictory array of data into concise and coherent packages, and thus provide a potent means of interpreting, representing, and conveying organizational experience and cuing action. However, labels are inherently arbitrary, labels cause individual category members to lose their individuality and assume the affective tone of the category, and labels tend to become reified as objective and normative accounts of social reality.

To understand this issue, we examine the process of problem solving involving new production equipment during early factory use. We find that adaptation is a situated process, in that different organizational settings (1) contain different kinds of clues about the underlying issues, (2) offer different resources for generating and analyzing information, and (3) evoke different assumptions on the part of problem solvers. Consequently, actors frequently must move in an alternating fashion between different organizational settings before they can identify the causal underpinnings of a problem and develop a suitable solution.These findings suggest that traditional, decontextualized theories of adaptive learning and of collaboration could be improved by taking into account that learning occurs through people interacting <i>in context</i>---or, more specifically, in multiple contexts. Learning is often enhanced not just by bringing people together, but by moving them around to confront different sorts of clues, gather different kinds of data, use different kinds of tools, and experience different pressures relevant to a given problem.

If all firms within an industry fail to train their workers, the whole economy suffers. Hence, training workers is a type of public good, a category that encompasses a broad range of social dilemmas. Employees face a similar dilemma in their choice of how much to contribute to the overall productivity of the organization. If employees receive a share of the profits regardless of their contribution, some may decide to free ride on the efforts of their fellow workers. If all employees decide to do so, the company will fail.The two dilemmas on the employee and organizational levels are closely interrelated. On one side, the benefits of training accrue only to the extent that employees contribute to the organization. Thus, a firm should take into account how it expects a training program to affect employee effort as well as employee turnover. On the other side, trained workers produce at higher rates, which in turn may affect how much they contribute and how often they migrate to other firms in comparison with untrained workers.The authors study the dynamics of training and turnover in firms facing both organizational- and employee-level dilemmas. First they establish a simple model that captures those conflicts and incorporates imperfect information and both worker and organizational expectations. Organizations can be both created and dissolved, and employees can move between firms, start new ones, or leave the industry for good. Next the authors summarize the different ways the dilemmas can unfold over time, collated from a number of computer experiments. For example, under one set of conditions, the double dilemma can be resolved for the industry as a whole and productivity then increases steadily over time. Alternatively, the organizational-level dilemma may remain unresolved and workers may contribute at fluctuating levels. In that case the overall productivity stays low. The authors find a positive correlation between high productivity, low turnover, and enterprise size, a relation that has also been observed in the empirical literature on training, stability, and turnover in organizations."}, {"e:author": ["Robert I.

In contrast, Burt stresses the entrepreneurship of individual agents in exploiting structural holes that lie between constrained positions. Though complementary, the theories of social capital and structural holes have fundamentally different implications for network formation.This paper investigates these theories by examining empirically the formation of the interorganizational network among biotechnology firms. We propose that network structure determines the frequency with which a new biotechnology firm (or startup) establishes new relationships. Network structure indicates both where social capital is distributed in the industry and where opportunities for entrepreneurial action are located. The reproduction of network structure depends on how startups value social capital compared to these opportunities. The critical test is, consequently, whether new relationships reproduce or alter the inherited network structure.

The concept of multipoint competition challenges both assumptions. Multipoint theory addresses how different levels of contact between firms across multiple markets affect competition in individual markets. Its main argument is that high levels of contact between firms across markets will induce mutual forbearance, causing multipoint competitors to refrain from aggressively attacking each other.The restraint stems from the fact that high levels of intermarket contact enable a firm to respond to an aggressive action by a multipoint rival in markets other than the one in which the action takes place. That possibility raises the potential costs of aggressive moves and serves as a credible deterrent, especially if a firm can respond in several markets. In addition, multipoint competition helps firms to interpret their rivals' intentions and signal their own, reducing the likelihood of costly misunderstandings.The authors elaborate on those ideas to examine how a hospital's degree of intermarket contact with its competitors in a particular service market affects the likelihood that it will exit that market. They find that hospitals are less likely to exit markets in which they meet large numbers of their multipoint rivals. As a result of mutual forbearance, competitive rivalry is reduced across the markets that multipoint rivals share, lessening the types of pressures that typically prompt market exit. With lower levels of competitive rivalry, markets shared by multipoint rivals are relatively more hospitable environments in which to operate and are less likely to be exited. Rather than competing intensely, multipoint rivals appear to adopt a “live and let live” approach toward each other.The fact that multipoint contact across markets may lessen competitive pressures within individual markets has implications for the contact between firms in several settings. Multimarket contact can occur across different product or service markets and also across different geographic markets, thus affording an intriguing perspective for the investigation of the rivalry between emerging transnational firms. True transnationals, by successfully integrating global operations while still addressing local market concerns, have been seen by some as having the capabilities necessary for successful performance in international competition. Perhaps transnational firms, because they have an integrated decision-making structure, can coordinate their actions to reduce competitive rivalry with each other across the markets they share. If so, markets dominated by transnationals may become more stable than the current state of international competition would predict."}, {"e:author": ["Sara L.

Longer-tenured, homogeneous teams are found to be more productive in stable environments because they will promote basic team maintenance functions (socialization, cohesion, etc.). Firms that are the most successful financially are ones that match their team structures to the environmental context over time. The results reported are unique because time, different contexts, and financial performance were combined to assess the interaction of top management teams with their environments.Surprisingly, the type of turbulence encountered in the firm's context may determine whether a specific element of team structure will be beneficial or detrimental to financial performance.

Improving processes also poses theoretical challenges. Coordination theory provides an approach to the study of processes. In this view, the design of a process depends on the coordination mechanisms chosen to manage dependencies among tasks and resources involved in the process.In this paper, I use coordination theory to analyze the software change process of a large mini-computer manufacturer. Mechanisms analyzed include those for task assignment, resource sharing, and managing dependencies between modules of source code. For each, I suggest alternative mechanisms and thus alternative designs for the process. The organization assigned problem reports to engineers based on the module that appeared to be in error, since engineers only worked on particular modules. Alternative task assignment mechanisms include assignment to engineers based on workload or market-like bids. Modules of source code were not shared, but rather “owned” by one engineer, thus reducing the need for coordination. An alternative resource sharing mechanism would be needed to manage source code if multiple engineers could work on the same modules. Finally, engineers managed dependencies between modules informally, relying on their personal knowledge of which other engineers used their code; alternatives include formally defining the interfaces between modules and tracking their users.Software bug fixing provides a microcosm of coordination problems and solutions. Similar coordination problems arise in most processes and are managed by a similar range of mechanisms. For example, diagnosing bug reports and assigning them to engineers may have interesting parallels to diagnosing patients and assigning them to specialists.While the case presented does not formally test coordination theory, it does illustrate the potential of coordination theory for exploring the space of organizational processes. Future work includes developing more rigorous techniques for such analyses, applying the techniques to a broader range of processes, identifying additional coordination problems and mechanisms and developing tools for collecting and comparing processes and automatically suggesting potential alternatives."}, {"e:author": ["Yasar A.

The study also illuminates the relationship between efficiency and effectiveness of publicly funded service organizations. The findings suggest that the allocation of resources to these organizations from local, state, and federal governments tends to he based on the extent of unmet needs for services. That is, the less the publicly funded service organization meets community needs, the more government funds are allocated to meet the needs. If the unmet needs that stimulate higher levels of funding actually reflect inefficiency, the inverse relationship between effectiveness and efficiency suggests that the government's resource allocation may not be based on performance, but may in fact be rewarding inefficiency. The findings suggest that legitimacy does not enhance efficiency and that legitimacy and efficiency may be entirely independent, which is consistent with institutional theory.

Large firms have dramatically downsized, refocused, and vertically disaggregated. They increasingly obtain goods and services, pursue complex development efforts, and exploit horizontal synergies without the aid of formal hierarchy. Large firms are also internally disaggregating into smaller, more autonomous units that are treated much like external subcontractors. The authors argue that these organizational innovations share an important underlying commonalty: economic activity is converging toward exchange involving either internal (within-firm) or external (between-firm) networks of small, autonomous production or service units. Small units and small firms have become the basic building block, the molecular units, of these new forms. Further, exchange among the small, autonomous units is commonly a mix of both market-like and hierarchical features. The authors develop a theoretical explanation for these trends. They argue that disaggregation is motivated by the powerful performance incentives that accompany small size. They further argue that disaggregation is facilitated by recent innovations in information technology, organizational design, and performance measurement that permit the selective intervention of market elements in hierarchy and hierarchical elements in markets.The enhanced ability to intervene selectively necessitates a rethinking of traditional assumptions about the discreteness of governance choices. Innovations in organization, measurement, and technology shift decisions about optimal governance from simple market versus hierarchy choices to choices of an optimal mix of hierarchical and market elements. Consequently, managers and scholars must increasingly view organizations as complex webs of governance arrangements rather than as entities with definable boundaries."}, {"e:author": ["Barrie R.

We show that IT can be applied to a hybrid form of market and hierarchy, franchising, and demonstrate how the resulting horizontal network organization can be an improved organization form. Specifically, we use IT-enabled “ownership of customers” to refine the horizontal network organization and show how that refinement can alleviate the problem of franchise underinvestment in traditional franchising. In traditional franchising each franchise underinvests relative to investments in an integrated firm because the benefits that accrue to other franchises from its investment (horizontal externalities) are not accounted for in its investment decision. Ownership of customers is a combination of identifying individual customers with individual franchises, monitoring customer transactions across franchises, and transferring benefits between franchises based on those transactions. Because ownership of customers rewards franchises for the beneficial horizontal externalities generated by their investments, the levels of investment that are chosen by franchises may be increased, although not to the levels that would occur in an integrated firm. As long as IT costs are covered, the franchisor is always more profitable and, if necessary, the franchisor and franchisees can be jointly more profitable. Consequently, if profits can be redistributed in lump-sum form, then the franchisor and franchisees can be individually more profitable. The analysis applies to all horizontal organizations where ownership of customers is feasible and where there are sufficient transactions between units for ownership of customers to be worthwhile."}, {"e:author": ["Soon Ang", "Larry L.

They propose a conceptual model that provides both a traditional ownership-focused internalization perspective on those issues and an integrated approach combining a broader transaction cost interpretation of control with a resource input-based bargaining power model. A set of simultaneous structural equations with endogenous explanatory variables provides multiple possible paths from various resource and power inputs through different means of control to perceived performance satisfaction. In such a model, intermediate variables act both as dependent and independent variables; thus the complex theoretical interactions of the variables are modeled more comprehensively and realistically than in single-equation models.To test the model and compare the theoretical relationships, the authors used data from a survey of managers in Norwegian multinational firms having at least one IJV. For structural equation modeling with latent variables, they used the LISREL VII program that simultaneously fits the measured variables to the latent variables and provides a maximum likelihood solution for the structural equation system. The results clearly reject the traditional internalization approach to IJV governance that relies strictly on ownership share to delineate degree of control. However, relative resource input has a strong relationship to relative bargaining of the parent companies, which then drives equity share, control over specific activities, and perceptions of overall control of the IJV. That result supports a bargaining-power-based model of IJV control. The relatedness of the strategic resources of the parent and the joint venture also drives specific control, implying that although transaction risk is important to governance, governance is provided by specific control rather than ownership level. Perceptions of performance are strongly and positively related to overall control.Those results suggest that specialized control provides both protection and exploitation of key resource inputs and is gained through increased bargaining power. Higher levels of specific control result in a perception of overall control and thereby satisfaction with perceived levels of IJV performance among foreign parent company managers. Interestingly, traditional exogenous determinants of IJV control and performance such as government mandates, cultural similarity, and international experience levels fail to provide significant effects. Rather, the focus is on endogenous aspects of the parent-IJV relationship, suggesting that the key to parent firm satisfaction with an IJV is control over operations that use key strategic inputs from the parent."}, {"e:author": ["Mary Jo Hatch"], "e:volume": "8", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.8.3.275", "e:keyword": ["Ironic humor", "Social construction processes", "Organizational contradictions", "Emotion in organizations", "The aesthetics of organizing", "Discourse analysis", "Reflexivity"], "e:pages": "275-288", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.8.3.275", "e:year": 1997, "e:title": "Irony and the Social Construction of Contradiction in the Humor of a Management Team", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "The thesis I explore in this essay is that organizational members use humorous remarks to discursively construct and organize their cognitive and emotional experiences in and of their organizations.

The <b>second</b> frontier reviews the historic role of idealized models, as understood by historical realists and the “semantic conception of theories”---idealized constructs such as point masses or the rational actor assumption---that currently successful sciences, such as physics and economics, drew upon early in their life-cycles to sidestep the idiosyncrasy problem. Organization scientists are encouraged to develop theories in terms of idealized models. The <b>third</b> frontier attends to the role of ‘instrumental conveniences’ as essential constructs in the early life-cycle stages of sciences and the importance of studying rates. For example, a construct such as a pressure vessel acts as a container translating idiosyncratic gas particle movements into a directed pressure stream where particles emerge at some rate. Drawing on Sommerhoff's “directive correlation” concept as an analogous “container” in firms, this section argues that such containers can be used in organizational analysis to translate idiosyncratic microstates into probabilistic rates of occurrence, thereby allowing the use of intrafirm rate models and Hempel's deductive-statistical model of explanation. An example is given showing how human resource variables can be translated into rate concepts and then used in the context of the directive correlation and the deductive statistical model. The <b>fourth</b> frontier draws on complexity theory as a computational/analytical approach that directly incorporates idiosyncrasy by use of dynamical (nonlinear) methods. Complex adaptive systems, kinds of complexity, the causal role of complexity, and levels of adaptive tension likely to foster self-organization are discussed. An example shows how a complexity theory approach differs from a conventional explanation of why participative management decision making styles have failed to proliferate. The combined effect of rate dynamics, statistical mechanics, and dynamical analysis lays the platform for a realist, predictive, and generalizable quasi-natural organization science, thereby offering a possible resolution of the paradigm war. The mitigation of idiosyncrasy effects allows a reemphasis of background laws in organization science, as opposed to the further emphasis of contingent details advocated by post-modernists."}, {"e:author": ["Frances Westley", "Harrie Vredenburg"], "e:volume": "8", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.8.4.381", "e:keyword": ["Interorganization collaboration", "Conservation", "Global networks", "Biodiversity"], "e:pages": "381-403", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "4", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.8.4.381", "e:year": 1997, "e:title": "Interorganizational Collaboration and the Preservation of Global Biodiversity", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Using grounded theory development research methods, the authors examine collaborative processes in the global biodiversity preservation domain.

For this process, I advocate a <i>calculative experimentation</i> approach that lies somewhere between truly random trial-and-error behavior and planned solutions. To suggest this approach, this paper defines causal ambiguity and proposes a typology of causal ambiguities. The primary distinctions in this typology derive from the knowability of causal structures and inputs to the causal structures, and what is actually known by relevant actors. A simple model of decision making is presented based on a hypothesis-testing approach to problem solving, with tentative rules about the relationships between actions and outcomes being revised in a Bayesian fashion. This paper also considers the circumstances under which causal ambiguity will affect strategy making: in particular, pointing to the overall complexity both within the firm and in its environment. To illustrate the effect of causal ambiguity, I examine the prototypical strategic problem of finding the most profitable use of a firm's assets; my objective is to consider the choices and contingencies facing a decision maker operating under causal ambiguity. This paper presents a series of hypotheses that describe these choices and contingencies. In a sample of computer firms, a subset of these hypotheses are tested empirically in the context of experimental diversification as a specific case of calculative experimentation. The empirical results are generally supportive of the idea that diversification may occur as firms search to assign resources to uses. The paper concludes with a general discussion of the relationship between calculative experimentation versus purely random trial-and-error behavior and planned approaches to strategy making. The process of decision making may itself transform over time as causal understanding increases."}, {"e:author": ["Douglas Polley"], "e:volume": "8", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.8.5.445", "e:keyword": ["Organizational turbulence", "Chaos", "Nonlinear dynamic systems", "Process theories", "Metaphors"], "e:pages": "445-457", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "5", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.8.5.445", "e:year": 1997, "e:title": "Turbulence in Organizations: New Metaphors for Organizational Research", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "Nonlinear dynamics provides two metaphors for organizational dynamics, bifurcation, and mathematical chaos.

Specifically, a diverse interorganizational community creates and employs an <i>organizing vision</i> of an IS innovation that is central to its early, as well as later, diffusion. This vision serves key functions in interpretation, legitimation, and the organization and mobilization of economic roles and exchanges. The development and influence of an organizing vision is determined by a variety of institutional forces. Among these forces, the community's discourse serves as the developmental engine.

Primary development of the organizing vision takes place during the innovation's earliest diffusion. The hesitant early majority among the prospective adopters relies on this development in its efforts to make sense of the innovation.

Twenty-five years later, in a retrospection of that article, the authors claimed that they were right (Slater and Bennis [Slater, P. E., W. G. Bennis. 1990. Democracy is inevitable. <i>Harvard Bus.

Nonetheless, workplace democracy is inevitable.This article argues in favor of the inevitability of participatory management, one form of workplace democracy, on the basis of its coherence to the social philosophical assumptions about human nature that underlie the forms of political arrangements (democracy) and economic arrangements (mixed economy) in the United States. These communitarian philosophical assumptions have been thoroughly argued in the political science and economic literature to be ethically superior to other sets of social philosophical assumptions that underlie authoritarianism and libertarianism. Currently, organization theory is approximately 200 years behind this literature. Persons who experience significant benefits as a result of the central position of “liberty” in the social philosophical assumptions of democracy and capitalism tend to design organizational systems that significantly restrict the liberty of their employees.The current push for more democratic features is coming from organization theorists doing work on corporate culture, total quality management, gainsharing, and other systems of management that encourage decentralization, and from business ethics scholars doing work on the societal accountability of organizations. The very slow rate of evolution to workplace democracy is primarily attributed to the central role of the power elite. Whereas the American political and economic revolutionaries came from within the power elite of their times that is not yet the case for workplace democracy advocates."}, {"e:author": ["Mona V.

According to the model, firms forming learning-related JVs match with partners in line with their differences in capability and other requirements; the result is referred to as the asymmetry-need configuration. A satisfactory post-negotiation match implies a balance in perceived bargaining power, enabling both partners to institute controls appropriate for the specific types of learning undertaken. The model stresses that appropriate controls are essential for learning to take place, yet dissimilar learning needs or learning capabilities of the two partners may nonetheless result in unequal learning rates. Such unequal learning sets into motion a continual reconfiguration of the original relationship between the two partners, including modification of the initial asymmetry-need configuration and perception of bargaining power. The model emphasizes that JVs with learning objectives are inherently and inevitably dynamic because of these internal processes. However, control mechanisms themselves are an important means for diagnosing these processes and realigning the relationship.The formulation of such a process model helps to integrate many aspects of the JV relationship, including initial configuration, partner bargaining power, JV controls, and interpartner learning. In addition, the model captures the evolution of the partner relationship over the life of the JV.

The model is designed to bring together epistemic contributions which are typically studied in isolation. The learning types produced from the model represent processes the intersection of which can contribute to the development of a comprehensive theory for integrating learning and work.At the individual level, work-based learning might start with <i>conceptualization</i> which provides practitioners with a means to challenge the assumptions underlying their practice. In <i>experimentation</i>, they engage their conceptual knowledge in such a way that it becomes contextualized or grounded. However, within the world of practice, in applying theoretical criteria or advanced analytical techniques, one confronts technical, cultural, moral, and personal idiosyncrasies which defy categorization. Hence, <i>experience</i> is required to reinforce the tacit knowledge acquired in experimentation. In fact, learning acquired through experience, often referred to as implicit learning, is the foundation for tacit knowledge and can be used to solve problems as well as make reasonable decisions about novel situations. Nevertheless, <i>reflection</i> is required to bring the inherent tacit knowledge of experience to the surface. It thus contributes to the reconstruction of meaning.At the collective level, conceptualization again makes a contribution in informing spontaneous inquiry but is now embedded within the more formal methods of <i>applied science</i>. Scientists seek to describe and explain social reality through the manipulation of theoretical propositions using the rules of hypothetico-deductive logic. The theories of applied science are often not helpful to practitioners, however, unless they are incorporated into practice. This is the purview of <i>action learning</i> wherein real-time experience, especially problems occurring within one's own work setting, constitutes the primary subject matter. As practitioners come together by being involved with one another in action, they may become a <i>community of practice</i> wherein they learn to construct shared understanding amidst confusing and conflicting data. Hence, community of practice returns knowledge back into its context such that groups learn to observe and experiment with their own collective tacit processes in action. <i>Action science</i> is called upon to bring the individuals' and group's mental models, often untested and unexamined, into consciousness. It is a form of “reflection-in-action” which attempts to discover how what one did contributed to an unexpected or expected outcome, taking into account the interplay between theory and practice.Applications of the model can spur conceptual and practical developments that might lead to a comprehensive theory of work-based learning. The discussion takes up such issues as transition links between learning types, their segmentation by function or process, and implications for epistemology. A sample program, incorporating many of the learning types in the model, is demonstrated. The paper argues that all eight types of learning need to be brought into consideration if learners are to achieve proficiency and become critical while learning at work."}, {"e:author": ["Martin Kilduff", "Jeffrey L.

Organizational sociologists have critiqued the agency theory model of boards as limited and have studied how the functioning of boards is shaped by structural, political, and cognitive contexts. Building on their work, this paper empirically studies the cultural embeddedness of boards in a nonprofit organization called Medlay. It shows how organizational identity---the members' shared beliefs about the central, enduring, and distinctive characteristics of the organization---influences the construction and enactment of the director's role and shapes interactions among board members and managers. The findings demonstrate that the role of the director is shaped by Medlay's Janus-faced identity, as both a volunteer-driven organization and a family of friends; directors see themselves as vigilant monitors and as friendly, supportive colleagues. The findings also portray how some board members' scrutiny of the budget, including “lavish” travel expenditures, surfaces the contradictions in Medlay's identity, and creates conflicts for directors. Should board members take manager to task and thereby exercise vigilance and uphold the ideal of volunteer control, or should they safeguard the principle of friendship and avoid all conflict? An influential subset of directors and top managers resolved the budget issue and preserved Medlay's identity by using different “face-saving” strategies to make directors feel that they had been vigilant, and to affirm sentiments of cooperation. More generally, this study extends the literature on corporate governance by showing how organizational identity influences the construction and enactment of the director's role. It introduces the idea of “conflicts of commitment,” a form of intra-role conflict that arises when directors are besieged by conflicting aspects of the organization's identity. When actions occur that breach the expected role performance of board members, latent contradictions in the organizational identity emerge, and directors are faced with the conflict of upholding one dimension of identity while undermining the other. The study also contributes to research on organizational identity by proposing a model of how organizational and individual identities shape the board role through the processes of identification and action, and how a hybrid identity generates the potential for intra-role conflict."}, {"e:author": ["Allen M.

This study investigates the relationship between IJV success and the strategic and organizational traits of local partners. We address this issue in the context of an emerging economy (P.R. China). Newly emerging economies have in recent years become major hosts of direct investment by multinational corporations (MNCs) because these rapidly expanding economies, characterized by an exploding demand previously stifled by ideologically-based government intervention, provide tremendous opportunities which MNCs can preempt. MNCs in such economies, however, face the challenges of structural reform, weak market structure, poorly specified property rights, and institutional uncertainty. Right local partners can help MNCs boost market expansion, obtain insightful information, mitigate operational risks, and provide country-specific knowledge.The analysis of the data obtained from China suggests that both strategic and organizational traits of local partners are significantly associated with some individual dimensions of IJV performance. Among strategic traits, absorptive capacity, product relatedness, and market power are favorable to IJVs' market and financial outcomes. Market power and experience significantly reduce IJVs' operational uncertainties. Of organizational traits, international experience and organizational collaboration are important for IJVs' not only profitability and stability but also local market expansion and export growth. Organizational form and size influence IJVs' local market performance.The findings provided by this study can help MNCs determine what criteria they should use in opting for local partners and what criteria are vital to their goal accomplishment.

The current paper advances these models with the development of a new idea called <i>moral approbation</i>, defined as moral approval from oneself or others. By arguing that people rely on the opinions of their <i>referent groups</i> when deciding how to behave, the paper also explains how organizational or environmental factors can affect individuals' ethical behavior.This theory proposes that individuals consider four factors when determining their own or someone else's level of moral responsibility in a given situation: the severity of the act's consequences, the certainty that the act is moral or immoral, the actor's degree of complicity in the act, and the extent of pressure the actor feels to behave unethically.A moral agent in an organizational predicament uses these four factors to determine the level of moral responsibility that his or her referent group will attribute to him or her. Based on that perceived level of responsibility, he or she will plan a certain course of action and estimate how much moral approbation can be expected from that referent group based on that behavior. The agent then compares this anticipated level of moral approbation to the minimum that he or she can tolerate. If the anticipated moral approbation meets that threshold, the agent is likely to establish a formal <i>intention</i> of behaving according to the projected plan, and is more likely to <i>act</i> in accordance with that plan. On the other hand, if the comparison shows that the threshold will not be met, the actor is likely to rethink his or her course of action and continue to go through the moral approbation process until a plan is developed that will lead to the necessary level of approbation.The moral approbation model begins to fill the theoretical gap between moral judgment and moral action in organizations, with some explicit observations about the effect of organizational influences.

In this paper, we propose an overall model that integrates these contingent determinants. Our model is based on historical analysis, a method of theory building that first conceptualizes a model and then utilizes it as an exploratory lens for viewing historical evidence. The originality of our model comes from the theory-based bias that we introduce into the model as a way to avoid the trap of multi-causalism. Specifically, we select a nation's educational system as our model's leading determinant, for educational institutions and particularly schools more than other institutions both shape a nation's beliefs about “how things ought to be done,” and transmit those beliefs and practices to successive generations. We draw the theoretical grounding for this bias using a theory of socialization which posits that the schemas that individuals internalize during their early formative stages of development greatly influence the way that they will later construct reality.We found our model to be useful in clarifying the underlying historical reasons why British and French firms rely on different integrative mechanisms when establishing headquarters-subsidiary linkages. Indeed, by analyzing the history of these two nations and the routines and rationalities imposed by their respective set of institutions in the context of our model, we find an overall mosaic, or gestalt, that is fully consistent with their present-day administrative practices. For example, we find that French managers today tend to heavily rely on centralized controls and headquarters intervention because of the influences of a number of key historical elements. These include the way their ancestors dealt with threats of invasion and ethnic diversity; the leadership styles of past French monarchies and elected officials; the manner in which the French colonies were controlled and the French school system organized; and the way the French government responded to economic problems that came from being a late participant in the two industrial revolutions. These also include the philosophies of the revered seventeenth-century French thinkers; the family structures that have existed in France since the middle ages; and the enduring influence of the Catholic ethos. Similarly, we use our model to present a different, yet equally compelling, mosaic image to explain why British managers have tended to rely on an administrative heritage, based on decentralization, “laissezfaire” and autonomy.Finally, and perhaps most important, we show that the explanation we arrived at using this inductive method of theory building is fully consistent with the empirical conclusions we derived using contemporary methods of organization science. In so doing, we demonstrate that these two approaches, when combined, can inform and enrich theory building and thereby lead to a more thorough understanding of organizational phenomena such as administrative heritage."}, {"e:author": ["James G.

Researchers who study organizational performance in this way typically devote little attention to the complications of using such a formulation to characterize the causal structure of performance phenomena. These complications include the ways in which performance advantage is competitively unstable, the causal complexity surrounding performance, and the limitations of using data based on retrospective recall of informants. Since these complications are well-known and routinely taught, a pattern of acknowledging the difficulties but continuing the practice cannot be attributed exclusively to poor training, lack of intelligence, or low standards. Most researchers understand the difficulties of inferring causal order from the correlations generated by organizational histories, particularly when those correlations may be implicit in the measurement procedures used. We suggest that the persistence of this pattern is due, in part, to the context of organizational research. Organizational researchers live in two worlds. The first demands and rewards speculations about how to improve performance. The second demands and rewards adherence to rigorous standards of scholarship. In its efforts to satisfy these often conflicting demands, the organizational research community sometimes responds by saying that inferences about the causes of performance cannot be made from the data available, and simultaneously goes ahead to make such inferences.

Those two criteria can be met only when social researchers find an invariant law. The author examines whether those two criteria are really necessary and attempts to clarify the conditions under which they are relevant, that is, the conditions under which an invariant law can be discovered in social phenomena. He argues that the conditions are so stringent that the search for an invariant law should not be the main objective of management studies, and he contends that reliability/replicability and external validity are irrelevant not only for the case study, but for any method of management studies. Without those two criteria, the validity of the case study can be forcefully reasserted.

Findings reported in a previous study suggest that the ways we conceptualize and experience stress and burnout are not inherently neutral, but are shaped by culture and a particular set of dominant themes prevalent in organizational and professional discourse. This article exposes the processes by which some forms of organizational experience and knowledge related to stress and burnout have become dominant, whereas “other” forms have become marginal and suppressed. Through a postmodern feminist reading of stress and burnout as expressed within the medical and organizational discourses, the author reveals how gender acts as an axis of power and meaning that helps sustain dominant and seemingly neutral conceptualizations within the discourses. Building from the feminist reading, she develops a radical reconstruction of the ways organizational participants and theorists could interpret and experience stress related emotions, and discusses the cultural conditions that could produce and sustain such a revision. The reading and revision reveal ways in which experiences of stress and burnout have been shaped and constrained by the dominant discourse and suggest ways social scientists might rewrite those experiences toward more humane ends. Insofar as stress and burnout are among the most common and well-researched topics (and emotions) within the field of organizational behavior, this paper has far-reaching theoretical, epistemological, and practical implications.

The authors show how employment relationships are linked to firm capabilities and strategic opportunities in a sample of taxicab organizations, relying on arguments about the linkage of employment to the internal liquidity of labor, organizational routines, and internal cooperation.

In this paper we argue that this variation in legal organization is observed because legal organization can significantly affect firm value. In particular, forming subsidiary firms to accommodate new businesses can protect the outstanding stakeholders of a diversified firm from increases in bankruptcy risk and liability exposure. However, forming subsidiary firms also reduces economies of scope. Hence, there are offsetting costs and benefits to adopting different types of legal organization. Changes in these relative costs and benefits over time can also be expected to trigger changes in legal organization, as well as the divestiture of businesses characterized by particular types of economic hazards."}, {"e:author": ["Kimberly D.

This paper uses a qualitative and inductive study of billing procedures at three large hospitals to develop theory about how organization members use impression management tactics to fend off specific, expected challenges to organizational practices that are ambiguously negative. We found that hospitals use anticipatory impression management tactics to: (1) distract, diminish, or overwhelm patients' attention to hospital charges; and (2) to induce emotions that lead patients to simplify their information processing of those charges. Hospitals appear to use such anticipatory obfuscations both to fend off patients' initial challenges and to prevent their existing challenges from escalating.

Those predictions were expected to be strongest for firms with intermediate levels of diversification, as such firms are believed to be the most difficult to manage efficiently. Repeated measures analyses of a panel of 164 <i>Fortune</i> 500 companies supported the predictions for highly diversified firms (e.g., unrelated businesses) only.

Such change is needed to provide room for ethics and to increase the relevance of research. We argue that the new pragmatism provides critical resources for this change. Pragmatism is a particularly helpful tool to use in that it highlights the moral dimensions of organizing (is this useful for our purposes?) while at the same time avoiding entrenched epistemological distinctions that marginalize ethics and make research less useful.The paper begins by discussing the relative absence of ethics within the mainstream of organization studies, indicates why this relative absence is problematic, and proceeds to show how pragmatism offers a preferable approach. Epistemology—specifically the debate between positivists and anti-positivists—becomes a central issue because the framework of positivism is overtly hostile to ethics (and other nonquantitative approaches to studying organizations), rendering it a marginal subject. While anti-positivism holds promise for overcoming this hostility towards ethics, it retains some of the destructive elements of positivism that create new and equally troubling difficulties. The paper claims, in contrast to the proposals of others (e.g., Zald's 1993 position) that the preferred alternative is not to split the difference, but to move beyond the positivism vs. antipositivism debate and work from an alternative framework.

The movement toward a less cohesive workplace suggests a need to deploy computer-based media, but it is not clear which media should be deployed and under what circumstances. Addressing such significant issues must begin with insights into why knowledge workers choose particular media for particular tasks in the first place.Prior research theorizing about media choice has focused on: (1) task, (2) medium, (3) the fit between task and medium, and (4) social environment. It has not sufficiently considered the role of the availability of the intended recipient or the interaction between recipient availability and task social presence variables which could have a significant impact on media choice. To examine the effects of these two factors, the authors conducted an initial exploratory study and a subsequent controlled factor study. In the initial study, an analysis of 1,669 hypothetical scenarios from 100 knowledge workers at a worldwide transportation company indicated that social presence (SP) theory proves to be a good predictor of media choice, as does the recipient availability construct. The analysis also suggested that the interaction between recipient availability and task social presence might be a good predictor. With a partial replication, randomized treatment design, including 1,883 scenarios from 257 workers, the controlled factor study at a large financial institution generally confirmed the study hypotheses.The authors examine rival explanations simultaneously along the dimensions of task, medium, fit between task and medium, and social environment.

They offer fast and flexible means of achieving market access, scale economies, and competence development. However, strategic alliances can encounter difficulties that often lead to disappointing performance. The authors suggest that the way partners manage the collective learning process plays a central role in the success and failure of strategic alliances.Present understanding of interorganizational learning primarily focuses on how the individual organization can be a “good partner” or try to win the internal “race to learn” among the partners. The interorganizational learning dilemma is that (1) being a good partner invites exploitation by partners attempting to maximize their individual appropriation of the joint learning, and (2) such opportunistic learning strategies undercut the collective knowledge development in the strategic alliance.The authors develop a framework for understanding the dilemma through consideration of trade-offs between how collective learning is developed in alliances and how the joint learning outcomes are divided among the partners. They create a typology of five different learning strategies based on how receptive as well as how transparent an organization is in relation to its partners. The strategies are: collaboration (highly receptive and highly transparent); competition (highly receptive and nontransparent); compromise (moderately receptive and transparent); accommodation (nonreceptive and highly transparent); and avoidance (neither receptive nor transparent). Interorganizational learning outcomes are proposed to be the interactive results of the respective partners' type of adopted learning strategy.By synthesizing strategic alliance, organizational learning, collective action, and game theories, the framework contributes to understanding the variety in alliance development, performance, and longevity. Interorganizational learning is likely to be hindered by lack of either motivation or ability to absorb and communicate knowledge between the partner organizations. The dynamics of power, opportunism, suspicion, and asymmetric learning strategies can constitute processual barriers to collective knowledge development. In contrast, prior related interaction between the partners, high learning stakes, trust, and long-term orientation are likely to empower the collective learning process.Comparison of previous case studies and surveys of interorganizational learning provides partial empirical support for the proposed framework. The comparison also indicates several omissions in previous research, such as failure to consider either how receptive or how transparent the partners are, the interaction between their learning strategies, and their dynamic processes over time. Because these omissions are due partly to the methodological limitations of traditional case studies and crosssectional surveys, the authors suggest a bridging case survey design for a more comprehensive test of their interactive, dynamic, and situational framework."}, {"e:author": ["Africa Ariño", "José de la Torre"], "e:volume": "9", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.9.3.306", "e:keyword": ["Alliances", "Collaborative Behavior", "Relational Quality", "Joint Ventures", "Learning and Failure in Alliances"], "e:pages": "306-325", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.9.3.306", "e:year": 1998, "e:title": "Learning from Failure: Towards an Evolutionary Model of Collaborative Ventures", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "This paper reports on a longitudinal case study of the interaction between two partners to a failed international joint venture.

The impact of these events, as well as the responses they elicit, on the quality of the relationship (and vice versa) are also considered. We find that the partners' assessments cause them to either engage in renegotiation of the terms of the contract, or to modify their behavior unilaterally, in an attempt to restore balance to the relationship. The process feeds back until a new mutual understanding of equity is restored, or else the relationship deteriorates gradually until a point when the venture is dissolved.

Based on a perspective of value, we explain how a more inclusive and integrative perspective, one which combines elements from transaction costs and resource-based theory, provides more robust insight into collaboration formation, management, and instability. In doing so, we differentiate rent-yielding firm-specific assets at the core of the resource-based view from the transaction-specific assets at the core of transaction cost theory.The paper makes a crucial distinction between the potential value attainable through collaborations and its actual realization. The crux of our argument is that firms enter into collaborative relationships because these are expected to yield superior value relative to alternate organizational forms in certain situations, offering potentially synergistic combinations of complementary resources and capabilities, yet such relationships are frequently prone to failure because the partner firms tend not to recognize ex ante the nature and extent of transaction-specific investment that is required in the collaborative relationship to attain these synergies. In our argument, critically, the relationship between organizations is seen not simply as a governance structure of a hybrid nature but, more importantly, as a productive resource for value creation and realization. In this light, transaction-specific investment in what we term relational specificity becomes imperative.In the search for value, we explain why the transaction costs incurred in the exchange of resources are not independent of the nature of resources to be transacted and, similarly, why the returns realized from these resources are not independent of the relationship- and transaction-specific expenditures incurred in effectively combining them and maintaining the combination. The interdependence between the two, mediated by the quality of the relationship, has direct implications for the earning of rents through collaborations. These relationship-specific expenditures can be of an internally generated nature, endogenous to the alliance form itself, and need not exceed alternative forms, while the associated benefits have the capacity to potentially exceed the alternatives. This translates into potentially superior value.The paper contributes in three key related ways: (a) the explicit recognition of the relationship as a value-bearing asset embedded in a larger and endogenous institutional context, namely a system of resource relationships—both intraorganizational and inter-organizational—among partner firms and the collaboration, (b) the recognition of the evolving relationship between production and exchange which, at the level of the collaboration, is directly dependent on the nature, evolution, and dynamics of the relationship among the parties to the transaction, and (c) the provision of a nontrust explanation for why firms might knowingly forego opportunities to take advantage of their partners. Drawing from this, the paper occasions (a) a shift in focus from the form to the process of governance, which has direct implications for value creation and realization and (b) a shift in the primary identity of transaction-specific and relationship-specific expenditures from cost to investment in future value."}, {"e:author": ["Tarun Khanna"], "e:volume": "9", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.9.3.340", "e:keyword": ["Alliance Scope", "Stability", "Evolution"], "e:pages": "340-355", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.9.3.340", "e:year": 1998, "e:title": "The Scope of Alliances", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "We develop the notion that the choice of alliance scope materially affects the character of benefits that alliance participants receive, and thereby affects a range of issues having to do with the initiation, evolution, and termination of the alliance. Indeed, while under-emphasized by academics, determining alliance scope ranks among the most important tasks undertaken by practitioners of alliances.Restricting ourselves to alliances where mutual learning is the primary raison d'être, we first define private benefits as those that accrue to subsets of participants in an alliance, and common benefits as those that accrue collectively to all participants. We demonstrate how the choice of alliance scope affects the mix of private and common benefits, and draw on earlier work to show how this, in turn, affects alliance partners' incentives to invest in learning.As illustrations of the utility of the framework of private and common benefits, we consider two applications. A simple model illustrates the relationship between the choice of alliance scope, the realization of private and common benefits, and the stability, or lack thereof, of the alliance. A second application sheds light on alliance evolution. It examines factors affecting both (a) how a particular alliance evolves, and (b) how firms manage sequences of alliances.Two broader theoretical points also emerge from this discussion of alliance scope. First, we argue that an analytical focus solely on the individual alliance may be inappropriate for studying a wide range of issues. Of the multiple sources of benefits that accrue to alliance participants, there are some whose realization depends on activities in which the firm is engaged, but that may have little to do with the alliance in question. Second, in contrast to much of the literature on alliances, our analysis is based upon the primitives of benefit streams, rather than on transaction cost reasoning. This complementary perspective is better suited to the task of highlighting how activities not governed by an alliance might nonetheless affect multiple aspects of the alliance."}, {"e:author": ["Rajesh Kumar", "Kofi O.

The degree to which the partners can realize their objectives is dependent on their absorptive capacities and the collaborative strategies adopted by the partners. Outcome and process discrepancies may emerge as collaboration unfolds. Outcome discrepancies concern the ability of the partners to achieve their economic and learning objectives. Process discrepancies relate to the partners' satisfaction with the pattern of interaction, and affect their feelings of psychological attachment to the relationship. How the partners assess and react to discrepancies shapes the developmental path of an alliance.

Data gathered in Russia from 1991 to 1993 on nine post-Soviet commodity exchange markets demonstrate how the difference in internal social structure between spin-off and startup exchanges shapes the strategy of their inter-firm networks and initial performance. The way in which managers come together structures their diversity and openness to the outside environment. In turn, the social structure internal to the firm affects the range and scope of their ties to other organizations. I show how the high range of overlap among the ties between spin-off founders has a more concentrated connection to the outside environment than the exchanges created by more loosely-linked startup founders. The relational costs of the more concentrated ties increases the cost of search, however, it lowers the cost of malfeasance. Thus, the model suggested proposes that the relative advantage of investing in relational capital is a double-edged sword which poses constraints along with its particular advantages. Finally, the model also brings to question the relative merits of concentrated alliances supposedly advantageous to new firms in particular by suggesting that conditions of transition and institutional instability may under-cut the relative advantage of familiarity and specialization found in Western settings."}, {"e:author": ["Jean-François Hennart", "Dong-Jae Kim", "Ming Zeng"], "e:volume": "9", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.9.3.382", "e:keyword": ["International Joint Ventures", "Longitudinal Studies", "Japanese Foreign Direct Investment"], "e:pages": "382-395", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "3", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.9.3.382", "e:year": 1998, "e:title": "The Impact of Joint Venture Status on the Longevity of Japanese Stakes in U.S. Manufacturing Affiliates", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "A number of well-known studies report that between one-third and two-thirds of international joint ventures eventually break up. While many generalizations, explanations, and prescriptions have been based on these statistics, their meaning is unclear. First, all foreign affiliates are subject to normal business risk, and to the risk that they will be divested by parents for strategic or financial reasons. Are these risks higher for joint ventures than for wholly-owned subsidiaries? Second, joint ventures may be shorter lived not because of their joint venture status, but because affiliates which are joint ventured have other characteristics that make them more likely to exit. To know whether joint ventures are shorter lived, one must control for the other factors that affect the longevity of affiliates, whether wholly-owned or joint ventured. Third, many joint ventures contracts contain clauses that allow partners to sell their stakes to one another at specific intervals. Because they make exit easier, joint ventures should have shorter lives, but these shorter lives should only be due to selloffs, not to liquidations. It is therefore important to see whether the supposedly higher termination rate of joint ventures stakes is due to a higher rate of selloffs or to a higher rate of liquidations.In this paper we (1) compare the longevity of stakes in joint ventures versus those in wholly-owned subsidiaries (2) while controlling for other factors that affect the longevity of such stakes and (3) while distinguishing between two types of exit, those through sale and those through liquidation. While past authors have addressed these three issues in piecemeal fashion, we believe we are the first to address them <i>simultaneously</i>. We analyze the factors that affect the longevity of 355 Japanese stakes in U.S. manufacturing affiliates. Controlling for all the factors that affect exit rates, we find that Japanese parents are more likely to terminate their stakes in U.S. joint ventures than in wholly-owned subsidiaries. This higher termination rate of joint venture stakes is explained by a higher probability of selling them, but not of liquidating them. Most of the other factors that have been found significant in explaining gross divestment of foreign affiliates do in fact only affect exits through sales, but not exits through liquidations. Hence it is true that joint ventures have shorter lives, but dangerous to interpret this finding as necessarily meaning that they are more likely to “fail”."}, {"e:author": ["Candace Jones", "William S.

Given these firms' need for intensifying relations with partners and clients, constellation members restrict interactions to certain select partners and clients and intensify their interactions.

By exploring how firms access and exploit alliance-based knowledge, the authors provide evidence to support the argument that the firm is a dynamic system of processes involving different types of knowledge. Using data from a longitudinal study of North American-based joint ventures (JVs) between North American and Japanese firms, they address three related research questions: (1) what processes do JV partners use to gain access to alliance knowledge; (2) what types of knowledge are associated with the different processes and how should that knowledge be classified; and (3) what is the relationship between organizational levels, knowledge types, and the transfer of knowledge?Although many generalizations have been drawn about the merits of knowledge-based resources and the creation of knowledge, few efforts have been made to establish systematically how firms acquire and manage new knowledge. Moreover, prior alliance research has not addressed in detail the nature of alliance knowledge and how knowledge is managed in the alliance context. The authors examine the processes used by alliance partners to transfer knowledge from an alliance context to a partner context. They identify four key processes—technology sharing, alliance-parent interaction, personnel transfers, and strategic integration—that share a conceptual underpinning and represent a knowledge connection between parent and alliance. Each of the four processes is shown to provide an avenue for managers to gain exposure to knowledge and ideas outside their traditional organizational boundaries and to create a connection for individual managers to communicate their alliance experiences to others.Although all of the knowledge management processes are potentially effective, the different processes involve different types of knowledge and different organizational levels. The primary types of knowledge associated with each process are identified and then linked with the organizational level affected by the transfer process. From those linkages, several propositions about organizational knowledge transfer and management are developed.

It required getting all the right permits (some unanticipated) approved and it meant having an effective grasp of and control over the logistics of a complex process well beyond the prior experience base of most of the organizers involved. It meant doing these things at a ridiculously low price and yet operating at a cost that was higher than anticipated. New money had to be found, rules and laws had to be bent or reframed or reinterpreted. When the magic of the session unfolded, when people were learning, having fun and being moved by what they experienced on stage, it was due, in no small part, to the individuals behind the scenes who themselves had performed, learned and improvised and who thus had helped created conditions that enabled the event to take place. Such individuals often are unsung heroes. They have stories to tell that are interesting and instructive.What follows are the recollections of one such hero, Steve Havlovic, Chair of the Local Arrangements Committee for the 1995 Academy of Management Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In conversation with Peter Frost, he talks about the roles that he and others who worked with him played in preparing the ground for the jazz symposium and he describes some of what happened along the way.

Entrepreneurial resources are defined as the propensity of an individual to behave creatively, act with foresight, use intuition, and be alert to new opportunities. This paper assumes that these entrepreneurial resources can be distributed in two ways throughout the firm: they can be held by one or a few individuals—“individual entrepreneurial resources”—or they can be dispersed among a team of individuals—“team entrepreneurial resources.” Agency theory is used to consider how various organizational characteristics—such as the assignment of decision responsibilities, incentives and risk bearing, the number of hierarchical levels, horizontal linking structures, mutual monitoring and bonding devices, and information systems—will differ in the individual and team entrepreneurial forms. Generally, the individual entrepreneurial form resembles the “classic entrepreneurial firm” (Fama and Jensen 1983) in which various decision making roles and risk bearing are performed by a single entrepreneur. The team entrepreneurial form is similar to what Bartlett and Ghoshal (1993) call “beyond the m-form.” Responsibility for steps in the decision process is dispersed in the team form, and monitoring the decision process will occur at the organization's apex. The CEO will not make operational or strategic decisions; instead, he manages the internal market for managers and develops an organization's cultural context and information systems. Below the CEO level, team entrepreneurs are responsible for ratifying innovative decisions, and below this team entrepreneurs are responsible for initiating innovative decisions. After presenting these two entrepreneurial forms, this paper relates them to extant research on corporate entrepreneurship and organizational forms."}, {"e:author": ["Pamela S.

A multiple analysis of covariance model, coupled with a two-nation (British and French), two-merger type (domestic, cross-national) sampling design, found evidence that the administrative approaches used by managers during merger integration from two nations partially reflect their different heritages, and that these differences are consistent with national differences and the theoretical perspectives of institutional development and cross-cultural studies.

The empirical analysis demonstrates differential effects of different types of organizational capabilities on different types of product development performance, and compares the differential effects between two types of industries that differ in terms of their product characteristics: system based and material based. The central message from our analysis is that the process capabilities emerging from dynamic interaction of knowledge play a crucial role as core capabilities for product development of Japanese firms in the system-based industries in which Japanese firms are relatively competitive. In the material industries, however, local capabilities have major effects on performance while effects of process capabilities are limited, which underlies the relative weakness of Japanese firms in developing material-based products.

Because a firm's long-run adaptation is realized through a series of strategic behaviors and organizational innovations, organizational capability to design effective strategic behaviors and organizational structure is critical for a firm's growth and survival. A series of strategic behaviors is shaped through the stable generation mechanism. Strategic learning is organizational learning that improves the strategic capability of the organization and changes the basic assumptions underlying the stable generation mechanism that structures the strategic behavior design process. Organizations have various levels of knowledge and learn at all levels. The levels of organizational learning interact, making higher order learning such as strategic learning problematic. Distinguishing characteristics of strategic learning are that it is learning without questioning and without unlearning in advance. It starts from a current set of basic assumptions and ends with a new set of basic assumptions. Referring to related literature and a case study, the author describes the process of strategic learning as an intraorganizational ecological process, integrating various levels of learning in organizations and including processes of both strategic knowledge creation and strategic knowledge distillation. He also discusses theoretical and practical implications derived from the strategic learning model."}, {"e:author": ["Maria Humphries"], "e:volume": "9", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.9.6.737", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "737-749", "e:issn": "1047-7039", "e:issue": "6", "e:doi": "10.1287/orsc.9.6.737", "e:year": 1998, "e:title": "Crossroads—For the Common Good? New Zealanders Comply with Quality Standards", "e:journal": "Organization Science", "e:abstract": "The heralding of improved economic indicators has generated worldwide interest in New Zealand's economic experiment despite the growing concern about the social repercussions of such rapid economic liberalisation. This paper argues that the compliance of New Zealanders to this economic experiment was achieved through the simultaneous development of a discourse of economic liberalism and a discourse of “the management of quality” and the subsequent cooption of the latter by the former. As an experiment for potential global emulation, this paper cautions those who pin their hopes for social justice on a common commitment to increasing productivity in the context of neoconservative economic policy preferences."}, {"e:author": ["Maureen A.

At different points in the paper, the author refers to the idea that “discourse creates institutions” as well as the idea that “institutions create discourse.” The power of discourse is that it creates a circular thread whose beginning and end are hard to find. This paper is therefore especially helpful by analyzing a discourse at the time it is fabricated, to trace how the reinforcing loop is set in motion. Moreover, the author does not lose sight of how the circle might be broken. While many accounts of strong social forces overlook the possibility of resistance, this paper remembers to look for glimmers of resistance and remark on the significance of their absence."}]
