Our findings, using data from one of the largest financial services providers in the United States, indicate that customer sensitivity to service time varies widely and predictably with observable market characteristics. In turn, we find evidence that local operating managers account for market-specific customer sensitivities to service times by deviating frequently and in predictable ways from the recommendations offered by a centralized capacity-planning model. Finally, we document that these discretionary capacity supply decisions exhibit a strong learning effect whereby experienced operating managers place more weight than their less-experienced counterparts on the market-specific trade-off between service capacity costs and customer sensitivity to service times.

The serviceable products used to fulfill stochastic customer demand can be either manufactured from new parts or remanufactured from the cores, and the objective is to minimize the expected total discounted cost over a finite planning horizon. We show that the optimal manufacturing-remanufacturing-disposal policy has a simple structure and can be completely characterized by a sequence of constant control parameters when manufacturing and remanufacturing leadtimes are the same. To demonstrate the value of the optimal policy, we conduct a numerical study that compares its performance with two simple heuristics, namely, pull policy without and with sorting.

At the beginning of a planning cycle, the vendor determines a minimum committed order per period. During the cycle, he may also place a supplemental order in each period based on the observed demand signal in that period. Moreover, the vendor is committed to a specific service target evaluated over the planning cycle. This is a complex problem, and we, as an approximation, offer a single-period, two-stage modeling approach. Under this approach, the vendor determines a first-stage order as the minimum committed order with the possibility of supplementing it based on a demand signal observed at the second stage. The problem is to maximize his expected profit subject to a constraint on his overall service performance across all possible values of the demand signal. We characterize the optimal policy for in-stock rate and fill-rate targets, and make comparisons. Whereas in the classical newsvendor model a service target can be replaced by a single unit shortage cost, it is not so in our model. Instead, a set of unit shortage costs are imputed--one for each demand signal. The imputed shortage costs reflect trade-offs among the profits under different demand signals in meeting the service targets. We also show that under a given ordering policy, the in-stock rate is lower (higher) than the fill rate when the demand has an increasing (decreasing) hazard rate. This result suggests that the vendor can infer a fill-rate measure from the corresponding in-stock rate without the difficult task of tracking lost sales. Furthermore, we analyze how the order quantity varies according to the observed signal, which allows us to formalize the notion of a valuable demand signal."}, {"e:author": ["Qian Liu", "Garrett van Ryzin"], "e:volume": "13", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/msom.1100.0306", "e:keyword": ["Consumer behavior", "Pricing and revenue management", "Dynamic programming"], "e:pages": "89-107", "e:issn": "1523-4614", "e:issue": "1", "e:doi": "10.1287/msom.1100.0306", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Strategic Capacity Rationing when Customers Learn", "e:journal": "Manufacturing & Service Operations Management", "e:abstract": "Consider a firm that sells products over repeated seasons, each of which includes a full-price period and a markdown period. The firm may deliberately understock products in the markdown period to induce high-value customers to purchase early at full price. Customers cannot perfectly anticipate availability. Instead, they use observed past capacities to form capacity expectations according to a heuristic smoothing rule. Based on their expectations of capacity, customers decide to buy either in the full-price period or in the markdown period. We embed this customer learning process in a dynamic program of the firm's capacity choices over time. One main result demonstrates the existence of a monotone optimal path of customers' expectations, which converges to either a rationing equilibrium or a low-price-only equilibrium. Further, there exists a critical value of capacity expectation such that the market converges to a rationing equilibrium if customers' initial expectations are less than that critical value; otherwise, a low-price-only equilibrium is the limiting outcome. These results show how firms can be stuck with unprofitable selling strategies from incumbent customer expectations. We also examine numerically how this critical value is affected by the firm's discount factor and customers' learning speed and risk aversion.

Suppose each of several retailers observes local demand for a common item and places an order at the supplier, which is immediately filled if the supplier has the item in stock. The supplier can fill retailer orders either from their reserved inventories or from a shareable pool of inventory. Using terminology from cooperative game theory, we say that the supplier and the retailers whose orders are filled from the common pool have formed an inventory-pooling coalition and study the use of Shapley value to allocate the expected excess profit because of pooling. We find that under Shapley value allocations the retailers have incentive to join the inventory-pooling coalition, and the supplier carries the level of inventory that is optimal for the coalition. Shapley value allocations might not lie within the core of the game, but the grand coalition of all players is stable in the farsighted sense. And, although the supplier's share of the expected excess profit is largest when all the retailers participate in the inventory-pooling coalition, the allocations to the retailers may diminish as the coalition grows. Colluding against the supplier (by merging and forming larger retailers) may seem like an appealing strategy for the retailers to increase their share of the total supply chain profit, but we find that the total expected after-pooling profits of retailers may instead go down because of collusion."}, {"e:author": ["Vernon N.

We further find that volume flexibility better combats aggregate demand uncertainty for the two products, whereas product flexibility is better at mitigating individual demand uncertainty for each product. Our results thus underscore the necessity of analyzing volume flexibility with more than one product and emphasize the contrast with product flexibility.

Queueing-based models of pricing primarily focus on charging a fee per use for the service, in part because per-use pricing enables the firm to regulate congestion--raising the per-use price naturally reduces how frequently customers use a service. The firm has less control over usage with subscription pricing (by definition, with subscription pricing customers are not charged proportional to their actual usage), and this is a disadvantage when customers dislike congestion. However, we show that subscription pricing is more effective at earning revenue. Consequently, the firm may be better off with subscription pricing, even, surprisingly, when congestion is intuitively most problematic for the firm: e.g., as congestion becomes more disliked by consumers. We show that the absolute advantage of subscription pricing relative to per-use pricing can be substantial, whereas the potential advantage of per-use pricing is generally modest. Subscription pricing becomes relatively more attractive if consumers become more heterogeneous in their service rates (e.g., some know they are \"heavy\" users and others know they are \"light\" users) as long as capacity is fixed, the potential utilization is high, and the two segments have substantially different usage rates.

We find that the effects of commonality on profit and variety level are stronger under a demand model in which product demands are more variable and exhibit pairwise negative correlation relative to a model with independent demands."}, {"e:author": ["anonymous"], "e:volume": "13", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/msom.1110.0330", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "271-274", "e:issn": "1523-4614", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1287/msom.1110.0330", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "MSOM Society Student Paper Competition: Abstracts of 2010 Winners", "e:journal": "Manufacturing & Service Operations Management", "e:abstract": "No abstract available."}, {"e:author": ["Stephen C.

Through their efforts, the journal was able to provide submitting authors with timely, thoughtful, and constructive reviews. In fact, for papers submitted in 2010, M&SOM received 581 reviews from 363 individuals. Remarkably, 61% of those reviews were submitted on or before their due date, a figure that increases to 69% if you allow a one-day grace period. Due in large part to the responsiveness of our reviewers, M&SOM made 96% of its 391 manuscript decisions for 2010 regular submissions and revisions within 75 days and 100% within 90 days. The following list acknowledges those who served from January to December 2010. On behalf of the editorial board and the submitting authors, we acknowledge their service to the journal and gratefully appreciate their contributions to our profession."}, {"e:author": ["Erica Plambeck", "Beril Toktay"], "e:volume": "13", "e:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/msom.1110.0331", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "280-280", "e:issn": "1523-4614", "e:issue": "2", "e:doi": "10.1287/msom.1110.0331", "e:year": 2011, "e:title": "Call for Papers--The M&SOM Special Issue on the Environment", "e:journal": "Manufacturing & Service Operations Management", "e:abstract": "No abstract available."}]
