The probability of ruin, defined as a first passage time, carries a dynamic element whose absence in Value at Risk is one liability, among others. Extreme value theory, which has been successfully applied to insurance shortly after it was introduced in probability, may offer a coherent framework for analyzing the extreme moves such as the ones observed in recent foreign exchange and financial crises. Lastly, we show that the genuine hazards generated by global capital markets and illustrated by the events of summer 1998, generate a market incompleteness that existing models of defaultable bonds do not fully address. In contrast, the long experience of risk premium analysis in the insurance and reinsurance industry, as well as the existence of historical data on natural disasters, render the valuation of catastrophe bonds less perilous than that of defaultable bonds."}, {"e:volume": "2", "e:author": ["David Marshall", "Subu Venkataraman"], "e:issue": "2", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1023/A:1009705608627", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "125-157", "e:issn": "1572-3097", "e:doi": "10.1023/A:1009705608627", "e:year": 1999, "e:title": "Bank Capital Standards for Market Risk: A Welfare Analysis", "e:journal": "Review of Finance", "e:abstract": "We propose a simple model that is suitable for evaluating alternative bank capital regulatory proposals for market risk. Our model formalizes the conflict between bank objectives and regulatory goals. Banks' decisions represent a tension between their desire to exploit the deposit-insurance put option and their desire to preserve franchise value. Regulators seek to balance the social value of deposits in mediating transactions against the deadweight costs of failure resolution. Our social welfare criterion is standard: a weighted average agents' utilities. We demonstrate that banks do not incrementally alter their portfolio risk as the economic environment changes. Rather, banks either choose the minimal feasible risk or the maximal feasible risk. This pattern, in turn, drives regulatory decisions: The first goal of the regulator is to induce banks to choose the minimal risk level. For all nontrivial cases, unregulated banks fail to choose the first-best allocations. Traditional ex-ante capital requirements can induce banks to choose the socially-optimal level of portfolio risk, but the required capital is often inefficiently high. In contrast, variants of the Federal Reserve Board's precommitment proposal imply far smaller efficiency losses, and achieve allocations at or nearthe first-best for most reasonable model specifications. The ex-post penalties required for the optimal implementation of precommitment are not excessively large. The welfare gains from precommitment are even higher when the precommitment penalty function is precluded from sending banks into default. We conclude that state-contingent regulatory mechanisms, of which the precommitment approach is an example, offer the possibility of substantial gains in regulatory efficiency, relative to traditional state non-contingent regulation."}, {"e:volume": "2", "e:author": ["Pierre Mella-Barral"], "e:issue": "2", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1023/A:1009720227906", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "159-160", "e:issn": "1572-3097", "e:doi": "10.1023/A:1009720227906", "e:year": 1999, "e:title": "Comment on ‘Bank Capital Standards for Market Risk: A Welfare Analysis’", "e:journal": "Review of Finance", "e:abstract": ""}, {"e:volume": "2", "e:author": ["Mark Britten-Jones", "Stephen M.

Operational hedging is also less important for commodity-based firms, which face price but not quantity uncertainty. When the fixed costs of establishing a plant are low or the variability of the exchange rate is high, a firm may benefit from establishing plants in both the domestic and foreign location. Capacity allocated to the foreign location relative to the domestic location will increase when the variability of foreign demand increases relative to the variability of domestic demand or when the expected profit margin is larger. For firms with plants in both a domestic and foreign location, the foreign currency cash flow generally will not be independent of the exchange rate and consequently the optimal financial hedging policy cannot be implemented with forward contracts alone.

However, before May 1998 there was considerable uncertainty about who would join EMU, and whether the project would start on time. When a monetary union is formed, exchange rates between the member countries are irrevocably fixed, and yield spreads stemming from exchange-rate risk are eliminated. As a direct consequence, EMU affected the prices of long-term bonds well before 1999, but quantifying this effect can be difficult when there is uncertainty about the monetary union. We address these issues and develop a bond-pricing model which explicitly takes into account that a country may join a monetary union at a future, unspecified date. The empirical results show that a narrow EMU, consisting of Germany, France and the Benelux countries, has been priced with almost 100% probability throughout the period 1995—1998, whereas, on average, the implied probability of joining EMU has been somewhat lower for the other EU countries. However, in the period leading up to May 1998, the estimated probabilities have increased considerably for the countries that joined EMU in January 1999.

The coupon (or voucher) privatization process, which has been frequently utilized in Eastern Europe, is generally characterized by a transfer of government holdings to the public for less than their full economic value. The vouchers process in the Czech Republic, specifically, is a case in which the transfer was practically free and in which foreign participation was banned. As such, and in the absence of an actual flow of funds, the process constituted an interesting large-scale experiment of a price discovery mechanism whose empirical conclusions are inconclusive. On the one hand, the variance of the expected outcomes declines during this process, but on the other hand, the participants could obtain superior outcomes using public information, while some, who had access to private information, may performed even better. Thus, wondering whether the process in the Czech Republic served as an efficient price discovery mechanism, additional potential distortions should be investigated: (i) the specific rules of the process through which the public exchanged bidding points for shares, or (ii) the role that funds' managers played, in lieu of the potential conflict between their objective functions and those of the shareholders of these funds, and (iii) lack of uniformity in information reporting standards. Generally, a failure to discover prices may lead to inefficiency in capital markets, because of the potential distortion of relative prices. If, in fact, the process in the Czech Republic, during the ‘second wave’, in which most of the shares of over 800 companies were transferred to the private sector, did not serve as an immediate price discovery mechanism, the ‘damage’, if any, was probably not significant, since it was not associated with a massive reallocation of funds, and the market could eventually correct itself once real funds started to pour in, in reaction to post-process relative prices."}, {"e:volume": "3", "e:author": ["Jia He", "Lilian Ng", "Chu Zhang"], "e:issue": "2", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1023/A:1009803503148", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "205-232", "e:issn": "1572-3097", "e:doi": "10.1023/A:1009803503148", "e:year": 1999, "e:title": "Asset Pricing Specification Errors and Performance Evaluation", "e:journal": "Review of Finance", "e:abstract": "Many evaluation techniques typically measure performance as deviations of average returns on actively managed funds from those predicted by some asset pricing model.

We first estimate the multivariate SV model via the efficient method of moments (EMM) technique based on observations of underlying state variables, and then investigate the respective effects of stochastic interest rates, stochastic volatility, and asymmetric S&amp;P500 index returns on option prices. We compute option prices using both reprojected underlying historical volatilities and the implied risk premium of stochastic volatility to gauge each model's performance through direct comparison with observed market option prices on the index. Our major empirical findings are summarized as follows. First, while allowing for stochastic volatilitycan reduce the pricing errors and allowing for asymmetric volatility or \"leverage effect\" does help to explain the skewness of the volatility \"smile\", allowing for stochastic interest rates has minimal impact on option prices in our case. Second, similar to Melino and Turnbull (1990), our empirical findings strongly suggest the existence of a non-zero risk premium for stochastic volatility of asset returns. Based on the implied volatility risk premium, the SV models can largely reduce the option pricing errors, suggesting the importance of incorporating the information from the options market in pricing options. Finally, both the model diagnostics and option pricing errors in our study suggest that the Gaussian SV model is not sufficient in modeling short-term kurtosis of asset returns, an SV model with fatter-tailed noise or jump component may have better explanatory power.

To prevent from numerical deficiencies, the space axis is discretized first, and not the time axis. In a Black–Scholes setup, models with improved convergence properties are constructed: a trinomial model and a randomized trinomial model where price changes occur at the jump times of a Poisson process. These lattice models are sufficiently general to handle options with multiple barriers: the numerical difficulties are resolved and extrapolation yields even more accurate results. In a last step, we extend the Black–Scholes setup and incorporate unpredictable discontinuous price movements. The randomized trinomial model can easily be extended to this case, inheriting its superior convergence properties.
