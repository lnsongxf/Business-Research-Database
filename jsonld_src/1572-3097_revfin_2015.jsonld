Factor implied risk exposures are obtained by breaking down a change in risk disclosure into a market volatility component and a bank-specific risk exposure component. In a study of large US and international banks, we show that (i) changes in risk exposures are negatively correlated with market volatility and (ii) changes in risk exposures are positively correlated across banks, which is consistent with banks exhibiting commonality in trading."}, {"e:volume": "19", "e:author": ["Raoul Minetti", "Sung-Guan Yun"], "e:issue": "6", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rof/rfu053", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "2223-2275", "e:issn": "1572-3097", "e:doi": "10.1093/rof/rfu053", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Institutions, Bailout Policies, and Bank Loan Contracting: Evidence from Korean Chaebols", "e:journal": "Review of Finance", "e:abstract": "In emerging economies, institutional and regulatory constraints can distort loan contracting and, hence, the incentives of lenders and borrowers. Studying the South Korean syndicated loan market, we find that during the 90s the safety net protecting business groups (chaebols)—especially the government’s bailout policy—affected the structure and pricing of loans to chaebol firms. However, after the chaebol reform of the late 90s dismantled the chaebol safety net, the differences in loan contracts between chaebol and non-chaebol firms narrowed or disappeared. The results suggest that the reform restored lenders’ incentives to monitor chaebol firms and properly assess their risk."}, {"e:volume": "19", "e:author": ["Claudio Loderer", "URS Waelchli"], "e:issue": "6", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rof/rfu048", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "2277-2315", "e:issn": "1572-3097", "e:doi": "10.1093/rof/rfu048", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Corporate Aging and Takeover Risk", "e:journal": "Review of Finance", "e:abstract": "Although growth opportunities fade and profitability declines as firms mature, older firms are no more likely to be acquired than young firms are. This article documents and explains that phenomenon. We argue that, because mature organizations are rationally less flexible, they are more costly to integrate and therefore comparatively unattractive acquisition candidates. The evidence supports this explanation of the negative age dependence of takeover hazard. The evidence also shows that negative exogenous shocks to merger benefits further reduce the takeover hazard of mature firms. We test many alternative explanations and find no evidence that they can explain the hazard decline."}, {"e:volume": "19", "e:author": ["Xiaoneng Zhu"], "e:issue": "6", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rof/rfu047", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "2317-2358", "e:issn": "1572-3097", "e:doi": "10.1093/rof/rfu047", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "Tug-of-War: Time-Varying Predictability of Stock Returns and Dividend Growth", "e:journal": "Review of Finance", "e:abstract": "We propose a regime-switching present-value model with latent variables to jointly investigate the predictability of stock returns and dividend growth. We find that both return predictability and dividend growth predictability are time-varying. Interestingly, the predictability of stock returns and dividend growth is a tug-of-war contest: when dividend growth is highly predictable in the high-volatility regime, stock returns are largely unpredictable; in contrast, when dividend growth is less predictable in the low-volatility regime, stock returns are significantly predictable. We also investigate macroeconomic determinants of regime switches and find that two regimes are intimately related to macroeconomic risk and economic activity."}, {"e:volume": "19", "e:author": ["Chunhua Lan"], "e:issue": "6", "e:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rof/rfu052", "e:keyword": [], "e:pages": "2359-2399", "e:issn": "1572-3097", "e:doi": "10.1093/rof/rfu052", "e:year": 2015, "e:title": "An Out-of-Sample Evaluation of Dynamic Portfolio Strategies", "e:journal": "Review of Finance", "e:abstract": "This article evaluates out-of-sample portfolio performance for a real-time investor who can exploit time variation in the conditional mean and volatility of stock returns in optimizing a multiperiod portfolio choice problem. With the presence of parameter uncertainty, our out-of-sample analysis shows that ignoring time variation in the first two return moments leads to significant utility costs of at least 1.97% of annualized certainty equivalent return. Accounting for the time-varying risk premium plays a more important role than considering time-varying volatility in improving portfolio performance. Interestingly, behaving myopically or ignoring the hedge against changes in future investment opportunities can lead to small out-of-sample utility losses or even utility gains."}]
