Previous studies have mostly focused on identifying bidding strategies in single, isolated online auctions.  Using a large data set collected from sequential online auctions, we first characterize bidding strategies in this interesting online environment and then develop an empirical model to explain bidders’ adoption of different strategies.  We also examine how bidders change their strategies over time.  Our findings challenge the general belief that bidders employ their strategies regardless of experience or their specific demand.  We find that bidders’ demand, participation experience, and auction design parameters affect their choice of bidding strategies.  Bidders with unit demand are likely to choose early bidding strategies, while those with multiple unit demand adopt late bidding strategies.  Auction design parameters that affect bidders’ perception of demand and supply trends affect bidders’ choice of bidding strategies.  As bidders gain experience within a sequence of auctions, they start choosing late bidding strategies.

We are particularly interested in whether client firms benefit from the accumulated knowledge held by information technology (IT) service firms.  In this paper, we examine the impact of IT outsourcing on the productivity of firms that choose this mode of services delivery focusing, on the role of IT-related knowledge.  Since firms self-select into their optimal sourcing mode, we use a variety of econometric techniques including propensity score-based matching and switching regression to control for potential bias arising from endogenously determined sourcing modes.  We demonstrate that IT outsourcing does lead to productivity gains for firms that select this mode of service delivery.  Our results also suggest that IT-related knowledge held by IT services vendors enables these productivity gains, the magnitude of which is moderated by a firm’s IT intensity.  Moreover, the value of outsourcing to a client firm increases with its propensity for outsourcing, which in turn depends on firm-specific attributes including efficiency level, financial leverage, and variability in business conditions.

We examine structural results explaining the reasons firms join an MSSP network, and characterize the growth of MSSP network size under different forms of ownership (monopoly versus consortium).  We find that the need for an initial investment in MSSP networks (which is necessary to overcome the stalling effect) only affects the optimal network size for a consortium but has no impact on the optimal network size for a profit-maximizing monopolist.  Our results provide an explanation why the majority of the MSSPs are for-profit entities and consortium-based MSSPs are less common.

We find that high product uncertainty and low retailer visibility have a negative impact on customer satisfaction.

We gathered actual sale transactions for NPT hospitals in the United States to derive the q ratio, a measure of market value.  Our findings indicate that the influence of IT investment on the firm is more pronounced and statistically significant on firm value than exclusively on the accounting performance measures.  Specifically, we find that the impact of IT investment is not significant on return on assets (ROA) and operating income for the same set of hospitals.  This research note contributes to research and practice by demonstrating that the overall impact of IT is better understood when accounting measures are complemented with the firm’s market value.

With the rapid growth of Web 2.0 applications, online environmental scanning provides top executives with unprecedented opportunities to tap into collective web intelligence to develop better insights about the sociocultural and political–economic factors that cross-border M&As face.

A 2009 article in Nature suggested new approaches to modeling economic meltdowns are needed to prevent future financial crises. However, existing studies have not focused on analysis of systemic risk at the individual bank level in a banking network, which is essential for monitoring and mitigating contagious bank failures.  To this end, we develop a network approach to risk management (NARM) for modeling and analyzing systemic risk in banking systems. NARM views banks as a network linked through financial relationships.  It incorporates network and financial principles into a business intelligence (BI) algorithm to analyze systemic risk attributed to each individual bank via simulations based on real-world data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  Our research demonstrates the feasibility of modeling and analyzing systemic risk at the individual bank level in a banking network using a BI-based approach.  In terms of business impact, NARM offers a new means for predicting contagious bank failures and determining capital injection priorities in the wake of financial crises.  Our simulation study shows that under significant market shocks, the interbank payment relationship becomes more influential than the correlated bank portfolio relationship in determining an individual bank’s survival.  These insights should help financial regulators devise more effective policies and mechanisms to prevent the collapse of a banking system.  Further, NARM and the simulation procedure driven by real-world data proposed in this study have instructional value to similar research areas such as bank stress testing, where time series data and business networks may be studied."}, {"e:volume": "36", "e:issn": "2162-9730", "e:issue": "4", "e:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol36/iss4/21", "e:keyword": ["Fraud detection", "Financial statement fraud", "Feature construction", "Meta-learning", "Business intelligence", "Design science"], "e:author": ["Ahmed Abbasi", "Conan Albrecht", "Anthony Osborn Vance", "James V.

However, most methods have yielded performance results that are less than ideal.  In consequence, financial fraud detection continues as an important challenge for business intelligence technologies.  In light of the need for more robust identification methods, we use a design science approach to develop MetaFraud, a novel meta-learning framework for enhanced financial fraud detection.  To evaluate the proposed framework, a series of experiments are conducted on a test bed encompassing thousands of legitimate and fraudulent firms.  The results reveal that each component of the framework significantly contributes to its overall effectiveness.  Additional experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the meta-learning framework over state-of-the-art financial fraud detection methods.  Moreover, the MetaFraud framework generates confidence scores associated with each prediction that can facilitate unprecedented financial fraud detection performance and serve as a useful decision-making aid.

Most of the works in the recommender systems literature have been developed under the assumption that user preference has a static pattern.  However, this is a strong assumption especially when the user is observed over a long period of time.  With the help of a data set on employees’ blog reading behavior, we show that users’ product selection behaviors change over time.  We propose a hidden Markov model to correctly interpret the users’ product selection behaviors and make personalized recommendations.  The user preference is modeled as a hidden Markov sequence.  A variable number of product selections of different types by each user in each time period requires a novel observation model.  We propose a negative binomial mixture of multinomial to model such observations.  This allows us to identify stable global preferences of users and to track individual users through these preferences.  We evaluate our model using three real-world data sets with different characteristics.  They include data on employee blog reading behavior inside a firm, users’ movie rating behavior at Netflix, and users’ music listening behavior collected through last.fm.  We compare the recommendation performance of the proposed model with that of a number of collaborative filtering algorithms and a recently proposed temporal link prediction algorithm.  We find that the proposed HMM-based collaborative filter performs as well as the best among the alternative algorithms when the data is sparse or static.  However, it outperforms the existing algorithms when the data is less sparse and the user preference is changing.

We argue the focus must include not only the act and its immediate antecedents of intention (to commit computer abuse) and deterrence (of the crime), but also phenomena which temporally precede these areas. Specifically, we assert the need to consider the thought processes of the potential offender and how these are influenced by the organizational context, prior to deterrence. We believe the interplay between thought processes and this context may significantly impact the efficacy of IS security controls, specifically deterrence safeguards. Through this focus, we extend the Straub and Welke (1998) security action cycle framework and propose three areas worthy of empirical investigation—techniques of neutralization (rationalization), expressive/instrumental criminal motivations, and disgruntlement as a result of perceptions of organizational injustice—and propose questions for future research in these areas."}, {"e:volume": "37", "e:issn": "2162-9730", "e:issue": "1", "e:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol37/iss1/3", "e:keyword": ["Meta-inferences", "Mixed methods", "Multimethod", "Positivist", "Qualitative", "Quantitative", "Research method", "Research design", "Validity"], "e:author": ["Viswanath Venkatesh", "Sue Brown", "Hillol Bala"], "e:doi": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol37/iss1/3", "e:year": 2013, "e:title": "Bridging the Qualitative–Quantitative Divide:  Guidelines for Conducting Mixed Methods Research in Information Systems", "e:journal": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "e:abstract": "Mixed methods research is an approach that combines quantitative and qualitative research methods in the same research inquiry.

For example, combinatorial auctions—in which bidders can bid on combinations of goods—have been shown to increase the economic efficiency of a trade when goods have complementarities.  However, the lack of real-time decision support tools for bidders has prevented this mechanism from reaching its full potential.  With the objective of facilitating bidder participation in combinatorial auctions, this study, using recent research in real-time bidder support metrics, discusses several novel feedback schemes that can aid bidders in formulating combinatorial bids in real-time.  The feedback schemes allow us to conduct continuous combinatorial auctions, where bidders can submit bids at any time.  Using laboratory experiments with two different setups, we compare the economic performance of the continuous mechanism under three progressively advanced levels of feedback.  Our findings indicate that information feedback plays a major role in influencing the economic outcomes of combinatorial auctions.  We compare several important bid characteristics to explain the observed differences in aggregate measures.  This study advances the ongoing research on combinatorial auctions by developing continuous auctions that differentiate themselves from earlier combinatorial auction mechanisms by facilitating free-flowing participation of bidders and providing exact prices of bundles on demand in real time.

Operationalizing e-government service quality to investigate and improve the design of e-government websites has been a much sought-after objective.

Drawing from marketing literature, we undertake a goal approach to this problem by delineating e-government service quality into aspects of IT-mediated service content and service delivery.  Whereas service content describes the functions available on an e-government website that assist citizens in completing their transactional goals, service delivery defines the manner by which these functions are made accessible via the web interface as a delivery channel.  We construct and empirically test a research model that depicts a comprehensive collection of web-enabled service content functions and delivery dimensions desirable by citizens.  Empirical findings from an online survey of 647 respondents attest to the value of distinguishing between service content functions and delivery dimensions in designing e-government websites.  Both service content and delivery are found to be significant contributors to achieving e-government service quality.  These IT-mediated service content functions and delivery dimensions represent core areas of e-government website design where the application of technology makes a difference, especially when considered in tandem with the type of transactional activity.

Using extant research on tournaments and intrinsic motivation, we model competitive games as a skill-based tournament and conduct an experimental study to understand player behaviors and emotional responses under different competition conditions.  When players compete with players of similar skill levels, they apply more effort as indicated by more games played and longer duration of play.

Drawing on the information processing view, resource-based view, and transaction cost theory, this study explicates how buyer performance can result from buyer’s use of relation-specific information processing solutions and supplier’s relational responses.  Two interfirm information processing solutions are proposed and examined:  the use of IT-based systems for planning and control, and the use of relational (normative) contracts.  Based on a sample of 144 manufacturing firms, eight of the nine proposed research hypotheses receive empirical support using PLS analysis.  The findings suggest that as buyers and suppliers utilize the IT and relational solutions, they induce relation-specific responses represented as supplier’s business process investments and modification flexibility, which in turn lead to positive buyer outcomes.

Within organizations, IS habits may develop over long periods of time and are typically embedded within larger, frequently practiced, higher-level work routines or task sequences.  When new systems are introduced for the purpose of at least partially replacing incumbent systems, existing IS habits embedded in these routines may inhibit adoption and use of the new systems.  Therefore, understanding how work-related IS habits form, how they enable and inhibit behavior, and how they can be disrupted or encouraged requires that we examine them within the context of organizational and individual level work routines. The current study integrates psychology and organizational behavior literature on cognitive scripts and work routines to examine IS habits as they occur embedded within larger, more complex task sequences.  The objective of the paper is to contribute to the IS habit literature by (1)　situating IS habits within the context of their associated work routines and task sequences, and (2)　providing a theoretical understanding of how incumbent system habits can be disrupted, and how development of new system habits can be encouraged, within this context.  We draw from extant research in psychology, organizational behavior, and consumer behavior to offer propositions about context-focused organizational interventions to break, or otherwise discourage, the continued performance of incumbent system habits and to encourage the development of new system habits.  Specifically, our theoretical development includes script disruption techniques, training-in-context, and performance goal suspension as organizational interventions that disrupt incumbent system habits.  We further theorize how stabilizing contextual variables associated with modified work routines can facilitate the development of new system habits.

In the information and communication technology (ICT) context, a growing number of studies consider the affective dimension of human interaction with ICTs.

Many of these issues stem from ambiguous conceptualizations of various affectiveconcepts and their relationships.  Before researchers can addressquestions such as \"what causes affective responses in an ICT context\" and \"what impacts do affective responses have on human interaction with ICTs,\" a theoretical foundation for affective concepts and their relationships has to be established.This theory and review paper addresses three research questions:  (1)　What are pertinent affective concepts in the ICT context?  (2)　In what ways are these affective concepts similar to, or different from each other?  (3)　How do these affective concepts relate to or influence one another?  Based on theoretical reasoning and empirical evidence, the affective response model (ARM) is developed.  ARM is a theoretically bound conceptual framework that provides a systematic and holistic reference map for any ICT study that considers affect.  It includes a taxonomy that classifies affective concepts along five dimensions:  the residing, the temporal, the particular/general stimulus, the object/behavior stimulus, and the process/outcome dimensions.  ARM also provides a nomological network to indicate the causal or co-occurring relationships among the various types of affective concepts in an ICT interaction episode.

We test our hypotheses using longitudinal KMS usage data on over 80,000 employees of a management consulting firm. Our approach infers the presence of identification and internalization from associations between actual system use behaviors by a focal individual and prior system use by a range of reference groups.  Evidence of these kinds of associations between system use behaviors helps construct a more complete picture of social influence mechanisms, and is to our knowledge novel to the technology diffusion literature.

Our results suggest that firms benefit more in terms of reduction in non-IT operating costs when they also have higher levels of complementary investments in internal IT, especially IT labor.

Through a three-part qualitative case study of 13 China-based IT service firms, including almost all of the Chinese suppliers recognized globally, this study elaborates the internationalization behavior and decision rationale of these suppliers. The findings show that these major Chinese suppliers include both firms that incrementally internationalize and firms that are “born global.” For both types of firms, the entry and growth in different markets is a highly dynamic activity combining a strategically planned, resource-seeking process and a flexible, opportunistic bricolage process based on existing operation capabilities and client relationships.

While there is an emerging literature on IPC, there is limited agreement about its conceptualization in terms of its key dimensions and its factor structure. Based on the multidimensional developmental theory and a review of the prior literature, we identify alternative conceptualizations of IPC. We examine the various conceptualizations of IPC with four online surveys involving nearly 4,000 Internet users. As a baseline, study 1 compares the integrated conceptualization of IPC to two existing conceptualizations in the literature. While the results provide support for the integrated conceptualization, the second-order factor model does not outperform the correlated first-order factor model. Study 2 replicates the study on a different sample and confirms the results of study 1. We also investigate whether the prior results are affected by the different perspectives adopted in the wording of items in the original instruments. In study 3, we find that focusing on one’s concern for website behavior (rather than one’s expectation of website behavior) and adopting a consistent perspective in the wording of the items help to improve the validity of the factor structure. We then examine the hypothesized third-order conceptualizations of IPC through a number of alternative higher-order models. The empirical results confirm that, in general, the third-order conceptualizations of IPC outperform their lower-order alternatives. In addition, the conceptualization of IPC that has the best fit with the data contains a third-order general IPC factor, two second-order factors of interaction management and information management, and six first-order factors (i.e., collection, secondary usage, errors, improper access, control, and awareness). Study 4 cross-validates the results with another data set and examines IPC within the context of a nomological network. The results confirm that the third-order conceptualization of IPC has nomological validity, and it is a significant determinant of both trusting beliefs and risk beliefs.

Although the Information Systems community is engaged in significant research on IT, the reach of our findings may be limited. In this commentary, our objective is to focus the IS community’s attention on the striking transformations in economic and social systems spawned by IT and to encourage more research that offers useful implications for policy. We present examples of transformations occurring in four distinct sectors of the economy and propose policy-relevant questions that need to be addressed.  We urge researchers to write papers based on their findings that inform policy makers, managers, and decision makers about the issues that transformational technologies raise.  Finally, we suggest a new outlet to publish these essays on the implications of transformational informational technology."}]
