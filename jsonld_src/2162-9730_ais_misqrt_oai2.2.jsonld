By identifying the lead actors of the initiation, development, and approval stages in IT governance, the patterns of 57 IT investment decisions at 6 hospitals are analyzed.  The results reveal seven IT governance archetypes: (1) top management monarchy, (2) top management–IT duopoly, (3) IT monarchy, (4) administration monarchy, (5) administration– IT duopoly, (6) professional monarchy, and (7) professional– IT duopoly.  Each archetype is analyzed by taking into account four specific factors:  IT investment level, external influence, organizational centralization, and IT function power. This study makes several contributions to IT governance theory and practice.  First, IT governance is reframed to include pre-decision stages, highlighting the importance of participants other than the final decision maker.  Second, the variation of IT governance archetypes suggests that even when top management approval is required, the IT department may not play a key role in the IT investment decision process.  Third, governance of the pre-decision initiation and development stages is found to be jointly affected by several contextual factors, suggesting that the allocation of final decision rights is only a part of IT governance.  While decision rights may be allocated by the organization a priori, the actual patterns of IT governance are contingent on contextual factors.  It is important to understand how IT governance archetypes are shaped because they may affect desired outcomes of IT investments."}, {"e:volume": "32", "e:issn": "2162-9730", "e:issue": "1", "e:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol32/iss1/8", "e:keyword": ["Structuration theory", "Review", "IS research"], "e:author": ["Matthew R.

Fewer DSS studies have integrated decision process variables, such as user beliefs and attitudes, in their models.  In this paper, we examine the mediating role of decision process variables in the use of an online customer DSS.  We do so through an experimental study of an alternative-based and an attribute-based DSS for product customization by online customers.  Using cognitive fit and flow theories, we develop a theoretical model with four mediating decision process variables (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, and perceived control) and two of their antecedents:  interface design (attribute-based versus alternative-based) and task complexity (choice set size).  Our results show that the impact of DSS interface design on behavioral intentions is fully mediated by perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment, although not by perceived control.  Specifically, we verify that users of an attribute-based DSS express higher perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment than users of an alternative-based one.  In addition, we find that task complexity has an interesting relationship with usefulness and enjoyment, both of which follow an inverted U-shaped curve as choice set size increases.  Finally, we find that for users of the alternative-based DSS, perceived ease of use and perceived control decrease as task complexity increases.  However, the attribute-based DSS alleviates that decline for both variables.  Among other contributions, our results indicate the importance of including decision process variables when studying DSS as well as the complex effect of task complexity on those variables.  Our study also provides some important guidelines for online companies that provide customer DSS on their websites, especially the danger of providing too many product choice options that can overwhelm customers and harm their shopping experience."}, {"e:volume": "32", "e:issn": "2162-9730", "e:issue": "1", "e:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol32/iss1/7", "e:keyword": ["Digital divide", "Digital inequality", "IT policy", "Technology acceptance", "Socio-economic inequality"], "e:author": ["J.

The context of our investigation is a city government project, known as the LaGrange Internet TV initiative, which allowed all city residents to access the Internet via their cable televisions at no additional cost.  We examine the residents’ post-implementation continued use intentions through a decomposed theory of planned behavior perspective, which is elaborated to include personal network exposure.  Differences in the behavioral models between socio-economically advantaged and disadvantaged users who have direct usage experience are theorized and empirically tested.  The results reveal distinct behavioral models and isolate the key factors that differentially impact the two groups.  The advantaged group has a higher tendency to respond to personal network exposure.  Enjoyment and confidence in using information and communication technologies, availability, and perceived behavioral control are more powerful in shaping continued ICT use intention for the disadvantaged.

By proposing that Information Systems researchers conduct applicability checks with practitioners on the research objects (for example, theories, models, frameworks, processes, technical artifacts, or other theoretically based IS artifacts) they either produce or use in theory-focused research, our paper presents an actionable, systematic approach to evaluating, establishing, and further improving research relevance.  Furthermore, because it is an approach that can be conducted as an additional step either at the beginning or the end of the traditional  research life cycle, it leaves untouched the rigorous methods used to conduct the study, that is, it does not compromise traditional research models.   The approach we propose is based on the analyses of three dimensions of relevance that are critical to practitioners’ attempts to internalize IS research findings (importance, accessibility, and suitability), and a comprehensive set of solutions that can be used to address them.  Our analysis reveals that the most critical dimension for practice is the importance of the research to the needs of practice.  The solution we propose to address that need is to conduct an applicability check on the research objects of interest.  The applicability check forms an integral part of the research process, either prior to or following engagement in a typical research process.  We present principles and criteria for the conduct and evaluation of an applicability check, which is primarily based on the focus group method, and secondarily on a modified nominal group technique."}, {"e:volume": "32", "e:issn": "2162-9730", "e:issue": "1", "e:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol32/iss1/4", "e:keyword": ["Contribution behaviors", "Knowledge sharing", "Knowledge management"], "e:author": ["Fernando Olivera", "Paul S.

Many EUS studies in the past have attempted to identify the antecedents of EUS, yet most of the relationships found have been criticized for their lack of a strong theoretical underpinning.  Today it is generally understood that IS failure is due to psychological and organizational issues rather than technological issues, hence individual differences must be addressed.  This study proposes a new model with an objective to extend our understanding of the antecedents of EUS by incorporating three well-founded theories of motivation, namely expectation theory, needs theory, and equity theory.  The uniqueness of the model not only recognizes the three different needs (i.e., work performance, relatedness, and self-development) that users may have with IS use, but also the corresponding inputs required from each individual to achieve those needs fulfillments, which have been ignored in most previous studies.  This input/needs fulfillment ratio, referred to as equitable needs fulfillment, is likely to vary from one individual to another and satisfaction will only result in a user if the needs being fulfilled are perceived as “worthy” to obtain.The partial least squares (PLS) method of structural equation modeling was used to analyze 922 survey returns collected form the hotel and airline sectors.  The results of the study show that IS end users do have different needs.  Equitable work performance fulfillment and equitable relatedness fulfillment play a significant role in affecting the satisfaction of end users.  The results also indicate that the impact of perceived IS performance expectations on EUS is not as significant as most previous studies have suggested.  The conclusion is that merely focusing on the technical soundness of the IS and the way in which it benefits employees may not be sufficient.  Rather, the input requirements of users for achieving the corresponding needs fulfillments also need to be examined."}, {"e:issn": "2162-9730", "e:volume": "31", "e:url":

It argues that a full understanding of the process of implementation of such systems should include not only technical aspects but also the social dynamics of an organization; specifically core values, distribution of power and mechanisms of control. A theoretical framework is formulated based on punctuated equilibrium and previous SIS literature, and is applied to an exploratory case study conducted in a Latin American public organization. The case study depicts how the initiative to implement SIS was the result of external and internal disturbances. The case analysis highlights relationships between an organization’s deep structure and SIS implementation. The paper concludes by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of the study.

When IS is used to advance socio-economic development in less developed countries (LDCs), there are additional sources contributing to this multiplicity. In the case of land management applications, it is important to consider the knowledge that communities have of the land they inhabit. This paper stresses the importance of constructing knowledge alliances between these multiple knowledge systems in order to support more effective IS development and implementation. The term \"knowledge alliance\" refers not merely to the material characteristics of the knowledge inscribed in technology, but also to the indigenous knowledge of the various communities involved. This includes the social setting that has shaped the practices which are responsible for the communities’ production, articulation and use of knowledge. Two key theoretical concepts, namely boundary objects and participation, are drawn upon both to understand the multiplicity of knowledge systems and to suggest possible approaches to the creation of effective knowledge alliances. The empirical setting for this analysis is a study of the use of GIS for land management in India.

The system was designed by a European consortium led by a Spanish polytechnic in cooperation with two universities in Lima and the Peruvian Ministry of Health. The purpose of the system was to improve health conditions by extending science-based medicine into a region with well-established traditional healing practices. The central analytical focus of this article is on the interplay between the public health care system, which used the telemedicine system, and local health care practices. The manner in which scientific medicine was delivered through information technology and public health care services is analyzed in terms of the health personnel’s activity, the local population’s conceptions of health, and the trajectories followed by patients seeking recovery. The author participated in the design of the second evaluation of the telemedicine system and acted as a participant observer in the regional hospital and peripheral clinics. In addition to interviewing health care staff from the study area, the author also met with traditional healers and patients in the districts whether or not they were involved in the telemedicine project. New institutional theory provided the analytical framework for the interpretation of the observed behavior of the public health care staff, traditional healers, and potential patients. Empirically, this study describes the informal aspects of the functioning of the telemedicine system, and its partial mismatch with the definitions of health and illness employed by local communities and healers.   An argument is made that people’s construction of their health, which is embedded in their normal patterns of action, should be identified, and then considered in the design, implementation, and evaluation of future telemedicine projects.

In this article, we propose a strategy for developing information infrastructures in general and in particular for the health care sector in developing countries. We use complexity science to explain the challenges that need to be addressed, in particular the needs for standards that can adapt to a changing health care environment, and propose the concept of flexible standards as a key element in a sustainable infrastructure development strategy. Drawing on case material from a number of developing countries, a case is built around the use of flexible standards as attractors, arguing that if they are well defined and simple, they will be able to adapt to the frequent changes that are experienced in the complex health environment. A number of paradoxes are highlighted as useful strategies – integrated independence being one that encourages experimentation and heterogeneity to develop and share innovative solutions, while still conforming to simple standards. The article provides theoretical concepts to support standardization processes in complex systems, and to suggest an approach to implement health standards in developing country settings that is sensitive to the local context, allows change to occur through small steps, and provides a mechanism for scaling information systems."}, {"e:volume": "31", "e:issn": "2162-9730", "e:issue": "2", "e:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol31/iss2/3", "e:keyword": ["Strategic alignment of IT", "Strategic value of IT", "Business value of IT", "Resource-centered view", "Contingency approach", "Nonlinear approaches", "Organizational performance"], "e:author": ["Wonseok Oh", "Alain Pinsonneault"], "e:doi": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol31/iss2/3", "e:year": 2007, "e:title": "On the Assessment of the Strategic Value of Information Technologies:  Conceptual and Analytical Approaches", "e:journal": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "e:abstract": "This study compares two conceptual (resource-centered and contingency-based) and two analytical approaches (linear and nonlinear) that can be used to assess the strategic value of information technology. Two hypotheses related to these approaches are developed and tested based on matched survey data collected from the CEOs and CIOs of 110 firms. The results indicate that the resource-centered and contingency-based approaches provide complementary understanding of the strategic value of IT. On the one hand, the contingency-based approach is better at explaining the impact of cost-oriented IT applications on firm performance. Alignment between business strategy and IS strategy on cost reduction was found to have a significant negative association with firm expense. On the other hand, the resource-centered perspective has a stronger predictive ability of IT impact on firm revenue and profitability. Our results indicate that investments in growth-oriented applications were directly and positively related to firm revenue. An ANOVA test indicates that the nonlinear approaches provide additional insights that help to better understand the relationship between alignment and performance. The response surface method (RSM) shows that high-end strategic alignment (e.g., fit occurring when business strategy and IT strategy are both high) leads to superior performance compared to low-end strategic alignment (e.g., fit occurring when business strategy and IT strategy are both low).

In this study, we seek to expand our understanding of media usage in organizations where there is a multiplicity of communication media available to employees.  We use communication media repertoires as the lens through which we explore how media is used in the support of communication-based work performed by individuals in complex organizational settings.  Data were collected in sales divisions at two large corporations in the information technology industry.  We compared multiple media use within and between the two sales divisions, and identified similarities and differences in repertoires.  Our findings suggest that use of repertoires is influenced by institutional conditions (e.g., incentives, trust, and physical proximity) and situational conditions (e.g., urgency, task, etc.), and by routine use of the media over time.   Based on the findings, we propose a framework for investigating the use of multiple media in organizations through examination of communication media repertoires.

Its mission has been to empower managers, IS engineers, and information and communication technology users with knowledge and techniques for effective decision making. However, empirical research frequently encounters human activity that is at odds with the assumed pattern of rational  behavior. Recent work tries to explain behavior in IS and organizational change in terms of social processes rather than as a consideration of rational techniques of professional practice. In this paper, this ambivalence is addressed within the IS field with regard to technical/rational knowledge and practice. We draw from the theoretical work of Michel Foucault on power/knowledge and the aesthetics of existence to argue that the rational techniques of IS practice and the power dynamics of an organization and its social context are closely intertwined, requiring each other to be sustained. Furthermore, we develop a context-specific notion of rationality in IS innovation, through which interested parties judge the value of an innovation for their lives and consequently support or subvert its course. We demonstrate these ideas with a case study of a social security organization in Greece."}, {"e:issn": "2162-9730", "e:volume": "31", "e:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol31/iss2/1", "e:keyword": [], "e:author": ["Carol Saunders"], "e:doi": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol31/iss2/1", "e:year": 2007, "e:title": "Information Systems in Developing Countries", "e:journal": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "e:issue": "2"}, {"e:volume": "31", "e:issn": "2162-9730", "e:issue": "2", "e:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol31/iss2/2", "e:keyword": [], "e:author": ["Rajeev Sharma", "Philip Yetton"], "e:doi": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol31/iss2/2", "e:year": 2007, "e:title": "The Contingent Effects of Training, Technical Complexity, and Task Interdependence on Successful Information Systems Implementation", "e:journal": "Management Information Systems Quarterly", "e:abstract": "Research has investigated the main effect of training on IS implementation success.

Road warriors are IT professionals who spend most of their workweek away from home at a client site.  Building on Moore’s (2000) work on turnover intention, this article develops and tests a model that is context-specific to the road warrior situation. The model highlights the effects of work-family conflict and job autonomy, factors especially applicable to the road warrior’s circumstances. Data were gathered from a company in the computer and software services industry.  This study provides empirical evidence for the effects of work-family conflict, perceived work overload, fairness of rewards, and job autonomy on organizational commitment and work exhaustion for road warriors.  The results suggest that work-family conflict is a key source of stress among IT road warriors because they have to juggle family and job duties as they work at distant client sites during the week. These findings suggest that the context of the IT worker matters to turnover intention, and that models that are adaptive to the work context will more effectively predict and explain turnover intention."}, {"e:volume": "31", "e:issn": "2162-9730", "e:issue": "1", "e:url": "http://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol31/iss1/4", "e:keyword": ["Privacy assurance", "Field experiment", "Privacy statement", "Privacy seal", "Monetary incentive", "Information request"], "e:author": ["Kai-Lung Hui", "Hock H.

Hence, it provided a field observation of the subjects' behavioral responses toward the privacy assurances.  We found that (1) the existence of a privacy statement induced more subjects to disclose their personal information but that of a privacy seal did not; (2) monetary incentive had a positive influence on disclosure; and (3) information request had a negative influence on disclosure.

Specifically, this model explains how top management mediates the impact of external institutional pressures on the degree of usage of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. The hypotheses were tested using survey data from companies that have already implemented ERP systems. Results from partial least squares (PLS) analyses suggest that mimetic pressures positively affect top management beliefs, which then positively affects top management participation in the ERP assimilation process. In turn, top management participation is confirmed to positively affect the degree of ERP usage. Results also suggest that coercive pressures positively affect top management participation without the mediation of top management beliefs. Surprisingly, we do not find support for our hypothesis that top management participation mediates the effect of normative pressures on ERP usage—but instead we find that normative pressures directly affect ERP usage. Our findings highlight the important role of top management in mediating the effect of institutional pressures on IT assimilation. We confirm that, institutional pressures, which are known to be important for IT adoption and implementation, also contribute to post-implementation assimilation when the integration processes are prolonged and outcomes are dynamic and uncertain."}]
