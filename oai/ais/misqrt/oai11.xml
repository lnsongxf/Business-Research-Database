			<dc:title>When Filling the Wait Makes it Feel Longer:  A Paradigm Shift Perspective for Managing Online Delay</dc:title>

<dc:description>As one of the most commonly experienced problems on the Internet, download delay is a significant impediment to the success of e-commerce websites.  While some research has examined how such delays can be reduced and how much delay online users will tolerate, little research has taken a theoretically grounded approach to managing perceptions of the wait.  Based on time perception theories, we develop a research model of the effects of actual wait time, amount of information, and direction of attention on perceptions of the wait.  Two empirical studies were conducted using an experimental travel website to test the proposed hypotheses.  The results show that with shorter waits, providing additional visual content, such as a travel picture, may make the wait feel longer.  However, with longer waits, additional visual content that distracts the user from the passage of time makes the wait feel shorter and reduces users’ negative affect toward the wait.  Further, the benefits of providing visual content in longer waits are enhanced as more content is provided.  Visual content should also be chosen to distract the user from time and temporal processing, as reminding users of the passage of time can encourage temporal processing and make the wait feel longer, especially in longer waits or when the amount of temporal visual content is high.  Our findings extend time perception theories and contribute to the literature by identifying a potential paradigm shift, from the retrospective to the prospective paradigm, when waiting times are prolonged.  Post hoc study results confirm the practical contribution of our research, demonstrating that several key findings are counter-intuitive to professional web designers.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Community Intelligence and Social Media Services:  A Rumor Theoretic Analysis of Tweets During Social Crises</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Oh, Onook</dc:creator>

<dc:description>Recent extreme events show that Twitter, a micro-blogging service, is emerging as the dominant social reporting tool to spread information on social crises.  It is elevating the online public community to the status of first responders who can collectively cope with social crises.  However, at the same time, many warnings have been raised about the reliability of community intelligence obtained through social reporting by the amateur online community.  Using rumor theory, this paper studies citizen-driven information processing through Twitter services using data from three social crises:  the Mumbai terrorist attacks in 2008, the Toyota recall in 2010, and the Seattle café shooting incident in 2012.  We approach social crises as communal efforts for community intelligence gathering and collective information processing to cope with and adapt to uncertain external situations.  We explore two issues:  (1)　collective social reporting as an information processing mechanism to address crisis problems and gather community intelligence, and (2)　the degeneration of social reporting into collective rumor mills.  Our analysis reveals that information with no clear source provided was the most important, personal involvement next in importance, and anxiety the least yet still important rumor causing factor on Twitter under social crisis situations.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Knowing What a User Likes:  A Design Science Approach to Interfaces that Automatically Adapt to Culture</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Reinecke, Katharina</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Bernstein, Abraham</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Adapting user interfaces to a user’s cultural background can increase satisfaction, revenue, and market share. Conventional approaches to catering for culture are restricted to adaptations for specific countries and modify only a limited number of interface components, such as the language or date and time formats.  We argue that a more comprehensive personalization of interfaces to cultural background is needed to appeal to users in expanding markets.  This paper introduces a low-cost, yet efficient method to achieve this goal:  cultural adaptivity.  Culturally adaptive interfaces are able to adapt their look and feel to suit visual preferences.  In a design science approach, we have developed a number of artifacts that support cultural adaptivity, including a prototype web application.  We evaluate the efficacy of the prototype’s automatically generated interfaces by comparing them with the preferred interfaces of 105 Rwandan, Swiss, Thai, and multicultural users.  The findings demonstrate the feasibility of providing users with interfaces that correspond to their cultural preferences in a novel yet effective manner.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Impact of Shaping on Knowledge Reuse for Organizational Improvement with Wikis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Majchrzak, Ann</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Wagner, Christian</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Yates, Dave</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this study, we explore the Wiki affordance of enabling shaping behavior within organizational intranets supported by Wikis.  Shaping is the continuous revision of one’s own and others’ contributions to a Wiki.　 Shaping promotes knowledge reuse through improved knowledge integration.　 Recognizing and clarifying the role of shaping allows us to theorize new ways in which knowledge resources affect knowledge reuse.　 We examine the role of three knowledge resources of a Wiki contributor:  knowledge depth, knowledge breadth, and assessment of the level of development of the Wiki community’s transactive memory system.  We offer preliminary evidence based on a sample of experienced organizational Wiki users that the three different knowledge resources have differential effects on shaping, that these effects differ from the effects on the more common user behavior of simply adding domain knowledge to a Wiki, and that shaping and adding each independently affect contributors’ perceptions that their knowledge in the Wiki has been reused for organizational improvement.  By empirically distinguishing between the different knowledge antecedents and consequences of shaping and adding, we derive implications for theory and research on knowledge integration and reuse.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Over the last three decades, the prevailing view of information technology strategy has been that it is a functional-level strategy that must be aligned with the firm’s chosen business strategy.  Even within this so-called alignment view, business strategy directed IT strategy.  During the last decade, the business infrastructure has become digital with increased interconnections among products, processes, and services.  Across many firms spanning different industries and sectors, digital technologies (viewed as combinations of information, computing, communication, and connectivity technologies) are fundamentally transforming business strategies, business processes, firm capabilities, products and services, and key interfirm relationships in extended business networks.  Accordingly, we argue that the time is right to rethink the role of IT strategy, from that of a functional-level strategy—aligned but essentially always subordinate to business strategy—to one that reflects a fusion between IT strategy and business strategy.  This fusion is herein termed digital business strategy.
We identify four key themes to guide our thinking on digital business strategy and help provide a framework to define the next generation of insights.  The four themes are (1)　the scope of digital business strategy, (2)　the scale of digital business strategy, (3)　the speed of digital business strategy, and (4)　the sources of business value creation and capture in digital business strategy.  After elaborating on each of these four themes, we discuss the success metrics and potential performance implications from pursuing a digital business strategy. We also show how the papers in the special issue shed light on digital strategies and offer directions to advance insights and shape future research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Information Technology and Business-Level Strategy:  Toward an Integrated Theoretical Perspective</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Drnevich, Paul L</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Croson, David C.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Information technology matters to business success because it directly affects the mechanisms through which they create and capture value to earn a profit:  IT is thus integral to a firm’s business-level strategy.  Much of the extant research on the IT/strategy relationship, however, inaccurately frames IT as only a functional-level strategy.  This widespread under-appreciation of the business-level role of IT indicates a need for substantial retheorizing of its role in strategy and its complex and interdependent relationship with the mechanisms through which firms generate profit.  Using a comprehensive framework of potential profit mechanisms, we argue that while IT activities remain integral to the functional-level strategies of the firm, they also play several significant roles in business strategy, with substantial performance implications.  IT affects industry structure and the set of business-level strategic alternatives and value-creation opportunities that a firm may pursue.  Along with complementary organizational changes, IT both enhances the firm’s current (ordinary) capabilities and enables new (dynamic) capabilities, including the flexibility to focus on rapidly changing opportunities or to abandon losing initiatives while salvaging substantial asset value.  Such digitally attributable capabilities also determine how much of this value, once created, can be captured by the firm—and how much will be dissipated through competition or through the power of value chain partners, the governance of which itself depends on IT.  We explore these business-level strategic roles of IT and discuss several provocative implications and future research directions in the converging information systems and strategy domains.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>How a Firm&#39;s Competitive Environment and Digital Strategy Posture Influence Digital Business Strategy</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mithas, Sunil</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Tafti, Ali</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Mitchell, Will</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, we examine how the competitive industry environment shapes the way that digital strategic posture (defined as a focal firm’s degree of engagement in a particular class of digital business practices relative to the industry norm) influences firms’ realized digital business strategy.  We focus on two forms of digital strategy:  general IT investment and IT outsourcing investment.  Drawing from prior literature on determinants of IT activity and competitive dynamics, we argue that three elements of the industry environment determine whether digital strategic posture has an increasingly convergent or divergent influence on digital business strategy.  By divergent influence, we mean an influence that leads to spending substantially more or less on a particular strategic activity than industry norms.  We predict that a digital strategic posture (difference from the industry mean) has an increasingly divergent effect on digital business strategy under higher industry turbulence, while having an increasingly convergent effect on digital business strategy under higher industry concentration and higher industry growth.  The study uses archival data for 400 U.S.-based firms from 1999 to 2006.  Our findings imply that digital business strategy is not solely a matter of optimizing firm operations internally or of responding to one or two focal competitors, but also arises strikingly from awareness and responsiveness to the digital business competitive environment.  Collectively, the findings provide insights on how strategic posture and industry environment influence firms’ digital business strategy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>As information technology becomes integral to the products and services in a growing range of industries, there has been a corresponding surge of interest in understanding how firms can effectively formulate and execute digital business strategies.  This fusion of IT within the business environment gives rise to a strategic tension between investing in digital artifacts for long-term value creation and exploiting them for short-term value appropriation.  Further, relentless innovation and competitive pressures dictate that firms continually adapt these artifacts to changing market and technological conditions, but sustained profitability requires scalable architectures that can serve a large customer base and stable interfaces that support integration across a diverse ecosystem of complementary offerings.  The study of digital business strategy needs new concepts and methods to examine how these forces are managed in pursuit of competitive advantage.  We conceptualize the logic of digital business strategy in terms of two constructs:  design capital (i.e., the cumulative stock of designs owned or controlled by a firm) and design moves (i.e., the discrete strategic actions that enlarge, reduce, or modify a firm’s stock of designs).  We also identify two salient dimensions of design capital, namely, option value and technical debt.  Using embedded case studies of four firms, we develop a rich conceptual model and testable propositions to lay out a design-based logic of digital business strategy.  This logic highlights the interplay between design moves and design capital in the context of digital business strategy and contributes to a growing body of insights that link the design of digital artifacts to competitive strategy and firm-level performance.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Leveraging Digital Technologies:  How Information Quality Leads to Localized Capabilities and Customer Service Performance</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Setia, Pankaj</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Venkatesh, Viswanath</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Joglekar, Supreet</dc:creator>
<dc:description>With the growing recognition of the customer’s role in service creation and delivery, there is an increased impetus on building customer-centric organizations.  Digital technologies play a key role in such organizations. Prior research studying digital business strategies has largely focused on building production-side competencies and there has been little focus on customer-side digital business strategies to leverage these technologies.  We propose a theory to understand the effectiveness of a customer-side digital business strategy focused on localized dynamics—here, a firm’s customer service units (CSUs).  Specifically, we use a capabilities perspective to propose digital design as an antecedent to two customer service capabilities—namely, customer orientation capability and customer response capability—across a firm’s CSUs.  These two capabilities will help a firm to locally sense and respond to customer needs, respectively.  Information quality from the digital design of the CSU is proposed as the antecedent to the two capabilities.  Proposed capability-building dynamics are tested using data collected from multiple respondents across 170 branches of a large bank.  Findings suggest that the impacts of information quality in capability-building are contingent on the local process characteristics.  We offer implications for a firm’s customer-side digital business strategy and present new areas for future examination of such strategies.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Content or Community?  A Digital Business Strategy for Content Providers in the Social Age</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Oestreicher-Singer, Gal</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Zalmanson, Lior</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The content industry has been undergoing a tremendous transformation in the last two decades.  We focus in this paper on recent changes in the form of social computing.  Although the content industry has implemented social computing to a large extent, it has done so from a techno-centric approach in which social features are viewed as complementary rather than integral to content.  This approach does not capitalize on users’ social behavior in the website and does not answer the content industry’s need to elicit payment from consumers.  We suggest that both of these objectives can be achieved by acknowledging the fusion between content and community, making the social experience central to the content website’s digital business strategy.  
We use data from Last.fm, a site offering both music consumption and online community features.  The basic use of Last.fm is free, and premium services are provided for a fixed monthly subscription fee.  Although the premium services on Last.fm are aimed primarily at improving the content consumption experience, we find that willingness to pay for premium services is strongly associated with the level of community participation of the user.
Drawing from the literature on levels of participation in online communities, we show that consumers’ willingness to pay increases as they climb the so-called &#34;ladder of participation&#34; on the website.  Moreover, we find that willingness to pay is more strongly linked to community participation than to the volume of content consumption.  We control for self-selection bias by using propensity score matching.  We extend our results by estimating a hazard model to study the effect of community activity on the time between joining the website and the subscription decision.  Our results suggest that firms whose digital business models remain viable in a world of &#34;freemium&#34; will be those that take a strategic rather than techno-centric view of social media, that integrate social media into the consumption and purchase experience rather than use it merely as a substitute for offline soft marketing.  We provide new evidence of the importance of fusing social computing with content delivery and, in the process, lay a foundation for a broader strategic path for the digital content industry in an age of growing user participation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Digital Business Strategy and Value Creation:  Framing the Dynamic Cycle of Control Points</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pagani, Margherita</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Within changing value networks, the profits and competitive advantages of participation reside dynamically at control points that are the positions of greatest value and/or power.  The enterprises that hold these positions have a great deal of control over how the network operates, how the benefits are redistributed, and how this influences the execution of a digital business strategy.  This article is based on a field study that provides preliminary, yet promising, empirical evidence that sheds light on the dynamic cycle of value creation and value capture points in digitally enabled networks in response to triggers related to technology and business strategy.  The context used is that of the European and U.S. broadcasting industry.  Specifically, the paper illustrates how incremental innovations may shift value networks from static, vertically integrated networks to more loosely coupled networks, and how cross-boundary industry disruptions may then, in turn, shift those to two-sided markets.  Based on the analysis, insights and implications for digital business strategy research and practice are then provided.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This section is a collection of shorter “Issue and Opinions” pieces that address some of the critical challenges around the evolution of digital business strategy. These voices and visions are from thought leaders who, in addition to their scholarship, have a keen sense of practice. They outline through their opinion pieces a series of issues that will need attention from both research and practice. These issues have been identified through their observation of practice with the eye of a scholar. They provide fertile opportunities for scholars in information systems, strategic management, and organizational theory.

<dc:description>In this study, we investigate the economic and strategic value of open innovation alliances (OIAs), in which collaborators and competitors integrate in the pursuit of the codevelopment of technological innovations. Given that OIAs differ substantially from traditional, closed alliances in many aspects, including their strategic scope and scale, governing mechanisms, and member composition, it is important to understand and assess the potential value inherent in these new modes of collaboration. Furthermore, OIAs evolve over time as the participating members are free to enter and leave at will. Therefore, we also examine the on-going value creation and wealth spillover that result from changes in membership. Moreover, we investigate how a firm’s participation in an IT-based open alliance alters the market value of its rivals operating within the same marketplace. To gain additional insight into the factors that moderate the market valuation of OIA participation, several contextual factors, including the degree of partner heterogeneity, innovation type, and degree of openness of the OIAs are used to account for variability in abnormal returns. Based on 194 observations, we found that allying firms realize significant positive abnormal returns when their entry into an OIA is made public. The results also suggest that substantial excessive returns accrue to the allying firms with the belated entry of a market leader firm. Furthermore, we discovered that a firm’s entry into an OIA increases, rather than decreases, the market valuation of its rivals. Interestingly, an incumbent rival that did not participate in the alliance appears to gain greater &#34;free-riding&#34; benefits from the OIA, as compared to peer rivals. Innovation type and openness were significantly associated with the amount of abnormal returns accruing to allying firms, while no significance was found for partner heterogeneity. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings for research and practice with respect to value cocreation in multifirm environments.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Empirical Examination of Individual Traits as Antecedents to Computer Anxiety and Computer Self-Efficacy</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Thatcher, Jason Bennett</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Perrewé, Pamela L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>To better understand how individual differences influence the use of information technology (IT), this study models and tests relationships among dynamic, IT-specific individual differences (i.e., computer self-efficacy and computer anxiety), stable, situation-specific traits (i.e., personal innovativeness in IT) and stable, broad traits (i.e., trait anxiety and negative affectivity). When compared to broad traits, the model suggests that situation-specific traits exert a more pervasive influence on IT situation-specific individual differences. Further, the model suggests that computer anxiety mediates the influence of situation-specific traits (i.e., personal innovativeness) on computer self-efficacy. Results provide support for many of the hypothesized relationships. From a theoretical perspective, the findings help to further our understanding of the nomological network among individual differences that lead to computer self-efficacy. From a practical perspective, the findings may help IT managers design training programs that more effectively increase the computer self-efficacy of users with different dispositional characteristics.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Moving Beyond Intentions and Toward the Theory of Trying:  Effects of Work Environment and Gender on Post-Adoption Information Technology Use</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ahuja, Manju K.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Thatcher, Jason Bennett</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Grounded in the theory of trying, this study examines the influence of the work environment and gender on trying to innovate with information technology.  The study extends the innovation diffusion literature by offering a theory-driven explanation for examining trying to innovate with IT and a parsimonious measure for this construct.  Drawing on the theory of reasoned action, we argue that work environment impediments render intentions inappropriate for examining emergent uses of IT. Instead of examining intentions, we introduce the goal-based construct of trying to innovate with IT as an appropriate dependent variable for examining emergent IT use. Statistical analysis supports the reliability and validity of a parsimonious measure of trying to innovate with IT. Analysis focuses on two research questions. First, do perceptions of the work environment such as overload and autonomy influence individuals’ trying to innovate with IT? Second, does gender influence the relationship between perceptions of the environment and trying to innovate with IT?   The model articulates how perceptions of the environment moderated by gender may influence trying to innovate with IT. Results provide evidence that overload and autonomy are antecedents to trying to innovate with information technology. Further, findings confirm that autonomy interacts with overload to determine trying to innovate with IT and that these relationships vary by gender. Implications for research and practice are offered.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Discovering Unobserved Heterogeneity in Structural Equation Models to Avert Validity Threats</dc:title>

<dc:description>A large proportion of information systems research is concerned with developing and testing models pertaining to complex cognition, behaviors, and outcomes of individuals, teams, organizations, and other social systems that are involved in the development, implementation, and utilization of information technology.  Given the complexity of these social and behavioral phenomena, heterogeneity is likely to exist in the samples used in IS studies.  While researchers now routinely address observed heterogeneity by introducing moderators, a priori groupings, and contextual factors in their research models, they have not examined how unobserved heterogeneity may affect their findings.  We describe why unobserved heterogeneity threatens different types of validity and use simulations to demonstrate that unobserved heterogeneity biases parameter estimates, thereby leading to Type　I and Type　II errors.  We also review different methods that can be used to uncover unobserved heterogeneity in structural equation models.  While methods to uncover unobserved heterogeneity in covariance-based structural equation models (CB-SEM) are relatively advanced, the methods for partial least squares (PLS) path models are limited and have relied on an extension of mixture regression—finite mixture partial least squares (FIMIX-PLS) and distance measure-based methods—that have mismatches with some characteristics of PLS path modeling.  We propose a new method—prediction-oriented segmentation (PLS-POS)—to overcome the limitations of FIMIX-PLS and other distance measure-based methods and conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the ability of PLS-POS and FIMIX-PLS to discover unobserved heterogeneity in both structural and measurement models.  Our results show that both PLS-POS and FIMIX-PLS perform well in discovering unobserved heterogeneity in structural paths when the measures are reflective and that PLS-POS also performs well in discovering unobserved heterogeneity in formative measures.  We propose an unobserved heterogeneity discovery (UHD) process that researchers can apply to (1) avert validity threats by uncovering unobserved heterogeneity and (2) elaborate on theory by turning unobserved heterogeneity into observed heterogeneity, thereby expanding theory through the integration of new moderator or contextual variables.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Venkatesh, Viswanath</dc:creator>
<dc:description>By distinguishing between employees’ online and offline workplace communication networks, this paper incorporates technology into social network theory to understand employees’ job performance.  Specifically, we conceptualize network ties as direct and indirect ties in both online and offline workplace communication networks, thus resulting in four distinct types of ties.  We theorize that employees’ ties in online and offline workplace communication networks are complementary resources that interact to influence their job performance.  We found support for our model in a field study among 104 employees in a large telecommunication company.  The paper concludes with theoretical and practical implications.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Dramaturgical Model of the Production of Performance Data</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Vieira da Cunha, João</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The production of performance data in organizations is often described as a functional process that managers enforce on their employees to provide leaders with accurate information about employees’ work and their achievements.  This study draws on a 15-month ethnography of a desk sales unit to build a dramaturgical model that explains how managers participate in the production of performance data to impress rather than inform leaders.  Research on management information systems is reviewed to outline a protective specification of this model where managers participate in the production of performance data to suppress information that threatens the image they present to leaders.  Ethnographic data about the production and use of performance records and performance reports in a desk sales unit is examined to induce an exploitive specification of this dramaturgical model.  This specification explains how people can take advantage of the opportunities, rather than just avoid the threats that performance data presents for impression management.  It also demonstrates how managers can participate in the production of performance data to create an idealized version of their accomplishments and that leaders reify these data by using them in their own attempts at impressing others.  By doing so, leaders and managers turn information systems into store windows to show achievement upward instead of transparent windows to monitor compliance downward.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>When Does Technology Use Enable Network Change in Organizations?  A Comparative Study of Feature Use and Shared Affordances</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Leonardi, Paul M.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The goal of this study is to augment explanations of how newly implemented technologies enable network change within organizations with an understanding of when such change is likely to happen.  Drawing on the emerging literature on technology affordances, the paper suggests that informal network change within interdependent organizational groups is unlikely to occur until users converge on a shared appropriation of the new technology’s features such that the affordances the technology enables are jointly realized.  In making the argument for the importance of shared affordances, this paper suggests that group-level network change has its most profound implications at the organization level when individuals use the same subset of a new information technology’s features.  To explore this tentative theory, we turn to a comparative, multimethod, longitudinal study of computer-based simulation technology use in automotive engineering.  The findings of this explanatory case study show that engineers used the new technology for more than three months, during which time neither group experienced changes to their advice networks.  Initially, divergent uses of the technology’s features by engineers in both groups precluded them from being able to coordinate their work in ways that allowed them to structure their advice networks differently.  Eventually, engineers in only one of the two groups converged on the use of a common set of the technology’s features to enact a shared affordance.  This convergence was necessary to turn the technology into a resource that could collectively afford group members the ability to compare their simulation outputs with one another and, in so doing, alter the content and structure of the group’s advice network.  The implications of these findings for the literatures on technology feature use, affordances, social networks, and post-adoption behaviors in organizations are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Integrating Service Quality with System and Information Quality:  An Empirical Test in the E-Service Context</dc:title>

<dc:creator>Cenfetelli, Ronald T.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Wixom and Todd (2005) integrated the user satisfaction and the technology acceptance literatures to theorize about and account for the influence of the information technology artifact on usage.  Based on Wixom and Todd’s integrated model of technology usage, we propose the 3Q model by investigating the role of service quality (SQ), in addition to system quality (SysQ) and information quality (IQ), in website adoption.  Attention to SQ is critical, as consumer websites have increasingly become the target of SQ assessment made by consumers, not just traditional SysQ and IQ evaluations.  As part of our study, we further theorize and empirically test the relationships among these three types of quality constructs and hypothesize that perceived SysQ influences perceived IQ and perceived SQ, and perceived IQ influences perceived SQ.  Our study extends the Wixom and Todd model in the e-service context and is the first of its kind to empirically examine the combined impact of perceived SQ, perceived SysQ, and perceived IQ on usage intention.  Our study advances the theoretical understanding of SQ and the relationships among perceptions of SysQ, IQ, and SQ in the e-service context.  The results also inform practitioners that high IQ and SysQ can directly or indirectly improve SQ in the e-service context.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Critical Realism in Information Systems Research</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mingers, John</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Mutch, Alistair</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Willcocks, Leslie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>There has been growing interest in a range of disciplines (Ackroyd and Fleetwood 2000; Danermark et al. 2002; Fleetwood 1999; Fleetwood and Ackroyd 2004), not least information systems (Dobson 2001; Longshore Smith 2006; Mingers 2004b; Mutch 2010b; Volkoff et al. 2007; Wynn and Williams 2012) in ideas derived from the philosophical tradition of critical realism.  Critical realism offers exciting prospects in shifting attention toward the real problems that we face and their underlying causes, and away from a focus on data and methods of analysis.  As such, it offers a robust framework for the use of a variety of methods in order to gain a better understanding of the meaning and significance of information systems in the contemporary world.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Technological Objects, Social Positions, and the Transformational Model of Social Activity</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Faulkner, Philip</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Runde, Jochen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The transformational model of social activity (TMSA), in many ways the centerpiece of critical realism, has been widely used in areas of information systems research.  However, little has been done so far to develop a systematic theory of the nature, position, and identity of technological objects within the context of the TMSA. Our aim in this paper is to fill this gap, paying particular attention to the important category of nonmaterial technological objects that lie at the heart of modern information systems.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Critical Realism and Affordances:  Theorizing IT-Associated Organizational Change Processes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Volkoff, Olga</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Strong, Diane</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Convincing arguments for using critical realism as an underpinning for theories of IT-associated organizational change have appeared in the Information Systems literature. A central task in developing such theories is to uncover the generative mechanisms by which IT is implicated in organizational change processes, but to do so, we must explain how critical realism’s concept of generative mechanisms applies in an IS context. Similarly, convincing arguments have been made for using Gibson’s (1986) affordance theory from ecological psychology for developing theories of IT-associated organizational change, but this effort has been hampered due to insufficient attention to the ontological status of affordances. In this paper, we argue that affordances are the generative mechanisms we need to specify and explain how affordances are a specific type of generative mechanism. We use the core principles of critical realism to argue how affordances arise in the real domain from the relation between the complex assemblages of organizations and of IT artifacts, how affordances are actualized over time by organizational actors, and how these actualizations lead to the various effects we observe in the empirical domain. After presenting these arguments, we reanalyze two published cases in the literature, those of ACRO and Autoworks, to illustrate how affordance-based theories informed by critical realism enhance our ability to explain IT-associated organizational change. These examples show how researchers using this approach should proceed, and how managers can use these ideas to diagnose and address IT implementation problems.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, critical realism and activity theory are compared within the context of theorizing technology-mediated organizational change.  An activity theoretic analysis of the implementation of large-scale disruptive information systems in a public sector setting (in particular concerning paramedic treatment of heart attack patients and ambulance dispatch work activity) is used to illustrate how activity theory makes a significant contribution to critical realism, by (1)　locating technology within &#34;activity systems&#34; and theorizing change through contradictions and congruencies within those systems; (2)　developing recent critical realism-inspired theorization of the &#34;inscription&#34; of cultural and social relations within technology; and (3)　developing recent insights of critical realist researchers regarding the way in which the performance management agenda is mediated through IS.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Methodological Implications of Critical Realism for Mixed-Methods Research</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zachariadis, Markos</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Scott, Susan</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Barrett, Michael</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Building on recent developments in mixed methods, we discuss the methodological implications of critical realism and explore how these can guide dynamic mixed-methods research design in information systems. Specifically, we examine the core ontological assumptions of CR in order to gain some perspective on key epistemological issues such as causation and validity, and illustrate how these shape our logic of inference in the research process through what is known as retroduction.  We demonstrate the value of a CR-led mixed-methods research approach by drawing on a study that examines the impact of ICT adoption in the financial services sector.  In doing so, we provide insight into the interplay between qualitative and quantitative methods and the particular value of applying mixed methods guided by CR methodological principles.  Our positioning of demi-regularities within the process of retroduction contributes a distinctive development in this regard.  We argue that such a research design enables us to better address issues of validity and the development of more robust meta-inferences.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Broader Context for ICT4D Projects:  A Morphogenetic Analysis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Njihia, James Muranga</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Merali, Yasmin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper demonstrates the value of Archer’s morphogenetic approach (MA) in understanding and explaining the complexity of the broader context within which many developing country information and communication technology (ICT) projects are implemented.  It does this by using MA’s analytical and explanatory apparatus to examine the evolution of the context of public sector ICT provision in Kenya over the period 1963–2006.  In addition to demonstrating the practical value of MA, the paper contributes to the Information Systems literature on ICT for development (ICT4D).  The analysis identifies (1)　global normative pressures, polity, the national socio-economic base, disruptive technology, and the emergence of multistakeholder networks as key forces in shaping the evolutionary trajectory, (2)　the explicit treatment of time and temporality as key for understanding mechanisms underpinning the evolutionary process, and (3)　the difficulty of cleanly isolating the implementation of individual public sector ICT projects from the broader context and ICT4D agendas.  The discussion elaborates on the features of MA found to be particularly valuable in this study.  The paper concludes that explicitly attending to time and temporality, and to the broader context for ICT4D projects, would contribute to the development of more nuanced accounts of such projects and a more emancipatory outlook for ICT4D research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Generative Mechanisms of Digital Infrastructure Evolution</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Henfridsson, Ola</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Bygstad, Bendik</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The current literature on digital infrastructure offers powerful lenses for conceptualizing the increasingly interconnected information system collectives found in contemporary organizations.  However, little attention has been paid to the generative mechanisms of digital infrastructure, that is, the causal powers that explain how and why such infrastructure evolves over time.  This is unfortunate, since more knowledge about what drives digital infrastructures would be highly valuable for managers and IT professionals confronted by the complexity of managing them.  To this end, this paper adopts a critical realist view for developing a configurational perspective of infrastructure evolution.  Our theorizing draws on a multimethod research design comprising an in-depth case study and a case survey.  The in-depth case study, conducted at a Scandinavian airline, distinguishes three key mechanisms of digital infrastructure evolution:  adoption, innovation, and scaling.  The case survey research of 41 cases of digital infrastructure then identifies and analyzes causal paths through which configurations of these mechanisms lead to successful evolution outcomes.  The study reported in this paper contributes to the infrastructure literature in two ways.  First, we identify three generative mechanisms of digital infrastructure and how they contingently lead to evolution outcomes.  Second, we use these mechanisms as a basis for developing a configurational perspective that advances current knowledge about why some digital infrastructures evolve successfully while others do not.  In addition, the paper demonstrates and discusses the efficacy of critical realism as a philosophical tradition for developing substantive contributions in the field of information systems.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Causal Explanation in the Coordinating Process:  A Critical Realist Case Study of Federated IT Governance Structures</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Williams, Clay K</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Karahanna, Elena</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Large, multi-unit organizations are continually challenged to balance demands for centralization of information technology that lead to cost and service efficiencies through standardization while providing flexibility at the local unit level in order to meet unique business, customer, and service needs.  This has led many organizations to adopt hybrid federated information technology governance (ITG) structures to find this balance.  This approach to ITG establishes demand for various means to coordinate effectively across the organization to achieve the desired benefits.  Past research has focused on the efficacy of various coordination mechanisms (e.g., steering committees, task forces) to coordinate activities related to information technology.  However, we lack insights as to how and why these various coordination approaches help organizations achieve desired coordinated outcomes.  This research specifically identifies coordinating as a process.  Adopting the philosophy of critical realism, we conducted a longitudinal, comparative case study of two coordinating efforts in a federated ITG structure.  Through a multifaceted approach to scientific logic employing deductive, inductive, and retroductive elements, we explicate two causal mechanisms, consensus making and unit aligning, which help to explain the coordinating process and the coordination outcomes observed in these efforts.  We additionally elaborate the operation of the mechanisms through the typology of macro–micro–macro influences. Further, we demonstrate the value of the causal mechanisms to understanding the coordinating process by highlighting the complementarity in insights relative to the theories of power and politics and of rational choice.  The study contributes to our understanding of coordinating as a process and of governance in federated IT organizations.  Importantly, our study illustrates the value of applying critical realism to develop causal explanations and generate insights about a phenomenon.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Explaining Broadband Adoption in Rural Australia:  Modes of Reflexivity and the Morphogenetic Approach</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Dobson, Philip</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Jackson, Paul</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Gengatharen, Denise E</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Universal fast broadband is currently being implemented by the Australian government.  It is the largest single project in Australia’s history.  Represented as a nation-building exercise by the government and many public and private promoters, it is vilified by others as a massive waste of taxpayers’ money.  Ultimately the target of successful universal availability will require that metropolitan installations subsidize rural adoption.  The take-up of these facilities, particularly in regional and remote areas, constitutes a complex, multi-factorial scenario in which political, personal, and organizational decisions are shaped by physical, cultural, economic, and ideological elements.  Critical realism is proposed here as an aid for examining the complex reality of rural adoption for communities and small businesses in the regions.  This article highlights the importance of considering individual reflexivity in explaining the adoption decision and potential adoption barriers.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Evaluating Journal Quality and the Association for Information Systems Senior Scholars&#39; Journal Basket Via Bibliometric Measures:  Do Expert Journal Assessments Add Value?</dc:title>

<dc:description>Information systems journal rankings and ratings help scholars focus their publishing efforts and are widely used surrogates for judging the quality of research.  Over the years, numerous approaches have been used to rank IS journals, approaches such as citation metrics, school lists, acceptance rates, and expert assessments. However, the results of these approaches often conflict due to a host of validity concerns.  In the current scientometric study, we make significant strides toward correcting for these limitations in the ranking of mainstream IS journals.  We compare expert rankings to bibliometric measures such as the ISI Impact Factor™, the h-index, and social network analysis metrics.  Among other findings, we conclude that bibliometric measures provide very similar results to expert-based methods in determining a tiered structure of IS journals, thereby suggesting that bibliometrics can be a complete, less expensive, and more efficient substitute for expert assessment.  We also find strong support for seven of the eight journals in the Association for Information Systems Senior Scholars’ &#34;basket&#34; of journals. A cluster analysis of our results indicates a two-tiered separation in the quality of the highest quality IS journals—with MIS Quarterly, Information Systems Research, and Journal of Management Information Systems belonging, in that order, to the highest A+ tier. Journal quality metrics fit nicely into the sociology of science literature and can be useful in models that attempt to explain how knowledge disseminates through scientific communities.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Longitudinal Study of Herd Behavior in the Adoption and Continued Use of Technology</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sun, Heshan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Herd literature suggests that people tend to discount their own beliefs and imitate others when making adoption decisions and that the resulting adoption decisions are fragile and can be easily reversed during the post-adoptive stage.  This helps explain why the adoption of a number of new technologies from Amazon’s Kindle, to Apple’s iPod, iPhone, and iPad, to various types of Web 2. 0 technologies appears to have adoption patterns similar to those of new fashion trends (i. e., an initial en masse acquisition followed by subsequent abandonment).  It is important to understand these phenomena because they are strongly related to the staying power of technology.  From a herd behavior perspective, this study proposes two new concepts, namely discounting one’s own information and imitating others, to describe herd behavior in technology adoption. A research model is developed to describe the conditions under which herd behavior in technology adoption occurs, how it impacts technology adoption decision making, and how it influences post-adoptive system use.  A longitudinal study is conducted to examine the research model.  Findings from this research suggest that the discounting of one’s own beliefs and the imitating of others when adopting a new technology are provoked primarily by the observation of prior adoptions and perceptions of uncertainty regarding the adoption of new technology.  Herd behavior has a significant influence on user technology adoption; however, it does not necessarily lead to the collapse of the user base, as predicted in the herd literature.  Instead, imitation can help reduce post-adoption regret and thus serve as a legitimate strategy for choosing a good enough technology, which may or may not be the best option to enhance job performance.  People tend to adjust their beliefs when herding and also to revive their discounted initial beliefs to modify their beliefs about the technology at the post-adoptive stage.  Findings from this study have significant research and practical implications.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Impact of Wikipedia on Market Information Environment:  Evidence on Management Disclosure and Investor Reaction</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Xu, Sean Xin</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Zhang, Michael (Xiaoquan)</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, we seek to determine whether a typical social media platform, Wikipedia, improves the information environment for investors in the financial market.  Our theoretical lens leads us to expect that information aggregation about public companies on Wikipedia may influence how management’s voluntary information disclosure reacts to market uncertainty with respect to investors’ information about these companies.  Our empirical analysis is based on a unique data set collected from financial records, management disclosure records, news article coverage, and a Wikipedia modification history of public companies.  On the supply side of information, we find that information aggregation on Wikipedia can moderate the timing of managers’ voluntary disclosure of companies’ earnings disappointments, or bad news.  On the demand side of information, we find that Wikipedia’s information aggregation moderates investors’ negative reaction to bad news. Taken together, these findings support the view that Wikipedia improves the information environment in the financial market and underscore the value of information aggregation through the use of information technology.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Talking about Technology:  The Emergence of a New Actor Category Through New Media</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Vaast, Emmanuelle</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Davidson, Elizabeth J.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Mattson, Thomas</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper examines how a new actor category may emerge in a field of discourse through the new media of the Internet.  Existing literatures on professional and organizational identity have shown the importance of identity claims and of the tensions surrounding &#34;optimal distinctiveness&#34; for new actors in a field, but have not examined the roles of new media in these processes.  The literature on information technology (IT) and identity has highlighted the identity-challenging and identity-enhancing aspects of new IT use for existing actor categories but has not examined the dynamics associated with the emergence of new actor categories.  Here, we investigate how a new actor category may emerge through the use of new media as a dynamic interaction of discursive practices, identity claims, and new media use.  Drawing on findings from a case study of technology bloggers, we identified discursive practices through which a group of technology bloggers enacted claims of a distinctive identity in the joint construction of their discourse and in response to continuous developments in new media.  Emergence of this new category was characterized by ongoing, opposing yet coexisting tendencies toward coalescence, fragmentation, and dispersion.  Socio-technical dynamics underlying bloggers’ use of new media and the actions of prominent (&#34;A-list&#34;) bloggers contributed to these tendencies.  We untangle theoretically the identity-enabling and identity-unsettling effects of new media and conceptualize the emergence of a new actor category through new media as an ongoing process in which the category identity may remain fluid, rather than progress to an endpoint.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Differential Influence of Blogs Across Different Stages of Decision Making:  The Case of Venture Capitalists</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Aggarwal, Rohit</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Singh, Harpreet</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, we study the differential influence of online user-generated content (UGC), specifically blogs, across the multiple stages of decision making of venture capitalists:  screening stage, choice stage, and contract stage.  We conjecture that, first, blogs are influential at the screening stage; second, after the screening stage, blogs are noninfluential since decision makers evaluate entities closely at later stages; third, blogs increase the interest from multiple decision makers which in turn increases the cost of the deal for a decision maker. This empirical investigation provides support for the hypotheses, which we tested for funding decisions by venture capitalists in information technology ventures.  In particular, this study indicates that blogs can help managers in getting their products/services selected at the screening stage, but, beyond that, blogs do not help directly.  However, since more decision makers screen products/services that receive blog coverage, the competition among decision makers helps managers in negotiating better contract terms.  We advance the boundary of existing studies on the influence of UGC from single stage process to multiple stages.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Enterprise system implementations often create tension in organizations.  On the one hand, these systems can provide significant operational and strategic benefits.  On the other hand, implementation of these systems is risky and a source of major disruptions.  In particular, employees experience significant changes in their work environment during an implementation.  Although the relationship between ES implementations and employees’ jobs has been noted in prior research, there is limited research on the nature, extent, determinants, and outcomes of changes in employees’ job characteristics following an ES implementation.  This paper develops and tests a model, termed the job characteristics change model (JCCM), that posits that employees will experience substantial changes in two job characteristics (i.e., job demands and job control) during the shakedown phase (i.e., immediately after the rollout) of an ES implementation.  These changes are theorized to be predicted by work process characteristics, namely perceived process complexity, perceived process rigidity, and perceived process radicalness, that in turn will be influenced by technology characteristics (i.e., perceived technology complexity, perceived technology reconfigurability, and perceived technology customization).  JCCM further posits that changes in job characteristics will influence employees’ job satisfaction.  Longitudinal field studies conducted in two organizations (N = 281 and 141 respectively) provided support for the model.  The scientific and practical implications of the findings are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Addressing the Personalization–Privacy Paradox:  An Empirical Assessment from a Field Experiment on Smartphone Users</dc:title>

<dc:description>Privacy has been an enduring concern associated with commercial information technology (IT) applications, in particular regarding the issue of personalization.  IT-enabled personalization, while potentially making the user computing experience more gratifying, often relies heavily on the user’s personal information to deliver individualized services, which raises the user’s privacy concerns.  We term the tension between personalization and privacy, which follows from marketers exploiting consumers’ data to offer personalized product information, the personalization–privacy paradox.  To better understand this paradox, we build on the theoretical lenses of uses and gratification theory and information boundary theory to conceptualize the extent to which privacy impacts the process and content gratifications derived from personalization, and how an IT solution can be designed to alleviate privacy concerns.
Set in the context of personalized advertising applications for smartphones, we propose and prototype an IT solution, referred to as a personalized, privacy-safe application, that retains users’ information locally on their smartphones while still providing them with personalized product messages.  We validated this solution through a field experiment by benchmarking it against two more conventional applications:  a base non-personalized application that broadcasts non-personalized product information to users, and a personalized, non-privacy safe application that transmits user information to a central marketer’s server.  The results show that (compared to the non-personalized application), while personalized, privacy-safe or not  increased application usage (reflecting process gratification), it was only when it was privacy-safe that users saved product messages (reflecting content gratification) more frequently.  Follow-up surveys corroborated these nuanced findings and further revealed the users’ psychological states, which  explained our field experiment results.  We found that saving advertisements for content gratification led to a perceived intrusion of information boundary that made users reluctant to do so.  Overall our proposed IT solution, which delivers a personalized service but avoids transmitting users’ personal information to third parties, reduces users’ perceptions that their information boundaries are being intruded upon, thus mitigating the personalization–privacy paradox and increasing both process and content gratification.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Investigation of Information Systems Use Patterns:  Technological Events as Triggers, the Effect of Time, and Consequences for Performance</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ortiz de Guinea, Ana</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Webster, Jane</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Information systems use represents one of the core concepts defining the discipline.  In this article, we develop a rich conceptualization of IS use patterns as individuals’ emotions, cognition, and behaviors while employing an information technology to accomplish a work-related task.  By combining two novel perspectives—the affect–object paradigm and automaticity—with coping theory, we theorize how different patterns appear and disappear as a result of different IT events—expected and discrepant—as well as over time, and how these patterns influence short-term performance.  In order to test our hypotheses, we conducted two studies, one qualitative and the other quantitative, that combined different methods (e.g., open-ended questions, physiological data, videos, protocol analysis) to study the influence of expected and discrepant events.  The synergistic properties of the two studies demonstrate the existence of two IS use patterns, automatic and adjusting.  Most interactions are automatic, and adjusting patterns, triggered by discrepant IT events, fade over time and transition into automatic ones.  Further, automatic patterns result in enhanced short-term performance, while adjusting ones do not.  Our conceptualization of IS use patterns is useful because it addresses important questions (such as why negative IT perceptions persist) and clarifies that it is how (rather than how much) people use IT that is pertinent for performance.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Insiders&#39; Protection of Organizational Information Assets:  Development of a Systematics-Based Taxonomy and Theory of Diversity for Protection-Motivated Behaviors</dc:title>

<dc:description>Protecting information from a variety of security threats is a daunting organizational activity.  Organization managers must recognize the roles that organization insiders have in protecting information resources rather than solely relying upon technology to provide this protection.  Unfortunately, compared to negative insider behaviors, the extant literature provides sparse coverage of beneficial insider activities.  The few beneficial activities in the literature represent only a small portion of the diverse collection of insiders’ protective actions.
This research focuses on protection-motivated behaviors (PMBs), which are volitional behaviors enacted by organization insiders to protect (1)　organizationally relevant information and (2)　the computer-based information systems in which the information is stored, collected, disseminated, and/or manipulated from information security threats.  Based on systematics, we propose a six-step methodology of qualitative and quantitative approaches to develop a taxonomy and theory of diversity for PMBs.  These approaches integrate the classification techniques of multidimensional scaling (MDS), property fitting (ProFit), and cluster analyses.  We leverage these techniques to identify and display how insiders collectively classify 67 unique PMBs and their homogeneous classes.  Our taxonomy provides researchers and practitioners a comprehensive guide and common nomenclature for PMBs.  Our methodology can be similarly used to create other theories of diversity.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Media Selection as a Strategic Component of Communication</dc:title>
<dc:creator>George, Joey F</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Carlson, John R.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Valacich, Joe</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Why do people select the media they choose for a particular type of communication?  The media choice literature has considered myriad contextual factors that influence media choice, from proximity of the communication partners, to the urgency of the situation, to time pressure, and so on.  From this body of work, a contingency-based theory of media choice has emerged.  An alternative approach is to investigate how communication strategies and media characteristics affect choice.  We identified two approaches for investigating these issues:  Te’eni’s (2001) model of organizational communication and Dennis et al.’s (2008) media synchronicity theory.  Using a scenario-based methodology, we asked respondents which medium they would use for a deceptive communication task and why they made that choice.  We analyzed the data from the perspective of both the Te’eni and MST frameworks, enabling us to compare the extent to which each was able to explain our respondents’ media choices.  Both frameworks, at differing levels of communication granularity, suggest that the intent of the communication drives a strategy that ultimately informs media choice.  The results suggest that the prior contingency-based explanations of media choice could be improved by not only understanding the intent of the communication, but also the strategy used by an individual to execute this communication.  Additionally, we found that the more finely grained view of communication contained in MST explained more of the outcomes and was more parsimonious as well.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Inferring App Demand from Publicly Available Data</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Garg, Rajiv</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Telang, Rahul</dc:creator>
<dc:description>With an abundance of products available online, many online retailers provide sales rankings to make it easier for consumers to find the best-selling products.  Successfully implementing product rankings online was done a decade ago by Amazon, and more recently by Apple’s App Store.  However, neither market provides actual download data, a very useful statistic for both practitioners and researchers.  In the past, researchers developed various strategies that allowed them to infer demand from rank data.  Almost all of that work is based on an experiment that shifts sales or collaboration with a vendor to get actual sales data.  In this research, we present an innovative method to use public data to infer the rank–demand relationship for the paid apps on Apple’s iTunes App Store.  We find that the top-ranked paid app for iPhone generates 150 times more downloads compared to the paid app ranked at 200.  Similarly, the top paid app on iPad generates 120 times more downloads compared to the paid app ranked at 200.  We conclude with a discussion on an extension of this framework to the Android platform, in-app purchases, and free apps.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Spurring Impactful Research on Information Systems for Environmental Sustainability</dc:title>

<dc:description>As the future of our ecosystem and society hangs in delicate balance, sustainability issues have come to the societal and governmental forefront.  Organizations, governments, and cross-national bodies are turning their attention to the question of how we can make the world a better place. Sustainability is a complex term that can encompass environmental, economic, and societal issues.  In essence, sustainability is conservation, deployment, and reuse of resources in responsible ways.  From an organizational perspective, sustainability has been widely operationalized as endeavoring to achieve societal goals within commercial goals in such a way as to optimize social, environmental, and economic dimensions simultaneously—rather than these goals being treated as trade-offs (Porter and Kramer 2006).
In terms of environmental sustainability, IS applications for good citizenship or to mitigate harmful value chain activities abound.  Such responsive information systems for environmental sustainability include a large technology consulting company launching a smart city online simulation to raise awareness of climate and energy issues and to drive engagement.  Another example is a logistics firm that has improved safety, lowered emissions, and cut maintenance expenses by gathering route data every day for every truck and analyzing these data streams (Watson, Boudreau, Li, and Levis 2010). This system complements its package-flow software, which  determines the most sustainable delivery routes by limiting left-hand turns for its drivers, resulting in a reduction of three million gallons of gas usage and 32,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions (Washburn et al. 2009).  Going beyond responsiveness, &#34;strategic&#34; IS for environmental sustainability allow companies to proactively transform value chain activities to benefit society both economically and environmentally.  Such applications may also confer upon companies the ability to create and leverage strategic differentiation capabilities based on socioeconomic and environmental issues.  For example, a large software firm uses its energy and carbon management software to enable a sustainability transformation internally, while also marketing the software externally, thereby giving it a competitive advantage in the marketplace.
Thus far, our narrative could be describing any new organizational opportunity or problem and an IS response—from environmental resource planning systems for integrating disparate islands of information in the 1990s to social media for enabling collaboration in the networked era.  So what is new here?  It is this:  The challenge of climate change poses enormous and widespread risk to people, societies, and the natural environment.  The threat is real.  The threat is colossal.  And the threat is ever increasing.  This is the challenge of great urgency.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Sensemaking and Sustainable Practicing:  Functional Affordances of Information Systems in Green Transformations</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Seidel, Stefan</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Recker, Jan</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>vom Brocke, Jan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper explores how a world-wide operating software solutions provider implemented environmentally sustainable business practices in response to emerging environmental concerns.  Through an interpretive case study, we develop a theoretical framework that identifies four important functional affordances originating in information systems, which are required in environmental sustainability transformations as they create an actionable context in which (1)　organizations can engage in a sensemaking process related to understanding emerging environmental requirements, and (2)　individuals can implement environmentally sustainable work practices.  Through our work, we provide several contributions, including a better understanding of IS-enabled organizational change and the types of functional affordances of information systems that are required in sustainability transformations.  We describe implications relating to (1)　how information systems can contribute to the creation of environmentally sustainable organizations, (2)　the design of information systems to create required functional affordances, (3)　the management of sustainability transformations, and (4)　the further development of the concept of functional affordances in IS research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Assessing the Effects of Benefits and Institutional Influences on the Continued Use of Environmentally Munificent Bypass Systems in Long-Haul Trucking</dc:title>

<dc:description>Commercial truck driving is an essential part of the national supply chain but one that adversely affects the environment.  The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of the potential environmental benefits, among other factors, on continued use of bypass systems that can be discontinued at any time by a driver.  The results from our study show that (1)　economic benefits and industry pressures positively influence drivers’ use of bypass systems but (2)　the environmental benefits of the technology do not, even though system vendors and state transportation agencies emphasize these benefits of the technology.  Based on these findings, we conclude that sustainable information systems can be a viable option in a business context if usage leads to economic benefits.  Our results and conclusions support the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s differentiation of public policy versus business perspectives on sustainable technology.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Motivating Energy-Efficient Behavior with Green IS:  An Investigation of Goal Setting and the Role of Defaults</dc:title>

<dc:description>This study investigates the role of information systems in stimulating energy-efficient behavior in private households.  We present the example of Velix, a web portal designed to motivate customers of a utility company to reduce their electricity consumption.  In particular, we consider the effectiveness of goal setting functionality and defaults in influencing energy conservation behavior.  For this purpose, we use the web portal as a test of the theoretical propositions underlying its design.  Based on data collected from a field experiment with 1,791 electricity consumers, we test hypotheses regarding the structural relations between defaults and goals, the impact of defaults and goals on consumption behavior, and the moderating role of feedback on goal choice. Our results confirm the positive impact of goal setting on energy conservation.  We show that default goals lead to statistically significant savings by affecting goal choice.  However, if the default goals are set too low or too high with respect to a self-set goal, the defaults will detrimentally affect behavior.  We also show that feedback on goal attainment moderates the effect of default goals on goal choice.  The results extend the knowledge on goal setting and defaults and have implications for the design of effective energy feedback systems.  The study’s approach, which combines hypothesis-driven work and design-oriented IS research, could serve as a blueprint for further research endeavors of this kind, particularly with regard to feedback systems based on future smart metering infrastructures.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Reliability Generalization of Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Usefulness, and Behavioral Intentions</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hess, Traci</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>McNab, Anna L.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Basoglu, Asli</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A reliability generalization study (a meta-analysis of reliability coefficients) was conducted on three widely studied information systems constructs from the technology acceptance model (TAM):  perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and behavioral intentions.  This form of meta-analysis summarizes the reliability coefficients of the scores on a specified scale across studies and identifies the study characteristics that influence the reliability of these scores.  Reliability is a critical issue in conducting empirical research as the reliability of the scores on well-established scales can vary with study characteristics, attenuating effect sizes.  In conducting this study, an extensive literature search was conducted, with 380 articles reviewed and coded to perform reliability generalization.  Study characteristics, including technology, sample, and measurement characteristics, for these articles were recorded along with effect size data for the relationships among these variables.  After controlling for number of items, sample size, and sampling error, differences in reliability coefficients were found with several study characteristics for the three technology acceptance constructs.  The reliability coefficients of PEOU and PU were lower in hedonic contexts than in utilitarian contexts, and were higher when the originally validated scales were used as compared to when other items were substituted. 　Only 27 percent of the studies that provided the measurement items used the original PEOU items, while 39 percent used the original PU items.  Scales that were administered in English had higher reliability coefficients for PU and BI, with a marginal effect for PEOU.  Reliability differences were also found for other study characteristics, including reliability type, subject experience, and gender composition.  While average reliability coefficients were high, the results show that, on average, relationships among these constructs are attenuated by 12 percent with maximum attenuation in the range of 35 to 43 percent.  Implications for technology acceptance research are discussed and suggestions for addressing variation in reliability coefficients across studies are provided.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Collaboration Through Open Superposition:  A Theory of the Open Source Way</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Howison, James</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Crowston, Kevin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper develops and illustrates the theory of collaboration through open superposition:  the process of depositing motivationally independent layers of work on top of each other over time.  The theory is developed in a study of community-based free and open source software (FLOSS) development, through a research arc of discovery (participant observation), replication (two archival case studies), and theorization.  The theory explains two key findings:  (1)　the overwhelming majority of work is accomplished with only a single programmer working on any one task, and (2)　tasks that appear too large for any one individual are more likely to be deferred until they are easier rather than being undertaken through structured team work.  Moreover, the theory explains how working through open superposition can lead to the discovery of a work breakdown that results in complex, functionally interdependent, work being accomplished without crippling search costs.  We identify a set of socio-technical contingencies under which collaboration through open superposition is likely to be effective, including characteristics of artifacts made from information as the objects being worked on.  We demonstrate the usefulness of the theory by using it to analyze difficulties in learning from FLOSS in other domains of work and in the IS function of for-profit organizations.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Enterprise System Implementation and Employee and Job Performance:  Understanding the Role of Advice Networks</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sykes, Tracy Ann</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Venkatesh, Viswanath</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Johnson, Jonathan L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The implementation of enterprise systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, alters business processes and associated workflows, and introduces new software applications that employees must use.  Employees frequently find such technology-enabled organizational change to be a major challenge.  Although many challenges related to such changes have been discussed in prior work, little research has focused on post-implementation job outcomes of employees affected by such change.  We draw from social network theory— specifically, advice networks—to understand a key post-implementation job outcome (i.e., job performance).  We conducted a study among 87 employees, with data gathered before and after the implementation of an ERP system module in a business unit of a large organization.  We found support for our hypotheses that workflow advice and software advice are associated with job performance.  Further, as predicted, we found that the interactions of workflow and software get-advice, workflow and software give-advice, and software get- and give-advice were associated with job performance.  This nuanced treatment of advice networks advances our understanding of post-implementation success of enterprise systems.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Explaining Data-Driven Document Classifications</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Martens, David</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Provost, Foster</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Many document classification applications require human understanding of the reasons for data-driven classification decisions by managers, client-facing employees, and the technical team. Predictive models treat documents as data to be classified, and document data are characterized by very high dimensionality, often with tens of thousands to millions of variables (words). Unfortunately, due to the high dimensionality, understanding the decisions made by document classifiers is very difficult. This paper begins by extending the most relevant prior theoretical model of explanations for intelligent systems to account for some missing elements. The main theoretical contribution is the definition of a new sort of explanation as a minimal set of words (terms, generally), such that removing all words within this set from the document changes the predicted class from the class of interest. We present an algorithm to find such explanations, as well as a framework to assess such an algorithm’s performance. We demonstrate the value of the new approach with a case study from a real-world document classification task: classifying web pages as containing objectionable content, with the goal of allowing advertisers to choose not to have their ads appear on those pages. A second empirical demonstration on news-story topic classification shows the explanations to be concise and document-specific, and to be capable of providing understanding of the exact reasons for the classification decisions, of the workings of the classification models, and of the business application itself. We also illustrate how explaining the classifications of documents can help to improve data quality and model performance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Motivated by the growing importance of social media, this paper examines the relationship between new media, old media, and sales in the context of the music industry. In particular, we study the interplay between blog buzz, radio play, and music sales at both the album and song levels of analysis. We employ the panel vector autoregression (PVAR) methodology, an extension of vector autoregression to panel data. We find that radio play is consistently and positively related to future sales at both the song and album levels. Blog buzz, however, is not related to album sales and negatively related to song sales, suggesting that sales displacement due to free online sampling dominates any positive word-of-mouth effects of song buzz on sales. Further, the negative relationship between song buzz and sales is stronger for niche music relative to mainstream music, and for less popular songs within albums. We discuss the implications of these results for both research and practice regarding the role of new media in the music industry.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The rise of social broadcasting technologies has greatly facilitated open access to information worldwide, not only by powering decentralized information production and consumption, but also by expediting information diffusion through social interactions like content sharing.  Voluntary information sharing by users in the context of Twitter, the predominant social broadcasting site, is studied by modeling both the technology and user behavior.  A detailed data set about the official content-sharing function on Twitter, called retweet, is collected and the statistical relationships between users’ social network characteristics and their retweeting acts are documented.  A two-stage consumption-sharing model is then estimated using the conditional maximum likelihood estimatio (MLE) method.  The empirical results convincingly support our hypothesis that weak ties (in the form of unidirectional links) are more likely to engage in the social exchange process of content sharing.  Specifically, we find that after a median quality tweet (as defined in the sample) is consumed, the likelihood that a unidirectional follower will retweet is 3.1 percentage point higher than the likelihood that a bidirectional follower will do so.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Contribution Behavior in Virtual Communities:  Cognitive, Emotional, and Social Influences</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Tsai, Hsien-Tung</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Bagozzi, Richard P.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The long-term viability of virtual communities depends critically on contribution behavior by their members.  We deepen and extend prior research by conceptualizing contributions to virtual communities in terms of small friendship group–referent intentional actions.  Specifically, we investigate cognitive, emotional, and social determinants of shared we-intentions and their consequences for member contribution behavior to the small friendship group to which they belong within a larger community.  Using multiple measurement sources and a longitudinal quasi-experimental design, we show that group norms and social identity, as well as attitudes and anticipated emotions, contribute to the development of behavioral desires, which in turn influence we-intentions.  In addition, subjective norms are less effective than either group norms or social identity in encouraging contribution behavior.  Finally, members’ experience levels positively moderate the relationship between we-intentions and contribution behaviors, and differences between collectivistic versus individualistic orientations moderate the effects of social identity and anticipated emotions on the desire to contribute to one’s friendship group in the virtual community.  Tests for methods biases were conducted, as well as rival hypotheses.  These findings have significant research and managerial implications.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Theorization and Translation in Information Technology Institutionialization:  Evidence from Danish Home Care</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Nielsen, Jeppe Agger</dc:creator>

<dc:creator>Newell, Sue</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Although institutional theory has become a more dominant perspective in information systems research, studies have only paid scant attention to how field dynamics and organizational processes coevolve during information technology institutionalization.  Against this backdrop, we present a new conceptualization based on the &#34;traveling of ideas&#34; metaphor that distinguishes between theorization of ideas about IT usage across an organizational field and translation of such ideas into practical use of IT within particular organizations.  Drawing on these distinct analytical views, we posit that IT institutionalization is constituted through recursive intertwining of theorization and translation involving both linguistic and material objects.  To illustrate the detailed workings of this conceptualization, we apply it to a longitudinal study of mobile IT institutionalization within Danish home care.  We demonstrate how heterogeneous actors within the Danish home care field theorized ideas about mobile IT usage and how these ideas translated into different local arrangements. Further, our account reveals a complex institutionalization process in which mobile IT was first seen as a fashionable recipe for improvement but subsequently became the subject of controversy.  The paper adds to the emerging process and discourse literature on IT institutionalization by shedding new light on how IT ideas travel across a field and within individual organizations, how they transform and become legitimized over time, and how they take on different linguistic and material forms across organizational settings.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Leveraging Philanthropic Behavior for Customer Support:  The Case of User Support Forums</dc:title>

<dc:description>Online user forums for technical support are being widely adopted by IT firms to supplement traditional customer support channels.  Customers benefit from having an additional means of product support, while firms benefit by lowering the costs of supporting a large customer base.  Typically these forums are populated with content generated by users, consisting of questioners (solution seekers) and solvers (solution providers).  While questioners can be expected to keep returning as long as they can find answers, firms must employ different means in order to recognize and encourage the contributions of solvers.  We identify and compare the impact of two widely adopted recognition mechanisms on the philanthropic behavior of solvers.  In the first mechanism, feedback-based recognition, solver contribution is evaluated by questioners.  In the second mechanism, quantity-based recognition, all contributions are weighted equally regardless of questioner feedback.  We draw on the pro-social behavior literature to identify four drivers of solver contribution:  (1)　peer recognition, (2)　image motivation, (3)　social comparison, and (4)　social exposure.  We show that the choice of recognition mechanism strongly influences a solver’s problem-solving behavior, highlighting the importance of the firm’s decision in this regard.  We address issues of solvers self-selecting a type of recognition mechanism by using propensity score analysis in order to show that solver behavior is a result of forum conditioning.  We also study the impact of the recognition mechanism on forum quality and the effectiveness of support to draw comparative analytics.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Swift Guanxi in Online Marketplaces:  The Role of Computer-Mediated Communication Technologies</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ou, Carol X.J.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Pavlou, Paul A.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Davison, Robert M</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The concept of guanxi (i.e., a close and pervasive interpersonal relationship) has received little attention in the literature on online marketplaces, perhaps due to their impersonal nature.  However, we propose that computer-mediated communication (CMC) technologies can mimic traditional interactive face-to-face communications, thus enabling a form of guanxi in online marketplaces.  Extending the literature on traditional guanxi, we herein introduce the concept of swift guanxi, conceptualized as the buyer’s perception of a swiftly formed interpersonal relationship with a seller, which consists of mutual understanding, reciprocal favors, and relationship harmony.
Integrating theories of CMC and guanxi, we develop a model that explains how a set of CMC tools (i.e., instant messaging, message box, feedback system) facilitate repeat transactions with sellers by building swift guanxi and trust through interactivity and presence (social presence and telepresence) with sellers.  Longitudinal data from 338 buyers in TaoBao, China’s leading online marketplace, support our structural model, showing that the buyers’ effective use of CMC tools enable swift guanxi and trust by enhancing the buyers’ perceptions of interactivity and presence.  In turn, swift guanxi and trust predict buyers’ repurchase intentions and their actual repurchases from sellers.  We discuss the implications of swift guanxi in online marketplaces with the aid of CMC technologies.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Complementary Online Services in Competitive Markets:  Maintaining Profitability in the Presence of Network Effects</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Etzion, Hila</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Pang, Min-Seok</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A growing number of firms are strategically utilizing information technology and the Internet to provide online services to consumers who buy their products.  Online services differ from traditional services because they often promote interactivity among users and exhibit positive network effects.  While the service increases the value obtained by consumers, network effects are known to intensify price competition and thus may reduce firms’ profits.  In this paper, we model the competition between two firms that sell a differentiated product when each firm can offer a complementary online service to its customers.  We derive the market equilibrium and determine how firms should adjust their strategies to account for network effects.  We find that when the service exhibits network effects, a firm’s decision whether or not to offer the service depends on both the competitor’s decision and the competitor’s service quality.  When the service does not exhibit network effects, this is not the case.  In addition, we show that a firm can benefit from the technological ability to offer the service, and from an increase in the strength of network effects or in the market size of the service, only when the value customers derive from the direct functionalities (those that do not rely on the network) of the service are sufficiently high. As a result, a firm’s investment in the direct functionalities of its service increases with the strength of network effects of the service as long as the marginal development cost is not too high.  Finally, we show that inefficiencies in terms of the number of firms offering the service as well as the total number of service users may prevail.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Software design is a knowledge intensive task that constitutes a critical part of the software development process.  Using a controlled experiment involving software practitioners, this research examines two potentially useful mechanisms for improving the software design process.  Specifically, this study examines the impact of structural distribution of cognition through design patterns and social distribution of cognition through collaborating pairs on design outcomes.  The results indicate that the use of design patterns as external cognitive artifacts improves design quality, reduces time taken to solve a design problem, and leads to higher participant satisfaction.  Collaborating pairs of software designers were compared to participants working alone but whose efforts were conjointly considered as the best and second-best members of nominal pairs.  It was found that paired designers produced higher quality designs compared with the second-best members of nominal pairs, did not differ from the best member of a nominal pair, but took more time to complete a design task than either member of a nominal pair.  The results also indicate that the availability of design patterns raises the performance level of the second-best member of a nominal pair, in terms of quality, and reduces task completion time when compared with a pair not using design patterns.  Finally, paired designers were found to experience higher levels of task satisfaction when compared with individuals.  Implications for research and practice are discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In recent years, we have witnessed the rapid proliferation and widespread adoption of a new class of information technologies, commonly known as social media.  Researchers often rely on social network analysis (SNA) when attempting to understand these technologies, often without considering how the novel capabilities of social media platforms might affect the underlying theories of SNA, which were developed primarily through studies of offline social networks.  This article outlines several key differences between traditional offline social networks and online social media networks by juxtaposing an established typology of social network research with a well-regarded definition of social media platforms that articulates four key features.  The results show that at four major points of intersection, social media has considerable theoretical implications for SNA.  In exploring these points of intersection, this study outlines a series of theoretically distinct research questions for SNA in social media contexts.  These points of intersection offer considerable opportunities for researchers to investigate the theoretical implications introduced by social media and lay the groundwork for a robust social media agenda potentially spanning multiple disciplines.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Information Technology Capability and Firm Performance:  Contradictory Findings and Their Possible Causes</dc:title>

<dc:description>Several studies support the positive link between information technology capability and firm performance, including Bharadwaj (2000) and Santhanam and Hartono (2003), which appeared in MIS Quarterly.  We conducted a study to see if this link is still statistically significant.  It is now over a decade since the first study was published, during which several significant developments in the IT industry have taken place.  Unlike the 1990s, when proprietary information systems prevailed, the 2000s are characterized by more standardized and homogeneous information systems and with the rapid adoption of ERP and web technologies.  Thus, we attempted to reexamine the link between IT capability and firm performance with data from the 2000s.  Surprisingly, the results of our current analysis showed no significant link between IT capability and firm performance.  Contrary to earlier studies, IT leader firms in our study didn’t show better financial performance than control firms.  We discuss several possible causes for the change in findings and present an in-depth comparison in business performance between the two groups—IT leader and control—over a period extending from 1991 to 2007.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Digital Innovation as a Fundamental and Powerful Concept in the Information Systems Curriculum</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Fichman, Robert G</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Dos Santos, Brian L.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Zheng, Zhiqiang (Eric)</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The 50-year march of Moore’s Law has led to the creation of a relatively cheap and increasingly easy-to-use world-wide digital infrastructure of computers, mobile devices, broadband network connections, and advanced application platforms.  This digital infrastructure has, in turn, accelerated the emergence of new technologies that enable transformations in how we live and work, how companies organize, and the structure of entire industries.
As a result, it has become important for all business students to have a strong grounding in IT and digital innovation in order to manage, lead, and transform organizations that are increasingly dependent on digital innovation.  Yet, at many schools, students do not get such grounding because the required information systems core class is stuck in the past.  We present a vision for a redesigned IS core class that adopts digital innovation as a fundamental and powerful concept (FPC).  A good FPC serves as both a foundational concept and an organizing principle for a course.
We espouse a particularly broad conceptualization of digital innovation that allows for a variety of teaching styles and topical emphases for the IS core class.  This conceptualization includes three types of innovation (i.e., process, product, and business model innovation), and four stages for the overall innovation process (i.e., discovery, development, diffusion, and impact).  Based on this conceptualization, we examine the implications of adopting digital innovation as an FPC.  We also briefly discuss broader implications relating to (1)　the IS curriculum beyond the core class, (2)　the research agenda for the IS field, and (3)　the identity and legitimacy of IS in business schools.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Nature and Consequences of Trade-Off Transparency in the Context of Recommendation Agents</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Xu, David</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Benbasat, Izak</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Cenfetelli, Ronald T.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>That recommendation agents (RAs) can substantially improve consumers’ decision making is well understood. Far less understood is the influence of specific design attributes of the RA interface on decision making and other outcome measures.  We investigate a novel design for an RA interface that enables it to interactively demonstrate trade-offs among product attribute values (i.e., trade-off transparency feature) to improve consumers’ perceived product diagnosticity and perceived enjoyment.  We also examine the extent to which the trade-offs among product attribute values should be revealed to the user.  Further, based on the stimulus– organism–response model, we develop a theoretical model that extends the effort–accuracy framework by proposing perceived enjoyment and perceived product diagnosticity as two antecedents for perceived decision quality and perceived decision effort, respectively.  In an experimental study, we find that (1)　the trade-off transparency feature significantly affects perceived enjoyment and perceived product diagnosticity, (2)　perceived enjoyment and perceived product diagnosticity follow an inverted U-shaped curve as the level of trade-off transparency increases, (3)　although users spend more time understanding attribute trade-offs with the trade-off transparency feature, they are more efficient in selecting a product, (4)　perceived enjoyment simultaneously leads to better perceived decision quality and lower perceived decision effort, and (5)　perceived product diagnosticity leads to better perceived decision quality without compromising perceptions of decision effort.  Theoretically, this study increases our understanding of how the design of an RA interface can improve consumers’ product diagnosticity and enjoyment, and proposes two antecedents to improve perceived decision quality and reduce perceived decision effort.  For design practitioners, our results indicate the importance of providing the trade-off transparency design feature to potential consumers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The effects of e-commerce institutional mechanisms on trust and online purchase have traditionally been understood in the initial online purchase context.  This study extends this literature by exploring the role of e-commerce institutional mechanisms in the online repurchase context.  In doing so, it responds to the emerging call for understanding the institutional context under which customer trust operates in an e-commerce environment.  Specifically, this study introduces a key moderator, perceived effectiveness of e-commerce institutional mechanisms (PEEIM), to the relationships between trust, satisfaction, and repurchase intention.  Drawing on the theory of organizational trust, and based on a survey of 362 returning online customers, we find that PEEIM negatively moderates the relationship between trust in an online vendor and online customer repurchase intention, as it decreases the importance of trust to promoting repurchase behavior.  We also find that PEEIM positively moderates the relationship between customer satisfaction and trust as it enhances the customer’s reliance on past transaction experience with the vendor to reevaluate trust in the vendor.  Consistent with the predictions made in the literature, PEEIM does not directly affect trust or repurchase intention.  Academic and practical implications and future research directions are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Economic Analysis of Online Advertising Using Behavioral Targeting</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chen, Jianqing</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Stallaert, Jan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Online publishers and advertisers have recently shown increasing interest in using targeted advertising online. Such targeting allows them to present users with advertisements that are a better match, based on their past browsing and search behavior and other available information (e.g., hobbies registered on a web site).  This technique, known as behavioral targeting, has been hailed as the new &#34;Holy Grail&#34; in online advertising because of its potential effectiveness.  In this paper, we study the economic implications when an online publisher engages in behavioral targeting.  The publisher auctions off an advertising slot and is paid on a cost-per-click basis.  Using a horizontal differentiation model to capture the fit between a user and an advertisement being displayed, we identify the factors that affect the publisher’s revenue, the advertisers’ payoffs, and social welfare.  We show that revenue for the online publisher in some circumstances can double when behavioral targeting is used.  However, increased revenue for the publisher is not guaranteed:  in some cases, the prices of advertising and hence the publisher’s revenue can be lower, depending on the degree of competition and the advertisers’ valuations.  We identify two effects associated with behavioral targeting:  a competitive effect and a propensity effect.  The relative strength of the two effects determines whether the publisher’s revenue is positively or negatively affected.  We also demonstrate that, although social welfare is increased and small advertisers are better off under behavioral targeting, the dominant advertiser might be worse off and reluctant to switch from traditional advertising.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Proactive Versus Reactive Security Investments in the Healthcare Sector</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kwon, Juhee</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Johnson, M. Eric</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study identifies the effects of security investments that arise from previous failures or external regulatory pressure.  Building on organizational learning theory, the study focuses on the healthcare sector where legislation mandates breach disclosure and detailed data on security investments are available.  Using a Cox proportional hazard model, we demonstrate that proactive security investments are associated with lower security failure rates.  Coupling that result with the economics of breach disclosure, we also show that proactive investments are more cost effective in healthcare security than reactive investments.  Our results further indicate that this effect is amplified at the state level, supporting the argument that security investments create positive externalities.  We also find that external pressure decreases the effect of proactive investments on security performance.  This implies that proactive investments, voluntarily made, have more impact than those involuntarily made.  Our findings suggest that security managers and policy makers should pay attention to the strategic and regulatory factors influencing security investment decisions.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Business of Being a User:  The Role of the Reference Actor in Shaping Packaged Enterprise System Acquisition and Development</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pollock, Neil</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Hyysalo, Sampsa</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The paper extends the concept of &#34;user&#34; to account for a new, more formalized role that some client organizations play in the diffusion of packaged enterprise systems.  Package vendors are attempting to draw parts of their user base into activities related to the promotion, selling, and commodification of systems.  Users, in turn, appear willing to help construct these systems as objects of consumption for others.  This can appear to be rather idiosyncratic behavior.  Information Systems scholars have argued that relations between packaged enterprise system vendors and users are attenuated.  Why might the user help the vendor market its systems in this way?  What benefits accrue from it?  And what role are users performing in carrying out this work?  To show how this is becoming a general facet of the work of some packaged enterprise system users, we develop the notion of &#34;reference actor,&#34; which is an extension of the earlier Information Systems concept of &#34;social actor.&#34;  In combining insights from the social shaping of technology and the biography of artifacts, and drawing on long-term qualitative fieldwork, we analyze this new actor role in relation to expectations and commitments coming from the wider packaged enterprise system community.  In return for the help provided to prospective adopters, reference actors are also able to gather various kinds of benefits for themselves and others.  In particular, they build closer relations with vendors such that they can influence product development strategies.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effects of Web Personalization on User Attitude and Behavior:  An Integration of the Elaboration Likelihood Model and Consumer Research Theory</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ho, Shuk Ying</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Bodoff, David</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Web personalization can achieve two business goals:  increased advertising revenue and increased sales revenue.  The realization of the two goals is related to two kinds of user behavior:  item sampling and item selection.  Prior research does not provide a model of attitude formation toward a personalization agent nor of how attitudes relate to these two behaviors.  This limits our understanding of how web personalization can be managed to increase advertising revenues and/or sales revenues.  To fill this gap, the current research develops and tests a theoretical model of user attitudes and behaviors toward a personalization agent.  The model is based on an integration of two theories:  the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) and consumer search theory (CST).  In the integrated model, a user’s attitude toward a personalization agent is influenced by both the number of items he/she has sampled so far (from CST) and the degree to which he/she cognitively processes each one (from ELM).  In turn, attitude is modeled to influence both behaviors—that is, item selection and any further item sampling.  We conducted a lab study and a field study to test six hypotheses.  This research extends the theory on web personalization by providing a more complete picture of how sampling and processing of personalized recommendations influence a user’s attitude and behavior toward the personalization agent.  For online merchants, this research highlights the trade-off between item sampling and item selection and provides practical guidance on how to steer users toward the attitudes and behaviors that will realize their business goals</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Nature and Nurture:  The Impact of Automaticity and the Structuration of Communication on Virtual Team Behavior and Performance</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bartelt, Valerie L.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Dennis, Alan R.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Much prior research on virtual teams has examined the impact of the features and capabilities of different communication tools (the nature of communication) on team performance.  In this paper, we examine how the social structures (i.e., genre rules) that emerge around different communication tools (the nurture of communication) can be as important in influencing performance.  During habitual use situations, team members enact genre rules associated with communication tools without conscious thought via automaticity.  These genre rules influence how teams interact and ultimately how well they perform.  We conducted an experimental study to examine the impact of different genre rules that have developed for two communication tools:  instant messenger and discussion forum.  Our results show that in habitual use situations, these tools triggered different genre rules with different behaviors, which in turn resulted in significantly different decision quality.  We used heightened time pressure as a discrepant event to interrupt the automatic enactment of habitual genre rules and found that users adopted similar behaviors for both tools, which resulted in no significant differences in decision quality.  These findings suggest that the automatic enactment of genre rules for a communication tool may have as powerful an effect on behavior and performance as the actual features of the tool itself.  We believe that our results, taken together with past research showing the effects of social structures on communication, call for the expansion of task–technology fit theories to include the role of social structures in explaining the use of and performance from communication tools.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Anxious or Angry?  Effects of Discrete Emotions on the Perceived Helpfulness of Online Reviews</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Yin, Dezhi</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Bond, Samuel D.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Zhang, Han</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper explores the effects of emotions embedded in a seller review on its perceived helpfulness to readers.  Drawing on frameworks in literature on emotion and cognitive processing, we propose that over and above a well-known negativity bias, the impact of discrete emotions in a review will vary, and that one source of this variance is reader perceptions of reviewers’ cognitive effort.  We focus on the roles of two distinct, negative emotions common to seller reviews:  anxiety and anger.  In the first two studies, experimental methods were utilized to identify and explain the differential impact of anxiety and anger in terms of perceived reviewer effort.  In the third study, seller reviews from Yahoo! Shopping web sites were collected to examine the relationship between emotional review content and helpfulness ratings.  Our findings demonstrate the importance of examining discrete emotions in online word-of-mouth, and they carry important practical implications for consumers and online retailers.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Reframing Success and Failure of Information Systems:  A Performative Perspective</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cecez-Kecmanovic, Dubravka</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Kautz, Karlheinz (Karl)</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Abrahall, Rebecca</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The paper questions common assumptions in the dominant representational framings of information systems success and failure and proposes a performative perspective that conceives IS success and failure as relational effects performed by sociomaterial practices of IS project actor-networks of developers, managers, technologies, project documents, methodologies, and other actors.  Drawing from a controversial case of a highly innovative information system in an insurance company—considered a success and failure at the same time— the paper reveals the inherent indeterminacy of IS success and failure and describes the mechanisms by which success and failure become performed and thus determined by sociomaterial practices.  This is explained by exposing ontological politics in the reconfiguration and decomposition of the IS project actor-network and the emergence of different agencies of assessment that performed both different IS realities and competing IS assessments.  The analysis shows that the IS project and the implemented system as objects of assessment are not given and fixed, but are performed by the agencies of assessment together with the assessment outcomes of success and failure.  The paper demonstrates that by reframing IS success and failure, the performative perspective provides some novel and surprising insights that have a potential to change conversations on IS assessments in both the IS literature and IS practice.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Quality Competition and Market Segmentation in the Security Software Market</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Dey, Debabrata</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Lahiri, Atanu</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Zhang, Guoying</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In recent years, we have witnessed an unprecedented growth in the security software market.  This market is now fiercely competitive with hundreds of nearly identical products; yet, the price is high and coverage low.  Although recent research has examined such idiosyncrasies and found the existence of a negative network effect as a possible explanation, several important questions still remain:  (1) What possibly discourages product differentiation in such a competitive market?  (2) 　Why is versioning absent here?  (3)　How does the presence of free alternatives in this market impact its structure?  We develop a comprehensive oligopoly model, with endogenous quality and versioning decisions, to address these issues.  Our analyses reveal that, although the presence of numerous competitors leads to a greater need to differentiate, the network effect in this market works as a counterweight, incentivizing vendors to sacrifice differentiation in favor of collocating in the top end of the quality spectrum.  We explain the reasons and implications of this important finding.  We further show that this result is robust and applicable even when versioning by competing vendors or the presence of free software is taken into consideration.  Furthermore, given that the presence of free software actually intensifies competitive pressure and heightens the need to differentiate, the role of the network effect in abating differentiation becomes even more discernible.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Coordinating Expertise Across Knowledge Boundaries in Offshore-Outsourcing Projects:  The Role of Codification</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kotlarsky, Julia</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Scarbrough, Harry</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Oshri, Ilan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The coordination of effort within and among different expert groups is a central feature of contemporary organizations.  Within the existing literature, however, a dichotomy has emerged in our understanding of the role played by codification in coordinating expert groups.  One strand of literature emphasizes codification as a process that supports coordination by enabling the storage and ready transfer of knowledge.  In contrast, another strand highlights the persistent differences between expert groups that create boundaries to the transfer of knowledge, seeing coordination as dependent on the quality of the reciprocal interactions between groups and individuals.  Our research helps to resolve such contested understandings of the coordinative role played by codification.  By focusing on the offshore-outsourcing of knowledge-intensive services, we examine the role played by codification when expertise was coordinated between client staff and onsite and offshore vendor personnel in a large-scale outsourcing contract between TATA Consultancy Services (TCS) and ABN AMRO bank.  A number of theoretical contributions flow from our analysis of the case study, helping to move our understanding beyond the dichotomized views of codification outlined above.  First, our study adds to previous work where codification has been seen as a static concept by demonstrating the multiple, coexisting, and complementary roles that codification may play.  We examine the dynamic nature of codification and show changes in the relative importance of these different roles in coordinating distributed expertise over time. Second, we reconceptualize the commonly accepted view of codification as focusing on the replication and diffusion of knowledge by developing the notion of the codification of the &#34;knower&#34; as complementary to the codification of knowledge.  Unlike previous studies of expertise directories, codification of the knower does not involve representing expertise in terms of occupational skills or competences but enables the reciprocal interrelating of expertise required by more unstructured tasks.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Differential Effects of Prior Experience on the Malware Resolution Process</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kim, Seung Hyun</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Kim, Byung Cho</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Despite growing interest in the economic and policy aspects of information security, little academic research has used field data to examine the development process of a security countermeasure provider. In this paper, we empirically examine the learning process a security software developer undergoes in resolving a malware problem. Using the data collected from a leading antivirus software company in Asia, we study the differential effects of experience on the malware resolution process. Our findings reveal that general knowledge from cross-family experience has greater impact than specific knowledge from within-family experience on performance in the malware resolution process. We also examine the factors that drive the differential effects of prior experience. Interestingly, our data show that cross-family experience is more effective than within-family experience in malware resolution when malware targets the general public than when a specific victim is targeted. Similar results—for example, the higher (lower) effect of cross-family (within-family) experience— were observed in the presence of information sharing among software vendors or during a disruption caused by a catastrophe. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the specific expertise required for security countermeasure providers to be able to respond under varying conditions to fast-evolving malware.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Digression and Value Concatenation to Enable Privacy-Preserving Regression</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Li, Xiao-Bai</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Sarkar, Sumit</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Regression techniques can be used not only for legitimate data analysis, but also to infer private information about individuals. In this paper, we demonstrate that regression trees, a popular data-analysis and data-mining technique, can be used to effectively reveal individuals’ sensitive data. This problem, which we call a regression attack, has not been addressed in the data privacy literature, and existing privacy-preserving techniques are not appropriate in coping with this problem. We propose a new approach to counter regression attacks. To protect against privacy disclosure, our approach introduces a novel measure, called digression, which assesses the sensitive value disclosure risk in the process of building a regression tree model. Specifically, we develop an algorithm that uses the measure for pruning the tree to limit disclosure of sensitive data. We also propose a dynamic value-concatenation method for anonymizing data, which better preserves data utility than a user-defined generalization scheme commonly used in existing approaches. Our approach can be used for anonymizing both numeric and categorical data. An experimental study is conducted using real-world financial, economic, and healthcare data. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is very effective in protecting data privacy while preserving data quality for research and analysis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Online discussion communities play an important role in the development of relationships and the transfer of knowledge within and across organizations. Their underlying technologies enhance these processes by providing infrastructures through which group-based communication can occur. Community administrators often make decisions about technologies with the goal of enhancing the user experience, but the impact of such decisions on how a community develops must also be considered. To shed light on this complex and under-researched phenomenon, we offer a model of key latent constructs influenced by technology choices and possible causal paths by which they have dynamic effects on communities. Two important community characteristics that can be impacted are community size (number of members) and community resilience (membership that is willing to remain involved with the community in spite of variability and change in the topics discussed). To model community development, we build on attraction–selection–attrition (ASA) theory, introducing two new concepts: participation costs (how much time and effort are required to engage with content provided in a community) and topic consistency cues (how strongly a community signals that topics that may appear in the future will be consistent with what it has hosted in the past). We use the proposed ASA theory of online communities (OCASA) to develop a simulation model of community size and resilience that affirms some conventional wisdom and also has novel and counterintuitive implications. Analysis of the model leads to testable new propositions about the causal paths by which technology choices affect the emergence of community size and community resilience, and associated implications for community sustainability.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Expectation confirmation research in general, and in information systems (IS) in particular, has produced conflicting results. In this paper, we discuss six different models of expectation confirmation: assimilation, contrast, generalized negativity, assimilation-contrast, experiences only, and expectations only. Relying on key constructs from the technology acceptance model (TAM), we test each of these six models that suggests different roles for expectations and experiences of the key predictor—here, perceived usefulness—and their impacts on key outcomes—here, behavioral intention, use, and satisfaction. Data were collected in a field study from 1,113 participants at two points in time. Using polynomial modeling and response surface analysis, we provide the analytical representations for each of the six models and empirically test them to demonstrate that the assimilation-contrast is the best existing model in terms of its ability to explain the relationships between expectations and experiences of perceived usefulness and important dependent variables—namely, behavioral intention, use, and satisfaction—in individual-level research on IS implementations.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Estimating Returns to Training in the Knowledge Economy:  A Firm-Level Analysis of Small and Medium Enterprises</dc:title>

<dc:description>The ongoing digitization of multiple industries has drastically reduced the half-life of skills and capabilities acquired by knowledge workers through formal education. Thus, firms are forced to make significant ongoing investments in training their employees to remain competitive. Existing research has not examined the role of training in improving firm-level productivity of knowledge firms. This paper provides an innovative econometric framework to estimate returns to such employee training investments made by firms. We use a panel dataset of small- to medium-sized Indian IT services firms and assess how training enhances human capital, a critical input for such firms, thereby improving firm revenues. We use econometric approaches based on optimization of the firm’s profit function to eliminate the endogenous choice of inputs common in production function estimations. We find that an increase in training investments is significantly linked to an increase in revenue per employee. Further, marginal returns to training are increasing firm size. Therefore, relatively speaking, large firms benefit more from training. For the median company in our data, we find that a dollar invested in training yields a return of $4.67, and this effect approximately grows 2.5 times for the 75th percentile-sized firm. A variety of robustness checks, including the use of data envelopment analysis, are used to establish the veracity of our results.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Cultural Differences and Geography as Determinants of Online Pro-Social Lending</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Burtch, Gordon</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Ghose, Anindya</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Wattal, Sunil</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, we analyze patterns of transaction between individuals using data drawn from Kiva.org, a global online crowdfunding platform that facilitates prosocial, peer-to-peer lending. Our analysis, which employs an aggregate dataset of country-to-country lending volumes based on more than three million individual lending transactions that took place between 2005 and 2010, considers the dual roles of geographic distance and cultural differences on lenders’ decisions about which borrowers to support. While cultural differences have seen extensive study in the Information Systems literature as sources of friction in extended interactions, here, we argue and demonstrate their role in individuals’ selection of a transaction partner. We present evid ence that lenders do prefer culturally similar and geographically proximate borrowers. An analysis of the marginal effects indicates that an increase of one standard deviation in the cultural differences between lender and borrower countries is associated with 30 fewer lending actions, while an increase of one standard deviation in physical distance is associated with 0.23 fewer lending actions. We also identify a substitution effect between cultural differences and physical distance, such that a 50 percent increase in physical distance is associated with an approximate 30 percent decline in the effect of cultural differences. Considering approaches to overcoming the observed cultural effect, we offer some empirical evidence of the potential of IT-based trust mechanisms, focusing on Kiva’s reputation rating system for microfinance intermediaries. We discuss the implications of our findings for prosocial lending, online crowdfunding, and electronic markets more broadly.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Emergence of Power Laws in Online Communities:  The Role of Social Mechanisms and Preferential Attachment</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Johnson, Steven L.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Faraj, Samer</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Kudaravalli, Sri</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Online communities bring together individuals with shared interest in joint action or sustained interaction. Power law distributions of user popularity appear ubiquitous in online communities but their formation mechanisms are not well understood. This study tests for the emergence of power law distributions via the mechanisms of preferential attachment, least efforts, direct reciprocity, and indirect reciprocity. Preferential attachment, where new entrants favor connections with already popular participants, is the predominant explanation suggested by prior literature. Yet, the attribution of preferential attachment or any other mechanism as a single unitary reason for the emergence of power law distributions runs contrary to the social nature of online communities and does not account for diversity of participants’ motivation. Agent-based modeling is used to test if a single social mechanism alone or multiple mechanisms together can generate power law distributions observed in online communities. Data from 28 online communities is used to calibrate, validate, and analyze the simulation. Simulated communication networks are randomly generated according to parameters for each hypothesis. The fit of the power law distribution in the model testing subset is then compared against the fit for these simulated networks. The major finding is that, in contrast to research in more general network settings, neither preferential attachment nor any other single mechanism alone generates a power law distribution. Instead, a blended model of preferential attachment with other social network formation mechanisms was most consistent with power law distributions seen in online communities. This suggests the need to move away from stylized explanations of network emergence that rely on single theories toward more highly socialized and multitheoretic explanations of community development.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In taking into account the ways in which material and social realms are constitutively entangled within organizations, it is rhetorically tempting to say that technologies and social structures reconfigure each other. But what does it mean to reconfigure? How does one &#34;figure&#34; the other and how do we fully embrace a mutually constitutive relationship when examining fluid relations? This paper delves into these questions by exploring how physical, social, material, technological, and organizational arrangements dynamically reconfigure each other in the duration of organizational practice. Using the venue of space exploration, we present three empirical examples from an ethnographic engagement with a NASA mission orbiting an outer planet in the solar system to examine various configurations and sociomaterial relations. In this endeavor, we suggest that theoretical and empirical traction can be gained by focusing attention on the dynamic reconfigurations between social and material realms. In so doing, we call attention to the ways in which current sociomaterial perspectives have difficulty articulating the shifting, figural, asymmetric and dynamic negotiations between people, social structures, information technologies, and representational objects. This paper contributes to current discussions of sociomaterial relations in information systems research by presenting an empirical treatment of entangled and shifting reconfigurations and providing language for engaging with this perspective.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Toward Generalizable Sociomaterial Inquiry:  A Computational Approach for Zooming In and Out of Sociomaterial Routines</dc:title>

<dc:creator>Lyytinen, Kalle</dc:creator>

<dc:description>In this paper, a computational, mixed methods approach that combines qualitative analysis with a novel approach to sequence analysis for studying the entanglement of human activities and digital capabilities in organizational routines is described. The approach is scalable across multiple contexts and complements the dominant idiographic modes of sociomaterial inquiry. The approach is rooted in the epistemology of a &#34;rational reconstruction&#34; consistent with the interpretive stance underlying the sociomaterial position. It arms researchers with the means to seek and uncover regularities in the ways human activities and digital capabilities become entangled across contexts by enabling the identification and articulation of generalizable patterns of sociomaterial activity. The computational approach is founded on sequence-analytic techniques that originated from the field of computational biology (genetics), but are now gaining popularity in the study of temporally ordered social phenomena such as organizational routines. These techniques are extended by drawing upon theoretical insights gained within sociomaterial scholarship on how the digital and the social become entangled. By detecting the variation in activities, actors, artifacts, and affordances that comprise what we denote a sociomaterial routine, the approach directly attends to ways in which human actors and the material features of technology become entangled in patterns of practice. Beyond motivating and describing the approach, the different insights that researchers can generate through its application in the study of the digitalization of organizational routines are illustrated. We conclude by suggesting several lines of inquiry that can enrich sociomaterial research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Entanglements in Practice:  Performing Anonymity Through Social Media</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Scott, Susan V.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Orlikowski, Wanda</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Information systems researchers have shown an increasing interest in the notion of sociomateriality. In this paper, we continue this exploration by focusing specifically on entanglement: the inseparability of meaning and matter. Our particular approach is differentiated by its grounding in a relational and performative ontology, and its use of agential realism. We explore some of the key ideas of entanglement through a comparison of two phenomena in the travel sector: an institutionalized accreditation scheme offered by the AA and an online social media website hosted by TripAdvisor. Our analysis centers on the production of anonymity in these two practices of hotel evaluation. By examining how anonymity is constituted through an entanglement of matter and meaning, we challenge the predominantly social treatments of anonymity to date and draw attention to the uncertainties and outcomes generated by specific performances of anonymity in practice. In closing, we consider what the particular agential realist concept of entanglement entails for understanding anonymity, and discuss its implications for research practice.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Matter of Life and Death:  Exploring Conceptualizations of Sociomateriality in the Context of Critical Care</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jones, Matthew R.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Sociomateriality has been attracting growing attention in the Organization Studies and Information Systems literatures since 2007, with more than 140 journal articles now referring to the concept. Over 80 percent of these articles have been published since January 2011 and almost all cite the work of Orlikowski (2007, 2010; Orlikowski and Scott 2008) as the source of the concept. Only a few, however, address all of the notions that Orlikowski suggests are entailed in sociomateriality, namely materiality, inseparability, relationality, performativity, and practices, with many employing the concept quite selectively. The contribution of sociomateriality to these literatures is, therefore, still unclear. Drawing on evidence from an ongoing study of the adoption of a computer-based clinical information system in a hospital critical care unit, this paper explores whether the notions, individually and collectively, offer a distinctive and coherent account of the relationship between the social and the material that may be useful in Information Systems research. It is argued that if sociomateriality is to be more than simply a label for research employing a number of loosely related existing theoretical approaches, then studies employing the concept need to pay greater attention to the notions entailed in it and to differences in their interpretation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Trichordal Temporal Approach to Digital Coordination:  The Sociomaterial Mangling of the CERN Grid</dc:title>

<dc:description>This paper develops a sociomaterial perspective on digital coordination. It extends Pickering’s mangle of practice by using a trichordal approach to temporal emergence. We provide new understanding as to how the nonhuman and human agencies involved in coordination are embedded in the past, present, and future. We draw on an in-depth field study conducted between 2006 and 2010 of the development, introduction, and use of a computing grid infrastructure by the CERN particle physics community. Three coordination tensions are identified at different temporal dimensions, namelyobtaining adequate transparency in the present, modeling a future infrastructure, and the historical disciplining of social and material inertias. We propose and develop the concept of digital coordination, and contribute a trichordal temporal approach to understanding the development and use of digital infrastructure as being orientated to the past and future while emerging in the present.

			<dc:title>Specifying Formative Constructs in Information Systems Research</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Petter, Stacie</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Straub, Detmar W.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Rai, Arun</dc:creator>
<dc:description>While researchers go to great lengths to justify and prove theoretical links between constructs, the relationship between measurement items and constructs is often ignored.  By default, the relationship between construct and item is assumed to be reflective, meaning that the measurement items are a reflection of the construct.  Many times, though, the nature of the construct is not reflective, but rather formative.  Formative constructs occur when the items describe and define the construct rather than vice versa.
In this research, we examine whether formative constructs are indeed being mistaken for reflective constructs by information systems researchers.  By examining complete volumes of MIS Quarterly and Information Systems Research over the last 3 years, we discovered that a significant number of articles have indeed misspecified formative constructs.  For scientific results to be valid, we argue that researchers must properly specify formative constructs. This paper discusses the implications of different patterns of common misspecifications of formative constructs on both Type I and Type II errors.  To avoid these errors, the paper provides a roadmap to researchers to properly specify formative constructs.  We also discuss how to address formative constructs within a research model after they are specified.</dc:description>
