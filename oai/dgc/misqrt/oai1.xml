<dc:description>This article discusses the role of commonly used neurophysiological tools such as psychophysiological tools (e.g., EKG, eye tracking) and neuroimaging tools (e.g., fMRI, EEG) in Information Systems research.  There is heated interest now in the social sciences in capturing presumably objective data directly from the human body, and this interest in neurophysiological tools has also been gaining momentum in IS research (termed NeuroIS).  This article first reviews commonly used neurophysiological tools with regard to their major strengths and weaknesses.  It then discusses several promising application areas and research questions where IS researchers can benefit from the use of neurophysiological data.  The proposed research topics are presented within three thematic areas:  (1) development and use of systems, (2) IS strategy and business outcomes, and (3) group work and decision support.  The article concludes with recommendations on how to use neurophysiological tools in IS research along with a set of practical suggestions for developing a research agenda for NeuroIS and establishing NeuroIS as a viable subfield in the IS literature.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Comparing PLS to Regression and LISREL:  A Response to Marcoulides, Chin, and Saunders</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Goodhue, Dale L.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Lewis, William</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Thompson, Ron</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In the Foreword to an MIS Quarterly Special Issue on PLS, the senior editors for the special issue noted that they rejected a number of papers because the authors attempted comparisons between results from PLS, multiple regression, and structural equation modeling (Marcoulides et al. 2009).  They raised several issues they argued had to be taken into account to have legitimate comparison studies, supporting their position primarily by citing three authors:  Dijkstra (1983), McDonald(1996), and Schneeweiss (1993).  As researchers interested in conducting comparison studies, we read the Foreword carefully, but found it did not provide clear guidance on how to conduct “legitimate” comparisons.  Nor did our reading of Dijksta, McDonald, and Schneeweiss raise any red flags about dangers in this kind of comparison research.  We were concerned that instead of helping researchers to successfully engage in comparison research, the Foreword might end up discouraging that type of work, and might even be used incorrectly to reject legitimate comparison studies. This Issues and Opinions piece addresses the question of why one might conduct comparison studies, and gives an overview of the process of comparison research with a focus on what is required to make those comparisons legitimate.  In addition, we explicitly address the issues raised by Marcoulides et al., to explore where they might (or might not) come into play when conducting or evaluating this type of study.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Generalization and Induction:  Misconceptions, Clarifications, and a Classification of Induction</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Tsang, Eric W. K.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>WILLIAMS, John</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In “Generalizing Generalizability in Information Systems Research,” Lee and Baskerville (2003) try to clarify generalization and classify it into four types.  Unfortunately, their account is problematic.  We propose repairs.  Central among these is our balance-of-evidence argument that we should adopt the view that Hume’s problem of induction has a solution, even if we do not know what it is.  We build upon this by proposing an alternative classification of induction.  There are five types of generalization:  (1) theoretical, (2) within-population, (3) cross-population, (4) contextual, and (5) temporal, with theoretical generalization being across the empirical and theoretical levels and the rest within the empirical level.  Our classification also includes two kinds of inductive reasoning that do not belong to the domain of generalization.  We then discuss the implications of our classification for information systems research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Conceptualizing Generalizability:  New Contribution and a Reply</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lee, Allen S.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Baskerville, Richard L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Tsang and Williams offer some good and provocative ideas in their critique of our earlier article on generalizing and generalizability.  In this essay we will advance some new ideas by building on those collected in both Tsang and Williams and our original article (Lee and Baskerville 2003).  Because IS is a pluralist scientific discipline, one in which both qualitative and quantitative (and both interpretive and positivist) research approaches are valued, “generalize” is unlikely to be a viable term or concept if only one IS research paradigm may lay claim to it and excludes others from using it.  Both papers agree on this point, but approach the problem differently.  Where we originally generalized generalizability by offering new language, Tsang and Williams conceptualize generalizability by framing it more closely to its older, more statistically oriented form. We agree about the importance of induction and about the classification or taxonomy of different types of induction.  We build further in this essay, advancing the ethical questions raised by generalization:  A formulation of judgment calls that need to be made when generalizing a theory to a new setting.  We further demonstrate how the process of generalizing may actually proceed, based on the common ground between Tsang and Williams and our original article.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Roles of Theory in Canonical Action Research</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Davison, Robert M</dc:creator>

<dc:creator>Ou, Carol X.J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Canonical action research (CAR) aims to address real-world problems and improve organizational performance by combining scholarly observations with practical interventions.  However, efforts to conduct CAR have revealed challenges that reflect a significant research–practice gap.  We examine these challenges by revisiting the process, principles, and criteria of CAR developed earlier.  The specific roles of two different types of theory in the cyclical action research process are considered.  A project undertaken in two public relations firms illustrates how our methodological revision improves the rigor and quality of CAR.  This article contributes both a significantly enhanced action research method, with detailed guidelines and suggestions that emphasize the roles of focal and instrumental theories, and an emerging theory of knowledge sharing that incorporates key elements of Chinese management and culture.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Principles for Conducting Critical Realist Case Study Research in Information Systems</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wynn, D</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Williams, Clay K</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Critical realism is emerging as a viable philosophical paradigm for conducting social science research, and has been proposed as an alternative to the more prevalent paradigms of positivism and interpretivism.  Few papers, however, have offered clear guidance for applying this philosophy to actual research methodologies. Under critical realism, a causal explanation for a given phenomenon is inferred by explicitly identifying the means by which structural entities and contextual conditions interact to generate a given set of events. Consistent with this view of causality, we propose a set of methodological principles for conducting and evaluating critical realism-based explanatory case study research within the information systems field.  The principles are derived directly from the ontological and epistemological assumptions of critical realism.  We demonstrate the utility of each of the principles through examples drawn from existing critical realist case studies.  The article concludes by discussing the implications of critical realism based research for IS research and practice.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>How to Conduct a Functional Magnetic Resonance (fMRI) Study in Social Science Research</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Dimoka, Angelika</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This research essay outlines a set of guidelines for conducting functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies in social science research in general and also, accordingly, in Information Systems research. Given the increased interest in using neuroimaging tools across the social sciences, this study aims at specifying the key steps needed to conduct an fMRI study while ensuring that enough detail is provided to evaluate the methods and results. The outline of an fMRI study consists of four key steps: (1)　formulating the research question, (2)　designing the fMRI protocol, (3)　analyzing fMRI data, and (4)　interpreting and reporting fMRI results. These steps are described with an illustrative example of a published fMRI study on trust and distrust in this journal (Dimoka 2010). The paper contributes to the methodological literature by (1)　providing a set of guidelines for designing and conducting fMRI studies, (2)　specifying methodological details that should be included in fMRI studies in academic venues, and (3)　illustrating these practices with an exemplar fMRI study. Future directions for conducting high-quality fMRI studies in the social sciences are discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Online communities are increasingly important to organizations and the general public, but there is little theoretically based research on what makes some online communities more successful than others.  In this article, we apply theory from the field of social psychology to understand how online communities develop member attachment, an important dimension of community success.  We implemented and empirically tested two sets of community features for building member attachment by strengthening either group identity or interpersonal bonds.  To increase identity-based attachment, we gave members information about group activities and intergroup competition, and tools for group-level communication.  To increase bond-based attachment, we gave members information about the activities of individual members and interpersonal similarity, and tools for interpersonal communication.  Results from a six-month field experiment show that participants’ visit frequency and self-reported attachment increased in both conditions.  Community features intended to foster identity-based attachment had stronger effects than features intended to foster bond-based attachment.  Participants in the identity condition with access to group profiles and repeated exposure to their group’s activities visited their community twice as frequently as participants in other conditions.  The new features also had stronger effects on newcomers than on old-timers.  This research illustrates how theory from the social science literature can be applied to gain a more systematic understanding of online communities and how theory-inspired features can improve their success.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Knowledge-Based Model of Radical Innovation in Small Software Firms</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Carlo, Jessica Luo</dc:creator>

<dc:description>In this paper, we adopt the lens of absorptive capacity (ACAP), defined by two dimensions—the knowledge base (consisting of knowledge diversity, depth, and linkages) and routines (consisting of sensing and experimentation)—to explain how a software firm’s knowledge endowments influence its level of radical information technology innovation during a technological breakthrough.  We distinguish three types of IT innovations—base, processes, and service innovation—that form an innovation ecology.  We posit that (1) ACAP is a relational construct where the impact of the knowledge base is mediated by routines; (2) IT innovations are either externally adopted or internally generated; and (3) knowledge antecedents associated with different types of innovations differ.  We hypothesize a three-step, mediated path (knowledge base -&#62; sensing -&#62; experimentation -&#62; innovation) for external innovation adoption, and a two-step path (knowledge diversity/depth -&#62; experimentation -&#62; innovation) for internal innovation creation to explain the software firm’s level of radical innovation across three IT innovation types.  We validate the model through a cross-sector study that examined how 121 small software firms innovated with Internet computing.  We confirm the mediated nature of ACAP for external base innovations, which are driven by all three knowledge-based factors as follows:  (1) knowledge depth (direct positive effect); (2) knowledge diversity (mediated three-step path), (3) knowledge linkages (mediated three step path).  Process innovations are externally driven by a three-step mediated path for knowledge linkages, as well as being directly affected by knowledge diversity, but negatively and directly impeded by knowledge depth.  Service innovations are not driven by any mediated influence of ACAP, but driven directly by knowledge diversity.  At the same time, both service and process innovations are strongly influenced by prior IT innovations:  base and/or service.  Several directions for future studies of radical IT innovation are proposed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Informatino Technology Implementers&#39; Responses to User Resistance:  Nature and Effects</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rivard, Suzanne</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Lapointe, Liette</dc:creator>
<dc:description>User resistance has long been acknowledged as a critical issue during information technology implementation. Resistance can be functional when it signals the existence of problems with the IT or with its effects; it will be dysfunctional when it leads to organizational disruption.  Notwithstanding the nature of resistance, the implementers—business managers, functional managers, or IT professionals—have to address it.  Although the literature recognizes the importance of user resistance, it has paid little attention to implementers’ responses—and their effect—when resistance occurs.  Our study focuses on this phenomenon, and addresses two questions:  What are implementers’ responses to user resistance?  What are the effects of these responses on user resistance?  To answer these questions, we conducted a case survey, which combines the richness of case studies with the benefits of analyzing large quantities of data.  Our case database includes 89 cases with a total of 137 episodes of resistance.  In response to our first research question, we propose a taxonomy that includes four categories of implementers’ responses to user resistance:  inaction, acknowledgment, rectification, and dissuasion.  To answer our second question, we adopted a set-theoretic analysis approach, which we enriched with content analysis of the cases.  Based on these analyses, we offer a theoretical explanation of how implementers’ responses may affect the antecedents that earlier research found to be associated with user resistance behaviors.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Standards Competition in the Presence of Digital Conversion Technology:  An Empirical Analysis of the Flash Memory Card Market</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Liu, Charles Zhechao</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Kemerer, Chris F.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Slaughter, Sandra A.</dc:creator>

<dc:description>Both theoretical and empirical evidence suggest that, in many markets with standards competition, network effects make the strong grow stronger and can “tip” the market toward a single, winner-take-all standard.  We hypothesize, however, that low cost digital conversion technologies, which facilitate easy compatibility across competing standards, may reduce the strength of these network effects.  We empirically test our hypotheses in the context of the digital flash memory card market.         We first test for the presence of network effects in this market and find that network effects, as measured here, are associated with a significant positive price premium for leading flash memory card formats.  We then find that the availability of digital converters reduces the price premium of the leading flash card formats and reduces the overall concentration in the flash memory market.  Thus, our results suggest that, in the presence of low cost conversion technologies and digital content, the probability of market dominance can be lessened to the point where multiple, otherwise incompatible, standards are viable.
Our conclusion that the presence of converters weakens network effects implies that producers of non-dominant digital goods standards benefit from the provision of conversion technology.  Our analysis thus aids managers seeking to understand the impact of converters on market outcomes, and contributes to the existing literature on network effects by providing new insights into how conversion technologies can affect pricing strategies in these increasingly important digital settings.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Research Note on Representing Part-Whole Relations in Conceptual Modeling</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Allen, Gove N.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>March, Salvatore T.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Empirical research is an important methodology for the study of conceptual modeling practices.  The recently published article “Representing Part–Whole Relations in Conceptual Modeling:  An Empirical Evaluation” (Shanks et al. 2008) uses the lens of ontology to study a relatively sophisticated aspect of conceptual modeling practice, the representation of aggregation and composition.  It contends that some analysts argue that a composite should be represented as a relationship while others argue that a composite should be represented as an entity.  We find no evidence of such a dispute in the data modeling literature.  We observe that composites are objects.  By definition, all object-types should be represented as entities.  Therefore, using the relationship construct to represent composites should not be seen as a viable alternative.  Additionally, we found significant conceptual and methodological issues within the study that call its conclusions into question.  As a way to offer insight into the requisite methodological procedures for research in this area, we conducted two experiments that both explicate and address the issues raised.  Our results call into question the utility of using ontology as a foundation for conceptual modeling practice.  Furthermore, they suggest a contrary but at least equally plausible explanation for the results reported by Shanks et al.  In conducting this work we hope to encourage dialogue that will be beneficial for future endeavors aimed at identifying, developing, and evaluating appropriate foundations for the discipline of conceptual modeling.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Hole in the Whole:  A Response to Allen and March</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Shanks, Graeme</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Weber, Ron</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Allen and March provide a critique of one of our papers in which we argue composites should be represented as entities/objects in a conceptual model rather than relationships/associations (Shanks et al. 2008).  They contend we have addressed a non-issue.  Furthermore, they argue our theoretical rationale and empirical evidence have flaws.  In this paper, we provide a response to their arguments.  We show that the issue we address is substantive.  We show, also, that our theoretical analysis and empirical results are robust.  We find, instead, that Allen and March’s theoretical arguments and empirical evidence have flaws.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Does PLS Have Advantages for Small Sample Size or Non-Normal Data?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Goodhue, Dale L.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Lewis, William</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Thompson, Ron</dc:creator>
<dc:description>There is a pervasive belief in the MIS research community that PLS has advantages over other techniques when analyzing small sample sizes or data with non-normal distributions.  Based on these beliefs, major MIS journals have published studies using PLS with sample sizes that would be deemed unacceptably small if used with other statistical techniques.  We used Monte Carlo simulation more extensively than previous research to evaluate PLS, multiple regression, and LISREL in terms of accuracy and statistical power under varying conditions of sample size, normality of the data, number of indicators per construct, reliability of the indicators, and complexity of the research model.  We found that PLS performed as effectively as the other techniques in detecting actual paths, and not falsely detecting non-existent paths.  However, because PLS (like regression) apparently does not compensate for measurement error, PLS and regression were consistently less accurate than LISREL.  When used with small sample sizes, PLS, like the other techniques, suffers from increased standard deviations, decreased statistical power,and reduced accuracy.  All three techniques were remarkably robust against moderate departures from normality, and equally so.  In total, we found that the similarities in results across the three techniques were much stronger than the differences.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Assessing Common Method Bias:  Problems with the ULMC Technique</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chin, Wynne</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Thatcher, Jason Bennett</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Wright, Ryan T.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Recent work, in journals such as MIS Quarterly and Management Science, has highlighted the importance of evaluating the influence of common method bias (CMB) on the results of statistical analysis.  In this research note, we assess the utility of the unmeasured latent method construct (ULMC) approach in partial least squares (PLS), introduced by Liang et al. (2007).  Such an assessment of the ULMC approach is important, because it has been employed in 76 studies since it appeared in MIS Quarterly in early 2007.  Using data generated via Monte Carlo simulations, we use PLS structural equation modeling (SEM) to demonstrate that the ULMC approach of Liang et al. is neither able to detect, nor control for, common method bias.  Method estimates using this approach resulted in negligible estimates, regardless of whether there were some, large, or no method bias introduced in the simulated data.  Our study contributes to the IS and research methods literature by illustrating that, and explaining why the ULMC approach does not accurately detect common method bias in PLS.  Further, our results build on prior work done using covariance-based SEM questioning the usefulness of the ULMC technique for detecting CMB.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Internet was a major factor in the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign and has become an important tool for political communication and persuasion.  Yet, information systems research is generally silent on the role of the Internet in politics.  In this paper, we argue that IS is positioned to enhance understanding of the influence of the Internet on politics, and, more specifically, the process of election campaigning using Internet-based technologies such as Web 2.0.  In this paper, we discuss how these technologies can change the nature of competition in politics and replace or complement traditional media.  Our empirical study on how Web 2.0 technologies were used by the candidates leading up to the 2008 U.S. presidential primaries sheds light on how these technologies influenced candidate performance.  Finally, we outline a research agenda highlighting where IS can contribute to the academic discourse on e-politics.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Focus and Diversity in Information Systems Research:  Meeting the Dual Demands of a Healthy Applied Discipline</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Taylor, Hazel</dc:creator>

<dc:creator>Van Wingen, Melinda</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Drawing on sociology of science foundations, we argue that, in order to survive and prosper, healthy applied disciplines must meet the dual demands of academic and practitioner audiences by demonstrating both focus and diversity in their research.  First, we use this concomitant modality to explain why previous studies into the structure of the Information Systems discipline have reported contradictory results, with some finding a focused field while others conclude that the field is diverse.  In support of our argument, we then present the results of a longitudinal, author co-citation analysis, looking across the full range of journals in which IS research is published.  Our results suggest that the IS field has sustained a focus on research within three subfields over a 20-year period from 1986 to 2005:  (1) a thematic miscellany of research on development, implementation, and use of systems in various application domains; (2) IS strategy and business outcomes; and (3) group work and decision support.  At the same time, the field has demonstrated considerable diversity within and around these core subfields, with researchers responding flexibly to the rapidly changing field by investigating these areas with new paradigms and in new contexts, and by exploring new topics including inter-business and Internet applications, computer-supported collaborative work, virtual teams, and knowledge management.  Finally, we demonstrate that, over the 20-year period from 1986 to 2005, the discipline has shifted from fragmented adhocracy to a polycentric state, which is particularly appropriate to an applied discipline such as IS that must address the dual demands of focus and diversity in a rapidly changing technological context.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Improving Employees&#39; Compliance Through Information Systems Security Training:  An Action Research Study</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Puhakainen, Petri</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Siponen, Mikko</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Employee noncompliance with information systems security policies is a key concern for organizations.  If users do not comply with IS security policies, security solutions lose their efficacy.  Of the different IS security policy compliance approaches, training is the most commonly suggested in the literature.  Yet, few of the existing studies about training to promote IS policy compliance utilize theory to explain what learning principles affect user compliance with IS security policies, or offer empirical evidence of their practical effectiveness.  Consequently, there is a need for IS security training approaches that are theory-based and empirically evaluated.  Accordingly, we propose a training program based on two theories:  the universal constructive instructional theory and the elaboration likelihood model.  We then validate the training program for IS security policy compliance training through an action research project.  The action research intervention suggests that the theory-based training achieved positive results and was practical to deploy.  Moreover, the intervention suggests that information security training should utilize contents and methods that activate and motivate the learners to systematic cognitive processing of information they receive during the training.  In addition, the action research study made clear that a continuous communication process was also required to improve user IS security policy compliance.  The findings of this study offer new insights for scholars and practitioners involved in IS security policy compliance.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Understanding Organization-Enterprise System Fit:  A Path to Theorizing the Information Technology Artifact</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Strong, Diane</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Volkoff, Olga</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Packaged software applications such as enterprise systems are designed to support generic rather than specific requirements, and hence are likely to be an imperfect fit in any particular instance.  Using critical realism as our philosophical perspective, we conducted a three-year qualitative study of misfits that arose from an enterprise system (ES) implementation.  A detailed analysis of the observed misfits resulted in a richer understanding of the concept of fit and of the ES artifact itself.  Specifically, we found six misfit domains (functionality, data, usability, role, control and organizational culture) and within each, two types of misfit (deficiencies and impositions).  These misfit types correspond to two newly defined types of fit:  fit as coverage and fit as enablement. Our analysis of fit also revealed a new conceptualization of the ES artifact, with implications for IT artifacts in general.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Other Side of Acceptance:  Studying the Direct and Indirect Effects of Emotions on Information Technology Use</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Beaudry, Anne</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Pinsonneault, Alain</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Much ado has been made regarding user acceptance of new information technologies.  However, research has been primarily based on cognitive models and little attention has been given to emotions.  This paper argues that emotions are important drivers of behaviors and examines how emotions experienced early in the implementation of new IT applications relate to IT use.  We develop a framework that classifies emotions into four distinct types:  challenge, achievement, loss, and deterrence emotions.  The direct and indirect rela tionships between four emotions (excitement, happiness, anger, and anxiety) and IT use were studied through a survey of 249 bank account managers.  Our results indicate that excitement was positively related to IT use through task adaptation.  Happiness was directly positively related to IT use and, surprisingly, was negatively associated with task adaptation, which is a facilitator of IT use.  Anger was not related to IT use directly, but it was positively related to seeking social support, which in turn was positively related to IT use. Finally, anxiety was negatively related to IT use, both directly and indirectly through psychological distancing.  Anxiety was also indirectly positively related to IT use through seeking social support, which countered the original negative effect of anxiety.  Post hoc ANOVAs were conducted to compare IT usage of different groups of users experiencing similar emotions but relying on different adaptation behaviors.  The paper shows that emotions felt by users early in the implementation of a new IT have important effects on IT use.  As such, the paper provides a complementary perspective to understanding acceptance and antecedents of IT use.  By showing the importance and complexity of the relationships between emotions and IT use, the paper calls for more research on the topic</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Affect in Web Interfaces:  A Study of the Impacts of Web Page Visual Complexity and Order</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Deng, Liqiong</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Poole, Marshall Scott</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This research concentrates on visual complexity and order as central factors in the design of webpages that enhance users’ positive emotional reactions and facilitate desirable psychological states and behaviors.  Drawing on existing theories and empirical findings in the environmental psychology, human–computer interaction, and marketing research literatures, a research model is developed to explain the relationships among visual complexity and order design features of a webpage, induced emotional responses in users, and users’ approach behaviors toward the website as moderated by users’ metamotivational states.  A laboratory experiment was  conducted to test the model and its associated hypotheses.  The results of the study suggested that a web user’s initial emotional responses (i.e., pleasantness and arousal), evoked by the visual complexity and order design features of a webpage when first encountered, will have carry-over effects on subsequent approach behavior toward the website.  The results also revealed how webpage visual complexity and order influence users’ emotions and behaviors differently when users are in different metamotivational states.  The salience and importance of webpage visual complexity and order for users’ feelings of pleasantness were largely dependent on users’ metamotivational states.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Alternative to Methodological Individualism:  A Non-Reductionist Approach to Studying Technology Adoption by Groups</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sarker, Saonee</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Valacich, Joseph S.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Studies on groups within the MIS discipline have largely been based on the paradigm of methodological individualism. Commentaries on methodological individualism within the reference disciplines suggest that studies embracing this paradigm can lead to potentially misleading or incorrect conclusions.  This study illustrates the appropriateness of the alternate non-reductionist approach to investigating group-related phenomenon, specifically in the context of technology adoption.  Drawing on theories of group influence, prior research on conflict, technology characteristics, task– technology fit, group communication media, and recent theoretical work surrounding group technology adoption, the paper proposes and empirically tests a new non-reductionist model for conceptualizing technology adoption by groups.  Further, the study also empirically compares this non-reductionist model with a (hypothetical) methodological individualist model of technology adoption by groups.  Results strongly support most of the assertions of the non-reductionist model and highlight that this model provides a more robust explanation of technology adoption by groups than a methodological individualist view.  Further, the study also highlights some conditions wherein the methodological individualist view fails to provide correct explanations.  The implications of the study’s findings for future research are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Impact of Information Technology and Transactive Memory Systems on Knowledge Sharing, Application, and Team Performance:  A Field Study</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Choi, Sue Young</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Lee, Heeseok</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Yoo, Youngjin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In contemporary knowledge-based organizations, teams often play an essential role in leveraging knowledge resources. Organizations make significant investments in information technology to support knowledge management practices in teams.  At the same time, recent studies show that the transactive memory system (TMS)—the specialized division of cognitive labor among team members that relates to the encoding, storage, and retrieval of knowledge—is an important factor that affects a team’s performance.  Yet little is known of how IT support for knowledge management practices in organizations affects the development of TMS. Furthermore, the precise role of TMS on knowledge sharing and knowledge application, which in turn influences team performance, has not been fully explored.  In order to close this gap in the literature, we conducted a field study that involved 139 on-going teams of 743 individuals from two major firms in South Korea.  Our results show that IT support in organizations has a positive impact on the development of TMS in teams, and that both TMS and IT support have a positive impact on knowledge sharing and knowledge application.  Furthermore, we found that knowledge sharing has a positive impact on knowledge application, which in turn has a direct impact on team performance.  However, contrary to our expectation, knowledge sharing does not have a direct impact on team performance and its impact on team performance was fully mediated by knowledge application. Our research shows that organizations can improve team members’ meta-knowledge of who knows what through the careful investment in information technology. Finally, our results show that sharing knowledge alone is not enough. Organizations must ensure that shared knowledge is in fact applied in order to improve team performance.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Toward Ethical Information Systems:  The Contribution of Discourse Ethics</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mingers, John</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Walsham, Geoff</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Ethics is important in the Information Systems field as illustrated by the direct effect of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on the work of IS professionals.  There is a substantial literature on ethical issues surrounding computing and information technology in the contemporary world, but much of this work is not published nor widely cited in the mainstream IS literature.  The purpose of this paper is to offer one contribution to an increased emphasis on ethics in the IS field.  The distinctive contribution is a focus on Habermas’s discourse ethics.  After outlining some traditional theories of ethics and morality, the literature on IS and ethics is reviewed, and then the paper details the development of discourse ethics.  Discourse ethics is different from other approaches to ethics as it is grounded in actual debates between those affected by decisions and proposals.  Recognizing that the theory could be considered rather abstract, the paper discusses the need to pragmatize discourse ethics for the IS field through, for example, the use of existing techniques such as soft systems methodology.  In addition, the practical potential of the theory is illustrated through a discussion of its application to specific IS topic areas including Web 2.0, open source software, the digital divide, and the UK biometric identity card scheme.  The final section summarizes ways in which the paper could be used in IS research, teaching, and practice.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Fake websites have become increasingly pervasive, generating billions of dollars in fraudulent revenue at the expense of unsuspecting Internet users.  The design and appearance of these websites makes it difficult for users to manually identify them as fake.  Automated detection systems have emerged as a mechanism for combating fake websites, however most are fairly simplistic in terms of their fraud cues and detection methods employed.  Consequently, existing systems are susceptible to the myriad of obfuscation tactics used by fraudsters, resulting in highly ineffective fake website detection performance.  In light of these deficiencies, we propose the development of a new class of fake website detection systems that are based on statistical learning theory (SLT).  Using a design science approach, a prototype system was developed to demonstrate the potential utility of this class of systems.  We conducted a series of experiments, comparing the proposed system against several existing fake website detection systems on a test bed encompassing 900 websites.  The results indicate that systems grounded in SLT can more accurately detect various categories of fake websites by utilizing richer sets of fraud cues in combination with problem-specific knowledge.  Given the hefty cost exacted by fake websites, the results have important implications for e-commerce and online security.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Circuits of Power:  A Study of Mandated Compliance to an Information Systems Security De Jure Standard in a Government Organization</dc:title>

<dc:description>Organizations need to protect information assets against cyber crime, denial-of-service attacks, web hackers, data breaches, identity and credit card theft, and fraud.  Criminals often try to achieve financial, political, or personal gain through these attacks, so the threats that their actions prompt are insidious motivators for organizations to adopt information systems security (ISS) approaches.  Extant ISS research has traditionally examined ISS in e-commerce business organizations.  The present study investigates ISS within government, analyzing power relationships during an ISS standards adoption and accreditation process, where a head of state mandates that all government agencies are to comply with a national de jure ISS standard.  Using a canonical action research method, designated managers of ISS services across small, medium, and large agencies were monitored and assessed for progress to accreditation through surveys, interviews, participant observation at round table forums, and focus groups.  By 2008, accreditation status across the 89 agencies participating in this study was approximately 33 percent fully accredited, with 67 percent partially compliant. The research uses Clegg’s (1989) circuits of power framework to interpret power, resistance, norms, and cultural relationships in the process of compliance.  The paper highlights that a strategy based on organization subunit size is helpful in motivating and assisting organizations to move toward accreditation.  Mandated standard accreditation was inhibited by insufficient resource allocation, lack of senior management input, and commitment.  Factors contributing to this resistance were group norms and cultural biases.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Neutralization:  New Insights into the Problem of Employee Systems Security Policy Violations</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Siponen, Mikko</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Vance, Anthony Osborn</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Employees’ failure to comply with information systems security policies is a major concern for information technology security managers.  In efforts to understand this problem, IS security researchers have traditionally viewed violations of IS security policies through the lens of deterrence theory.  In this article, we show that neutralization theory, a theory prominent in Criminology but not yet applied in the context of IS, provides a compelling explanation for IS security policy violations and offers new insight into how employees rationalize this behavior.  In doing so, we propose a theoretical model in which the effects of neutralization techniques are tested alongside those of sanctions described by deterrence theory.  Our empirical results highlight neutralization as an important factor to take into account with regard to developing and implementing organizational security policies and practices.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>User Participation in Information Systems Security Risk Management</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Spears, Janine L.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Barki, Henri</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper examines user participation in information systems security risk management and its influence in the context of regulatory compliance via a multi-method study at the organizational level.  First, eleven informants across five organizations were interviewed to gain an understanding of the types of activities and security controls in which users participated as part of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, along with associated outcomes.  A research model was developed based on the findings of the qualitative study and extant user participation theories in the systems development literature. Analysis of the data collected in a questionnaire survey of 228 members of ISACA, a professional association specialized in information technology governance, audit, and security, supported the research model.  The findings of the two studies converged and indicated that user participation contributed to improved security control performance through greater awareness, greater alignment between IS security risk management and the business environment, and improved control development.  While the IS security literature often portrays users as the weak link in security, the current study suggests that users may be an important resource to IS security by providing needed business knowledge that contributes to more effective security measures.  User participation is also a means to engage users in protecting sensitive information in their business processes.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Information Security Policy Compliance:  An Empirical Study of Rationality-Based Beliefs and Information Security Awareness</dc:title>

<dc:description>Many organizations recognize that their employees, who are often considered the weakest link in information security, can also be great assets in the effort to reduce risk related to information security.  Since employees who comply with the information security rules and regulations of the organization are the key to strengthening information security, understanding compliance behavior is crucial for organizations that want to leverage their human capital.
This research identifies the antecedents of employee compliance with the information security policy (ISP) of an organization.  Specifically, we investigate the rationality-based factors that drive an employee to comply with requirements of the ISP with regard to protecting the organization’s information and technology resources.  Drawing on the theory of planned behavior, we posit that, along with normative belief and self-efficacy, an employee’s attitude toward compliance determines intention to comply with the ISP.  As a key contribution, we posit that an employee’s attitude is influenced by benefit of compliance, cost of compliance, and cost of noncompliance, which are beliefs about the overall assessment of consequences of compliance or noncompliance.  We then postulate that these beliefs are shaped by the employee’s outcome beliefs concerning the events that follow compliance or noncompliance:  benefit of compliance is shaped by intrinsic benefit, safety of resources, and rewards, while cost of compliance is shaped by work impediment; and cost of noncompliance is shaped by intrinsic cost, vulnerability of resources, and sanctions.  We also investigate the impact of information security awareness (ISA) on outcome beliefs and an employee’s attitude toward compliance with the ISP.
Our results show that an employee’s intention to comply with the ISP is significantly influenced by attitude, normative beliefs, and self-efficacy to comply.  Outcome beliefs significantly affect beliefs about overall assessment of consequences, and they, in turn, significantly affect an employee’s attitude.  Furthermore, ISA positively affects both attitude and outcome beliefs.  As the importance of employees’ following their organizations’ information security rules and regulations increases, our study sheds light on the role of ISA and compliance-related beliefs in an organization’s efforts to encourage compliance.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Fear Appeals and Information Security Behaviors:  An Empirical Study</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Johnston, Allen C.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Warkentin, Merrill</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Information technology executives strive to align the actions of end users with the desired security posture of management and of the firm through persuasive communication.  In many cases, some element of fear is incorporated within these communications.  However, within the context of computer security and information assurance, it is not yet clear how these fear-inducing arguments, known as fear appeals, will ultimately impact the actions of end users.  The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of fear appeals on the compliance of end users with recommendations to enact specific individual computer security actions toward the mitigation of threats.  An examination was performed that culminated in the development and testing of a conceptual model representing an infusion of technology adoption and fear appeal theories.
Results of the study suggest that fear appeals do impact end user behavioral intentions to comply with recommended individual acts of security, but the impact is not uniform across all end users.  It is determined in part by perceptions of self-efficacy, response efficacy, threat severity, and social influence.  The findings of this research contribute to information systems security research, human–computer interaction, and organizational communication by revealing a new paradigm in which IT users form perceptions of the technology, not on the basis of performance gains, but on the basis of utility for threat mitigation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Market Value of Voluntary Disclosures Concerning Information Security</dc:title>

<dc:creator>Loeb, Martin P</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Sohail, Tashfeen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Information security is a fundamental concern for corporations operating in today’s digital economy.  The number of firms disclosing items concerning their information security on reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has increased in recent years.  A question then arises as to whether or not there is value to the voluntary disclosures concerning information security.  Thus, the primary objective of this paper is to assess empirically the market value of voluntary disclosures of items pertaining to information security.  Based on a sample of 1,641 disclosing and 19,266 non-disclosing firm-years in a cross-sectional pooled model, our primary findings provide strong evidence that voluntarily disclosing items concerning information security is associated positively with the market value of a firm.  These findings are based on the use of a market-value relevance model, as well as a bid-ask spread analysis. The study’s findings are robust to alternative statistical analyses. The findings also provide support for the signaling argument, which states that managers disclose information in a manner consistent with increased firm value.  Finally, the study findings provide some insight into the strategic choice that firms make regarding voluntary disclosures about information security.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Impact of Malicious Agents on the Enterprise Software Industry</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Galbreth, Michael R.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Shor, Mikhael</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, a competitive software market that includes horizontal and quality differentiation, as well as a negative network effect driven by the presence of malicious agents, is modeled. Software products with larger installed bases, and therefore more potential computers to attack, present more appealing targets for malicious agents.  One finding is  that software firms may profit from increased malicious activity. Software products in a more competitive market are less likely to invest in security, while monopolistic or niche products are likely to be more secure from malicious attack.  The results provide insights for IS managers considering enterprise software adoption.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Practicing Safe Computing:  A Multimedia Empirical Examination of Home Computer User Security Behavioral Intentions</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Smith, Catherine L.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Agarwal, Ritu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Although firms are expending substantial resources to develop technology and processes that can help safeguard the security of their computing assets, increased attention is being focused on the role people play in maintaining a safe computing environment.  Unlike employees in a work setting, home users are not subject to training, nor are they protected by a technical staff dedicated to keeping security software and hardware current.  Thus, with over one billion people with access to the Internet, individual home computer users represent a significant point of weakness in achieving the security of the cyber infrastructure.  We study the phenomenon of conscientious cybercitizens, defined as individuals who are motivated to take the necessary precautions under their direct control to secure their own computer and the Internet in a home setting.  Using a multidisciplinary, phased approach, we develop a conceptual model of the conscientious cybercitizen.  We present results from two studies—a survey and an experiment—conducted to understand the drivers of intentions to perform security-related behavior, and the interventions that can positively influence these drivers.  In the first study, we use protection motivation theory as the underlying conceptual foundation and extend the theory by drawing upon the public goods literature and the concept of psychological ownership.  Results from a survey of 594 home computer users from a wide range of demographic and socio-economic backgrounds suggest that a home computer user’s intention to perform security-related behavior is influenced by a combination of cognitive, social, and psychological components.  In the second study, we draw upon the concepts of goal framing and self-view to examine how the proximal drivers of intentions to perform security-related behavior identified in the first study can be influenced by appropriate messaging.  An experiment with 101 subjects is used to test the research hypotheses.  Overall, the two studies shed important new light on creating more conscientious cybercitizens.  Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Information Systems Strategy:  Reconceptualization, Measurement, and Implications</dc:title>

<dc:creator>Preston, David S.</dc:creator>

<dc:description>Information systems strategy is of central importance to IS practice and research.  Our extensive review of the literature suggests that the concept of IS strategy is a term that is used readily; however, it is also a term that is not fully understood. In this study, we follow a perspective paradigm based on the strategic management literature to define IS strategy as an organizational perspective on the investment in, deployment, use, and management of IS.  Through a systematic literature search, we identify the following three conceptions of IS strategy employed implicitly in 48 articles published in leading IS journals that focus on the construct of IS strategy: (1) IS strategy as the use of IS to support business strategy; (2) IS strategy as the master plan of the IS function; and (3) IS strategy as the shared view of the IS role within the organization.  We find the third conception best fits our definition of IS strategy.  As such, we consequently propose to operationalize IS strategy as the degree to which the organization has a shared perspective to seek innovation through IS. Specifically, our proposed IS strategic typology suggests an organization’s IS strategy falls into one of the two defined categories (i.e., IS innovator or IS conservative) or is simply undefined.  We also develop measures for this new typology. We argue that the proposed instrument, which was cross-validated across both chief information officers and senior business executives, has the potential to serve as a diagnostic tool through which the organization can directly assess its IS strategy.  We contend that our reconceptualization and operationalization of IS strategy provides theoretical and practical implications that advance the current level of understanding of IS strategy from extant studies within three predominant literature streams: strategic IS planning, IS/business strategic alignment, and competitive use of IS.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Computing in Everyday Life:  A Call for Research on Experiential Computing</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Yoo, Youngjin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The information systems field emerged as a new discipline of artificial science as a result of intellectual efforts to understand the nature and consequences of computer and communication technology in modern organizations.  As the rapid development of digital technology continues to make computers and computing a part of everyday experiences, we are once again in need of a new discipline of the artificial.  In this essay, I argue that the IS community must expand its intellectual boundaries by embracing experiential computing as an emerging field of inquiry in order to fill this growing intellectual void.  Experiential computing involves digitally mediated embodied experiences in everyday activities through everyday artifacts that have embedded computing capabilities.  Experiential computing is enabled by the mediation of four dimensions of human experiences (time, space, actors, and artifacts) through digital technology.  Drawing on a research framework that encompasses both behavioral and design sciences, six research opportunities that the IS research community can explore are suggested.  Ultimately, I propose that the IS field return to its roots, the science of the artificial, by decisively expanding the scope of its inquiry and establishing a new domain of research on computing in everyday life experiences.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Whether and how firms can employ relative rankings in search engine results pages (SERPs) to differentiate their brands from competitors in cyberspace remains a critical, puzzling issue in e-commerce research.  By synthesizing relevant literature from cognitive psychology, marketing, and e-commerce, this study identifies key contextual factors that are conducive for creating brand positioning online via SERPs.  In two experiments, the authors establish that when Internet users’ implicit beliefs (i.e., schema) about the meaning of the display order of search engine results are activated or heightened through feature priming, they will have better recall of an unknown brand that is displayed before the well-known brands in SERPs.  Further, those with low Internet search skills tend to evaluate the unknown brand more favorably along the particular brand attribute that activates the search engine ranking schema.  This research has both theoretical and practical implications for understanding the effectiveness of search engine optimization techniques.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Expectation Disconfirmation and Technology Adoption:  Polynomial Modeling and Response Surface Analysis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Venkatesh, Viswanath</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Goyal, Sandeep</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Individual-level information systems adoption research has recently seen the introduction of expectation–disconfirmation theory (EDT) to explain how and why user reactions change over time.  This prior research has produced valuable insights into the phenomenon of technology adoption beyond traditional models, such as the technology acceptance model. First, we identify gaps in EDT research that present potential opportunities for advances—specifically, we discuss methodological and analytical limitations in EDT research in information systems and present polynomial modeling and response surface methodology as solutions.  Second, we draw from research on cognitive dissonance, realistic job preview, and prospect theory to present a polynomial model of expectation–disconfirmation in information systems.  Finally, we test our model using data gathered over a period of 6 months among 1,143 employees being introduced to a new technology.  The results confirmed our hypotheses that disconfirmation in general was bad, as evidenced by low behavioral intention to continue using a system for both positive and negative disconfirmation, thus supporting the need for a polynomial model to understand expectation disconfirmation in information systems.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Multi-Project Model of Key Factors Affecting Organizational Benefits from Enterprise Systems</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Seddon, Peter B.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Calvert, Cheryl</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Yang, Song</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper develops a long-term, multi-project model of factors affecting organizational benefits from enterprise systems (ES), then reports a preliminary test of the model.  In the shorter-term half of the model, it is hypothesized that once a system has gone live, two factors, namely functional fit and overcoming organizational inertia, drive organizational benefits flowing from each major ES improvement project. The importance of these factors may vary from project to project. In the long-term half of the model, it is hypothesized that four additional factors, namely integration, process optimization, improved access to information, and on-going major ES business improvement projects, drive organizational benefits from ES over the long term.  Preliminary tests of the model were conducted using data from 126 customer presentations from SAP’s 2003 and 2005 Sapphire U.S. conferences. All six factors were found to be important in explaining variance in organizational benefits from enterprise systems from the perspective of senior management.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Investigating Two Contradictory Views of Formative Measurement in Information Systems Research</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kim, Gimun</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Shin, Bongsik</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Grover, Varun</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The use of formative measurement in the field of Information Systems has increased, arguably due to statistical tools (e.g., PLS) that can test such models.  However, in the literature, there exist two contradictory views on the potential deficiency of formative measurement.  While opponents who are critical of formative measurement argue that there are native weaknesses of the formative approach in model estimation, propo nents who are in favor of using formative measurement counter that opponents’ research methods in measurement model specification are flawed.  The goal of this work is to empirically test these opposing views on whether the alleged estimation instability of formative measurement is due to measurement model misspecification or simply the shortcoming of formative measurement.  To assess the integrity of arguments of both parties, we adopt a research design in which four different cases are tested in terms of interpretational confounding and external consistency.  We find that regardless of whether there is a specification issue, formative measures can lead to misleading outcomes.  Based on the results, we offer guidelines that researchers may adopt in planning and executing data analysis with structural equation modeling.  Given that the use of formative measurement is at a critical juncture in the IS field, we believe that the guidelines in this research note are important to promote appropriate use of the approach rather than relegate it to a bandwagon effect.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Introduction to the Special Issue on Novel Perspectives on Trust in Information Systems</dc:title>

<dc:description>Research on trust has taken center stage in the MIS field in the past few decades, covering a wide range of trust-related topics based on a multitude of theories from sociology and psychology to economics.  To extend this rapidly emerging trend and identify some ground-breaking perspectives on the study of trust, this special issue of the MIS Quarterly on “Novel Perspectives on Trust in Information Systems” aims to explore novel aspects of trust in new and under-researched IS contexts.  In brief, the intent of the special issue was to publish innovative research articles about (1) novel antecedents of trust, (2) the construct of distrust and its relationship to trust, (3) the boundaries of trust, and (4) the study of trust in new and unexplored MIS contexts (Benbasat et al. 2008).
The papers submitted were first screened by the editors, in some cases aided by an associate editor, to verify their appropriateness to the topic of the special issue and their novelty.  The remaining manuscripts went through the MIS Quarterly’s standard, rigorous review process, including the usual “arms-length” and “conflict of interest” guidelines for the senior editors, associate editors, and reviewers in the handling of the papers.  Interestingly, neither of the papers eventually accepted utilized traditional research methods commonly used in past research on trust in MIS.  Indeed, the two papers that appear in this special issue dealt with what to MIS research are rather novel methodologies (namely functional brain imaging, specifically functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI) (see Belliveau et al. 1991; Friston et al. 1994; Logothetis et al. 2001; Ogawa et al. 1990), which enabled these two papers to offer new insights into topics that were out of reach for the more traditional research methods previously used in trust research.  By no means do we imply, however, that future novel contributions to the study of trust in MIS research should be limited to any particular research methodologies.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Information About Information:  A Taxonomy of Views</dc:title>
<dc:creator>McKinney, Earl</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Yoos, Chuck</dc:creator>
<dc:description>“Information” is poorly defined in the Information Systems research literature, and is almost always unspecified, a reflexive, all-purpose but indiscriminant solution to an unbounded variety of problems.  We present a taxonomy of four views—token, syntax, representation, and adaptation—to enable scholars and practitioners to specify their concept of information.  This taxonomy is normative, but we also provide a background review of the etymology and chronology of information, and we sample uses of the term in current IS research.  IS research will improve as the term information, via the taxonomy we contribute, is employed more explicitly and consistently.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Chen, Adela J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>While many corporations and Information Systems units recognize that environmental sustainability is an urgent problem to address, the IS academic community has been slow to acknowledge the problem and take action.  We propose ways for the IS community to engage in the development of environmentally sustainable business practices.  Specifically, as IS researchers, educators, journal editors, and association leaders, we need to demonstrate how the transformative power of IS can be leveraged to create an ecologically sustainable society.  In this Issues and Opinions piece, we advocate a research agenda to establish a new subfield of energy informatics, which applies information systems thinking and skills to increase energy efficiency. We also articulate how IS scholars can incorporate environmental sustainability as an underlying foundation in their teaching, and how IS leaders can embrace environmental sustainability in their core principles and foster changes that reduce the environmental impact of our community.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Are There Neural Gender Differences in Online Trust?  An fMRI Study on the Perceived Trustworthiness of eBay Offers</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Riedl, René</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Hubert, Marco</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Kenning, Peter</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Research provides increasing evidence that women and men differ in their decisions to trust.  However, information systems research does not satisfactorily explain why these gender differences exist.  One possible reason is that, surprisingly, theoretical concepts often do not address the most obvious factor that influences human behavior:  biology.  Given the essential role of biological factors—and specifically those of the brain—in decisions to trust, the biological influences should naturally include those related to gender.  As trust considerations in economic decision making have become increasingly complex with the expansion of Internet use, understanding the related biological/brain functions and the involvement of gender provides a range of valuable insights.
To show empirically that online trust is associated with activity changes in certain brain areas, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).  In a laboratory experiment, we captured the brain activity of 10 female and 10 male participants simultaneous to decisions on trustworthiness of eBay offers.  We found that most of the brain areas that encode trustworthiness differ between women and men. Moreover, we found that women activated more brain areas than did men.  These results confirm the empathizing– systemizing theory, which predicts gender differences in neural information processing modes.
In demonstrating that perceived trustworthiness of Internet offers is affected by neurobiology, our study has major implications for both IS research and management.  We confirm the value of a category of research heretofore neglected in IS research and practice, and argue that future IS research investigating human behavior should consider the role of biological factors.  In practice, biological factors are a significant consideration for management, marketing, and engineering attempts to influence behavior.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Information Systems Innovation for Environmental Sustainability</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Melville, Nigel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Human life is dependent upon the natural environment, which, most would agree, is rapidly degrading.  Business enterprises are a dominant form of social organization and contribute to the worsening, and enhancement, of the natural environment.  Scholars in the administrative sciences examine questions spanning organizations and the natural environment but have largely omitted the information systems perspective.  We develop a research agenda on information systems innovation for environmental sustainability that demonstrates the critical role that IS can play in shaping beliefs about the environment, in enabling and transforming sustainable processes and practices in organizations, and in improving environmental and economic performance.  The belief–action–outcome (BAO) framework and associated research agenda provide the basis for a new discourse on IS for environmental sustainability.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>What Does the Brain Tell Us About Trust and Distrust?  Evidence from a Functional Neuroimaging Study</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Dimoka, Angelika</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Determining whom to trust and whom to distrust is a major decision in impersonal IT-enabled exchanges.  Despite the potential role of both trust and distrust in impersonal exchanges, the information systems literature has primarily focused on trust, alas paying relatively little attention to distrust.  Given the importance of studying both trust and distrust, this study aims to shed light on the nature, dimensionality, distinction, and relationship, and relative effects of trust and distrust on economic outcomes in the context of impersonal IT-enabled exchanges between buyers and sellers in online marketplaces.
This study uses functional neuroimaging (fMRI) tools to complement psychometric measures of trust and distrust by observing the location, timing, and level of brain activity that underlies trust and distrust and their underlying dimensions. The neural correlates of trust and distrust are identified when subjects interact with four experimentally manipulated seller profiles that differ on their level of trust and distrust.  The results show that trust and distrust activate different brain areas and have different effects, helping explain why trust and distrust are distinct constructs associated with different neurological processes.  Implications for the nature, distinction and relationship, dimensionality, and effects of trust and distrust are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Empirical Analysis of the Impact of Information Capabilities Design on Business Process Outsourcing Performance</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mani, Deepa</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Barua, Anitesh</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Whinston, Andrew B.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Organizations today outsource diverse business processes to achieve a wide variety of business objectives ranging from reduction of costs to innovation and business transformation.  We build on the information processing view of the firm to theorize that performance heterogeneity across business process outsourcing (BPO) exchanges is a function of the design of information capabilities (IC) that fit the unique information requirements (IR) of the exchange.  Further, we compare performance effects of the fit between IR and IC across dominant categories of BPO relationships to provide insights into the relative benefits of enacting such fit between the constructs.  Empirical tests of our hypotheses using survey data on 127 active BPO relationships find a significant increase (decrease) in satisfaction as a result of the fit (misfit) between IR and IC of the relationship.  The results have implications for how BPO relationships must be designed and managed to realize significant performance gains.  The study also extends the IPV to identify IC that provide the incentives and means to process information in an interfirm relationship.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Chasing the Hottest IT:  Effects of Information Technology Fashion on Organizations</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wang, Ping</dc:creator>
<dc:description>What happens to organizations that chase the hottest information technologies?  This study examines some of the important organizational impacts of the fashion phenomenon in IT.  An IT fashion is a transitory collective belief that an information technology is new, efficient, and at the forefront of practice.  Using data collected from published discourse and annual IT budgets of 109 large companies for a decade, I have found that firms whose names were associated with IT fashions in the press did not have higher performance, but they had better reputation and higher executive compensation in the near term.  Companies investing in IT in fashion also had higher reputation and executive pay, but they had lower performance in the short term and then improved performance in the long term.  These results support a fashion explanation for the middle phase diffusion of IT innovations, illustrating that following fashion can legitimize organizations and their  leaders regardless of performance improvement.  The findings also extend institutional theory from its usual focus on taken-for-granted practices to fashion as a novel source of social approval.  This study suggests that practitioners balance between performance pressure and social approval when they confront whatever is hottest in IT.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Toward Agile:  An Integrated Analysis of Quantitative and Qualitative Field Data</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lee, Gwanhoo</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Xia, Weidong</dc:creator>
<dc:description>As business and technology environments change at an unprecedented rate, software development agility to respond to changing user requirements has become increasingly critical for software development performance.  Agile software development approaches, which emphasize sense-and-respond, self-organization, cross-functional teams, and continuous adaptation, have been adopted by an increasing number of organizations to improve their software development agility.  However, the agile development literature is largely anecdotal and prescriptive, lacking empirical evidence and theoretical foundation to support the principles and practices of agile development.  Little research has empirically examined the software development agility construct in terms of its dimensions, determinants, and effects on software development performance.  As a result, there is a lack of understanding about how organizations can effectively implement an agile development approach.
Using an integrated research approach that combines quantitative and qualitative data analyses, this research opens the black box of agile development by empirically examining the relationships among two dimensions of software development agility (software team response extensiveness and software team response efficiency), two antecedents that can be controlled (team autonomy and team diversity), and three aspects of software development performance (on-time completion, on-budget completion, and software functionality).  Our PLS results of survey responses of 399 software project managers suggest that the relationships among these variables are more complex than what has been perceived by the literature.  The results suggest a tradeoff relationship between response extensiveness and response efficiency.  These two agility dimensions impact software development performance differently:  response efficiency positively affects all of on-time completion, on-budget completion, and software functionality, whereas response extensiveness positively affects only software functionality.  The results also suggest that team autonomy has a positive effect on response efficiency and a negative effect on response extensiveness, and that team diversity has a positive effect on response extensiveness.  We conducted 10 post hoc case studies to qualitatively cross-validate our PLS results and provide rich, additional insights regarding the complex, dynamic interplays between autonomy, diversity, agility, and performance.  The qualitative analysis also provides explanations for both supported and unsupported hypotheses.  We discuss these qualitative analysis results and conclude with the theoretical and practical implications of our research findings for agile development approaches.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Vital Signs for Virtual Teams:  An Empirically Developed Trigger Model for Technology Adaptation Interventions</dc:title>

<dc:creator>Bostrom, Robert P.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study explores how team leaders sense the need for technology adaptation intervention in distributed, computer-mediated (“virtual”) teams.  Analysis and coding of critical incident data collected in interviews of practicing leaders produce a five-trigger model including (1) external constraint, (2) internal constraint, (3) information and communication technology (ICT) inadequacy, (4) ICT knowledge, skills, and abilities inadequacy, and (5) trust and relationship inadequacies.  The resulting five-trigger model provides several key contributions including (1) a diagnostic tool for examining real, multi-trigger team technology adaptation contexts, enabling better leader training and evaluation as well as improved research on team technology adaptation and interventions and (2) a better understanding of the relationship between the technology structure strength indicators in adaptive structuration theory and the need for team technology adaptation intervention.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Formation and Value of IT-Enabled Resources:  Antecedents and Consequences</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Nevo, Saggi</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Wade, Michael R</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper informs the literature on the business value of information technology by conceptualizing a path from IT assets—that is, commodity-like or off-the-shelf information technologies—to sustainable competitive advantage.  This path suggests that IT assets can play a strategic role when they are combined with organizational resources to create IT-enabled resources.  To the extent that relationships between IT assets and organizational resources are synergistic, the ensuing IT-enabled resources are capable of positively affecting firms’ sustainable competitive advantage via their  improved strategic potential.  This is an important contribution since IT-related organizational benefits have been hard to demonstrate despite attempts to study them through a variety of methods and theoretical lenses.  This paper synthesizes systems theory and the resource-based view of the firm to build a unified conceptual model linking IT assets with firm-level benefits.  Several propositions are derived from the model and their implications for IS research and practice are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Job Characteristics and Job Satisfaction:  Understanding the Role of Enterprise Resource</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Morris, Michael G.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Venkatesh, Viswanath</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Little research has examined the impacts of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems implementation on job satisfaction.  Based on a 12-month study of 2,794 employees in a telecommunications firm, we found that ERP system implementation moderated the relationships between three job characteristics (skill variety, autonomy, and feedback) and job satisfaction.  Our findings highlight the key role that ERP system implementation can have in altering well-established relationships in the context of technology-enabled organizational change situations.  This work also extends research on technology diffusion by moving beyond a focus on technology-centric outcomes, such as system use, to understanding broader job outcomes.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>What Makes a Helpful Online Review?  A Study of Customer Reviews on Amazon.com</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mudambi, Susan M.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Schuff, David</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Customer reviews are increasingly available online for a wide range of products and services.  They supplement other information provided by electronic storefronts such as product descriptions, reviews from experts, and personalized advice generated by automated recommendation systems.  While researchers have demonstrated the benefits of the presence of customer reviews to an online retailer, a largely uninvestigated issue is what makes customer reviews helpful to a consumer in the process of making a purchase decision. Drawing on the paradigm of search and experience goods from information economics, we develop and test a model of customer review helpfulness.  An analysis of 1,587 reviews from Amazon.com across six products indicated that review extremity, review depth, and product type affect the perceived helpfulness of the review.  Product type moderates the effect of review extremity on the helpfulness of the review.  For experience goods, reviews with extreme ratings are less helpful than reviews with moderate ratings.  For both product types, review depth has a positive effect on the helpfulness of the review, but the product type moderates the effect of review depth on the helpfulness of the review.  Review depth has a greater positive effect on the helpfulness of the review for search goods than for experience goods.  We discuss the implications of our findings for both theory and practice.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Fashion Waves in Information Systems Research and Practice</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Baskerville, Richard L.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Myers, Michael D.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Building on neo-institutional theory and theories of innovation and diffusion, recent work in the field of management has suggested that management research and practice is characterized by fashions.  A management fashion is a relatively transitory belief that a certain management technique leads rational management progress.  Using bibliographic research, we apply Abrahamson’s management fashion theory to information systems research and practice.  Our findings reveal that information systems research and practice, like management research and practice, is indeed characterized by fashions.  These “IS fashion waves” are relatively transitory and represent a burst of interest in particular topics by IS researchers and practitioners.  However, while our findings show that IS research closely parallels practice, we suggest that a more proactive engagement of IS academics is needed in the IS fashion-setting process.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>How Ethics Can Enhance Organizational Privacy:  Lessons from the ChoicePoint and TJX Data Breaches</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Culnan, Mary J</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Williams, Cynthia  C.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Protecting the privacy of personal information continues to pose significant challenges for organizations.  Because  consumers are vulnerable in their dealings with businesses due to a lack of information about and an inability to control the subsequent use of their personal information, we argue that organizations have a moral responsibility to these individuals to avoid causing harm and to take reasonable precautions toward that end.  We further argue that firms can enhance their privacy programs by moving beyond merely complying with laws and other regulations and creating a culture of  integrity that combines a concern for the law with an emphasis on managerial responsibility for the firm’s organizational privacy behaviors.  We use two high-profile data breaches experienced by two U.S. companies, ChoicePoint and TJX, to illustrate our arguments for enhancing organizational level privacy programs based on ethical reasoning.  In doing so, this paper contributes to the dearth of prior organizational-level privacy research, which has largely overlooked ethical issues or the personal harms often caused by privacy violations.  We conclude with recommendations for ways organizations can improve their privacy programs by incorporating moral responsibility.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Interpretation of Formative Measurement in Information Systems Research</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cenfetelli, Ronald T.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Bassellier, Genevieve</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Within the Information Systems literature, there has been an emerging interest in the use of formative measurement in structural equation modeling (SEM).  This interest is exemplified by descriptions of the nature of formative measurement (e.g., Chin 1998a), and more recently the proper specification of formatively measured constructs (Petter et al. 2007) as well as application of such constructs (e.g., Barki et al. 2007).  Formative measurement is a useful alternative to reflective measurement.  However, there has been little guidance on interpreting the results when formative measures are employed.  Our goal is to provide guidance relevant to the interpretation of formative measurement results through the examination of the following six issues:  multicollinearity; the number of indicators specified for a formatively measured construct; the possible co-occurrence of negative and positive indicator weights; the absolute versus relative contributions made by a formative indicator; nomological network effects; and the possible effects of using partial least squares (PLS) versus covariance-based SEM techniques.  We provide prescriptions for researchers to consider when interpreting the results of formative measures as well as an example to illustrate these prescriptions.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Community Learning in Information Technology Innovation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wang, Ping</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Ramiller, Neil C.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In striving to learn about an information technology innovation, organizations draw on knowledge resources available in the community of diverse interests that convenes around that innovation.  But even as such organizations learn about the innovation, so too does the larger community.  Community learning takes place as its members reflect upon their learning and contribute their experiences, observations, and insights to the community’s on-going discourse on the innovation.  Community learning and organizational learning thus build upon one another in a reciprocal cycle over time, as the stock of interpretations, adoption rationales, implementation strategies, and utilization patterns is expanded and refined.  We advance an overall model of this learning cycle, drawing on two community-level theories (management fashion and organizing vision), both of which complement the dominant emphases of the literature on IT innovation and learning.  Relative to this cycle, we then empirically examine, in particular, the dependence of community learning on organizational learning.  Sampling the public discourse on enterprise resource planning (ERP) over a 14-year period, we explore how different kinds of organizational actors can play different roles, at different times, in contributing different types of knowledge to an innovation’s public discourse.  The evidence suggests that research analysts and technology vendors took leadership early on in articulating the “know-what” (interpretation) and “know-why” (rationales) for ERP, while later on adopters came to dominate the discourse as its focus shifted to the “know-how” (strategies and capabilities).  We conclude by identifying opportunities for further inquiry on and strategic management of community learning and its interactions with organizational learning.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Interfirm Strategic Information Flows in Logistics Supply Chain Relationships</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Klein, Richard</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Rai, Arun</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper focuses on strategic information flows between buyers and suppliers within logistics supply chain relationships and on subsequent relationship-specific performance outcomes.  Our analysis of dyadic data collected from 91 buyer–supplier logistics relationships finds that buyer and supplier strategic information flows positively impact the relationship-specific performance of both sharing and receiving parties.  Specifically, each party gains financially from improved management of assets, reduced costs of operations, and enhanced productivity.  Moreover, each benefits operationally from improved planning, control, and flexibility of resources.  Buyer dependence on the supplier increases buyer strategic information flows to the supplier.  Additionally, buyer IT customization and both buyer and sup plier trusting beliefs in the receiving party positively impact strategic information sharing with partners.  This study suggests that partnerships for supply chain services engage in cooperative initiatives to generate relational rents and are an alternative to conventional “arms length” transactional exchanges.  These partnerships need to be motivated to go beyond the sharing of order-related information (which must occur in transactional exchanges) and to share strategic information (which has the potential for both additional rent generation and risks of misappropriation).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Online auctions enable market-level interactions or interdependency of outcomes, which were not observed in physical auctions.  One such set of interactions takes place when multiple auctions are conducted to sell identical items by an identical seller in an overlapping manner.  This research focuses on overlapping auctions, their interactions, and the related impact on bidder behavior.  We introduce the notion of auction “overlap” and examine the impact of market-level factors such as the price information revealed from prior auctions, degree of overlap, the auction format, and the overall market supply on a given auction’s price.  Despite a competitive setting, we find that, ceteris paribus, English auctions, on average, extract roughly 8.6 percent more revenue per unit than multiunit uniform-price Dutch auctions.  We discover that the overlapping auctions attract institutional bidders, who bid in a participatory manner across multiple auctions, and that such bidders exert a downward pressure on auction prices.  We find that overlap of an auction with other competing auctions has a significant negative influence on prices, and information about following auctions has a stronger negative influence than information about prior closing auctions.  By estimating the expected price difference, we provide practitioners, who have private knowledge of their internal holding costs, a benchmark that can be used in deciding between using overlapping single-unit English auctions and multiunit Dutch auctions.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Selective Status Reporting in Information Systems Projects:  A Dyadic-Level Investigation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Iacovou, Charalambos L.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Thompson, Ronald L.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Smith, H. Jeff</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study investigates selective reporting behaviors that are pursued by project managers when communicating the status of their information system initiatives to their executives.  To understand the types, motivations, impacts, and antecedents of such behaviors, a message-exchange perspective is adopted and the prior literature on IS project status reporting is reviewed.  This study incorporates an empirical investigation that examined the influence of five dyadic factors on selective reporting using a survey of 561 project managers.  The findings of the study reveal a positive effect of reporting quality on project performance and indicate that a specific type of selective reporting behavior (optimistic biasing) has a degrading effect on reporting quality.  Moreover, the findings show that all five antecedents have a significant influence on the propensity of project managers to report selectively.  Specifically, the project executive’s power, the project manager’s trust in the executive, and the executive’s quality of communication impact selective reporting directly; the executive’s familiarity with the IS development process and the executive’s organizational affiliation vis-à-vis that of the project manager have an indirect influence (it is mediated through other factors).  The effects of each of these factors on the two types of selective reporting (optimistic and pessimistic biasing) are examined, and the implications of these findings for both researchers and managers are discussed in this article.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Resolving Difference Score Issues in Information Systems Research</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Klein, Gary</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Jiang, James J.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Cheney, Paul</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A number of models and theories in information systems research include concepts of a match between two variables or states.  The development of measures for this concept can present problems, because decisions must be made about the nature of the comparison.  Should indirect measures of the match be employed, then methodological issues arise about how to best handle the measure when testing the model. Difference scores are commonly used to measure a match between variables or states in IS research, but these have implicit assumptions about the theory and data characteristics that are often false.  Not unexpectedly, false assumptions can lead to erroneous conclusions about the relationships among the variables that are used to determine a match in a research model.  The implicit assumptions restrict the form of the relationships and limit the IS researcher’s ability to understand the possible interplay among theoretical concepts.  We suggest some guidelines for the formation and testing of models that measure the match.  In addition, we recommend polynomial regression analysis as one means of analyzing the more complex relationships in IS studies.  We then use an IS service quality example to illustrate the issues involved in the use of matching variables and make suggestions with regard to using or avoiding difference scores.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Nonlinearities Between Attitude and Subjective Norms in Information Technology Acceptance:  A Negative Synergy?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Titah, Ryad</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Barki, Henri</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Empirical results both from information technology acceptance research as well as from other fields suggest that attitude and subjective norms may have a nonlinear relationship.  Based on the economic theory of complementarities, the present paper hypothesizes a substitution relationship or negative synergy between attitude and subjective norms in organizational IT use contexts.  Employing two methods for modeling and measuring nonlinear effects of latent constructs, as well as two approaches for visualizing and interpreting interaction and quadratic terms, structural equation modeling analysis of data collected from 258 users of a variety of IT applications in 14 organizations provides support for the hypothesis that attitude and subjective norms were substitutes in predicting intention to use.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Minimizing Method Bias Through Programmatic Research</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Burton-Jones, Andrew</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Researchers have long known that research methods influence construct measurements and that this influence, or method bias, can lead to false conclusions.  Despite much work in the methodological literature on specific aspects of method bias, such as common method bias and self-report bias, the meaning of method bias remains unclear, and there is no comprehensive approach for dealing with it.  This paper offers a clear definition of method bias, proposes a more comprehensive approach for dealing with it, and describes a demonstration exercise applying the approach in an empirical study of how individual system use and task performance relate. The demonstration suggests that the approach is feasible and illustrates how it can help researchers test theories and identify new research opportunities.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Building consumer trust is important for new or unknown Internet businesses seeking to extend their customer reach globally.  This study explores the question:  Should website designers take into account the cultural characteristics of prospective customers to increase trust, given that different trust-building web strategies have different cost implications?  In this study, we focused on two theoretically grounded practical web strategies of customer endorsement, which evokes unit grouping, and portal affiliation, which evokes reputation categorization, and compared them across two research sites:  Australia (individualistic culture) and Hong Kong (collectivistic culture).  The results of the laboratory experiment we conducted, on the website of an online bookstore, revealed that the impact of peer customer endorsements on trust perceptions was stronger for subjects in Hong Kong than Australia and that portal (Yahoo) affiliation was effective only in the Australian site.  A follow-up study was conducted as a conceptual replication, and provided additional insights on the effects of customer endorsement versus firm affiliation on trust-building.  Together, these findings highlight the need to consider cultural differences when identifying the mix of web strategies to employ in Internet store websites.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Integrative Framework of Technology Use:  An Extension and Test</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kim, Sung S.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The integrative framework of technology use (IFTU) posits that to fully explain post-adoption phenomena, four mechanisms—namely, reason-oriented action, sequential updating, feedback, and habit—should be taken into account simultaneously in a unified model.  Although IFTU sheds light on the four mechanisms underlying technology use, it lacks a coherent theoretical explanation for the underlying force that leads to the four mechanisms.  To offer a more generalized and richer description of the four mechanisms, this study extends IFTU by drawing on the process model of memory in cognitive psychology.  In addition, based on the extended IFTU paradigm, a three-wave panel model is developed that incorporates not only proximal effects but also distal effects of the four mechanisms on post-adoption phenomena.  Three different sets of data (n = 195, 160, and 342, respectively) are used to test the proposed model.  The results of data analysis show that, as expected, the four mechanisms have proximal effects on subsequent evaluations and behavior.  Furthermore, consistent with the memory perspective, the sequential updating and habit mechanisms are found to have distal effects on post-adoption phenomena even after controlling for their proximal effects.  Overall, the findings of this study indicate that the memory perspective offers not only a seamless explanation of the four mechanisms underlying technology use but also yields deeper insights that can be validated only through a three-or-more-wave panel study.  This research contributes to the literature by demonstrating that the extended IFTU paradigm has the potential to serve as a coherent theoretical framework on post-adoption phenomena in which prior experiences are internalized into memories, which in turn regulate later experiences.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Effective visual design of e-commerce websites enhances website aesthetics and emotional appeal for the user.  To gain insight into how Internet users perceive human images as one element of website design, a controlled experiment was conducted using a questionnaire, interviews, and eye-tracking methodology.  Three conditions of human images were created including human images with facial features, human images without facial features, and a control condition with no human images.  It was expected that human images with facial features would induce a user to perceive the website as more appealing, having warmth or social presence, and as more trustworthy.  In turn, higher levels of image appeal and perceived social presence were predicted to result in trust.  All expected relationships in the model were supported except no direct relationship was found between the human image conditions and trust.  Additional analyses revealed subtle differences in the perception of human images across cultures (Canada, Germany, and Japan).  While the general impact of human images seems universal across country groups, based on interview data four concepts emerged—aesthetics, symbolism, affective property, and functional property—with participants from each culture focusing on different concepts as applied to website design.  Implications for research and practice are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Investigating User Resistance to Information Systems Implementation:  A Status Quo Bias Perspective</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kim, Hee-Woong</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Kankanhalli, Atreyi</dc:creator>
<dc:description>User resistance to information systems implementation has been identified as a salient reason for the failure of new systems and hence needs to be understood and managed.  While previous research has explored the reasons for user resistance, there are gaps in our understanding of how users evaluate change related to a new information system and decide to resist it.  In particular, missing in the explanation of user decision making is the concept of status quo bias, that is, that user resistance can be due to the bias or preference to stay with the current situation.  Motivated thus, this study develops a model to explain user resistance prior to a new IS implementation by integrating the technology acceptance and resistance literatures with the status quo bias perspective.  The results of testing the model in the context of a new enterprise system implementation indicate the central role of switching costs in increasing user resistance.  Further, switching costs also mediate the relationship between other antecedents (colleague opinion and self-efficacy for change) and user resistance.  Additionally, perceived value and organizational support for change are found to reduce user resistance.  This research advances the theoretical understanding of user acceptance and resistance prior to a new IS implementation and offers organizations suggestions for managing such resistance.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Evolution of Risk in Information Systems Offshoring:  The Impact of Home Country Risk, Firm Learning, and Competitive Dynamics</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hahn, Eugene D</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Doh, Jonathan</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Bunyaratavej, Kraiwinee</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Information systems offshoring has emerged as a significant force in the global political economy, an important source of firm-specific competitive advantage, and a focal point for debates over the benefits and costs of globalization.  As worldwide competition exerts increasing pressure on the IS function of firms to become geographically unbundled, and IS services are dispersed among increasingly distant and unfamiliar locations, the issue of risk emerges as a significant factor in decisions about where to locate offshore facilities.  Drawing from prior research in IS outsourcing/offshoring and theoretical perspectives from international strategy and multinational management, we examine the determinants of risk firms bear in their offshoring decisions.  In particular, the current paper explores firm-level and environment-level “push” factors that drive firms to accept increasingly greater degrees of host country risk.  We predict that firm-level risk outcomes for locating IS offshore facilities will be influenced by prior firm-specific experience, the relative gap between home and host country risk levels, and the overall movement by IS offshore services providers toward increasingly riskier locations. We test these hypotheses on a proprietary data set of more than 850 information technology and software offshoring projects in 55 host countries worldwide during the period 2000 through 2005.  We find that firm-specific experience and the core “risk gap” between home and host country are predictive of companies pursuing progressively riskier locations, but that their effects dissipate as environment-wide experience is incorporated into our model.  Our analysis suggests that broader dynamics in the competitive environment are powerful contributors to the overall observation that IS offshoring is moving to increasingly high-risk locations.  This trend has implications for the management, security, and global integration of information systems.  Our study contributes to the literature on risk and IS offshoring in providing the first worldwide empirical examination of the determinants of actual firm IS offshoring behavior with respect to offshoring location risk.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Why Break the Habit of a Lifetime?  Rethinking the Roles of Intention, Habit, and Emotion in Continuing Information Technology Use</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ortiz de Guinea, Ana</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Markus, M. Lynne</dc:creator>
<dc:description>One of the most welcome recent developments in Information Systems scholarship has been the growing interest in individuals’ continuing use of information technology well after initial adoption, known in the literature as IT usage, IT continuance, and post-adoptive IT usage.  In this essay, we explore the theoretical underpinnings of IS research on continuing IT use.  Although the IS literature on continuing IT use emphasizes the role of habitual behavior that does not require conscious behavioral intention, it does so in a way that largely remains faithful to the theoretical tradition of planned behavior and reasoned action.  However, a close reading of reference literatures on automatic behavior (behavior that is not consciously controlled) and the influences of emotion on behavior suggests that planned behavior and reasoned action may not provide the best theoretical foundation for the study of continuing IT use.  As a result, we call for empirical research that directly compares and contrasts the consensus theory of continuing IT use with rival theories that place much greater emphasis on unplanned and unreasoned action.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Offshore Information Systems Project Success:  The Role of Social Embeddedness and Cultural Characteristics</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rai, Arun</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Maruping, Likoebe M.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Venkatesh, Viswanath</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Agency theory has served as a key basis for identifying drivers of offshore information system project success.  Consequently, the role of relational factors in driving project success has been overlooked in this literature.  In this paper, we address this gap by integrating the social embeddedness perspective and the culture literature to theorize how and why relational factors affect the success of offshore IS projects that are strategic in nature.  We identify organizational and interpersonal cultural differences as critical success factors in this context.  Using data from a longitudinal field study of 155 offshore IS projects managed by 22 project leaders, we found evidence of a relationship between hypothesized relational factors and two measures of offshore IS project success—namely, project cost overruns and client satisfaction—over and above the effects of project characteristics and agency factors.  Specifically, we found that information exchange, joint problem solving, and trust reduce project cost overruns and improve client satisfaction.  We also found a relationship between cultural differences at the organizational and team level, and offshore IS project success.  The model explained 40 percent and 41 percent of the variance in project cost overruns and client satisfaction, respectively, for projects with a client representative.  For projects with no client representative, the model explained 35 percent and 37 percent of the variance in project cost overruns and client satisfaction, respectively.  Collectively, the results have important theoretical and practical implications for how client– vendor relationships should be managed when partnering with offshore firms and designing offshore IS project teams.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Whom Are We Informing?  Issues and Recommendations for MIS Research from an Informing Science Perspective</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gill, Grandon</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Bhattacherjee, Anol</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper provides an introspective assessment of the current state of management information systems as a research discipline using the “lens” of the informing sciences.  Based on this assessment, we observe that the degree to which MIS research is informing its key external clients— practitioners, students, and researchers in other disciplines— has declined over the years.  This problem is particularly acute with respect to informing practitioners.  Unfortunately, practitioner support may be critical in making up for lost resources caused by declining student enrollments.  Despite this dire prognostication, we believe that it is possible to reverse this trend.  Drawing upon cognitive science and diffusion of innovations research, we analyze the source of the problem and then present five recommendations aimed at leading MIS journals, scholars, and professional societies for improving the ability of MIS research to engage and inform its external clients.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Scientific Basis for Rigor in Information Systems Research</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lee, Allen S.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Hubona, Geoffrey S.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Qualitative research is just as able as quantitative research to follow certain fundamental principles of logic in general and scientific reasoning in particular.  Two such principles are the logic of modus ponens and the logic of modus tollens. In this essay, we frame different research approaches—positivist research, interpretive research, action research, and design research—in the forms of modus ponens and modus tollens.  Three issues emerge from this framing and call into question how research is now conducted in the discipline of information systems.  They are the issue of a common scientific basis, the issue of the fallacy of affirming the consequent, and the issue of summative validity.  Both rigor and relevance in information systems research may be better achieved by attending to the three issues.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Internet Exchanges for Used Goods:  An Empirical Analysis of Trade Patterns and Adverse Selection</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ghose, Anindya</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In the past few years, we have witnessed the increasing ubiquity of user-generated content on seller reputation and product condition in Internet-based used-good markets. Recent theoretical models of trading and sorting in used-good markets provide testable predictions to use to examine the presence of adverse selection and trade patterns in such dynamic markets.  A key aspect of such empirical analyses is to distinguish between product-level uncertainty and seller-level uncertainty, an aspect the extant literature has largely ignored.  Based on a unique, 5-month panel data set of user-generated content on used good quality and seller reputation feedback collected from Amazon, this paper examines trade patterns in online used-good markets across four product categories (PDAs, digital cameras, audio players, and laptops).  Drawing on two different empirical tests and using content analysis to mine the textual feedback of seller reputations, the paper provides evidence that adverse selection continues to exist in online markets.  First, it is shown that after controlling for price and other product, and for seller-related  factors, higher quality goods take a longer time to sell compared to lower quality goods.  Second, this result also holds when the relationship between sellers’ reputation scores and time to sell is examined.  Third, it is shown that price declines are larger for more unreliable products, and that products with higher levels of intrinsic unreliability exhibit a more negative relationship between price decline and volume of used good trade.  Together, our findings suggest that despite the presence of signaling mechanisms such as reputation feedback and product condition disclosures, the information asymmetry problem between buyers and sellers persists in online markets due to both product-based and seller-based information uncertainty.  No consistent evidence of substitution or complementarity effects between product-based and seller-level uncertainty are found.  Implications for research and practice are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Interactive Decision Aids for Consumer Decision Making in E-Commerce:  The Influence of Perceived Strategy Restrictiveness</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wang, Weiquan</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Benbasat, Izak</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper extends the effort–accuracy framework of cognition by taking into account the perceived strategy restrictiveness of decision aids, and tests the extended framework in a context in which online decision aids are used to elicit consumers’ preferences, automate the processing of the preferences, and provide product advice for consumers.  Three types of decision aids with different decision strategy support capabilities (an additive-compensatory based aid, an elimination-based aid, and a hybrid aid supporting both strategies) are compared in terms of users’ perceptions of strategy restrictiveness, advice quality, and cognitive effort.  These comparisons are grounded on the properties of normativeness and complementarity of decision strategies employed by the aids.  A normative strategy takes into account both the users’ attribute preferences and the relative importance of such preferences, and allows for trade-offs among preferences (e.g., additive–compensatory).  Strategy complementarity indicates support for decision rules based on multiple strategies (e.g., both additive–compensatory and elimination strategies).
The experimental results support the validity of the extended effort–accuracy–restrictiveness framework and the effects of strategy normativeness, but not the effects of strategy complementarity.  In addition to the perceptions of cognitive effort and advice quality, perceived strategy restrictiveness exerts a significant influence on consumers’ intentions to use online decision aids.  The additive–compensatory aid is perceived to be less restrictive, of higher quality, and less effortful than the elimination aid, whereas the hybrid aid is not perceived to be any different from the additive–compensatory aid.</dc:description>
