			<dc:title>How Information Technology Strategy and Investments Influence Firm Performance:  Conjecture and Emirical Evidence</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mithas, Sunil</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Rust, Roland T.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, we develop conjectures for understanding how information technology (IT) strategy and IT investments jointly influence profitability and the market value of the firm. We view IT strategy as an expression of the dominant strategic objective that the firm chooses to emphasize, which can be revenue expansion, cost reduction, or a dual emphasis in which both goals are pursued. Using data from more than 300 firms in the United States, we find that at the mean value of IT investments, firms with a dual IT strategic emphasis have a higher market value as measured by Tobin’s Q than firms with a revenue or a cost emphasis, but they have similar levels of profitability. Of greater importance, IT strategic emphasis plays a significant role in moderating the relationship between IT investments and firm performance. Dual-emphasis firms have a stronger IT–Tobin’s Q relationship than revenue-emphasis firms. Dual-emphasis firms also have a stronger IT– profitability relationship than either revenue- or cost-emphasis firms. Overall, these findings imply that, at low levels of IT investment, the firm may need to choose between revenue expansion and cost reduction, but at higher levels of IT investment, dual-emphasis in IT strategy or IT strategic ambidexterity increasingly pays off.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Creation of Social Value:  Can an Online Health Community Reduce Rural-Urban Health Disparities?</dc:title>

<dc:creator>Agarwal, Ritu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The striking growth of online communities in recent years has sparked significant interest in understanding and quantifying benefits of participation. While research has begun to document the economic outcomes associated with online communities, quantifying the social value created in these collectives has been largely overlooked. This study proposes that online health communities create social value by addressing rural–urban health disparities via improved health capabilities. Using a unique data set from a rare disease community, we provide one of the first empirical studies of social value creation. Our quantitative analysis using exponential random graph models reveals patterns of social support exchanged between users and the variations in these patterns based on users’ location. We find that, overall, urban users are net suppliers of social support while rural participants are net recipients, suggesting that technology-mediated online health communities are able to alleviate rural–urban health disparities. This study advances extant understanding of value production in online collectives, and yields implications for policy.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Insider Threats in a Financial Institution:  Analysis of Attack-Proneness of Information Systems Applications</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wang, Jingguo</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Gupta, Manish</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Rao, H. Raghav</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study investigates the risk of insider threats associated with different applications within a financial institution. Extending routine activity theory (RAT) from criminology literature to information systems security, hypotheses regarding how application characteristics, namely value, inertia, visibility, accessibility, and guardians, cause applications to be exposed to insider threats are developed. Routine activity theory is synthesized with survival modeling, specifically a Weibull hazard model, and users’ system access behavior is investigated using seven months of field data from the institution. The inter-arrival times of two successive unauthorized access attempts on an application are employed as the measurement of risk. For a robustness check, the daily number of unauthorized attempts experienced by an application as an alternative measurement of risk are introduced and a zero-inflated Poisson-Gamma model is developed. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is used for model estimations. The results of the study support the empirical application of routine activity theory in understanding insider threats, and provide a picture of how different applications have different levels of exposure to such threats. Theoretical and practical implications for risk management regarding insider threats are discussed. This study is among the first that uses behavioral logs to investigate victimization risk and attack proneness associated with information assets.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Campus Emergency Notification Systems:  An Examination of Factors Affecting Compliance with Alerts</dc:title>

<dc:description>The increasing number of campus-related emergency incidents, in combination with the requirements imposed by the Clery Act, have prompted college campuses to develop emergency notification systems to inform community members of extreme events that may affect them. Merely deploying emergency notification systems on college campuses, however, does not guarantee that these systems will be effective; student compliance plays a very important role in establishing such effectiveness. Immediate compliance with alerts, as opposed to delayed compliance or noncompliance, is a key factor in improving student safety on campuses. This paper investigates the critical antecedents that motivate students to comply immediately with messages from campus emergency notification systems. Drawing on Etzioni’s compliance theory, a model is developed. Using a scenario-based survey method, the model is tested in five types of events—snowstorm, active shooter, building fire, health-related, and robbery—and with more than 800 college students from the Northern region of the United States. The results from this study suggest that subjective norm and information quality trust are, in general, the most important factors that promote immediate compliance. This research contributes to the literature on compliance, emergency notification systems, and emergency response policies.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Disaster Experience and Hospital Information Systems:  An Examination of Perceived Information Assurance, Risk, Resilience, and HIS Usefulness</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Park, Insu</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Sharman, Raj</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Rao, H. Raghav</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper examines how an individual’s disaster experience affects his or her perceptions of sociotechnical safety factors (risk, information assurance, resilience) and perceived usefulness of hospital information systems (HIS). This paper consists of two studies focusing on different aspects: a quasi-field experiment conducted with employees in three hospitals affected by a severe snowstorm (labeled a federal disaster) (N = 103), where we compare the perceptual factors in the context of the disaster experience (with versus without recall), and a comparative study between a first sample group (with disaster experience) and a second, contrast sample group (with no disaster experience) of hospital employees (N= 179) from two similar hospitals. The results show that the disaster experience changes the relationships among the perceptual factors that affect perceived usefulness. Individuals tend to perceive negative factors (such as risk) as having greater effects when they actually have direct experience in a disaster situation than in a normal situation. Positive factors (such as information assurance and resilience) have a lesser impact among individuals who have disaster experience (with versus without recall).</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Designing for Digital Transformation:  Lessons for Information Systems Research from the Study of ICT and Societal Challenges</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Majchrzak, Ann</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Markus, M. Lynne</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Wareham, Jonathan D</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The 14 papers in this special issue discuss the roles of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in a wide range of major societal challenges, including employment, climate, health, and human migration. An overview of the special issue process can be found in the Appendix. A tabular summary of the 14 accepted papers is shown in Table 1.
The importance of the societal challenges addressed in these 14 papers makes this special issue significant and interesting in its own right. However, some readers may believe the special issue has little to offer to them, particularly if they study enterprise technologies in Western corporations. Nothing could be further from the truth.
In this introductory commentary, we discuss four major implications of these papers for any IS research that aims to contribute to the improvement of societal or business conditions. The implications are
• That IS researchers interested in societal or business change should expand their definitions of theory to include theories of the problem and theories of the solution; however, any single paper should only have to work with one of these two alternative theory types.
• That IS researchers interested in societal or business change should explicitly define the ICT artifact in both broad and specific ways, include affordances and constraints provided by the ICT artifact, and explicitly examine the unintended consequences of the ICT artifact.
• That IS researchers interested in societal or business change should consider emergent digital designing as a replacement for organizations.
• That IS researchers interested in societal and business change should couple research findings with public policy and regulation recommendations where relevant.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Duality of Empowerment and Marginalization in Microtask Crowdsourcing:  Giving Voice to the Less Powerful Through Value Sensitive Design</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Deng, Xuefei (Nancy)</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Joshi, K.D.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Galliers, Robert D</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Crowdsourcing (CS) of micro tasks is a relatively new, open source work form enabled by information and communication technologies. While anecdotal evidence of its benefits abounds, our understanding of the phenomenon’s societal consequences remains limited. Drawing on value sensitive design (VSD), we explore microtask CS as perceived by crowd workers, revealing their values as a means of informing the design of CS platforms. Analyzing detailed narratives of 210 crowd workers participating in Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), we uncover a set of nine values they share: access, autonomy, fairness, transparency, communication, security, accountability, making an impact, and dignity. We find that these values are implicated in four crowdsourcing structures: compensation, governance, technology, and microtask. Two contrasting perceptions—empowerment and marginalization—coexist, forming a duality of microtask CS. The study contributes to the CS and VSD literatures, heightens awareness of worker marginalization in microtask CS, and offers guidelines for improving CS practice. Specifically, we offer recommendations regarding the ethical use of crowd workers (including for academic research), and call for improving MTurk platform design for greater worker empowerment.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Are Social Media Emancipatory or Hegemonic?  Societal Effects of Mass Media Digitization in the Case of the SOPA Discourse</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Miranda, Shaila M.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Young, Amber</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Yetgin, Emre</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Mass media digitization is an unfolding phenomenon, posing novel societal opportunities and challenges that researchers are beginning to note. We build on and extend MIS research on process digitization and digital versus traditional communication media to study how and to what extent social media—one form of digital mass media—are emancipatory (i.e., permitting wide-spread participation in public discourse and surfacing of diverse perspectives) versus hegemonic (i.e., contributing to ideological control by a few). While a pressing concern to activists and scholars, systematic study of this issue has been elusive, owing partially to the complexity of the emancipation and hegemony concepts. Using a case study approach, we iteratively engaged with data on the discourse surrounding the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and source literature to identify six facets of interpretive media packages (i.e., competing social constructions of an issue) as measurable constructs pertinent to emancipation and hegemony. These facets included three structural constraints (on authorship, citation, and influence) and three content restrictions (on frames, signatures, and emotion). We investigated propositions regarding effects of social versus traditional media and lean versus rich social media on these interpretive media package facets by comparing the SOPA discourse across two lean traditional and social media (newspapers and Twitter) and two rich traditional and social media (television and YouTube). Our findings paradoxically revealed social media to be emancipatory with regard to structural constraints, but hegemonic with regard to an important content restriction (i.e., frames). Lean social media mitigated structural advantages and exacerbated content problems. These findings suggest that, as with traditional media, some inevitable evils accompany the societal benefits of social media and that mass media is having a detrimental effect on public discourse. We offer practical steps by which private and public institutions may counter this effect, theoretical implications for wider consideration of the six interpretive media package facets proposed here, and encouragement to MIS researchers to increase their efforts to compare different digitized processes so that a more comprehensive theory of the effects of different forms of digitized processes can be developed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Digital Action Repertories and Transforming a Social Movement Organization</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Selander, Lisen</dc:creator>

<dc:description>An emerging research agenda focuses on social media’s influence on political activism. Specific attention has recently been paid to digital social movement organizing and action repertoire development. The literature acknowledges the changing face of activism at the movement level, but little is known about the relationship between social movement organizations (SMOs) and digital action repertoires. Understanding this relationship is critical because strong adherence to values is at the heart of establishing action repertoires with legitimacy and persistence. In this paper, we rely on a two-year longitudinal study of the Swedish affiliate of Amnesty International. We examine the transformation in engagement and interaction that followed the organization’s introduction of new action repertoires. Drawing on resource mobilization theory and the collective action space model, we elaborate how new action repertoires both stabilized and challenged the values of the SMO, as well as gradually broadened the interactions of supporters and deepened their modes of engagement. We offer a value-based model on the antecedents and effects of new action repertoires from the SMO perspective. The empirical findings and the model build new theory on social media and digital activism at the organizational level, complementing the predominant movement level research in the extant literature.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Combating Infant Mortality in Rural India:  Evidence from a Field Study of eHealth Kiosk Implementations</dc:title>

<dc:description>The United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals listed high infant mortality rates as a major problem in developing countries, especially in rural areas. Given the powerful information dissemination capabilities, information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been suggested as interventions to build infant care awareness and to modify healthcare behaviors. We examine how the use of one ICT intervention—specifically, eHealth kiosks disseminating authenticated and accessible medical information—can alleviate the problem of high infant mortality in rural India. We investigate how mothers’ social networks affect their use of eHealth kiosks, seeking professional medical care for their infants and, ultimately, infant mortality. Drawing on the social epidemiology and social networks literatures, we focus on advice and hindrance from both strong and weak ties as the conduit of social influence on mothers’ health-related behaviors for the care of their infants. Over a period of 7 years, we studied 4,620 infants across 10 villages where the eHealth kiosks were implemented along with support resources for proxy use. The results revealed that (1) eHealth kiosk use promotes seeking professional medical care and reduces infant mortality, (2) mothers are especially vulnerable to hindrance from both strong and weak ties as they choose to maintain the status quo of traditional infant healthcare practices (e.g., reliance on untrained personnel, superstitions, fatalism) in villages, and (3) advice from both strong and weak ties offers the potential to break down misplaced beliefs about infant healthcare practices and to develop literacy on seeking professional medical care. In contrast, in a comparative group of 10 neighboring villages, the reduction in infant mortality was not as pronounced and the effect of professional medical care in reducing infant mortality was lower. Our findings suggest that an ICT intervention can effectively address one of society’s most important problems (i.e., infant mortality) even in parts of the world with limited resources and deep suspicion of technology and change. Overall, we believe such an ICT intervention will complement other investments being made, including the facilitation of use (proxy use) and provision of professional medical facilities to reduce infant mortality.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This research note reports on an empirical investigation of the effect of the Internet on racial hate crimes in the United States from the period 2001–2008. We find evidence that, on average, broadband availability increases racial hate crimes. We also document that the Internet’s impact on these hate crimes is not uniform in that the positive effect is stronger in areas with higher levels of racism, which we identify as those with more segregation and a higher proportion of racially charged search terms, but not significant in areas with lower levels of racism. We analyze in depth whether Internet access will enhance hate group operations but find no support for the idea that this mechanism is driving the result. In contrast, we find that online access is increasing the incidence of racial hate crimes executed by lone wolf perpetrators. Several other mechanisms that could be driving the results are described. Overall, our results shed light on one of the many offline societal challenges from increased online access</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Information and Communication Technology and the Social Inclusion of Refugees</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Andrade, Antonio Diaz</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Doolin, Bill</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The social inclusion of newly resettled refugees is a significant issue confronting both refugees and their host societies. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are increasingly viewed as a useful resource in programs that provide settlement services or promote participation in society. This paper moves beyond the conventional discussion on the digital divide to explore what people are actually able to do and achieve with ICTs. We draw on an analysis of the use of ICTs for particular purposes by more than 50 resettled refugees to develop an explanation of the process by which ICT use contributes to their social inclusion. We propose that ICT constitutes a resource from which a set of five valuable capabilities is derived: to participate in an information society, to communicate effectively, to understand a new society, to be socially connected, and to express a cultural identity. In realizing these capabilities through ICT use, refugees exercise their agency and enhance their well-being in ways that assist them to function effectively in a new society and regain control over their disrupted lives.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The shift toward sustainable electricity systems is one of the grand challenges of the 21st century. Decentralized production from renewable sources, electric mobility, and related advances are at odds with traditional power systems where central, large-scale generation of electricity follows inelastic consumer demand. Information systems innovations can enable new forms of dynamic electricity trading that leverage real-time consumption information and that use price signals to incentivize sustainable consumption behaviors. However, the best designs for these innovations, and the societal implications of different design choices, are largely unclear. We are addressing these challenges through the Power Trading Agent Competition (Power TAC), a competitive gaming platform on which numerous research groups now jointly devise, benchmark, and improve IS-based solutions to the sustainable electricity challenge. Based on the Power TAC community’s results, we give preliminary empirical evidence for the efficacy of competitive gaming platforms, and for the community’s contributions toward resolving the sustainable electricity challenge.</dc:description>

<dc:description>When user needs do not align with system designers’ visions, new technology implementation becomes a complex process as users appropriate the new technology to meet their needs. Prior studies recognize this complexity, but focus on the complex implementation of simple systems in which user groups are well defined and the IT artifact is the primary change. We extend the research lens by examining the implementation of the Brazilian correspondent banking system, a complex system involving multiple actors, system elements, and settings intended to address the social problem of financial exclusion. Our case study comparison of two settings—retail stores and post offices—reveals that actors’ appropriations extended beyond the IT artifact to include technical, role, usage, social, and policy appropriations. The intended users (poor clients in remote and underserved areas) barely interacted with the IT artifact or other system elements; instead, they relied upon remote bankers (correspondents) to appropriate the system on their behalf. Because rewards, incentives, and constraints differed by setting, correspondents’ appropriations differed by setting. We call the resulting mix of appropriations across multiple elements by multiple actors in multiple settings multiplex appropriation. Complex societal challenges often involve multiple users in multiple settings with varied needs and few technology skills; thus, designing systems to meet user requirements may prove impossible. Instead, allowing multiplex appropriation might foster system success because, rather than forcing a global alignment among system elements or trying to ascertain multiple user needs, it allows for multiple local alignments of system elements that fit local settings.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Emergence of Self-Organizing E-Commerce Ecosystems in Remote Villages of China:  A Tale of Digital Empowerment for Rural Development</dc:title>

<dc:description>The emergence of Alibaba’s Taobao (e-commerce) Villages in remote China has challenged the assumption that rural, underserved communities must always be the recipients of aid to stimulate ICT-enabled development. Based on an in-depth case study of two remote villages in China, this research note shows how ICT (e-commerce) can empower a marginalized community, giving rise to a rural e-commerce ecosystem that can aid self-development. We propose the concept of digital empowerment to explicate our findings in the exploration of community-driven development: first, we identify the critical actors of a rural e-commerce ecosystem and how they use ICTs; second, we illustrate how the same ICT can be used for different affordances by the actors in the evolution of a rural e-commerce ecosystem. The paper also presents unintended consequences of rural e-commerce development. We conclude with suggestions on how to make ICT useful for rural development and, in doing this, challenge some of the prevailing theoretical arguments about this process.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Identity Verification and Societal Challenges:  Explaining the Gap Between Service Provision and Development Outcomes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>McGrath, Kathy</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The capability to produce a secure, reliable form of identification on request is taken for granted by many citizens, especially those living in countries with advanced economies. This capability provides numerous development benefits for individuals, from accessing government and business services to establishing their right of residence and employment in a region. Furthermore, nationwide use of reliable means of identification can help to combat crime and illegal immigration. Efforts to introduce identity verification services in Nigeria have been presented by policymakers as an intervention that would lead to a wide range of such development outcomes. However, these benefits are proving difficult to realize. The use of identity smart cards aims to improve the current situation in which most Nigerian citizens do not possess reliable means of identifying themselves by, say, an international passport or driving license. Although IS research is well aware that the provision of a service does not of itself deliver development outcomes, the nature and role of ICT-based services in development is not well understood. Therefore, this research contributes in two ways. First, it directly addresses the relationship between ICTs and development policies and outcomes, with which much IS research engages minimally or not at all. Second, it explains citizens’ suspicion of the intervention in Nigeria and then uses secondary data from more successful cases to address the question of why some countries achieve desired development outcomes from the provision of identity verification services while others do not.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>ICT, Intermediaries, and the Transformation of Gendered Power Structures</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Oreglia, Elisa</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Srinivasan, Janaki</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are believed to hold much potential to empower women, both socially and economically, in low-income and rural communities. In this paper, we focus on rural women who mediate ICT use as telecenter operators in India and as helpers and enablers for family members in rural China. We explore under what circumstances they may be able to renegotiate existing gendered power structures. We argue that acts of reconciling or confronting the different spaces they inhabit can allow intermediaries to remake their own identities and positions in their community.　 This process, rather than the potential associated with ICTs, is where spaces for empowerment often lie.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Does Information and Communication Technology Lead to the Well-Being of Nations?  A Country-Level Empirical Investigation</dc:title>

<dc:description>This paper examines the role of information and communication technology (ICT) in enhancing the well-being of nations. Extending research on the role of ICT in the productivity of nations, we posit that the effects of ICT may not be limited to productivity (e.g., GDP), and we argue that the use of ICT can also improve the well-being of a country by helping citizens to develop their social capital and achieve social equality, enabling access to health-related information and health services, providing education to disadvantaged communities, and facilitating commerce. Using a number of empirical specifications, specifically a fixed-effects model and an instrumental variable approach, our results show that the level of ICT use (number of fixed telephones, Internet, mobile phones) in a country predict a country’s well-being (despite accounting for GDP and several other control variables that also predict a country’s well-being). Furthermore, by using an exploratory method (biclustering) of identifying both country-specific and ICT-specific variables simultaneously, we identify clusters of countries with similar patterns in terms of their use of ICT, and we show that not all countries increase their level of well-being by using ICT in the same manner. Interestingly, we find that less developed countries increase their level of well-being with mobile phones primarily, while more developed countries increase their level of well-being with any ICT system. Contributions and implications for enhancing the well-being of nations with ICT are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>You Can&#39;t Bribe a Computer:  Dealing with the Societal Challege of Corruption Through ICT</dc:title>

<dc:description>Despite the influence of information and communication technologies (ICTs) on enhancing transparency and fairness, there is limited theoretical understanding of how ICT affects corruption. Adopting an institutional perspective, we conceptualize the mechanisms through which e-government influences corruption in a nation. Specifically, we theorize the relationship between e-government and corruption at two levels: (1)　base corruption observed in national institutions (political, legal, and media institutions), and (2)　permeated corruption in the national stakeholder service systems (business and citizen systems). Using panel data from 63 countries over a 4-year period, we test the direct and mediated effects of e-government on corruption in national institutions and stakeholder service systems, respectively. This exploratory study provides preliminary insights into the mechanisms through which corruption manifests in a nation and demonstrates how e-government can be helpful in alleviating it. In addition, the study offers important implications that we believe will be instrumental in stimulating future research on the subject.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Tool for Addressing Construct Identity in Literature Reviews and Meta-Analyses</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Larsen, Kai R.T.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Bong, Chih How</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The problem of detecting whether two behavioral constructs reference the same real-world phenomenon has existed for over 100 years. Discordant naming of constructs is here termed the construct identity fallacy (CIF). We designed and evaluated the construct identity detector (CID), the first tool with large-scale construct identity detection properties and the first tool that does not require respondent data. Through the adaptation and combination of different natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, six designs were created and evaluated against human expert decisions. All six designs were found capable of detecting construct identity, and a design combining two existing algorithms significantly outperformed the other approaches. A set of follow-up studies suggests the tool is valuable as a supplement to expert efforts in literature review and meta-analysis. Beyond design science contributions, this article has important implications related to the taxonomic structure of social and behavioral science constructs, for the jingle and jangle fallacy, the core of the Information Systems nomological network, and the inaccessibility of social and behavioral science knowledge. In sum, CID represents an important, albeit tentative, step toward discipline-wide identification of construct identities.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Electronic Health Records:  How Can IS Researchers Contribute to Transforming Healthcare?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kohli, Rajiv</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Tan, Sharon</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Electronic health records (EHR) facilitate integration of patient health history for planning safe and proper treatment. Combined with data analytics, aggregate-level EHR enable examination and development of effective medicines and therapies for chronic diseases. Although promising efforts to implement EHRs are underway, social and organizational challenges plague EHR development and widespread use. These challenges are due to lingering issues such as privacy, interoperability, and security among key stakeholders (patients, providers, and purveyors). Based upon stakeholders’ needs and the issues, we identify two primary thematic areas—integration and analytics—in which the information systems (IS) discipline can contribute to EHRs. Through the accumulated body of knowledge, IS researchers are well positioned and have the expertise to design, develop, and facilitate the use of EHR in the delivery of healthcare. We identify potential research opportunities in each of the two thematic areas that have the potential to transform the delivery of healthcare. We conclude with a recommendation for IS scholars to collaborate with allied healthcare disciplines in order to advance the use of EHR to improve patient care.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Advertising Versus Brokerage Model for Online Trading Platforms</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chen, Jianqing</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Fan, Ming</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Li, Mingzhi</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The two leading online consumer-to-consumer platforms use very different revenue models: eBay.com in the United States uses a brokerage model in which sellers pay eBay on a transaction basis, whereas Taobao.com in China uses an advertising model in which sellers can use the basic platform service for free and pay Taobao for advertising services to increase their exposure. This paper studies how the chosen revenue model affects the revenue of a platform, buyers’ payoffs, sellers’ payoffs, and social welfare. We find that when little space can be dedicated to advertising under the advertising model, the brokerage model generates more revenue for the platform than the advertising model. When a significant proportion of space is dedicated to advertising under the advertising model, matching probability on a platform plays a critical role in determining which revenue model can generate more revenue: If the matching probability is high, the brokerage model generates more revenue; otherwise, the advertising model generates more revenue. Buyers are always better off under the advertising model because of larger participation by the sellers in the platform’s free service. Sellers are better off under the advertising model in most scenarios. The only exception is when the matching probability is low and the platform dedicates considerable space to advertising. Under these conditions, the sellers with payoffs similar to the marginal advertiser who is indifferent about advertising can be worse off under the advertising model. Finally, the advertising model generates more social welfare than the brokerage model.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Compensatory Interaction Between User Capabilities and Technology Capabilities in Infuencing Task Performance:  An Empirical Analysis in Telemedicine Consultations</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Serrano, Christina</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Karahanna, Elena</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Although technology-enabled task performance has been a long-standing outcome of interest in information systems research, existing studies primarily emphasize characteristics of the technology and task, rather than the user, in shaping performance outcomes. Given that both technology and people have inherent limitations, a worthwhile research pursuit is to examine how one might compensate for the limitations of the other in order to achieve successful task performance. We propose a new conceptualization of user abilities, task-specific user capabilities, and examine their compensatory effects with technology capabilities in shaping performance outcomes within the context of e-consultations (i.e., technology-mediated expert consultations). Specifically, we theorize the user capabilities of presentation (information giving) and elicitation (information seeking) as the task-specific user capabilities in this context. Leveraging the theory of compensatory adaptation, we propose that these user capabilities can overcome the limitations of technology and result in successful task performance outcomes. We employ mixed methods (qualitative field study, survey field study, and a lab experiment) to develop and test our model within the context of telemedicine consultations, a form of e-consultation. Convergent findings across the studies suggest that both user capabilities and technology capabilities are important facilitators of task performance and that these capabilities compensate for each other.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>TV&#39;s Dirty Little Secret:  The Negative Effect of Popular TV on Online Auction Sales</dc:title>

<dc:creator>Hill, Shawndra</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Kim, Ju-Young</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Timing online auctions to attract a large number of prospective buyers is important for sellers. This study examines whether online auction sellers need to account for exogenous effects like TV viewing when timing and predicting their auction results. An ongoing debate questions whether TV viewers can spread their attention across multiple devices while watching TV, for example, by concurrently shopping online or posting on social media. Recent research has focused on understanding cross-media effects; however, little attention has been given to TV viewership’s relationship with a very important economic activity, namely participation in online auctions. 
We examine this potential cross-media effect by analyzing the four-year sales history of a German online auction platform and addressing potential endogeneity problems with an instrumental variable approach. We use three different instrumental variables that have different advantages and disadvantages but can, in sum, be used for triangulation as they lead to the same result. The analyses reveal a significant negative cross-media effect between TV consumption and online auction sales, indicating that TV consumption and online auction sales might compete for the scarce attention of consumers and are thus substitutes for each other rather than complements.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Exploring Bidder Heterogeneity in Multichannel Sequential B2B Auctions</dc:title>

<dc:description>The proliferation of online auctions has attracted significant research interest in understanding real-life bidding behavior. However, most of the empirical work has focused on business-to-consumer (B2C) auctions. A natural question is whether the findings obtained from B2C auctions are applicable to business-to-business (B2B) auctions, which often involve much higher stakes. In this paper, we examine how professional bidders choose their bidding strategies in multichannel, sequential B2B auctions. Using an extensive data set from the world’s largest B2B market for cut flowers, we find a stable taxonomy of bidding behavior and identify five distinctive bidding strategies. In addition, we demonstrate that bidders’ choice of strategies is associated with their demand, budget constraint, and transaction cost. These findings challenge the conventional view that bidders’ bidding strategies will converge as they gain experience. We also analyze the economic impacts of different strategies. Our results provide useful implications for practical design of B2B auctions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The confluence of widely available malleable technology and the &#34;bring your own device&#34; (BYOD) trend creates a new dynamic for information technology innovation in the workplace. Nontechnical users are empowered to adapt pliable technology in the course of normal usage episodes. We develop a theoretical perspective of adaptation behaviors by extending the adaptive structuration theory (AST) to the level of individuals, and present a topology of adaptation behaviors to capture the rich landscape of this emerging phenomenon. Based on this new theoretical perspective, we propose a research model and perform a survey study targeting young professionals to empirically investigate adaptation of malleable IT by users. Our findings reveal the compounding effects of four distinct adaptation behaviors including the insight that task adaptation mediates the effect of technology adaptation on individual performance. This study contributes by providing a theoretical framework for examining adaptation behaviors, extending AST to the level of individuals, and addressing specific criticisms of AST in the information systems literature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>While the information systems scholarly and practice literatures both stress the importance of senior executive engagement with IT management, the recommendations for doing so remain, at best, limited and general. Examining the influence of serious IT-related deficiencies on CEO/CFO turnover within the post-SOX financial reporting context, specific CEO/CFO IT management responsibilities are identified: CEOs are shown to be held accountable for global IT management responsibilities, and CFOs are shown to be held accountable for demand-side IT management responsibilities. Implications for information systems research, management research, and information systems practice are provided.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, we report on a laboratory experiment aimed at investigating factors affecting choice between different versions of a full-length movie. In particular, we are able to pin down the willingness to pay for a legal, rather than pirated, copy and compare it to the impact of such characteristics as picture quality or delay in delivery. We find a modest but highly significant preference for the authorized version. We also find that when the proceeds from legal sales are transferred to a good cause, willingness to pay for the unauthorized copy is reduced. Our method does not seem to suffer from hypothetical bias.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Making of a Good Impression:  Information Hiding in Ad Exchanges</dc:title>

<dc:description>In this paper, we examine information revelation designs and policies in ad exchanges that use a second-price auction mechanism. Two auction designs are studied: one-call and two-call. Under the one-call design, the ad exchange makes one call to all bidders at the beginning of an auction. Under the two-call design, in addition to the call to all bidders at the beginning of the auction, the exchange calls out the winning bidder at the end of the auction; this second call enables the winning bidder to match the right advertiser for the impression. Thus, the two-call design requires a higher level of technical sophistication but offers to the auction site the choice of the timing and the extent of information released to bidders about an impression.
While valuations are private to bidders, there are two possibilities as far as the information available to the ad exchange on these bidder valuations is concerned: One, the ad exchange has no reliable knowledge about bidder valuations. For this situation, we develop simple information revelation policies that do not use any knowledge of the valuations and establish their performance guarantees. Two, the ad exchange has distributional knowledge about bidder valuations. For this situation, we develop an informed heuristic that exploits this information. While the heuristic continues to offer the same performance guarantee as that of the simple policies, we show that its performance on a comprehensive test bed is near-optimal. The welfare implications of the information revelation policy of the ad exchange on other stakeholders of the ecosystem are also analyzed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Control Configuration and Control Enactment in Information Systems Projects:  Review and Expanded Theoretical Framework</dc:title>

<dc:description>The control of information systems (IS) projects is a key activity for deployment of information technology (IT) resources and ultimately for value creation through IT. For the last 20 years, research on IS project control has grown to cover a wide range of aspects and issues, including control modes, amounts, and portfolios, control in internal and outsourced settings, and control antecedents, consequences, and dynamics. There is an important theoretical and practical impetus for this research, since the nature of IS projects creates specific and challenging conditions for control, and since control research in neighboring disciplines often neglects temporary endeavors such as projects.
In this study, we provide a systematic review and synthesis of the literature and develop an expanded theoretical framework for IS project control with supporting conjectures. Our review reveals that existing research primarily studies the contextual antecedents and performance consequences of control modes and amounts, and thus focuses on control portfolio configurations (what). In contrast, prior research largely neglects control enactment, that is, how the controller interacts with the controllee to put the portfolio of controls into practice. Our expanded framework points to the importance of studying control portfolio configurations and control enactment (in terms of control style and control congruence) in combination, in order to better understand IS project control effectiveness. Expanding the toolbox of concepts available to IS researchers, our framework helps resolve existing research gaps and inconsistencies, and opens up new avenues for future research on the control of IS projects.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Revisiting Group-Based Technology Adoption as a Dynamic Process:  The Role of Changing Attitude-Rationale Configurations</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bayerl, Petra Saskia</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Lauche, Kristina</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Astell, Carolyn</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this study, we set out to better understand the dynamics behind group-based technology adoption by investigating the underlying mechanisms of changes in collective adoption decisions over time. Using a longitudinal multi-case study of production teams in the British oil and gas industry, we outline how internally or externally triggered modifications to the constellation of adoption rationales and attitudes toward a focal technology between subgroups caused changes to adoption decisions within a team. The constellations further seemed to impact usage patterns including conflicts about ICT use and the stability of adoption. Based on these observations, we suggest that group-based adoption can be differentiated in qualitatively different technology adoption states (TAS), which emerge as the result of disparate attitude–rationale configurations across subgroups in a user collective. With this reconceptualization of collective adoption as technology adoption states, our study extends current group-based models by providing a new, qualitative lens to view the creation and stability of adoption patterns in complex user groups. With this, our study offers a process view on the (dis)continuance of information systems and provides a basis for practical guidelines on how to deal with problematic adoption situations when actors from multiple (sub)groups are involved.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Participation in Open Knowledge Communities and Job-Hopping:  Evidence from Enterprise Software</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Huang, Peng</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Zhang, Zhongju</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Using longitudinal data of IT professionals’ activities in the SAP Community Network, and the career histories of these professionals obtained from LinkedIn, we investigate the relationship between an individual’s participation in Internet-enabled open knowledge communities and a major event of his/her career development: job-hopping. We measure individual participation in open knowledge communities by two dimensions of related activities: contribution and learning. We provide empirical evidence that contribution to knowledge communities leads to a higher likelihood of job-hopping, yet a greater amount of learning is associated with a higher probability of retention. We argue that the effect of contribution can be attributed to job market signaling and the effect of learning is primarily driven by enhanced job performance and career advancement within the current organization. A series of robustness tests were conducted to address the self-selection bias and to rule out some possible alternative explanations to these mechanisms. Our work contributes to the existing body of literature on networks of practice and provides supporting evidence that participation in these networks indeed leads to career benefits and status advancements. Additionally, our study takes the first step to fill the gap in the current literature on voluntary employee turnover that has so far ignored the impacts of employee participation in external knowledge communities, thus providing both theoretical and practical insights in the area of organizational research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Tree-Based Approach for Addressing Self-Selection in Impact Studies with Big Data</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Yahav, Inbal</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Shmueli, Galit</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Mani, Deepa</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, we introduce a tree-based approach adjusting for observable self-selection bias in intervention studies in management research. In contrast to traditional propensity score (PS) matching methods, including those using classification trees as a subcomponent, our tree-based approach provides a standalone, automated, data-driven methodology that allows for (1)　the examination of nascent interventions whose selection is difficult and costly to theoretically specify a priori, (2)　detection of heterogeneous intervention effects for different pre-intervention profiles, (3)　identification of pre-intervention variables that correlate with the self-selected intervention, and (4)　visual presentation of intervention effects that is easy to discern and understand. As such, the tree-based approach is a useful tool for analyzing observational impact studies as well as for post-analysis of experimental data. The tree-based approach is particularly advantageous in the analyses of big data, or data with large sample sizes and a large number of variables. It outperforms PS in terms of computational time, data loss, and automatic capture of nonlinear relationships and heterogeneous interventions. It also requires less user specification and choices than PS, reducing potential data dredging. We discuss the performance of our method in the context of such big data and present results for very large simulated samples with many variables. We illustrate the method and the insights it yields in the context of three impact studies with different study designs: reanalysis of a field study on the effect of training on earnings, analysis of the impact of an electronic governance service in India based on a quasi-experiment, and performance comparison of contract pricing mechanisms and durations in IT outsourcing using observational data.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper proposes an audience selection framework for online brand advertising based on user activities on social media platforms. It is one of the first studies to our knowledge that develops and analyzes implicit brand–brand networks for online brand advertising. This paper makes several contributions. We first extract and analyze implicit weighted brand–brand networks, representing interactions among users and brands, from a large dataset. We examine network properties and community structures and propose a framework combining text and network analyses to find target audiences. As a part of this framework, we develop a hierarchical community detection algorithm to identify a set of brands that are closely related to a specific brand. This latter brand is referred to as the &#34;focal brand.&#34; We also develop a global ranking algorithm to calculate brand influence and select influential brands from this set of closely related brands. This is then combined with sentiment analysis to identify target users from these selected brands. To process large-scale datasets and networks, we implement several MapReduce-based algorithms. Finally, we design a novel evaluation technique to test the effectiveness of our targeting framework. Experiments conducted with Facebook data show that our framework provides significant performance improvements in identifying target audiences for focal brands.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Organizations increasingly have access to massive, fine-grained data on consumer behavior. Despite the hype over &#34;big data,&#34; and the success of predictive analytics, only a few organizations have incorporated such fine-grained data in a non-aggregated manner into their predictive analytics. This paper examines the use of massive, fine-grained data on consumer behavior—specifically payments to a very large set of particular merchants—to improve predictive models for targeted marketing. The paper details how using this different sort of data can substantially improve predictive performance, even in an application for which predictive analytics has been applied for years. One of the most striking results has important implications for managers considering the value of big data. Using a real-life data set of 21 million transactions by 1.2 million customers, as well as 289 other variables describing these customers, the results show that there is no appreciable improvement from moving to big data when using traditional structured data. However, in contrast, when using fine-grained behavior data, there continues to be substantial value to increasing the data size across the entire range of the analyses. This suggests that larger firms may have substantially more valuable data assets than smaller firms, when using their transaction data for targeted marketing.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Toward a Digital Attribution Model:  Measuring the Impact of Display Advertising on Online Consumer Behavior</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ghose, Anindya</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Todri-Adamopoulos, Vilma</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The increasing availability of individual-level data has raised the standards for measurability and accountability in digital advertising. Using a massive individual-level data set, our paper captures the effectiveness of display advertising across a wide range of consumer behaviors. Two unique features of our data set that distinguish this paper from prior work are (1)　the information on the actual viewability of impressions as on average 55% of the display ads are not rendered viewable and (2)　the duration of exposure to the display advertisements, both at the individual-user level. Employing a quasi-experiment enabled by our setting, we use difference-in-differences and corresponding matching methods as well as instrumental variable techniques to control for unobservable and observable confounders. We empirically demonstrate that mere exposure to display advertising increases users’ propensity to search for the brand and the corresponding product; consumers engage both in active search exerting effort to gather information, and in passive search using information sources that arrive exogenously. We also find statistically and economically significant effects of display advertising on increasing consumers’ propensity to make a purchase. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the longer the duration of exposure to display advertising, the more likely the consumers are to engage in direct search behaviors (e.g., direct visits) rather than indirect ones (e.g., search engine inquiries). We also study the effects of various types of display advertising (e.g., prospecting, retargeting, affiliate targeting, video advertising, etc.) and the different goals they achieve. Our framework for evaluating display advertising effectiveness constitutes a stepping stone toward causally addressing the digital attribution problem.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Park, Insu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Marketing resource allocation has been a topic of intense scrutiny, yet the literature on the topic has not paid adequate attention to the fact that the effectiveness of marketing-mix elements varies over time. Despite the fact that firms collect volumes of data on their customers, existing estimation approaches do not readily lend themselves to modeling the temporal variations for big data and provide little guidance to managers in terms of their resource allocation decisions. We address this gap and argue that marketing-mix effectiveness varies with the evolution of the consumer–brand relationship and explicitly model these temporal variations using a time-varying effects model (TVEM) that accounts for self-selection of customers into receiving marketing communications and endogeneity of the number of such communications. The proposed TVEM framework handles the complexities associated with big data analytics and provides novel insights for data-driven decision making. We combine transaction data from a Fortune 500 retailer with demographic information obtained from Acxiom Corp for over a quarter million customers to test our framework. The results provide strong support for our proposed framework. Specifically, we find that the influence of marketing mailers, other transaction characteristics (coupon redemption, returns, and cross-buy), and demographic factors (age, income, household size, and interests) on sales varies significantly over the customer life cycle and ignoring such temporal variations can lead to gross misallocation of marketing investments. Specifically, our results suggest that firms can increase their revenues by over 17 percent by just reallocating their resources based on the proposed framework. To facilitate</dc:description>

<dc:description>Big data generated by crowds provides a myriad of opportunities for monitoring and modeling people’s intentions, preferences, and opinions. A crucial step in analyzing such big data is selecting the relevant part of the data that should be provided as input to the modeling process. In this paper, we offer a novel, structured, crowd-based method to address the data selection problem in a widely used and challenging context: selecting search trend data. We label the method &#34;crowd-squared,&#34; as it leverages crowds to identify the most relevant terms in search volume data that were generated by a larger crowd. We empirically test this method in two domains and find that our method yields predictions that are equivalent or superior to those obtained in previous studies (using alternative data selection methods) and to predictions obtained using various benchmark data selection methods. These results emphasize the importance of a structured data selection method in the prediction process, and demonstrate the utility of the crowd-squared approach for addressing this problem in the context of prediction using search trend data.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Privacy and Big Data:  Scalable Approaches to Sanitize Large Transactional Databases for Sharing</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Menon, Syam</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Sarkar, Sumit</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Scalability and privacy form two critical dimensions that will eventually determine the extent of the success of big data analytics. We present scalable approaches to address privacy concerns when sharing transactional databases. Although the benefits of sharing are well documented and the number of firms sharing transactional data has increased over the years, the rate at which this number has grown is not quite what it could have been. Concerns about revealing proprietary information have prevented some retailers from sharing, despite the obvious advantages in an increasingly networked economy. In the context of sharing transactional data, sensitive information is typically based on relationships derived from frequently occurring itemsets, result of surprisingly successful promotions by the retailer, or unexpected relationships identified by the retailer while mining the data. Prior work in this area includes optimal approaches based on integer programming to maximize the accuracy of shared databases, while hiding all sensitive itemsets. While these approaches were shown to solve problems involving up to 10 million transactions, many transactional databases in the big data context are considerably larger and the existing integer programming-based procedures do not scale well enough to solve these larger problems. Consequently, there is no effective solution procedure for such databases in extant literature.
In this paper, we first present an optimal procedure leveraging intuition from linear programming based column generation. Next, we identify a common structure that exists in these problems, and show how it can be taken advantage of through an approach based on sorting and column generation to make the process more efficient. We then illustrate how this structure can be incorporated into the column generation based procedure to develop an effective, scalable heuristic. Computational experiments are conducted on databases with 50 million and 100 million transactions, involving problems that could not be solved using existing optimal procedures. These experiments show that the optimal column generation based procedure can solve problem instances significantly larger than those tackled previously, and that the scalable heuristic identifies near-optimal solutions quickly in all instances where the optimal solution is known. We investigate the impact of hiding sensitive itemsets on the quality of a rule-based recommender system derived from the shared data. As expected, recommendation quality decreases as the number of sensitive itemsets increases; however, recommendation accuracy stays above 80% of the original rate when using the unmodified data even when there are 1,000 sensitive itemsets to hide. The effect on recommendation accuracy from using the heuristic relative to the optimal approach was very small: the accuracies with the heuristic were over 97% of the corresponding accuracies with the optimal approach in every experiment, and over 99% in the vast majority.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The number of mobile apps launched in the market has exponentially grown to more than 2 million, but little is known about how users choose and consume apps of numerous categories. This study develops a utility theory-based structural model for mobile app analytics. We use the theoretical concepts of utility and satiation along with the factor analytic approach, as bases in simultaneously modeling the complex relationships among choice, consumption, and utility maximization for consumers of various mobile apps. Using a unique panel dataset detailing individual user-level mobile app time consumption, we quantify the baseline utility and satiation levels of diverse mobile apps and delineate how app preferences and consumption patterns vary across demographic groups affected by persistent use and time trends. The findings suggest that users’ baseline utility substantially diverges across app categories and that their demographic characteristics and habit formation explain the appreciable heterogeneity in baseline utility and satiation. These parameters also exhibit positive and negative correlations in mobile websites and app categories. Our modeling approaches and computational methods can unlock new perspectives and opportunities for handling large-scale, micro-level data, while serving as important resources for big data analytics and mobile app analytics.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Predictive modeling approaches in business process management provide a way to streamline operational business processes. For instance, they can warn decision makers about undesirable events that are likely to happen in the future, giving the decision maker an opportunity to intervene. The topic is gaining momentum in process mining, a field of research that has traditionally developed tools to discover business process models from data sets of past process behavior. Predictive modeling techniques are built on top of process-discovery algorithms. As these algorithms describe business process behavior using models of formal languages (e.g., Petri nets), strong language biases are necessary in order to generate models with the limited amounts of data included in the data set. Naturally, corresponding predictive modeling techniques reflect these biases. Based on theory from grammatical inference, a field of research that is concerned with inducing language models, we design a new predictive modeling technique based on weaker biases. Fitting a probabilistic model to a data set of past behavior makes it possible to predict how currently running process instances will behave in the future. To clarify how this technique works and to facilitate its adoption, we also design a way to visualize the probabilistic models. We assess the effectiveness of the technique in an experimental evaluation with synthetic and real-world data.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this article, we propose a new data-analytic approach to measure firms’ dyadic business proximity. Specifically, our method analyzes the unstructured texts that describe firms’ businesses using the statistical learning technique of topic modeling, and constructs a novel business proximity measure based on the output. When compared with existent methods, our approach is scalable for large datasets and provides finer granularity on quantifying firms’ positions in the spaces of product, market, and technology. We then validate our business proximity measure in the context of industry intelligence and show the measure’s effectiveness in an empirical application of analyzing mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. high technology industry. Based on the research, we also build a cloud-based information system to facilitate competitive intelligence on the high technology industry.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Competitive Benchmarking:  An IS Research Approach to Address Wicked Problems with Big Data and Analytics</dc:title>

<dc:description>Wicked problems like sustainable energy and financial market stability are societal challenges that arise from complex sociotechnical systems in which numerous social, economic, political, and technical factors interact. Understanding and mitigating these problems requires research methods that scale beyond the traditional areas of inquiry of information systems (IS) individuals, organizations, and markets and that deliver solutions in addition to insights. We describe an approach to address these challenges through competitive benchmarking (CB), a novel research method that helps interdisciplinary research communities tackle complex challenges of societal scale by using different types of data from a variety of sources such as usage data from customers, production patterns from producers, public policy and regulatory constraints, etc. for a given instantiation. Further, the CB platform generates data that can be used to improve operational strategies and judge the effectiveness of regulatory regimes and policies. We describe our experience applying CB to the sustainable energy challenge in the Power Trading Agent Competition (Power TAC) in which more than a dozen research groups from around the world jointly devise, benchmark, and improve IS-based solutions.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Evolution of an ICT Platform-Enabled Ecosystem for Poverty Alleviation:  The Case of eKutir</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jha, Srivardhini K.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Pinsonneault, Alain</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Dube, Laurette</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper analyzes the pioneering work of eKutir, a social business in India that leverages an information and communication technology (ICT) platform to progressively build a self-sustaining ecosystem to address multiple facets of smallholder farmer poverty. The study reveals that eKutir’s ecosystem has evolved through five distinct phases, each expanding the number and type of actors engaged and the breadth of ICT-supported services provided. The evolution displays a distinct pattern where the five elements of the ecosystem progressively evolve and reinforce one another to create a system that is economically sustainable, scalable, and can accelerate transformative change. The study has important implications for the design of emergent ICT platforms, which can enable an ecosystem-based approach to address complex problems.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Estimating the Effect of Common Method Variance:  The Method-Method Pair Technique with an Illustration from TAM Research</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sharma, Rajeev</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Yetton, Philip</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Crawford, Jeff</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper presents a meta-analysis-based technique to estimate the effect of common method variance on the validity of individual theories.  The technique explains between-study variance in observed correlations as a function of the susceptibility to common method variance of the methods employed in individual studies.  The technique extends to mono-method studies the concept of method variability underpinning the classic multitrait–multimethod technique.  The application of the technique is demonstrated by analyzing the effect of common method variance on the observed correlations between perceived usefulness and usage in the technology acceptance model literature.  Implications of the technique and the findings for future research are discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Emotion can influence important user behaviors, including purchasing decisions, technology use, and customer loyalty. The ability to easily assess users’ emotion during live system use therefore has practical significance for the design and improvement of information systems. In this paper, we discuss using human–computer interaction input devices to infer emotion. Specifically, we utilize attentional control theory to explain how movement captured via a computer mouse (i.e., mouse cursor movements) can be a real-time indicator of negative emotion. We report three studies. In Study 1, an experiment with 65 participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, we randomly manipulated negative emotion and then monitored participants’ mouse cursor movements as they completed a number-ordering task. We found that negative emotion increases the distance and reduces the speed of mouse cursor movements during the task. In Study 2, an experiment with 126 participants from a U.S. university, we randomly manipulated negative emotion and then monitored participants’ mouse cursor movements while they interacted with a mock e-commerce site. We found that mouse cursor distance and speed can be used to infer the presence of negative emotion with an overall accuracy rate of 81.7 percent. In Study 3, an observational study with 80 participants from universities in Germany and Hong Kong, we monitored mouse cursor movements while participants interacted with an online product configurator. Participants reported their level of emotion after each step in the configuration process. We found that mouse cursor distance and speed can be used to infer the level of negative emotion with an out-of-sample R2 of 0.17. The results enable researchers to assess negative emotional reactions during live system use, examine emotional reactions with more temporal precision, conduct multimethod emotion research, and create more unobtrusive affective and adaptive systems.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Is Voluntary Profiling Welfare Enhancing?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Koh, Byungwan</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Raghunathan, Srinivasan</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Nault, Barrie R.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Although consumer profiling advocates tout benefits from personalization, consumer advocacy groups oppose profiling in online markets because of concerns about privacy and price discrimination. Policies such as opt-out or opt-in that provide consumers the option to voluntarily participate in profiling are the favored compromise. We compare voluntary profiling to no profiling and show that voluntary profiling leads to some counterintuitive results. Consumers that do not participate in profiling and some that participate are worse off under voluntary profiling. Neither social welfare nor aggregate consumer surplus is necessarily higher under voluntary profiling; even when voluntary profiling leads to an increase in social welfare, it may come at the expense of consumer surplus. If the seller cannot price discriminate and charge only a uniform price for everyone or the seller can only charge different prices based on the consumer’s participation status, then aggregate consumer surplus under voluntary profiling is higher and a reduction in privacy cost has a positive impact on all consumers as well as the seller. However, when personalized pricing is possible, reducing privacy cost alone may reduce aggregate consumer surplus. The primary reason for these results is that voluntary profiling allows the seller to identify high valuation consumers that have no incentive to participate and set a higher price for them (compared to no profiling) while simultaneously benefitting from the profile information of low valuation consumers that participate. However, a positive privacy cost mitigates the participation incentives of even low valuation consumers and hence sellers’ ability to engage in price discrimination.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Configural Approach to Coordinating Expertise in Software Development Teams</dc:title>

<dc:creator>Johnson, Steven L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Despite the recognition of how important expertise coordination is to the performance of software development teams, understanding of how expertise is coordinated in practice is limited. We adopt a configural approach to develop a theoretical model of expertise coordination that differentiates between design collaboration and technical collaboration. We propose that neither a strictly centralized, top-down model nor a largely decentralized approach is superior. Our model is tested in a field study of 71 software development teams. We conclude that because design work addresses ill-structured problems with diverse potential solutions, decentralization of design collaboration can lead to greater coordination success and reduced team conflict. Conversely, technical work benefits from centralized collaboration. We find that task knowledge tacitness strengthens these relationships between collaboration configuration and coordination outcomes and that team conflict mediates the relationships. Our findings underline the need to differentiate between technical and design collaboration and point to the importance of certain configurations in reducing team conflict and increasing coordination success in software development teams. This paper opens up new research avenues to explore the collaborative mechanisms underlying knowledge team performance.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Using Forum and Search Data for Sales Prediction of High-Involvement Projects</dc:title>

<dc:description>A large body of research uses data from social media websites to predict offline economic outcomes such as sales. However, recent research also points out that such data may be subject to various limitations and biases that may hurt predictive accuracy. At the same time, a growing body of research shows that a new source of online information, search engine logs, has the potential to predict offline outcomes. We study the relationship between these two important data sources in the context of sales predictions. Focusing on the automotive industry, a classic example of a domain of high-involvement products, we use Google’s comprehensive index of Internet discussion forums, in addition to Google search trend data. We find that adding search trend data to models based on the more commonly used social media data significantly improves predictive accuracy. We also find that predictive models based on inexpensive search trend data provide predictive accuracy that is comparable, at least, to that of social media data-based predictive models. Last, we show that the improvement in accuracy is considerably larger for &#34;value&#34; car brands, while for &#34;premium&#34; car brands the improvement obtained is more moderate.</dc:description>

With the increasing diffusion of smartphones, the potential to serve content to shoppers using auto-ID technologies is starting to receive interest. Using a design science approach, we design and build, theorize about, and compare six shopping assistance artifacts by manipulating the hardware design—barcode scanner versus radio frequency identification (RFID) reader—and content design—product information versus product review versus both. We theorize about how these artifact conditions will compare to a control condition (no shopping assistance artifact available) across three sets of outcomes: technology adoption, security beliefs, and shopping. We tested our propositions in two experiments—wherein the task was varied: general browsing and shopping (n = 227) versus goal-directed shopping (n = 221)—conducted in a retail store laboratory. The RFID reader was most favorably received in terms of technology adoption outcomes and shopping outcomes, although it was most negatively viewed in terms of security beliefs. We also found that the content design conditions (i.e., product information, product reviews, and both) were perceived favorably. In a post hoc analysis, we found a two-way interaction of hardware and content designs such that content fueled by RFID was perceived most favorably in terms of technology adoption and shopping outcomes, whereas it was most negatively viewed in terms of security beliefs. Interestingly, the two-way interaction was most pronounced in the goal-directed shopping condition such that the most positive effects were observed for RFID in combination with both product information and reviews.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We conduct an exploratory study using a customized Facebook application to understand how social ties are linked to an economic measure of trust. We employ the Investment Game, a well-established economic game designed to generate a quantifiable trust measure. We consider the relationship between observed trust and three &#34;revealed preference&#34; tie strength measures: (1)　the degree of interaction between friends on their walls; (2)　embeddedness, a metric related to the number of mutual friends shared; and (3)　being tagged together in a photograph, indicative of a physical-world interaction. We identify latent heterogeneity among our subjects, establishing that for users with a large number of Facebook friends, the only measure associated with trust is whether the dyad was tagged in a photo together. In contrast, for users that are more selective and have fewer Facebook friends, all three aforementioned tie strength measures correlate with trust. Our findings are preliminary evidence that traditional measures of dyadic trust like embeddedness which are used widely in physical-world social networks may not always be effective predictors of digital trust, because not all online social ties are created equal. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that traditional measures of dyadic trust may not always be effective predictors of trust, as not all online social ties are created equal.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Empirical Analysis of Intellectual Property Rights Sharing in Software Development Outsourcing</dc:title>

<dc:creator>Goh, Khim Yong</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Software development outsourcing (SDO) contracts are plagued with ex post opportunism and underinvestment problems. Property rights theory (PRT) argues that appropriate property rights allocation between vendors and clients can reduce opportunism and incentivize relation-specific investments. We conduct an in-depth content analysis of 171 real SDO contracts and empirically examine how project attributes and contract parties’ bargaining power affect the allocation of intellectual property rights (IPR). We find that clients retained more IPR when software development was modularized whereas they shared more IPR with vendors in contracts that incorporated greater use of a vendor’s proprietary software. Greater levels of task complexity were associated with more IPR sharing with vendors. We also find that the responsiveness of IPR to project attributes varied across the different types of intellectual assets. For example, vendors were more likely to obtain redeployment rights of know-how if they were contracted for novel software development projects. However, clients were less likely to cede ownership of data and confidential information embedded in software customization projects. We control for a variety of firm and transaction characteristics and the results we obtain here are robust to concerns of endogeneity bias.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Show Me the Way to Go Home:  An Empirical Investigation of Ride-Sharing and Alcohol Related Motor Vehicle Fatalities</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Greenwood, Brad N.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Wattal, Sunil</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this work, we investigate how the entry of ride-sharing services influences the rate of alcohol related motor vehicle fatalities. While significant debate has surrounded ride-sharing, limited empirical work has been devoted to uncovering the societal benefits of such services (or the mechanisms which drive these benefits). Using a difference in difference approach to exploit a natural experiment, the entry of Uber Black and Uber X into California markets between 2009 and 2014, we find a significant drop in the rate of fatalities after the introduction of Uber X. Further, results suggest that not all services have the same effect, insofar as the effect of the Uber Black car service is intermittent and manifests only in selective locations (i.e., large cities). These results underscore the importance of coupling increased availability with cost savings in order to exploit the public welfare gains offered by the sharing economy. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Zheng, Zhiqiang (Eric)</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Information systems researchers have drawn on the resource-based view (RBV) and dynamic capabilities theory to offer a sharper theoretical lens to study the impact of information technology (IT) enabled capabilities on organizational performance. In this study, we propose a new conceptualization of IT-enabled production capability, based on the ability of a manufacturing plant to use its mix of resource inputs to maximize its process outputs. Our approach extends the literature on firm capability using data envelopment analysis (DEA), a nonparametric approach for estimating relative efficiencies of decision-making units. We tested our models using plant-level data collected from a sample of U.S. plants. Our study makes a key contribution by developing a new methodology to measure IT business value with respect to the role of IT-enabled production capability. We operationalize a new DEA-based measure of capability using the relative efficiency of converting plant inputs into process outputs, a significant departure from extant research that has primarily focused on subjective and absolute measures to conceptualize capability.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Recent studies have documented that the contagion of information and behaviors in social networks is generally quite limited. We examine whether this pattern characterizes exogenous demand shocks diffusing in a product network. To this end, we analyze a unique series of demand shocks induced by mass-media book reviews on the Oprah Winfrey television show and in The New York Times. Our identification strategy is based on a difference-in-differences model estimated using two different groups as control, based on propensity-score-based matching and network proximity to a reviewed book, respectively. Our results show that the diffusion of exogenous demand shocks in the Amazon.com product network is relatively shallow, typically about three edges deep into the network, although the economic impact of this diffusion can often be significant. We link our results to recent findings in the context of diffusion in social networks and discuss managerial implications.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Rapid and pervasive digitization of innovation processes and outcomes has upended extant theories on innovation management by calling into question fundamental assumptions about the definitional boundaries for innovation, agency for innovation, and the relationship between innovation processes and outcomes. There is a critical need for novel theorizing on digital innovation management that does not rely on such assumptions and draws on the rich and rapidly emerging research on digital technologies. We offer suggestions for such theorizing in the form of four new theorizing logics, or elements, that are likely to be valuable in constructing more accurate explanations of innovation processes and outcomes in an increasingly digital world. These logics can open new avenues for researchers to contribute to this important area. Our suggestions in this paper, coupled with the six research notes included in the special issue on digital innovation management, seek to offer a broader foundation for reinventing innovation management research in a digital world.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Embracing Digital Innovation in Incumbent Firms:  How Volvo Cars Managed Competing Concerns</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Svahn, Fredrik</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Mathiassen, Lars</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Lindgren, Rikard</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Past research provides instructive yet incomplete answers as to how incumbent firms can address competing concerns as they embrace digital innovation. In particular, it offers only partial explanations of why different concerns emerge, how they manifest, and how firms can manage them. In response, we present a longitudinal case study of Volvo Cars’connected car initiative. Combining extant literature with insights from the case, we argue that incumbent firms face four competing concerns—capability (existing versus requisite), focus (product versus process), collaboration (internal versus external), and governance (control versus flexibility)—and that these concerns are systemically interrelated. Firms must therefore manage these concerns cohesively by continuously balancing new opportunities and established practices.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Jiang, Xiaoyue</dc:creator>
<dc:description>For a period starting in 2015, Apple, Google, and Microsoft became the most valuable companies in the world. Each was marked by an external developer ecosystem. Anecdotally, at least, developers matter. Using a formal model of code spillovers, we show how a rising number of developers can invert the firm. That is, firms will choose to innovate using open external contracts in preference to closed vertical integration. The locus of value creation moves from inside the firm to outside. Distinct from physical goods, digital goods afford firms the chance to optimize spillovers. Further, firms that pursue high risk innovations with more developers can be more profitable than firms that pursue low risk innovations with fewer developers. More developers give platform firms more chances at success. Our contribution is to show why developers might cause a shift in organizational form and to provide a theory of how platform firms optimize their own intellectual property regimes in order to maximize growth. We use stylized facts from multiple platform firms to illustrate our theory and results</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Leveraging Customer Involvement for Fueling Innovation:  The Role of Relational and Analytical Information Processing Capabilities</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Saldanha, Terence J. V.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Mithas, Sunil</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Krishnan, M. S.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>How do IT-enabled capabilities influence firms’ ability to leverage customer involvement and shape the amount of firm innovation? This study theorizes that effective processing and management of customer information flows requires organizations to possess &#34;relational information processing capability&#34; (RIPC) and &#34;analytical information processing capability&#34; (AIPC). Drawing on and extending the theories of absorptive capacity and complementarities in the context of innovation, we posit that RIPC and AIPC complement product-focused customer involvement (PCI) and information-intensive customer involvement (ICI) practices, respectively, to enhance the amount of firm innovation. To test our hypotheses, we collected archival data from more than 300 large U.S. manufacturing firms and mapped their RIPC and AIPC to specific IT applications.
Consistent with our theorizing, we find that RIPC positively moderates the relationship between PCI and amount of firm innovation and that AIPC positively moderates the relationship between ICI and amount of firm innovation. In further exploratory analysis, we find a positive three-way interaction between AIPC, RIPC, and PCI. Taken together, the results suggest that configurations of IT-enabled capabilities alone are not enough for innovation; instead, firms benefit more when specific configurations of IT-enabled capabilities are leveraged in unison with specific types of customer involvement. The study contributes to theory and practice by shedding light on important complementarities between specific types of customer involvement (PCI and ICI) and specific IT-enabled capabilities (RIPC and AIPC).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Prior information systems research highlights the vital role of information technology (IT) for innovation in firms. At the same time, innovation literature has shown that accessing and integrating knowledge from sources that reside outside the firm, such as customers, competitors, universities, or consultants, is critical to firms’ innovative success. In this paper, we draw on the knowledge-based view of the firm to investigate how search in external knowledge sources and information technology for knowledge absorption jointly influence process innovation performance. Our model is tested on a nine-year panel (2003–2011) of Swiss firms from a wide range of manufacturing industries. Using instrumental variables, and disaggregating by type of IT, we find that data access systems and network connectivity hold very different potential for the effective absorption of external knowledge, and the subsequent realized economic gains from process innovation. Against the backdrop of today’s digital transformation, our findings demonstrate how firms should coordinate strategies for sourcing external knowledge with specific IT investments in order to improve their innovation performance.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Growing on Steroids:  Rapidly Scaling the User Base of Digital Ventures Through Digitl Innovation</dc:title>

<dc:description>Digital ventures, start-ups growing by drawing on and adding to digital infrastructures, can scale their business at an unprecedented pace. We view such rapid scaling as a generative process by which a venture’s user base increases significantly between two points in time through digital innovation. We studied WeCash, a Chinese digital venture, nearly doubling its user base monthly, to learn more about this generative process. We trace three contingent mechanisms underpinning rapid scaling: data-driven operation, instant release, and swift transformation. We explain these mechanisms and how they interact in the rapid scaling of digital ventures. The research offers an agency perspective on scaling of digital ventures that speaks to the digital innovation literature.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Knowledge Reuse for Customization:  Metamodels in an Open Design Community for 3D Printing</dc:title>

<dc:description>Theories of knowledge reuse posit two distinct processes: reuse for replication and reuse for innovation. We identify another distinct process, reuse for customization. Reuse for customization is a process in which designers manipulate the parameters of metamodels to produce models that fulfill their personal needs. We test hypotheses about reuse for customization in Thingiverse, a community of designers that shares files for three-dimensional printing. 3D metamodels are reused more often than the 3D models they generate. The reuse of metamodels is amplified when the metamodels are created by designers with greater community experience. Metamodels make the community’s design knowledge available for reuse for customization—or further extension of the metamodels, a kind of reuse for innovation.</dc:description>
