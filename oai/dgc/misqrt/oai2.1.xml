			<dc:title>Adoption of Electronic Health Records in the Presence of Privacy Concerns:  The Elaboration Likelihood Model and Individual Persuasion</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Angst, Corey M.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Agarwal, Ritu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Within the emerging context of the digitization of health care, electronic health records (EHRs) constitute a significant technological advance in the way medical information is stored, communicated, and processed by the multiple parties involved in health care delivery.  However, in spite of the anticipated value potential of this technology, there is widespread concern that consumer privacy issues may impede its diffusion. In this study, we pose the question:  Can individuals be persuaded to change their attitudes and opt-in behavioral intentions toward EHRs, and allow their medical information to be digitized even in the presence of significant privacy concerns?  To investigate this question, we integrate an individual’s concern for information privacy (CFIP) with the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) to examine attitude change and likelihood of opting-in to an EHR system.  We theorize that issue involvement and argument framing interact to influence attitude change, and that concern for information privacy further moderates the effects of these variables.  We also propose that likelihood of adoption is driven by concern for information privacy and attitude.  We test our predictions using an experiment with 366 subjects where we manipulate the framing of the arguments supporting EHRs.  We find that an individual’s CFIP interacts with argument framing and issue involvement to affect attitudes toward the use of EHRs.  In addition, results suggest that attitude toward EHR use and CFIP directly influence opt-in behavioral intentions.  An important finding for both theory and practice is that even when people have high concerns for privacy, their attitudes can be positively altered with appropriate message framing.  These results as well as other theoretical and practical implications are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Competing with Free:  The Impact of Movie Broadcasts on DVD Sales and Internet Piracy</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Smith, Michael D.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Telang, Rahul</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The creative industries have frequently expressed concern that they can’t compete with freely available copies of their content.  Competing with free is particularly concerning for movie studios, whose content may be more prone to single-use consumption than other industries such as music.  This issue has gained renewed importance recently with the advent of new digital video recording and distribution technologies, and the widespread availability of Internet piracy.
We examine competition between “free” and paid video content in two important contexts:  the impact of legitimate free distribution in one channel on sales through paid channels, and the impact of illegitimate free distribution in pirated channels on sales through paid channels.  We do this by studying the impact of movie broadcasts on DVD demand and the impact of piracy availability at the time of broadcast on DVD demand.  Our data include all movies shown on over-the-air and cable television during an eight-month period in 2005–2006.
With respect to the impact of movie broadcasts on piracy and sales, we find that movie broadcasts on over-the-air networks result in a significant increase in both DVD sales at Amazon. com and illegal downloads for those movies that are available on BitTorrent at the time of broadcast.  With respect to the impact of piracy on sales, we use the television broadcast as an exogenous demand shock and find that the availability of pirated content at the time of broadcast has no effect on post-broadcast DVD sales gains.
Together our results suggest that creative artists can use product differentiation and market segmentation strategies to compete with freely available copies of their content.  Specifically, the post-broadcast increase in DVD sales suggests that giving away content in one channel can stimulate sales in a paid channel if the free content is sufficiently differentiated from its paid counterpart.  Likewise, our finding that the presence of pirated content does not cannibalize sales for the movies in our sample suggests that if free and paid products appeal to separate customer segments, the presence of free products need not harm paid sales.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Model of Acceptance with Peer Support:  A Social Network Perspective to Understand Employees&#39; System Use</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sykes, Tracy Ann</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Venkatesh, Viswanath</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Gosain, Sanjay</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Prior research has extensively studied individual adoption and use of information systems, primarily using beliefs as predictors of behavioral intention to use a system that in turn predicts system use.  We propose a model of acceptance with peer support (MAPS) that integrates prior individual-level research with social networks constructs.   We argue that an individual’s embeddedness in the social network of the organizational unit implementing a new information system can enhance our understanding of technology use.  An individual’s coworkers can be important sources of help in overcoming knowledge barriers constraining use of a complex system, and such interactions with others can determine an employee’s ability to influence eventual system configuration and features.  We incorporate network density (reflecting “get-help” ties for an employee) and network centrality (reflecting “give-help” ties for an employee), drawn from prior social network research, as key predictors of system use.  Further, we conceptualize valued network density and valued network centrality, both of which take into account ties to those with relevant system-related information, knowledge, and resources, and employ them as additional predictors.  We suggest that these constructs together are coping and influencing pathways by which they have an effect on system use.  We conducted a 3-month long study of 87 employees in one business unit in an organization.  The results confirmed our theory that social network constructs can significantly enhance our understanding of system use over and above predictors from prior individual-level adoption research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Meta-Analysis of the Role of Environment-Based Voluntariness in Information Technology Acceptance</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wu, Jiming</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Lederer, Albert</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The technology acceptance model (TAM) asserts that ease of use and usefulness are two primary determinants of behavioral intention and usage. A parallel research stream emphasizes voluntariness, a key social influence and contextual variable, as a critical factor in information technology (IT) adoption, but pays little attention to its role in TAM.  This paper addresses this particular absence by investigating the impact of environment-based voluntariness on the relationships among the four primary TAM constructs. A meta-analysis of 71 empirical studies provides strong support for the hypotheses that environment-based voluntariness moderates the effects of ease of use and usefulness on behavioral intention, but not the effect of ease of use on usefulness. Moreover, inconsistent with our expectations, environment-based voluntariness does not moderate the effects of ease of use and usefulness on usage. By further analyzing the data set, we suggest this may be because of the relatively small sample size, the presence of other factors, or the inappropriate measurement of usage in previous studies. The current study contributes not only to the distinction between user-based and environment-based voluntariness but also to a more complete understanding of user acceptance of IT across system-use environments.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Editor&#39;s Comments:  Turning the Corner:  The Influence of Positive Thinking on the Information Systems Field</dc:title>

<dc:description>There are good times.  And there are bad times.  We see cycles in all human activity and the issue in how to deal with these is not to ignore the realities of the period, but it is equally not to further forces that contribute to vicious downward spirals or to “irrational exuberance” in upward cycles.  What is called for is a realistic, responsible, and virtuous upward movement built by those who see that can then create a way forward.
Frequently at conferences and colloquia we hear our colleagues lament about the dismal state of the Information Systems field.  Often, it is a reaction to trends (e.g., the current IS academic job market) or to a panel session where the question is framed as “Do We Have a Core?” or “How Shall We Deal with the IS Identity Crisis?”  We often see articles that begin with “Nothing at the Center” or “Is IS a discipline?” or “The Slippery Slope of MIS Academia”.  Hearing and seeing such reactions, one might get the impression that there is a general malaise about the discipline. However, despite the reality that there are profound problems that do merit serious attention, we do not believe that couching discourse in a negative affective tone is healthy for ours or for any field.
We wonder what views our colleagues, in their moments of private honesty, hold about the field.  Are they consistent with ours?  We see a still young field that has grown significantly and globally over the years, and one that has established stable institutional structures and core journals that compare favorably to the best in any field (Grover et al. 2006; Straub 2008; Straub and Ang 2008).</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Information Systems Theorizing Based on Evolutionary Psychology:  An Interdisciplinary Review and Theory Integration Framework</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kock, Ned</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Evolutionary psychology holds great promise as one of the possible pillars on which information systems theorizing can take place.  Arguably, evolutionary psychology can provide the key to many counterintuitive predictions of behavior toward technology, because many of the evolved instincts that influence our behavior are below our level of conscious awareness; often those instincts lead to behavioral responses that are not self-evident.  This paper  provides a discussion of information systems theorizing based on evolutionary psychology, centered on key human evolution and evolutionary genetics concepts and notions.  It is argued here that there is often a need to integrate evolutionary and non-evolutionary theories, and four important preconditions for the successful integration of evolutionary and non-evolutionary theories are discussed.  An example of integration of evolutionary and non-evolutionary theories is provided.  The example focuses on one evolutionary information systems theory—media naturalness theory—previously developed as an alternative to media richness theory, and one non-evolutionary information systems theory, channel expansion theory.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Shoemaker&#39;s Children:  Using Wikis for Information Systems Teaching, Research, and Publication (includes Comments and Editorial Note)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kane, Gerald C.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Fichman, Robert G</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper argues that Web 2.0 tools, specifically wikis, have begun to influence business and knowledge sharing practices in many organizations.  Information Systems researchers have spent considerable time exploring the impact and implications of these tools in organizations, but those same researchers have not spent sufficient time considering whether and how these new technologies may provide opportunities for us to reform our core practices of research, review, and teaching.  To this end, this paper calls for the IS discipline to engage in two actions related to wikis and other Web 2.0 tools.  First, the IS discipline ought to engage in critical reflection about how wikis and other Web 2.0 tools could allow us to conduct our core processes differently.  Our existing practices were formulated during an era of paper-based exchange; wikis and other Web 2.0 tools may enable processes that could be substantively better.  Nevertheless, users can appropriate information technology tools in unexpected ways, and even when tools are appropriated as expected there can be unintended negative consequences.  Any potential changes to our core processes should, therefore, be considered critically and carefully, leading to our second recommended action.  We advocate and describe a series of controlled experiments that will help assess the impact of these technologies on our core processes and the associated changes that would be necessary to use them.  We argue that these experiments can provide needed information regarding Web 2.0 tools and related practice changes that could help the discipline better assess whether or not new practices would be superior to existing ones and under which circumstances.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Informational Cascades and Software Adoption on the Internet:  An Empirical Investigation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Duan, Wenjing</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Gu, Bin</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Whinston, Andrew B.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Online users often need to make adoption decisions without accurate information about the product values.  An informational cascade occurs when it is optimal for an online user, having observed others’ actions, to follow the adoption decision of the preceding individual without regard to his own information.  Informational cascades are often rational for individual decision making; however, it may lead to adoption of inferior products.  With easy availability of information about other users’ choices, the Internet offers an ideal environment for informational cascades.  In this paper, we empirically examine informational cascades in the context of online software adoption.  We find user behavior in adopting software products is consistent with the predictions of the informational cascades literature.  Our results demonstrate that online users’ choices of software products exhibit distinct jumps and drops with changes in download ranking, as predicted by informational cascades theory.  Furthermore, we find that user reviews have no impact on user adoption of the most popular product, while having an increasingly positive impact on the adoption of lower ranking products.  The phenomenon persists after controlling for alternative explanations such as network effects, word-of-mouth effects, and product diffusion.  Our results validate informational cascades as an important driver for decision making on the Internet.  The finding also offers an explanation for the mixed results reported in prior studies with regard to the influence of online user reviews on product sales.  We show that the mixed results could be due to the moderating effect of informational cascades.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Out of Dedication or Constraint?  A Dual Model of Post-Adoption Phenomena and its Empirical Test in the Context of Online Services</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kim, Sung S.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Son, Jai-Yeol</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Sustained website traffic through consumers’ patronage at the post-adoption stages is known as a key to the survival of an online service provider.  Although a firm’s survival depends much on repeated use, whether or not a firm survives is also influenced by a variety of other behavioral outcomes that include, but are not limited to, word-of-mouth, willingness to pay, and inattentiveness to alternatives.  Whereas post-adoption research has recently paid attention to repeated use, the information systems field still lacks a systematic investiation into other behavioral outcomes that transcend mere usage.  In an attempt to extend the horizons of post-adoption research, we develop and test a model that explains post-adoption behaviors in the context of online services.  First, drawing on a dual model of relationship maintenance in consumer behavior research, we propose a conceptual framework to study and explain online consumer behavior.  In particular, our model predicts that two contrasting mechanisms, that is, dedication and constraint, are the main drivers of post-adoption phenomena (i.e., consumers’ post-adoption reactions to online services—beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors).  We empirically test the proposed dual model through the use of data collected from 510 users of online portals.  The results of structural equation modeling analysis indicate that, as expected, the dedication- and constraint-based mechanisms simultaneously, yet differentially, determine online consumer behavior.  In general, our findings suggest that it is essential in examining the complex nature of post-adoption phenomena to take into account the interplay of the dedication- and constraint-based mechanisms.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Avoidance of Information Technology Threats:  A Theoretical Perspective</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Liang, Huigang</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Xue, Yajiong</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper describes the development of the technology threat avoidance theory (TTAT), which explains individual IT users’ behavior of avoiding the threat of malicious information technologies.  We articulate that avoidance and adoption are two qualitatively different phenomena and contend that technology acceptance theories provide a valuable, but incomplete, understanding of users’ IT threat avoidance behavior.  Drawing from cybernetic theory and coping theory, TTAT delineates the avoidance behavior as a dynamic positive feedback loop in which users go through two cognitive processes, threat appraisal and coping appraisal, to decide how to cope with IT threats.  In the threat appraisal, users will perceive an IT threat if they believe that they are susceptible to malicious IT and that the negative consequences are severe.  The threat perception leads to coping appraisal, in which users assess the degree to which the IT threat can be avoided by taking safeguarding measures based on perceived effectiveness and costs of the safeguarding measure and self-efficacy of taking the safeguarding measure.  TTAT posits that users are motivated to avoid malicious IT when they perceive a threat and believe that the threat is avoidable by taking safeguarding measures; if users believe that the threat cannot be fully avoided by taking safeguarding measures, they would engage in emotion-focused coping.  Integrating process theory and variance theory, TTAT enhances our understanding of human behavior under IT threats and makes an important contribution to IT security research and practice.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Power and Concession in Computer-Mediated Negotiations:  An Examination of First Offers</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Johnson, Norman A.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Cooper, Randolph B.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Negotiation is increasingly being conducted over computer media, such as e-mail and instant messaging, because of the potential for time savings and monetary benefits.  However, these media can affect negotiators’ behaviors as they engage in what is called concession making, which is a process by which they make offers that yield benefits to their opponents.  In this paper, we focus on how and why conducting negotiations via computer media can affect this process, especially when negotiators have unequal power.  Our research model is based on theories from the information systems, negotiation, and social psychology literatures.  Via a laboratory experiment, we find that concessions made by the first individual to make an offer (the first mover) were not typically reciprocated by his/her negotiating opponent (the second mover).  Thus, in the context of computer-mediated negotiation, it appears that second movers are, among other things, more likely to violate the well-established norm of reciprocity.  This can result in significant disadvantages for the first mover, independent of power differences between negotiators.  In addition, we find that, contrary to face-to-face negotiations, increased power of one negotiator resulted in his/her having less influence in terms of getting larger concessions from the other negotiator.  In general, these findings support the notion that computer-mediated negotiation can be significantly different than face-to-face negotiation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Are Two Heads Better than One for Software Development?  The Productivity Paradox of Pair Programming</dc:title>

<dc:description>Extreme programming is currently gaining popularity as an alternate software development methodology.  Pair programming, a core practice of this methodology, involves two programmers working collaboratively to develop software.  This study examined the efficacy of pair programming by comparing the performance effectiveness and affective responses of collaborating pairs with those of individual programmers treated as nominal pairs.  In a controlled laboratory experiment involving student subjects, proxies for entry level programmers working on entry level tasks, two factors were manipulated:  programming setting (collaborative pair versus individuals) and programming task complexity (high versus low).  Participants who worked in the individual condition were randomly combined into nominal pairs.  The performance and affective responses of the collaborating pairs were then compared with those of the best performers and the second best performers of each nominal pair.  Results indicated that programming pairs performed at the level above the second best performers and at the level of the best performers in each nominal pair.  This relationship was found to be consistent across both levels of task complexity.  Consequently, there was no evidence of an “assembly bonus effect,” where the performance of a collaborating pair exceeds the performance of its best member working alone.  While this finding may appear counterintuitive due to the general perception of two heads being better than one, it is consistent with the findings in small group research.  When affective responses were considered, programming pairs reported higher levels of satisfaction than those of the best and second-best performing members in nominal pairs.  They also showed higher levels of confidence in their performance compared to those of the second-best members.  But the confidence levels of pairs were no different from those of the best performing members in nominal pairs.  Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are presented.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Role of Service Level Agreements in Relational Management of Information Technology Outsourcing:  An Empirical Study</dc:title>

<dc:description>This study extends the view that formal contracts and relational governance function as complements rather than as substitutes.  We investigate how specific characteristics of service level agreements (SLAs) impact relational governance in information technology outsourcing relationships.  Eleven contractual elements (categorized into three SLA characteristics:  foundation, change, and governance characteristics) are hypothesized to act as complements of three relational governance attributes:  relational norms, harmonious conflict resolution, and mutual dependence.  Data for the study were collected through a survey of South Korean IT executives.  Results of the study support the fundamental proposition of complementarity between formal contracts and relational governance, and indicate that well-structured SLAs have significant positive influence on the various aspects of relational governance in IT outsourcing relationships.  However, the study also reveals that change characteristics of SLAs may act as a substitute for relational governance as these characteristics were found to dampen the level of trust and commitment through moderation effects.  Overall, the findings support the proposition that well-developed SLAs not only provide a way to measure the service provider’s performance, but also enable effective management of outsourcing engagements through the development of partnership-style relationships with high levels of trust and commitment.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Foreword:  A Critical Look at Partial Least Squares Modeling</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Marcoulides, George A.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Chin, Wynne</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Saunders, Carol</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The first seed for this special issue on partial least squares (PLS) modeling was sown when George A. Marcoulides, editor-in-chief of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), submitted an Issues and Opinions article to MIS Quarterly (MISQ) about the presumed immunity of the method to distributional assumptions and that urged caution when using PLS with small sample sizes.  As editor-in-chief of MISQ, Carol Saunders started a review process for the paper that turned out to be more problematic than any she had ever seen.  Several reviewers turned down the invitation to review.  Several reviewers who accepted the invitation never completed their reviews either because of personal problems that had arisen in their families or for unstated reasons.  The few reviewers completing the assignment found the paper either too advanced for the MIS target audience or, concomitantly, conveying a message that was so obvious that the paper did not warrant publication.  More so than other disciplines, the Information Systems discipline relies heavily on PLS for testing path models.  Goodhue, Lewis, and Thompson (2006) found that PLS was used almost one third of the time in three top MIS journals between 2000 and 2003 (inclusive) when testing such models. Carol, believing the cautionary message was an important one, offered to work with George to issue a joint editorial to share that message with the IS community (Marcoulides and Saunders 2006).</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Whinston, Andrew B.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The shift to more distributed forms of organizations and the prevalence of interorganizational relationships have led to increasing the transfer of asymmetric and incomplete information knowledge between entities. Due to such information asymmetry and incompleteness, parties seeking knowledge may not be able to identify qualified knowledge providers, and the appropriate experts may fail to be motivated to engage in knowledge transfer.   We propose a sender-receiver framework for studying knowledge transfer under asymmetric and/or incomplete information. We outline four types of information structures for knowledge transfer, and focus on the sender-advantage asymmetric information structure and the symmetric incomplete information structure. We develop formal game-theoretical models, show how information incompleteness and asymmetry may negatively influence knowledge transfer, and propose solutions to alleviate these negative impacts. Implications for knowledge transfer research and practice are also discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Using PLS Path Modeling for Assessing Hierarchical Construct Models:  Guidelines and Empirical Illustration</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wetzels, Martin</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Odekerken-Schroder, Gaby</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>van Oppen, Claudia</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, the authors show that PLS path modeling can be used to assess a hierarchical construct model.  They provide guidelines outlining four key steps to construct a hierarchical construct model using PLS path modeling.  This approach is illustrated empirically using a reflective, fourth-order latent variable model of online experiential value in the context of online book and CD retailing.  Moreover, the guidelines for the use of PLS path modeling to estimate parameters in a hierarchical construct model are extended beyond the scope of the empirical illustration. The findings of the empirical illustration are used to discuss the use of covariance-based SEM versus PLS path modeling. The authors conclude with the limitations of their study and suggestions for future research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Assessing Between-Group Differences in Information Systems Research:  A Comparision of Covariance- and Component-Based SEM</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Qureshi, Israr</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Compeau, Deborah R.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Multigroup or between-group analyses are common in the information systems literature.  The ability to detect the presence or absence of between-group differences and accurately estimate the strength of moderating effects is important in studies that attempt to show contingent effects.  In the past, IS scholars have used a variety of approaches to examine these effects, with the partial least squares (PLS) pooled significance test for multigroup becoming the most common (e.g., Ahuja and Thatcher 2005; Enns et al. 2003; Zhu et al. 2006).  In other areas of social sciences (Epitropaki and Martin 2005) and management (Mayer and Gavin 2005; Song et al. 2005) research, however, there is greater emphasis on the use of covariance-based structural equation modeling multigroup analysis.  This paper compares these two methods through Monte Carlo simulation.  Our findings demonstrate the conditions under which covariance-based multigroup analysis is more appropriate as well as those under which there either is no difference or the component-based approach is preferable.  In particular, we find that when data are normally distributed, with a small sample size and correlated exogenous variables, the component-based approach is more likely to detect differences between-group than is the covariance-based approach.  Both approaches will consistently detect differences under conditions of normality with large sample sizes.  With non-normally distributed data, neither technique could consistently detect differences across the groups in two of the paths, suggesting that both techniques struggle with the prediction of a highly skewed and kurtotic dependent variable.  Both techniques detected the differences in the other paths consistently under conditions of non-normality, with the component-based approach preferable at moderate effect sizes, particularly for smaller samples.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Using Cognitive Principles to Guide Classification in Information Systems Modeling</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Parsons, Jeffrey</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Wand, Yair</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Organizing phenomena into classes is a pervasive human activity.  The ability to classify phenomena encountered in daily life in useful ways is essential to human survival and adaptation.  Not surprisingly, then, classification-oriented activities are widespread in the information systems field.  Classes or entity types play a central role in conceptual modeling for information systems requirements analysis, as well as in the design of databases and object-oriented software.  Furthermore, classification is the primary task in applications such as data mining and the development of domain ontologies to support information sharing in semantic web applications.  However, despite the pervasiveness of classification, little research has proposed well-grounded guidelines for identifying, evaluating, and choosing classes when modeling a domain or designing information systems artifacts.  In this paper, we adopt the cognitive notions of inference and economy to derive a set of principles to guide effective and efficient classification.  We present a model for characterizing what may be considered useful classes in a given context based on the inferences that can be drawn from membership in a class.  This foundation is then used to suggest practical design rules for evaluating and refining potential classes.  We illustrate the use of the rules by showing that applying them to a previously published example yields meaningful changes.  We then present an evaluation by a panel of experts who compared the published and revised models.  The evaluation shows that following the rules leads to semantically clearer models that are preferred by experts.  The paper concludes by outlining possible future research directions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Two paradigms characterize much of the research in the Information Systems discipline: behavioral science and design science.  The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior.  The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts.  Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology.  Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research.   In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact.  Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines.  We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Buyer Intention to Use Internet-Enabled Reverse Auctions:  The Role of Asset Specificity, Product Specialization, and Non-Contractibility</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mithas, Sunil</dc:creator>

<dc:creator>Mitchell, Will</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Information technology enabled exchanges in electronic markets have significant implications for buyer–supplier relationships.  Building on studies that emphasize the role of intangible assets in interorganizational relationships, this study argues that buyers are less likely to use reverse auctions for supplier relationships involving a high degree of non-contractibility.  The argument complements traditional transaction cost economics arguments that focus on the impact of asset specificity and product specialization.  We identify six dimensions of non-contractibility—quality, supplier technological investments, information exchange, responsiveness, trust, and flexibility—which encompass task-based and interaction-based non-contractibility.  The study finds that, together with product specialization, these non-contractible elements of interorganizational relationships have greater explanatory power for reverse auction use than asset specificity.  This result highlights the importance of supplier investments in non-contractible elements of exchange relationships in an increasingly dynamic service- and knowledge-based economy.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Design Theory Nexus</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pries-Heje, Jan</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Baskerville, Richard L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Managers frequently face ill-structured or “wicked” problems. Such problems are characterized by a large degree of uncertainty with respect to how the problem should be approached and how to establish and evaluate the set of alternative solutions.  A design theory nexus is a set of constructs and methods that enable the construction of models that connect numerous design theories with alternative solutions.  It thereby offers a unique problem-solving approach that is particularly useful for addressing ill-structured or wicked problems.  For each alternative solution in a design theory nexus one or more unique criteria are established to formulate a specific design theory.  We develop a general method for constructing a design theory nexus and illustrate its utility using two field studies.  One develops and applies an organizational change nexus.  The other develops and applies a user involvement nexus.  Each is a specific instantiation of the general design theory nexus constructs.  Using these illustrations, we provide examples of how to evaluate such instantiations. We then discuss our findings as well as the validity of our approach. We conclude that the design theory nexus provides a viable conceptualization that enables the construction of effective problem-solving artifacts.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Process Grammar as a Tool for Business Process Design</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lee, Jintae</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Wyner, George M.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Pentland, Brian T.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The space of design alternatives for a business process is typically very large, with technology, location, and other factors combining to generate seemingly endless possibilities.  This paper introduces a set of artifacts that support process designers in their efforts to manage this critical business problem:  (1) a grammar-based method to generate and manage business process design alternatives and (2) a software prototype that provides support for the use of this method.  The method and prototype software are demonstrated with a grammar for a sales process.  The method improves on existing approaches by offering the generative power of grammar-based methods while addressing the principal challenge to using such approaches in the design of business processes:  the limitations on automated evaluation of alternatives and thus the need to provide designers with tools to manage the potentially overwhelming array of choices generated by design grammars.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Design Science in the Information Systems Discipline:  An Introduction to the Special Issue on Design Science Research</dc:title>
<dc:creator>March, Salvatore T.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Storey, Veda C.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Design is fundamental to the information systems discipline. IS professionals are engaged in the design and implementation of information technology artifacts aimed at improving the performance of business organizations.  Business managers commonly view performance through an economic lens, defining the overall goal as the maximization of firm value; that is, the long-term profit of the firm.  These managers understandably ask questions such as:  “Why do investments in IT artifacts often not result in an increase in firm value?” and “What IT artifacts will do so?”  The first is a theory-based, causal-related question.  The second is a design-based, problem-solving question.  Each represents a critical class of research questions in the IS discipline.
Answering the first question requires an understanding of phenomena that occur at the intersection of organizations, people, and information technologies—the locus of the information systems discipline (Lee 1999).  Researchers addressing it develop and justify theories that provide deep principled explanations of these phenomena.  Such theories aim to explain what happened, why it happened, and possibly to predict what will happen within a given context.  It is the focus of much of the research published in the IS literature.
While such theories may be strictly explanatory in nature, their relevancy and value are determined by the degree to which they enable managers to design work-systems that improve organizational performance (Alter 2003; Benbasat and Zmud 1999).  This is the focus of the second question.  Answering it is fundamentally a design task that requires, “shaping artifacts and events to create a more desirable future” (Boland 2002).  Researchers addressing it build and evaluate IT artifacts that extend the boundaries of known applications of IT, addressing important problems heretofore not thought to be amenable to computational approaches (Hevner et al. 2004; Markus et al. 2002; Walls et al. 1992).  This is the focus of design science research in information systems and of this special issue.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>CyberGate:  A Design Framework and System for Text Analysis of Computer-Mediated Communication</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Abbasi, Ahmed</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Chen, Hsinchun</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Content analysis of computer-mediated communication (CMC) is important for evaluating the effectiveness of electronic communication in various organizational settings.  CMC text analysis relies on systems capable of providing suitable navigation and knowledge discovery functionalities.  However, existing CMC systems focus on structural features, with little support for features derived from message text.  This deficiency is attributable to the informational richness and representational complexities associated with CMC text.  In order to address this shortcoming, we propose a design framework for CMC text analysis systems.  Grounded in systemic functional linguistic theory, the proposed framework advocates the development of systems capable of representing the rich array of information types inherent in CMC text.  It also provides guidelines regarding the choice of features, feature selection, and visualization techniques that CMC text analysis systems should employ.  The CyberGate system was developed as an instantiation of the design framework.  CyberGate incorporates a rich feature set and complementary feature selection and visualization methods, including the writeprints and ink blots techniques.  An application example was used to illustrate the system’s ability to discern important patterns in CMC text.  Furthermore, results from numerous experiments conducted in comparison with benchmark methods confirmed the viability of CyberGate’s features and techniques.  The results revealed that the CyberGate system and its underlying design framework can dramatically improve CMC text analysis capabilities over those provided by existing systems.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A major problem for firms making information technology investment decisions is predicting and understanding the effects of future technological developments on the value of present technologies.  Failure to adequately address this problem can result in wasted organization resources in acquiring, developing, managing, and training employees in the use of technologies that are short-lived and fail to produce adequate return on investment.  The sheer number of available technologies and the complex set of relationships among them make IT landscape analysis extremely challenging.  Most IT-consuming firms rely on third parties and suppliers for strategic recommendations on IT investments, which can lead to biased and generic advice.  We address this problem by defining a new set of constructs and methodologies upon which we develop an IT ecosystem model.  The objective of these artifacts is to provide a formal problem representation structure for the analysis of information technology development trends and to reduce the complexity of the IT landscape for practitioners making IT investment decisions.  We adopt a process theory perspective and use a combination of visual mapping and quantification strategies to develop our artifacts and a state diagram-based technique to represent evolutionary transitions over time.  We illustrate our approach using two exemplars:  digital music technologies and wireless networking technologies.  We evaluate the utility of our approach by conducting in-depth interviews with IT industry experts and demonstrate the contribution of our approach relative to existing techniques for technology forecasting.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Marshaling the Professional Experience of Doctoral Students:  A Contribution to the Practical Relevance Debate</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Klein, Heinz K.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Rowe, Frantz</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, we propose a partial solution to the problem of the relevance of information systems research by adjusting doctoral programs to the specific needs and talents of doctoral students that have significant prior professional life experience.  The purpose of this paper is first to recognize that the “professionally qualified doctoral student” (PQDS) has a different type of knowledge that may give her/him some advantages over other students, including greater symbolic capital.  We examine the epistemic evidence for the claim that part of their practical experience constitutes a specific type of “applicative” knowledge that should be considered as different from but of equal value to theory, which has been the mainstay of academic education.  Three independent lines of academic research contribute such evidence:  the communities of practice literature, philosophical perspectives on applicative knowledge, and cognitive sciences.  We argue that PQDSs may benefit from doctoral programs with specific features designed to leverage their practical knowledge.  In turn, they may be able to “boundary span” and publish research results in forms that are appreciated by their professional communities.  Finally we discuss some practical institutional issues that could be addressed if we are to sustain this profile of researchers.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Fast Form Approach to Measuring Technology Acceptance and Other Constructs</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chin, Wynne W.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Johnson, Norman</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Schwarz, Andrew</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Nearly all prior studies on the technology acceptance model (TAM) have used Likert scales to measure the model’s constructs, but the use of only this type of scale has two shortcomings.  One is that such use prevents us from exposing the model’s constructs to a robust test of their measure and relationships to each other, termed their nomological validity.  The other is that such use leaves us unsure about whether or not we have selected an efficient way, in terms of survey completion time, to assess these constructs.  Past researchers have used short form scales to address the issue of efficiency, but there are problems that may result from such efforts.  In this study, we address both shortcomings by exploring the use of a semantic differential scale, which we refer to as a fast form, to assess the constructs of TAM.  In this regard, we do three things.  First, we describe how fast form as a scale may be developed.  Second, we conduct a psychometric evaluation of the constructs that are measured by the fast form and examine their relationships.  Third, we assess the efficiency of the fast form by comparing the time required to complete a survey with it to that which is required to complete a survey with Likert scales.  Our results confirm that the constructs that are measured by the fast form are psychometrically equivalent to those that are measured by the Likert scales.  The relationship among these constructs was unchanged, providing strong evidence for nomological validity.  The fast form also yielded a 40 percent reduction in the survey completion time, proving its superior efficiency.  We conclude with a description of the implications of these results for research and practice.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Interaction of Institutionally Triggered and Technology-Triggered Social Structure Change:  An Investigation of Computerized Physician Order Entry</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Davidson, Elizabeth J.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Chismar, William G.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Aligning social structures and technology capabilities is a significant challenge to information technology-related organizational change.  It is particularly challenging in institutionalized settings such as hospitals.  We report an interpretive field study of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) at an acute-care hospital, in which we investigated how institutionally triggered and technology-triggered change interacted in complementary processes to engender alignment.  Social structure changes included increased interdependency among clinical departments, multidisciplinary cooperation across clinical disciplines, and standardization in clinical decision-making.  Organization members also enacted institutionalized interaction patterns with physicians by deferring to their preferences for CPOE use.  The cumulative influence of change triggers nonetheless facilitated the hospital’s realization of clinical goals.  We drew on Barley’s (1990) role- and network-based model for technology and structure alignment.  Nonetheless, we extended this micro-level analytic approach to account for the influence of change in the macro-institutional environment.  Our analysis clarified the extent of structure change attributable to the CPOE technology and highlighted institutional forces that promoted yet inhibited change.  The case also highlighted the importance of role networks on the trajectory and outcomes of organizational change processes.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Role of Online Trading Communities in Managing Internet Auction Fraud</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chua, Cecil Eng Huang</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Wareham, Jonathan D.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Robey, Daniel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Internet auctions demonstrate that advances in information technologies can create more efficient venues of exchange between large numbers of traders.  However, the growth of Internet auctions has been accompanied by a corresponding growth in Internet auction fraud.  Much extant research on Internet auction fraud in the information systems literature is conducted at the individual level of analysis, thereby limiting its focus to the choices of individual traders or trading dyads.  The criminology literature, in contrast, recognizes that social and community factors are equally important influences on the perpetration and prevention of crime.  We employ social disorganization theory as a lens to explain how online auction communities address auction fraud and how those communities interact with formal authorities.  We show how communities may defy, coexist, or cooperate with the formal authority of auction houses.  These observations are supported by a qualitative analysis of three cases of online anticrime communities operating in different auction product categories.  Our analysis extends aspects of social disorganization theory to online communities.  We conclude that community-based clan control may operate in concert with authority-based formal control to manage the problem of Internet auction fraud more effectively.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>How Habit Limits the Predictive Power of Intention:  The Case of Information Systems Continuance</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Limayem, Moez</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Hirt, Sabine Gabriele</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Cheung, Christy M. K.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Past research in the area of information systems acceptance has primarily focused on initial adoption under the implicit assumption that IS usage is mainly determined by intention.  While plausible in the case of initial IS adoption, this assumption may not be as readily applicable to continued IS usage behavior since it ignores that frequently performed behaviors tend to become habitual and thus automatic over time.
This paper is a step forward in defining and incorporating the “habit” construct into IS research.  Specifically, the purpose of this study is to explore the role of habit and its antecedents in the context of continued IS usage.
Building on previous work in other disciplines, we define habit in the context of IS usage as the extent to which people tend to perform behaviors (use IS) automatically because of learning.  Using recent work on the continued usage of IS (IS continuance), we have developed a model suggesting that continued IS usage is not only a consequence of intention, but also of habit.  In particular, in our research model, we propose IS habit to moderate the influence of intention such that its importance in determining behavior decreases as the behavior in question takes on a more habitual nature.  Integrating past research on habit and IS continuance further, we suggest how antecedents of behavior/behavioral intention as identified by IS continuance research relate to drivers of habitualization.
We empirically tested the model in the context of voluntary continued WWW usage.  Our results support the argument that habit acts as a moderating variable of the relationship between intentions and IS continuance behavior, which may put a boundary condition on the explanatory power of intentions in the context of continued IS usage.  The data also support that satisfaction, frequency of past behavior, and comprehensiveness of usage are key to habit formation and thus relevant in the context of IS continuance behavior.  Implications of these findings are discussed and managerial guidelines presented.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study directly tests the effect of personality and cognitive style on three measures of Internet use.  The results support the use of personality—but not cognitive style—as an antecedent variable.  After controlling for computer anxiety, self-efficacy, and gender, including the “Big Five” personality factors in the analysis significantly adds to the predictive capabilities of the dependent variables.  Including cognitive style does not.  The results are discussed in terms of the role of personality and cognitive style in models of technology adoption and use.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Impact of Knowledge Coordination on Virtual Team Performance over Time</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kanawattanachai, Prasert</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Yoo, Youngjin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>As the role of virtual teams in organizations becomes increasingly important, it is crucial that companies identify and leverage team members’ knowledge.  Yet, little is known of how virtual team members come to recognize one another’s knowledge, trust one another’s expertise, and coordinate their knowledge effectively.  In this study, we develop a model of how three behavioral dimensions associated with transactive memory systems (TMS) in virtual teams—expertise location, task–knowledge coordination, and cognition-based trust—and their impacts on team performance change over time.  Drawing on the data from a study that involves 38 virtual teams of MBA students performing a complex web-based business simulation game over an 8-week period, we found that in the early stage of the project, the frequency and volume of task-oriented communications among team members played an important role in forming expertise location and cognition-based trust.  Once TMS were established, however, task-oriented communication became less important.  Instead, toward the end of the project, task–knowledge coordination emerges as a key construct that influences team performance, mediating the impact of all other constructs.  Our study demonstrates that TMS can be formed even in virtual team environments where interactions take place solely through electronic media, although they take a relatively long time to develop.  Furthermore, our findings show that, once developed, TMS become essential to performing tasks effectively in virtual teams.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Toward a Deeper Understanding of System Usage in Organizations:  A Multilevel Perspective</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Burton-Jones, Andrew</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Gallivan, Michael J</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The objective of this paper is to contribute to a deeper understanding of system usage in organizations by examining its multilevel nature.  Past research on system usage has suffered from a levels bias, with researchers studying system usage at single levels of analysis only (e.g., the individual, group, or organizational level).  Although single-level research can be useful, we suggest that studying organizations one level at a time will ultimately lead to an unnatural, incomplete, and very disjointed view of how information systems are used in practice.  To redress this situation, we draw on recent advances in multilevel theory to present system usage as a multilevel construct and provide an illustration for what it takes for researchers to study it as such.  The multilevel perspective advanced in this article offers rich opportunities for theoretical and empirical insights and suggests a new foundation for in-depth research on the nature of system usage, its emergence and change, and its antecedents and consequences.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Through the Eyes of Experts:  A Socio-Cognitive Perspective on the Automation of Fingerprint Work</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Davis, Christopher J.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Hufnagel, Ellen M.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Prior research on technological frames indicates that many of the difficulties associated with systems implementation stem from differences in the meanings users, managers, and system developers attribute to automation projects.  Although the concept of technological frames has been used to explore the bases for intergroup conflict during implementation, it is also a useful device for probing more deeply into the effects complex systems have on users’ perceptions of their work and the role-altering effects of new technologies.  Drawing upon personal construct theory and job characteristics theory, we adapted the repertory grid technique to explore the technology-in-use frames of a group of occupationally certified fingerprint technicians (FPTs).  Our investigation reveals the important role the FPTs’ occupationally defined values and norms played in structuring their existing work practices and the tensions produced by organizationally mandated efforts to restructure the logic of their expertise-based hierarchies.  These insights illuminate the effects work redesign had on the FPTs’ task environment, the process logic that guided specific work practices, and the roles defined by their expertise-based hierarchies, providing a basis for understanding the FPTs’ unanticipated reactions to the automation of their work.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Emotional Dissonance and the Information Technology Professional</dc:title>

<dc:description>The information technology professional is regularly expected to work with colleagues in both IT and other areas of the organization.  During these interactions, the IT employee is expected to conform to occupational or organizational norms regarding the display of emotion.  How do these display norms affect the IT professional?  This study examines an IT professional’s emotional dissonance, the conflict between norms of emotional display and an employee’s felt emotion.  Emotional dissonance is studied as a factor of IT professionals’ work exhaustion, job satisfaction, and turnover intention, modeled as an extension to the work of Moore (2000a).  The results indicate emotional dissonance predicts work exhaustion better than do perceived workload, role conflict, or role ambiguity, constructs which have long been associated with work exhaustion.  Job satisfaction is influenced directly by role ambiguity and work exhaustion.  In turn, job satisfaction influences employee turnover intention.  We discuss implications of these findings for both IT management and future research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Dressing Your Online Auction Business for Success:  An Experiment Comparing Two eBay Businesses</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gregg, Dawn G.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Walczak, Steven</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Businesses can choose who they want to be online.  Product and company attributes that are directly perceivable in the real world can be manipulated to make a favorable impression on online buyers.  This study examines whether creating a more professional online e-image can signal consumers about unobservable product or company quality, and whether this signal influences their willingness to transact with the company, and ultimately the prices they are willing to pay for the company’s goods and services.  An empirical study is presented that examines two online auction businesses utilizing different company names and auction listing styles to sell items in parallel over the course of one year. The findings suggest that increasing the quality of an auction business’s e-image does increase consumers’ willingness to transact with the business, and increases prices received at auction. The study also demonstrates the ability to use eBay as an experimental laboratory for testing a variety of hypotheses about purchasing behavior online.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Business Familiarity as Risk Mitigation in Software Development Outsourcing Contracts</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gefen, David</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Wyss, Simon</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Lichtenstein, Yossi</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study examines the role of business familiarity in determining how software development outsourcing projects are managed and priced to address risks.  Increased business familiarity suggests both more prior knowledge, and hence reduced adverse selection risk, and increased implied trust about future behavior, and hence implied reduced moral hazard risk.  Preferring high business familiarity partners may also alleviate concerns about incomplete contracts.  By reducing these risks, higher business familiarity is hypothesized to be associated with higher priced projects, reduced penalties, and an increased tendency to contract on a time and materials rather than a fixed price basis.  These hypotheses were examined with objective contractual legal data from contracts made by a leading international bank.  Integrating trust theory into agency theory and into incomplete contract theory and examining unique contract data, the contribution of the study is to show that the premium on business familiarity and the trust it implies is not in directly affecting price, but, rather, in changing how the relationship is managed toward a tendency to sign time and materials contracts.  Implications about integrating trust into agency theory and incomplete contract theory, as well as implications regarding trust premiums and software development outsourcing, are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Media, Tasks, and Communication Processes:  A Theory of Media Synchronicity</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Dennis, Alan R.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Fuller, Robert M.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Valacich, Joseph S.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper expands, refines, and explicates media synchronicity theory, originally proposed in a conference proceeding in 1999 (Dennis and Valacich 1999).  Media synchronicity theory (MST) focuses on the ability of media to support synchronicity, a shared pattern of coordinated behavior among individuals as they work together.  We expand on the original propositions of MST to argue that communication is composed of two primary processes:  conveyance and convergence. The familiarity of individuals with the tasks they are performing and with their coworkers will also affect the relative amounts of these two processes.  Media synchronicity theory proposes that for conveyance processes, use of media supporting lower synchronicity should result in better communication performance.  For convergence processes, use of media supporting higher synchronicity should result in better communication performance.  We identify five capabilities of media (symbol sets, parallelism, transmission velocity, rehearsability, and reprocessability) that influence the development of synchronicity and thus the successful performance of conveyance and convergence communication processes.  The successful completion of most tasks involving more than one individual requires both conveyance and convergence processes, thus communication performance will be improved when individuals use a variety of media to perform a task, rather than just one medium.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Three-Perspective Model of Culture, Information Systems, and Their Development and Use</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kappos, Antonio</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Rivard, Suzanne</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Culture plays an increasingly important role in information systems initiatives, and it receives considerable attention from researchers who have studied a variety of aspects of its role in IS initiatives.  Notwithstanding the contributions of research to date, our knowledge of how culture influences— and is influenced by—the development and use processes and an information system itself remains fragmented.  Knowledge fragmentation is amplified by the fact that conceptualizations of culture differ among researchers.  Indeed, most researchers agree that culture consists of patterns of meaning underlying a variety of manifestations.  Researchers diverge, however, on the degree of consensus on these interpretations that they assume to be reached within a collective.  In order to integrate these divergent conceptualizations of culture, we adopt the view that no single perspective is sufficient to capture the complexity of interplay between culture, the processes of developing and using an IS, and the IS itself.  We have, therefore, adopted a conceptualization that views culture from three perspectives—integration, differentiation, and fragmentation—that come into play simultaneously and jointly.  Using this conceptualization, the paper synthesizes what is known about the role of culture in IS initiatives, and proposes a model of the relationships between culture, the development and use processes, and an information system.</dc:description>

<dc:description>What is the intellectual core of the information systems discipline?  This study uses latent semantic analysis to examine a large body of published IS research in order to address this question.  Specifically, the abstracts of all research papers over the time period from 1985 through 2006 published in three top IS research journals—MIS Quarterly, Information Systems Research, and Journal of Management Information Systems—were analyzed.  This analysis identified five core research areas:  (1) information technology and organizations; (2) IS development; (3) IT and individuals; (4) IT and markets; and (5) IT and groups.  Over the time frame of our analysis, these core topics have remained quite stable.  However, the specific research themes within each core area have evolved significantly, reflecting research that has focused less on technology development and more on the social context in which information technologies are designed and used.  As such, this analysis demonstrates that the information systems academic discipline has maintained a relatively stable research identity that focuses on how IT systems are developed and how individuals, groups, organizations, and markets interact with IT.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Employees’ underutilization of new information systems undermines organizations’ efforts to gain benefits from such systems.  The two main predictors of individual-level system use in prior research—behavioral intention and facilitating conditions—have limitations that we discuss.  We introduce behavioral expectation as a predictor that addresses some of the key limitations and provides a better understanding of system use.  System use is examined in terms of three key conceptualizations:  duration, frequency, and intensity.  We develop a model that employs behavioral intention, facilitating conditions, and behavioral expectation as predictors of the three conceptualizations of system use.  We argue that each of these three determinants play different roles in predicting each of the three conceptualizations of system use.  We test the proposed model in the context of a longitudinal field study of 321 users of a new information system.  The model explains 65 percent, 60 percent, and 60 percent of the variance in duration, frequency, and intensity of system use respectively.  We offer theoretical and practical implications for our findings.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Internet Users’ Information Privacy-Protective Responses:  A Taxonomy and a Nomological Model</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Son, Jai-Yeol</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Kim, Sung S.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Although Internet users are expected to respond in various ways to privacy threats from online companies, little attention has been paid so far to the complex nature of how users respond to these threats.  This paper has two specific goals in its effort to fill this gap in the literature. The first, so that these outcomes can be systematically investigated, is to develop a taxonomy of information privacy-protective responses (IPPR).  This taxonomy consists of six types of behavioral responses—refusal, misrepresentation, removal, negative word-of-mouth, complaining directly to online companies, and complaining indirectly to third-party organizations—that are classified into three categories:  information provision, private action, and public action.  Our second goal is to develop a nomological model with several salient antecedents—concerns for information privacy, perceived justice, and societal benefits from complaining—of IPPR, and to show how the antecedents differentially affect the six types of IPPR.  The nomological model is tested with data collected from 523 Internet users.  The results indicate that some discernible patterns emerge in the relationships between the antecedents and the three groups of IPPR.  These patterns enable researchers to better understand why a certain type of IPPR is similar to or distinct from other types of IPPR.  Such an understanding could enable researchers to analyze a variety of behavioral responses to information privacy threats in a fairly systematic manner.  Overall, this paper contributes to researchers’ theory-building efforts in the area of information privacy by breaking new ground for the study of individuals’ responses to information privacy threats.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>&#34;Outsourcing to an Unknown Workforce:  Exploring Opensourcing as a Global Sourcing Strategy</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Agerfalk, Par J.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Fitzgerald, Brian</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper presents a psychological contract perspective on the use of the open source development model as a global sourcing strategy—opensourcing, as we term it here—whereby commercial companies and open source communities collaborate on development of software of commercial interest to the company.  Building on previous research on information systems outsourcing, a theoretical framework for exploring the opensourcing phenomenon is derived.  The first phase of the research concerned qualitative case studies involving three commercial organizations (IONA Technologies, Philips Medical Systems, and Telefonica) that had “liberated” what had hitherto been proprietary software and sought to grow a global open source community around their product.  We followed this with a large-scale survey involving additional exemplars of the phenomenon.  The study identifies a number of symmetrical and complementary customer and community obligations that are associated with opensourcing success.  We also identify a number of tension points on which customer and community perceptions tend to vary.  Overall the key watchwords for opensourcing are openness, trust, tact, professionalism, transparency, and complementariness:  The customer and community need to establish a trusted partnership of shared responsibility in building an overall opensourcing ecosystem.  The study reveals an ongoing shift from OSS as a community of individual developers to OSS as a community of commercial organizations, primarily small to medium-sized enterprises.  It also reveals that opensourcing provides ample opportunity for companies to headhunt top developers, hence moving from outsourcing to a largely unknown OSS workforce toward recruitment of developers from a global open source community whose talents have become known as a result of the opensourcing experience.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Transformational Technologies and the Creation of New Work Practices:  Making Implicit Knowledge Explicit in Task-Based Offshoring</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Leonardi, Paul L.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Bailey, Diane E.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Studies have shown the knowledge transfer problems that arise when communication and storage technologies are employed to accomplish work across time and space.  Much  less is known about knowledge transfer problems associated with transformational technologies, which afford the creation, modification, and manipulation of digital artifacts.  Yet, these technologies play a critical role in offshoring by allowing the distribution of work at the task level, what we call task-based offshoring.  For example, computer-aided engineering applications transform input like physical dimensions, location coordinates, and material properties into computational models that can be shared electronically among engineers around the world as they work together on analysis tasks. Digital artifacts created via transformational technologies often embody implicit knowledge that must be correctly interpreted to successfully act upon the artifacts.  To explore what problems might arise in interpreting this implicit knowledge across time and space, and how individuals might remedy these problems, we studied a firm that sent engineering tasks from home sites in Mexico and the United States to an offshore site in India.  Despite having proper formal education and ample tool skills, the Indian engineers had difficulty interpreting the implicit knowledge embodied in artifacts sent to them from Mexico and the United States.  To resolve and prevent the problems that subsequently arose, individuals from the home sites developed five new work practices to transfer occupational knowledge to the offshore site.  The five practices were defining requirements, monitoring progress, fixing returns, routing tasks strategically, and filtering quality.  The extent to which sending engineers in our study were free from having to enact these new work practices because on-site coordinators acted on their behalf predicted their perceptions of the effectiveness of the offshoring arrangement, but Indian engineers preferred learning from sending engineers, not on-site coordinators.  Our study contributes to theories of knowledge transfer and has practical implications for managing task-based offshoring arrangements.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Explaining Variations in Client Extra Costs Between Software Projects Offshored to India</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Dibbern, Jens</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Winkler, Jessica</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Heinzl, Armin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Gaining economic benefits from substantially lower labor costs has been reported as a major reason for offshoring labor-intensive information systems services to low-wage countries.  However, if wage differences are so high, why is there such a high level of variation in the economic success between offshored IS projects?  This study argues that offshore outsourcing involves a number of extra costs for the client organization that account for the economic failure of offshore projects.  The objective is to disaggregate these extra costs into their constituent parts and to explain why they differ between offshored software projects.  The focus is on software development and maintenance projects that are offshored to Indian vendors.  A theoretical framework is developed a priori based on transaction cost economics (TCE) and the knowledge-based view of the firm, complemented by factors that acknowledge the specific offshore context.  The framework is empirically explored using a multiple case study design including six offshored software projects in a large German financial service institution.  The results of our analysis indicate that the client incurs post- contractual extra costs for four types of activities:  (1) requirements specification and design, (2) knowledge transfer, (3) control, and (4) coordination.  In projects that require a high level of client-specific knowledge about idiosyncratic business processes and software systems, these extra costs were found to be substantially higher than in projects where more general knowledge was needed.  Notably, these costs most often arose independently from the threat of opportunistic behavior, challenging the predominant TCE logic of market failure.  Rather, the client extra costs were particularly high in client-specific projects because the effort for managing the consequences of the knowledge asymmetries between client and vendor was particularly high in these projects.  Prior experiences of the vendor with related client projects were found to reduce the level of extra costs but could not fully offset the increase in extra costs in highly client-specific projects.  Moreover, cultural and geographic distance between client and vendor as well as personnel turnover were found to increase client extra costs.  Slight evidence was found, however, that the cost-increasing impact of these factors was also leveraged in projects with a high level of required client-specific knowledge (moderator effect).</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Is the World Really Flat?  A Look at Offshoring at an Online Programming Marketplace</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gefen, David</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Carmel, Erran</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In a world that is flat, where all clients and providers can easily transact with one another, offshoring represents the proposition that information technology providers from low-wage nations can now underbid providers from high-wage nations and win contracts.  We examined a particularly flat “world”—an online programming marketplace—and found that this profound tilt to low-wage nations is overstated. We analyzed the entire history of transactions at one of the major online programming marketplaces, a marketplace for outsourcing small IT projects.  The data spanned 38 months and included over 263,000 bids by over 31,000 providers from 70 countries on over 20,000 small IT projects requested by over 7,900 clients from 59 countries.
Contrary to the world-is-flat proposition, the data in this particular site show some client preference for domestic providers.  However, the largest group of clients, the American clients, are a marked exception to clients in the rest of the world:  they give relatively less preference to domestic providers. In a sense, the American clients have a higher preference for offshore providers. Among non-American clients the preference for domestic providers is mitigated when both client and provider are from an English-speaking nation. Relative bid price, often very low already, also determines the winning bid, as does the ratio of purchasing power parity (PPP) between the country of the client and the country of the provider. Nonetheless, the strongest determinant of the winning bid is client loyalty: the client gives very strong preference to a provider with whom there has been a previous relationship, regardless of whether the provider is offshore or domestic.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Kemerer, Chris F.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper we develop a learning-mediated model of offshore software project productivity and quality to examine whether widely adopted structured software processes are effective in mitigating the negative effects of work dispersion in offshore software development.  We explicate how the key process areas of the capability maturity model (CMM) can be utilized as a platform to launch learning routines in offshore software development and thereby explain why some offshore software development process improvement initiatives are more effective than others.  We validate our learning-mediated model of offshore software project performance by utilizing data collected from 42 offshore software projects of a large firm that operates at the CMM level-5 process maturity.  Our results indicate that investments in structured processes mitigate the negative effects of work dispersion in offshore software development.  We also find that the effect of software process improvement initiatives is mediated through investments in process-based learning activities.  These results imply that investments in structured processes and the corresponding process-based learning activities can be an economically viable way to counter the challenges of work dispersion and improve offshore project performance.  We discuss the implication of these results for the adoption of normative process models by offshore software firms.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Two-Stage Offshoring:  An Investigation of the Irish Bridge</dc:title>

<dc:creator>Agerfalk, Par J.</dc:creator>

<dc:description>This paper investigates two-stage offshoring as experienced by the Irish sites of two large global companies, headquartered in the United States, with significant software development operations.  As part of these companies, the Irish sites act as a bridge in their offshoring arrangements:  While the U.S. sites offshore work to Ireland, the Irish sites offshore work further to India and, hence, have experience of being both customer and vendor in two-stage offshore sourcing relationships. Using a framework derived from relational exchange theory (RET), we conducted multiple case study research to investigate and develop an initial theoretical model of the implementation of this two-stage offshoring bridge model.  Our study shows that while both companies act as bridges in two-stage offshoring arrangements, their approaches differ in relation to (1) team integration, (2) organizational level implementation, and (3) site hierarchy.  Although, there are opportunities afforded by the bridge model at present, the extent to which these opportunities will be viable into the future is open to question.  As revealed in our study, temporal location seems to favor a bridge location such as Ireland, certainly with United States–Asian partners.  However, location alone will not be enough to maintain position in future two-stage offshoring arrangements.  Furthermore, our research supports the view that offshoring tends to progress through a staged sequence of progressively lower cost destinations.  Such a development suggests that two-stage offshoring, as described in this paper, will eventually become what we would term multistage offshoring.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Managing the Knowledge Supply Chain:  An Organizational Learning Model of Information Technology Offshore Outsourcing</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cha, Hoon S.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Pingry, David E.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Thatcher, Matt E.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, we present an economic learning model that helps to formalize the complex relationships among an offshoring firm’s knowledge levels, production costs, and coordination costs.  Specifically, we model a domestic firm’s use of a selective offshore strategy (i.e., offshoring only a portion of its information technology activities) to exploit, through IT investments or contractual provisions, the foreign vendor’s large, scale-driven repository of production knowledge.  We illustrate the conditions under which knowledge transfers during offshoring may reduce a domestic firm’s in-house production costs, leading to total cost savings in both the short term and the long term.  Alternatively, when knowledge transfers are not sufficiently large, some short-lived offshoring projects may generate substantial cost savings to the domestic firm; however, long-lived offshoring projects may cause a disruption in the knowledge supply chain, resulting in substantial losses in the later stages of the project.  A firm that fails to realize the costs associated with such a disruption soon enough in the project life may find itself locked into a disadvantageous offshoring agreement without any recourse.  However, a domestic firm may be able to overcome a disruption in its knowledge supply chain by exploiting the learning-by-doing production knowledge generated by the foreign vendor’s economies of scale.  The managerial implications derived from our learning model may help guide firms as they consider the impacts of offshore contracts and knowledge management investments on firm knowledge, production costs, and coordination costs.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Cocreating Understanding and Value in Distributed Work:  How Members of Onsite and Offshore Vendor Teams Give, Make, Demand, and Break Sense</dc:title>

<dc:description>Achieving shared, common, or mutual understandings among geographically dispersed workers is a central concern in the distributed work literature.  Nonetheless, little is known yet about the socio-cognitive acts and communication processes involved with synchronizing and cocreating understandings in such settings.  Building on a case study of a geographically distributed information systems development project at one of India’s largest offshore vendors, we postulate that knowledge and experience asymmetries, and requirements and task characteristics (such as complexity, instability, ambiguity, and novelty) prompt onsite and offshore team members to engage in acts of sensegiving, sensedemanding, and sensebreaking.  This allows them to make sense of their tasks and their environment, and it increases the likelihood that congruent and actionable understandings emerge.  Furthermore, it assists them in cocreating novel understandings, especially when acts of sensegiving and sensedemanding are complemented with instances of sensebreaking.  Our results contribute to the literature by explaining how distributed team members mitigate problems of understanding, transfer preexisting understandings, and cocreate novel understandings. Acts of sensegiving, sensedemanding, and sensebreaking allow distributed team members to jointly explore and generate value, thereby amplifying the performance of distributed workers.</dc:description>
