Title: Human mobility and international knowledge spillovers: evidence from high‐tech small and medium enterprises in an emerging market

Abstract: Using novel survey data, we examine the relationship between returnee entrepreneurs, multinational enterprise (MNE) work experience of domestic entrepreneurs, and firms' innovation performance in high-tech SMEs in China. We adopt an integrated framework that combines the knowledge-based view and social capital theory to investigate whether human mobility across national borders and MNE work experience facilitate international knowledge spillovers. We find that firms founded by returnees are more innovative than their local counterparts. We also find that returnee firms have an indirect impact/spillover effect on non-returnee firms' innovation performance and act as a new channel for technological knowledge spillovers. The findings show that the presence of a technology gap positively moderates the effect of returnee spillovers on non-returnee firms' innovation performance, but the impact of MNE work experience on local innovation is constrained by the technology gap. Our results extend the existing literatures on knowledge spillovers and strategic entrepreneurship and have important managerial and policy implications.

Title: A learning perspective on intraorganizational knowledge spill‐ins
Author-Name: Oldroyd, James B.
Author-Name: Gulati, Ranjay
Abstract: This exploratory study examines the role of intraorganizational knowledge spill-ins in the process of inferential learning. Drawing on the notions of knowledge reliability (the creation of shared meanings) and validity (the understanding of cause and effect), we explore how organizations learn inferentially in dynamic environments, where active experimentation rather than past experience is the underlying basis for learning. We find that intraorganizational knowledge spill-ins transfer heuristics crafted by one unit under local conditions of reliability and validity to other units, where they are reinterpreted and repurposed. Intraorganizational knowledge spill-ins emerge as a mechanism through which reliability and validity are enhanced for organizational learning. Copyright © 2010 Strategic Management Society.

Title: From legitimacy to impact: Moving the field forward by asking how entrepreneurship informs life
Author-Name: Lumpkin, G. T.
Abstract: Entrepreneurship as a field of research has grown significantly since the publication of Lumpkin and Dess (1996), an article that addressed what it means to be entrepreneurial. The field has gained legitimacy in part through research that asks how phenomena such as market conditions, institutional environments, and strategic behaviors inform the entrepreneurship domain. New progress can be made by asking how phenomena unique to the domain of entrepreneurship help researchers understand decisions, actions, and environments outside of the domain. Ideas for using entrepreneurial knowledge to explain more general phenomena are presented. Copyright © 2011 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Effects of theoretical contribution, methodological rigor, and journal quality, on the impact of scale development articles in the field of entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Kuskova, Valentina V.
Author-Name: Podsakoff, Nathan P.
Author-Name: Podsakoff, Philip M.
Abstract: Despite the widespread belief that empirical studies that are firmly grounded in theory and use valid measures of their focal constructs are more critical to the advancement of science than studies that do not possess these attributes, it is only recently that this belief has begun to be empirically tested. Unfortunately, most of the tests that have been conducted have some limitations. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the effects that an article's theoretical contribution, the rigor of its scale validation procedures, and the quality of the journal in which it is published have on its impact in the field of entrepreneurship. Using expectancy theory as a conceptual framework, we develop and test our hypotheses in a sample of 88 entrepreneurship articles that reported scale development and validation evidence. Our hypotheses were supported in that the results showed that an article's theoretical contribution, methodological rigor, and journal quality significantly predicted the number of citations the article received, even after controlling for article age- and author-related variables. When taken together, the article characteristics and control variables accounted for 66 percent of the variance in article citations. Implications of these findings for researchers in the field of entrepreneurship are discussed. Copyright © 2011 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Effects of initial teamwork capability and initial relational capability on the development of new technology‐based firms
Author-Name: Brinckmann, Jan
Author-Name: Hoegl, Martin
Abstract: New technology-based firms face substantial resource constraints. This study examines how teamwork capability and relational capability of the entrepreneurial team affects the development of new firms. Teamwork capabilities are captured by the quality of collaboration of the entrepreneurial team members among themselves. Relational capabilities are analyzed based on the collaboration of the entrepreneurial team members with partners external to the focal firm. Our findings show that teamwork and relational capabilities, while theoretically originating from social capabilities, can have diverging effects on the development of a new organization. We find that relational capabilities lead to founding team member additions as well as sales and employment growth. In contrast, teamwork capabilities lead to a reduced likelihood to add founding team members and do not affect sales and employment growth. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

Title: Complementary effects of network range and tie strength in enhancing transnational venture performance
Author-Name: Patel, Pankaj C.
Author-Name: Terjesen, Siri
Abstract: We examine the complementary effects of network range and tie strength on the performance of ventures in the context of the transnational entrepreneur (TE). Network range facilitates access to a broad set of knowledge and resources; however these resources may be activated only in the presence of strong ties. Alternatively, a network heavy in strong ties provides reliable connections, but a lack of range can lead to network closure. Using a sample of 452 TE ventures, we find that tie strength enhances venture performance, but network range does not have a significant effect. Furthermore, taken together, tie strength and network range significantly enhance TE venture performance. Supermodularity and linear restriction tests indicate asymmetric complementarity between network range and tie strength. Tie strength is a critical input and network range plays a supporting role in a TE's venture performance. Copyright © 2011 Strategic Management Society.

Title: The mediating role of knowledge‐based capital for corporate entrepreneurship effects on performance: A study of small‐ to medium‐sized firms
Author-Name: Simsek, Zeki
Author-Name: Heavey, Ciaran
Abstract: Even though research suggests that a firm's pursuit of corporate entrepreneurship directly contributes to its performance, we develop a deeper explanation, based on the insight that this pursuit develops and extends the firm's knowledge-based capital. Specifically, we first demonstrate that the pursuit of corporate entrepreneurship enhances the firm's knowledge-based capital residing in people (human capital), relationships (social capital), and systems (organizational capital). Then, we examine the mediating role of each capital type for corporate entrepreneurship effects on performance. We test our hypotheses using multisource data from a sample of CEOs and their top management teams in 125 firms, including a time-lagged measurement of knowledge-based capital and performance. Our findings provide general support for this theory and indicate that corporate entrepreneurship is positively associated with knowledge-based capital and through this, with performance.

Title: The downside of being ‘up’: entrepreneurs' dispositional positive affect and firm performance
Author-Name: Baron, Robert A.
Author-Name: Tang, Jintong
Author-Name: Hmieleski, Keith M.
Abstract: Previous research indicates that dispositional positive affect (DPA) is related to many beneficial outcomes (e.g., enhanced career success, development of high-quality social networks, improved performance on many tasks). Past research, however, has not directly investigated three crucial issues: (1) Are there limits to these beneficial effects? (2) Is dispositional positive affect related to firm performance as well as to individual entrepreneur performance? (3) Are the effects of entrepreneurs' DPA moderated by specific variables? The present study provides evidence relating to these issues. Findings indicate significant relationships between entrepreneurs' DPA and two measures of firm performance (product innovation and sales growth rate). However, there are indeed limits to these effects, such that beyond certain upper bounds, further increments in entrepreneurs' DPA are associated with declines in firm performance. These effects are moderated by firm size, such that the negative effects of entrepreneurs' DPA are stronger in small firms than in comparatively larger ones. Results contribute to the development of theory for understanding the role of entrepreneurs' affect in the entrepreneurial process. More generally, they contribute to ongoing efforts to understand how founding entrepreneurs influence the subsequent development and growth of their firms.

Author-Name: Tucci, Christopher L.
Abstract: Previous studies suggest that spin-outs will locate in close proximity to the firm from which they spawn. As a result of this process, clusters of entrepreneurial activity tend to develop around a few strong parent firms. But do all spin-outs really stay close to home? We demonstrate that spin-out firms choose heterogeneous technological and market strategies, and we hypothesize that firms with more aggressive strategies have a greater need to maintain local relationships. We find supporting evidence of our theory by analyzing the location, technology, and market decisions of intraindustry spin-outs in their first year in the disk drive industry.

Abstract: We explore how environmental contingencies determine the way resources are accumulated in young technology-based firms and argue that growth paths are critically shaped at the nexus between resource management and the competitive environment, defined along its most important dimensions, ‘stability’ and ‘complexity.’ We also build propositions about the way environmental conditions affect resource portfolio development or acquisition. We show how particular high-growth paths result from structuring resource portfolios in accordance with environmental demands and provide insights into why, based on six case studies of young technology-based high-growth firms, involving 27 interviews, 121 press releases, 605 press articles, and archival data.

Title: Lost in translation: Cultural codes are not blueprints
Author-Name: Aldrich, Howard E.
Author-Name: Yang, Tiantian
Abstract: Entrepreneurship enjoys widespread appeal in nearly all capitalist nations, but start-up success has proved elusive for most entrepreneurs. We explain the low likelihood of entrepreneurial success by focusing on the contrast between organizational forms in terms of cultural codes that tap into widely held perceptions versus organizational forms in terms of blueprints that sustain effective guidance for organizational activities. The dilemma facing nascent entrepreneurs during their life course is the incomplete and fragmentary nature of these opportunities for learning about start-up practices. We conclude the article by offering suggestions for further research to discover what entrepreneurs actually do during the start-up process. Copyright © 2012 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Exploration and exploitation strategies, profit performance, and the mediating role of strategic learning: Escaping the exploitation trap
Author-Name: Sirén, Charlotta A.
Author-Name: Kohtamäki, Marko
Author-Name: Kuckertz, Andreas
Abstract: This study focuses on the role of strategic learning as a mediating construct between opportunity-seeking (exploration) and advantage-seeking (exploitation) strategies and profit performance. Prior studies argue that the effect of these core elements of strategic entrepreneurship (exploration and exploitation) cannot be fully captured through their direct effects on profit performance, but that this relationship consists of mediating factors. This study proposes that the process of strategic learning, through its intraorganizational elements that enable the dissemination, interpretation, and implementation of strategic knowledge, enables firms to capitalize on the benefits of both exploration and exploitation strategies. Results from 206 Finnish software firms indicate that strategic learning fully mediates the relationship between exploration, exploitation, and profit performance. The result contributes by stressing the importance of strategic learning processes, especially in conjunction with entrepreneurial exploration strategies. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the effect from exploration to strategic learning is moderated by the level of exploitation. This moderation effect suggests that the strategic learning is limited, being a path dependent capability that favors exploitation over exploration when stretched. However, strategic learning effectively allows both types of strategies to improve profit performance. Copyright © 2012 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Second‐order competences and Schumpeterian rents
Author-Name: Danneels, Erwin
Abstract: Second-order competences, a type of dynamic capability, enable firms to engage in a process of Schumpeterian competition. This study examines the effects of marketing and R&D second-order competences (the abilities to create new market-related and technological resources) on firm profitability. Based on multiple informant surveys and archival data from U.S. public manufacturing firms, competitive turbulence is found to present contrasting contingencies for the effects of these competences on return on assets (ROA). The effect of marketing competence on ROA was positive under stable and moderate competitive conditions, whereas the effect of R&D competence on ROA was positive under volatile competitive conditions.

Title: The mortality problem of learning and mimetic practice in emerging industries: Dying to be legitimate
Author-Name: Miller, Justin I.
Abstract: This study seeks to disentangle claims of institutional and organizational learning theories and to shed light on the impact of Knightian (environmental) uncertainty in discovery opportunities. This article suggests, and finds empirical support for, the concept that emerging professional service industries retain high levels of causal ambiguity. High uncertainty interferes with institutional theory's claim of mortality reduction through isomorphism, but leads to superstitious learning, increasing organizational mortality hazard. Education and experience of entrepreneurs help them identify discovery (exogenous) opportunities for entrepreneurial rents, while high (but untheorized) levels of uncertainty interfere in their ability to successfully exploit these same opportunities.

Title: Amphibious entrepreneurs and the emergence of organizational forms
Author-Name: Powell, Walter W.

Abstract: We study the emergence of organizational forms, focusing on two mechanisms—reconfiguration and transposition—that distinguish the founding models of the first 26 biotechnology companies, all created in the industry's first decade, from 1972 to 1981. We analyze rich archival data using hierarchical cluster analysis, revealing four organizational variants of the dedicated biotech firm (DBF). Three were products of reconfiguration, as executives from Big Pharma used past practices to incorporate new science. One DBF variant resulted from ‘amphibious’ scientists who imported organizing ideas from the academy into their VC-funded start-ups. We argue that such transpositions are fragile, yet charged with generative possibilities. Copyright © 2012 Strategic Management Society.

Title: The impact of ipos on the values of directly competing incumbents

Author-Name: Baik, Yoon‐Suk
Abstract: Would an initial public offering (IPO) in a growing and uncertain industry have a positive or negative effect on directly competing incumbent firms in the industry? We assert that due to the risk and uncertainty inherent in a growing industry, a firm's IPO may send a positive market signal of growing industry demand. An IPO can send a signal to the investors of directly competing incumbents that the market is promising, and incumbent firms will enjoy a better future. If directly competing incumbent firms are capable of capturing these positive externalities, they will experience even greater positive results. In particular, an incumbent firm with a significant research and development investment may capture more of this increased demand in the industry. On the other hand, if a market segment is more concentrated, it is more likely that directly competing incumbents will suffer when another firm announces an IPO. We find supporting results for the various arguments of our initial question examining the computer-related service industry. We also present discussion and implications for our results.

Title: All the right moves: How entrepreneurial firms compete effectively
Author-Name: Katila, Riitta
Author-Name: Chen, Eric L.
Author-Name: Piezunka, Henning
Abstract: In this article, we examine competitive moves by which firms achieve superior performance. In contrast to prior work that has focused on moves and the related competitive advantages of large firms, we draw attention to entrepreneurial firms. Based on 32 runs of a multi-round experiential simulation and in-depth participant interviews, we find that entrepreneurial firms require competitive strategies that are different from those of a control group of comparable large firms. Entrepreneurial firms that stay below the radar in established markets and are quick to explore in new markets perform better. They succeed in established markets with a strategy that works around large firm competition but ultimately surprises them, and in new markets with a strategy that sets the standards of competition swiftly by continuously creating and destroying new strongholds ahead of large firms. Overall, successful entrepreneurs use a combination of selective, invisible, and asynchronous strategies that vary depending on whether the market is established or new. Our findings contribute to literatures on evolutionary learning, exploration and exploitation, and competitive dynamics. Copyright © 2012 Strategic Management Society.

Abstract: We add to the theory of entrepreneurial firm growth by inductively theorizing the processes through which new high-growth firms utilize their partnering portfolios to pursue distinctive approaches to growth. We extend the strategic perspective on entrepreneurial networks by identifying three mechanisms linking partnering portfolios to differences in firm growth: configuring partnering portfolios to pursue distinctive logics for sourcing external resources, aligning resource-sourcing and resource-linking logics in new product development, and embarking on different growth trajectories, which contribute to different performance patterns. These theoretical insights contribute to current understanding of the external and internal sources of heterogeneity in the performance of entrepreneurial firms.

Title: How firms learn heuristics: Uncovering missing components of organizational learning
Author-Name: Bingham, Christopher B.
Author-Name: Haleblian, Jerayr (John)
Abstract: This study explores how firms learn heuristics from negative outcomes. Prior literature has suggested that learning is strongly affected by whether attributions for negative outcomes are internal or external. Our data complement this view by revealing a new and different pattern. Specifically, they show that learning heuristics appears more dependent on whether attributions are convergent or divergent across hierarchical levels. Moreover, our data show that formal communication influences the convergence and divergence of those attributions. Besides setting forth an emergent framework for how firms learn heuristics and shedding light on the microfoundations of dynamic capabilities, a central contribution of this article is uncovering important missing components of organizational learning.

Abstract: This study takes an organizational decision-making perspective to examine when firms are likely to utilize CVC units as a mechanism for externalizing R&D. We draw insights from the behavioral theory of the firm to argue that managerial aspirations for innovation-related goals are an important driver of CVC initiatives within firms. We test our argument by examining both the adoption and termination of CVC units for a sample of information technology firms from 1992 to 2003. Results show that a firm is more likely to adopt and less likely to terminate a CVC unit when its innovation performance is closest to its social aspirations.

Title: Who Changes Course? The Role of Domain Knowledge and Novel Framing in Making Technology Changes
Author-Name: Furr, Nathan R.
Author-Name: Cavarretta, Fabrice
Author-Name: Garg, Sam
Abstract: The foundations of established firms are laid when, early in life, venture executives explore dynamic landscapes in search of opportunities. During this search, the executive team processes information that might signal the need to change, and their cognitive flexibility in processing this information affects the likelihood of such changes. While executive backgrounds affect this information processing, current literature does not identify how executive backgrounds impact the extent of change a firm undertakes. Therefore, we compare the effects of teams dominated by domain insiders, domain outsiders, and complementary teams (blending insiders and outsiders) on the likelihood of different degrees of technology change. In an examination of the population of U.S. solar photovoltaic manufacturing ventures from 1992 to 2007, we find that teams with extra-domain expertise, particularly at the CEO level, undertake more significant technology change. By contrast, intra-domain expertise has an inertial effect on change: even when combined in complementary team configurations, domain expertise reduces chances of significant technology change. These findings expand the discussion of types and antecedents of organization change, top management team composition, and the psychological foundations of strategy.

Title: The Causes and Consequences of Churn in Entrepreneurs’ Personal Networks
Author-Name: Vissa, Balagopal
Author-Name: Bhagavatula, Suresh
Abstract: This study examines the causes and consequences of churn in technology entrepreneurs’ (ego) core personal networks. Churn refers to the change in the composition of an entrepreneur's core personal network due to the entry of new network contacts (alters) or exit of existing network contacts. We draw on recent research describing networking styles to examine how a focal entrepreneur's networking actions affects churn in his/her core personal network and thereby increases his/her venture's portfolio of exchange partners. We find that entrepreneurs whose networking actions involve establishing greater interpersonal knowledge when interacting with strangers or relationally embedding ties with existing alters experience lesser network churn. In contrast, entrepreneurs whose networking actions involved greater time pacing of interactions with existing alters experienced greater network churn. The longitudinal empirical analysis on a sample of Indian high technology entrepreneurs operating business-to-business ventures provides support for our theoretical framework. We contribute to the entrepreneurial networks literature by systematically examining the dynamics of technology entrepreneurs’ core personal networks and their venture-level consequences.

Since returnees' effect on venture performance is the net effect of their advantages and disadvantages, contextual factors that can help them overcome their disadvantages should improve their ventures' performance. With a sample of new technology ventures in China, we find strong support for this argument. Copyright © 2012 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Venture failure, stigma, and impression management: A self‐verification, self‐determination view
Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean A.
Author-Name: Haynie, J. Michael
Abstract: We offer a theoretical basis for understanding how and to what end entrepreneurs employ impression management strategies in response to the negative attributions associated with the stigma of venture failure. Our framework offers counterintuitive insights into why some entrepreneurs stigmatized by failure will use impression management strategies to align their conception of self with how others perceive them—even if that means adopting a negative view of self. Our model highlights a potential paradox related to competing individual (the entrepreneur) and organizational goals, with regard to actions positioned to enhance the psychological well-being of the failed entrepreneur.

Title: When Stars Shine: The Effects of Faculty Founders on New Technology Ventures
Author-Name: Fuller, Anne W.
Author-Name: Rothaermel, Frank T.
Abstract: Despite the increasing importance of faculty entrepreneurship to technology diffusion, wealth creation, and economic growth, we know little about the effects that academic faculty turned entrepreneurs have on the performance of new technology ventures. We argue faculty inventors select their most promising projects for commercialization. We further posit that star faculty founders have positive effects on new venture performance, above and beyond that of the average faculty founder. In addition, we develop two contingency hypotheses to unearth specific situations when ‘stars shine.’ We posit that star faculty founders are able to overcome geographic distance to venture capitalists as well as the disadvantages of not being affiliated with a top research university. We test our hypotheses on a broad sample of 238 university-related new technology ventures at 65 U.S. universities. Copyright © 2012 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Are You Experienced or Are You Talented?: When Does Innate Talent versus Experience Explain Entrepreneurial Performance?
Author-Name: Eesley, Charles E.
Author-Name: Roberts, Edward B.
Abstract: We explore whether entrepreneurial performance is due to innate talent or the accumulation of entrepreneurial experience. Using a novel data set with multiple observations of founding attempts per individual, we generate a unique measure of entrepreneurial talent. In contrast to prior findings, the relative importance of experience versus talent changes with the context. When the current market or technology is familiar, experience dominates. However, when the venture context is unfamiliar, talent is more important. Individuals with experience and talent handle both familiar and unfamiliar aspects and may extract more from a given level of experience. The findings advance our understanding of how the drivers of venture performance shift with the broader technological and industry environment and places limits on when experience aids performance.

Title: Options in the Implementation Plan of Entrepreneurial Initiatives: Examining Firms' Attainment of Flexibility Benefit
Author-Name: Klingebiel, Ronald
Abstract: The value of real options has been discussed extensively—it helps explain managerial decisions in designing the rollout of bold initiatives in uncertain environments. However, few studies directly trace the impact of option usage on the performance of such entrepreneurial initiatives. Do all firms benefit from the flexibility that options confer? To answer this question, I collected detailed survey data on individual options designed into the implementation plans of entrepreneurial initiatives, focusing exclusively on options that were, eventually, in the money. The sample observations display significant variation in the degree to which flexibility benefit was realized from options, if at all. I find that this variance stems, in part, from heterogeneous organizational capability, regarding not only option creation but also option maintenance, exercise, and governance. These results imply that attainable benefit is highly firm specific. Holding valuable options does not predict performance of entrepreneurial initiatives, unless it is accompanied by active management of the option life cycle.

Title: Entrepreneurs’ Improvisational Behavior and Firm Performance: A Study of Dispositional and Environmental Moderators
Author-Name: Hmieleski, Keith M.
Author-Name: Corbett, Andrew C.
Author-Name: Baron, Robert A.
Abstract: Previous research indicates that improvisation—the deliberate extemporaneous composition and execution of novel action—is a key form of entrepreneurial behavior. It has been argued, however, that entrepreneurs’ improvisational behavior does not necessarily result in performance gains for their firms. Instead, a contingency perspective suggests that the effectiveness of entrepreneurs’ improvisational behavior depends on key moderating variables. Drawing on this framework, the current study uses a national (U.S.) random sample of new ventures to examine the interactive effects on firm performance of entrepreneurs’ improvisational behavior with key dispositional and environmental variables. Consistent with predictions, findings indicated that within the context of dynamic environments, the relationship between improvisational behavior and firm performance was significantly more negative for entrepreneurs who were high in optimism than it was for those who were moderate in optimism. In contrast, within the context of stable environments, results demonstrated marginally significant evidence that entrepreneurs’ improvisational behavior was more positively associated with firm performance for entrepreneurs who were high in optimism than it was for those who were moderate in optimism. Overall, results suggest that improvisational behavior can be an effective form of entrepreneurial action within rapidly and unpredictably shifting environments, but only when coupled with realistic levels of optimism.

Abstract: Knowledge flow between two firms has been found to be enhanced by both technological relatedness and social interaction. We build on work in education psychology and consider how cognitive and social aspects of learning may be compensatory. Using a sample of 61 alliances involving Eli Lilly and its partners, we find the importance of social interaction between Lilly and its partner to partner learning decreased as their technological relatedness increased. Likewise, the importance of technological relatedness to partner learning decreased as social interaction increased. This study provides nuance on the criticality of technological relatedness and social interaction for learning. Copyright © 2012 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Capability Development and Decision Incongruence in Strategic Opportunity Pursuit
Author-Name: Robert Mitchell, J.
Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean A.
Abstract: In strategic opportunity pursuit, decision incongruence (the gap between the decision-making rationale that an individual conveys to others and the rationale that informs his/her actual decisions) can lead to difficulties achieving the commitment necessary to grow a venture. To understand why some individuals have greater decision incongruence in strategic opportunity pursuit than others, we conducted a field experiment to test how a configuration of theoretically-based capability-building mechanisms—codification, general human capital, and specific human capital—affected 127 CEOs' decision incongruence. The results indicate that codification decreases decision incongruence the most for CEOs with low general but high specific human capital. Copyright © 2012 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Networking Ability and the Financial Performance of New Ventures: A Mediation Analysis among Younger and More Mature Firms

Author-Name: Sigmund, Stefan
Abstract: We hypothesize that entrepreneurs' networking ability—an individual-level skill widely studied in career research—positively influences new ventures' financial performance. Additionally, we propose that this impact is mediated by new ventures' network characteristics and moderated by venture age. When testing our hypotheses based on a sample of 146 German entrepreneurs, we find them largely confirmed. Our results show a significant relationship between entrepreneurs' networking ability and their new ventures' financial performance, which is mediated by new ventures' network size and the strength of network relationships. Additionally, the relationships observed are salient for younger but not for more mature firms. Copyright © 2012 Strategic Management Society.

Author-Name: Pitelis, Christos N.
Abstract: Public organizations are relatively understudied in the strategic entrepreneurship literature. In this article, we submit that public organizations are usefully analyzed as entities that create and capture value in both the private and public sectors and that a capabilities lens sheds important new insights on their behavior. As they try to create and capture value, public organizations can act entrepreneurially by creating or leveraging bundles of capabilities, which may then shape subsequent entrepreneurial action. Such processes can involve complex interactions among public and private actors. For example, public organizations often partner with private firms to produce existing products, create new products, and establish new markets which, in turn, generate new capabilities for both public and private actors. Yet such coevolutionary processes are not guaranteed to create value, and capabilities acquired in the pursuit of public interests may, over time, enable activities that damage those same interests. We show how a capabilities approach helps explain the nature and evolution of public organizations and we apply this approach to a series of cases on the growth and diversification of public organizations, the private provision of public goods, and related issues.

Title: How Strategic Entrepreneurship and The Institutional Context Drive Economic Growth
Author-Name: Bjørnskov, Christian
Author-Name: Foss, Nicolai
Abstract: The economics of growth has shown that countries grow by better allocating whatever resources are at their disposal and by introducing productivity-enhancing innovations. Strategic entrepreneurship plays a key role in this process by searching for, combining, trying out, etc., new resource combinations in the pursuit of profits under uncertainty. Institutions that support economic freedom allow such experimentation to take place at low transaction costs, positively influencing total factor productivity. We test these ideas on a unique panel data set derived from Compendia, World Bank data, and the Fraser Institute's economic freedom data. Copyright © 2013 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Private Entrepreneurs in Public Services: A Longitudinal Examination of Outsourcing and Statization of Prisons
Author-Name: Cabral, Sandro

Author-Name: Azevedo, Paulo Furquim
Abstract: Some fear that the profit-maximizing orientation of private entrepreneurs conflicts with societal goals expected in the provision of complex public services. Received contractual theories advocate that private involvement in public services will result in cost reductions at the expense of quality. Using prisons as our empirical context, we benefit from an event involving the outsourcing and subsequent statization of correctional facilities in Brazil. Triangulating between quantitative and qualitative information, we do not find evidence of quality deterioration in outsourced prisons and suggest that a key mechanism driving this result is the presence of public supervisors closely working on-site with private entrepreneurs in a hybrid governance fashion. We then deliver a set of new propositions that move beyond hazard considerations to examine how the combination of heterogeneous public and private capabilities might yield learning and spillover effects unattainable through pure government management or full-fledged privatization.

Title: Endogenous growth through knowledge spillovers in entrepreneurship: an empirical test
Author-Name: Delmar, Frédéric

Abstract: Endogenous growth theory suggests that technological knowledge stimulates growth, yet the micro-foundations of this process remain obscure. Knowledge spillover theory posits that growth is contingent on the technology dependence of industries, forming the landscape for entrepreneurs to launch and grow ventures. We investigate these theoretical contingencies with two research questions using comprehensive employee-employer data documenting the science and technology labor force in Sweden. First, do industries with a greater need for new technology-based entrepreneurship grow disproportionately faster than other industries? Second, are the knowledge spillover effects fostering the growth of new technology-based firms contingent on certain industry structures? Copyright © 2011 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Optimization or Bricolage? Overcoming Resource Constraints in Global Social Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Desa, Geoffrey
Author-Name: Basu, Sandip
Abstract: Resources play a vital role in the development of an entrepreneurial venture. For ventures operating in the public interest, the process of effective resource mobilization can be especially critical to the social mission. However, there has been limited empirical examination of the approaches used by social ventures to mobilize critical resources. We study two processes of resource mobilization—optimization and bricolage, and examine the antecedent conditions that influence a venture's selection of these processes. Our theory predicts that environmental munificence and organizational prominence have U-shaped associations with the use of bricolage and positive associations with the use of optimization. We test our hypotheses on a sample of 202 technology social ventures from 42 countries and discuss implications for the social entrepreneurship and broader entrepreneurship literatures.

Title: Do Innovative Users Generate More Useful Insights? An Analysis of Corporate Venture Capital Investments in the Medical Device industry
Author-Name: Smith, Sheryl Winston
Author-Name: Shah, Sonali K.
Abstract: Users are an important source of innovation. Scholars have suggested that established firms will gain valuable innovative insights by working with user innovators. However, no study compares the extent to which knowledge sourced from innovative users, as compared to other external sources of knowledge, triggers the creation of new technologies and commercial products within established firms. This leaves established firms with little guidance when it comes to choosing where to search for external knowledge that ignites innovation. Based on existing empirical work in the literature on user innovation, we build a theoretical framework that explains why user knowledge will provide established firms with more ‘useful’ innovative insights than will other sources of knowledge. We test this claim in the context of corporate venture capital investment in the medical device industry. We find that established firms incorporate more knowledge from user innovators than from other sources of external knowledge into their patents and highly innovative products. Accessing the knowledge contained in user-generated innovations enriches the product development outcomes of established firms. We trace the flow of knowledge from start-ups to established firms using both an established method based on backward patent citation data and a novel algorithmic method that compares the content of regulatory documents.

Author-Name: Wales, William J.

Author-Name: Kreiser, Patrick M.
Abstract: This research examines the nature of the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and small firm performance. The results from a sample of 258 Swedish small firms indicate an inverted U-shaped relationship between EO and small firm performance. Drawing upon resource orchestration theory, we theorize that information and communication technology capability and network capability help small firms overcome their resource-related ‘liabilities of smallness’ and observe these capabilities to increase the optimal levels and performance-related returns from EO. In the absence of these capabilities, returns to firm performance from increasing EO were observed to reach harmful levels. The study implications are discussed.

Title: Collaborative Benefits and Coordination Costs: Learning and Capability Development in Science
Author-Name: Onal Vural, M.

Abstract: We examine the effects of team structure and experience on the impact of inventions produced by scientific teams. Whereas multidisciplinary, collaborative teams have become the norm in scientific production, there are coordination costs commensurate with managing such teams. We use patent citation analysis to examine the effect of prior collaboration and patenting experience on invention impact of 282 patents granted in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research from 1998 to 2010. Our results reveal that team experience outside the domain may be detrimental to project performance in a setting where the underlying knowledge changes. In stem cell science, we show that interdepartmental collaboration has a negative effect on invention impact. Scientific proximity between members of the team has a curvilinear relationship, suggesting that teams consisting of members with moderate proximity get the highest impact. We elaborate on these findings for theories of collaboration and coordination and its implications for radical scientific discoveries. Copyright © 2013 Strategic Management Society.

Abstract: This study advances research on business planning by integrating and reconciling the institutional and strategic planning perspectives to explore the performance implications of both formal and informal business planning.

Using a dataset of two waves of interviews with 313 founders in China, we found that both formal and informal business planning can benefit new ventures. Interestingly, as a unique contingency factor in the Chinese context, social class moderates only the link between formal planning and performance, whereas prior work experience moderates the effects of both formal and informal planning on performance.

Our results indicate that signaling organizational virtue in prospectuses leads to higher levels of foreign IPO performance, which is positively moderated by perceived home country corruption.

Title: A Contextualized Transactive Memory System View on How Founding Teams Respond to Surprises: Evidence from China
Author-Name: Zheng, Yanfeng
Author-Name: Mai, Yiyuan
Abstract: Entrepreneurs in emerging economies face not only more opportunities but also heightened levels of uncertainties than their peers in developed economies. They, therefore, frequently encounter surprising events arising from rapid and chaotic environmental changes. Extant research, however, provides only sketchy accounts regarding how founding teams respond to surprises. In this study, we propose that founding teams' transactive memory systems (TMS) situated in the unique contextual conditions prevalent in most emerging economies will affect their perceptions regarding how to bridge the knowledge gaps arising from surprises. We test our hypotheses with survey data collected from 137 start-ups in China. Our results suggest that in emerging economies where market supporting institutions are deficient, founding teams with strong TMSs are less inclined to acquire external knowledge but are more prone to improvise in response to surprises than founding teams with weak TMSs. Negative surprises seem to strengthen the above relationships. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of this study. Copyright © 2013 Strategic Management Society.

Abstract: What drives new ventures to internationalize from emerging economies to developed economies? To answer this underexplored question, we bring together theory at the intersection of international entrepreneurship and strategy in emerging economies. Focusing on intangible resources, we theorize that international expansion of new ventures from emerging economies is driven by their desire to enhance domestic reputation, to exploit their stocks of prior knowledge, and to explore benefits of incoming knowledge flows. We find support for our hypotheses using a cross-country sample of new ventures from two major emerging economies—China and India. Copyright © 2013 Strategic Management Society.

Author-Name: Kang, Hyoung‐Goo

Author-Name: Mitchell, Will
Abstract: Research concerning diversification and specialization of venture capital funds typically does not consider how a VC's effort might influence performance of different portfolios. We develop a model that analyzes VC effort when there is the potential for cross-sectional and/or serial knowledge spillover among projects. The model generates two implications concerning VC effort and performance. First, VC post-investment effort is a nonmonotonic function of performance shocks, especially for diversified VCs. Second, greater cross-sectional and serial knowledge spillovers improve the performance of specialization relative to diversification, and shape how the number of decision stages in a project affects portfolio choice.

Abstract: We employ a historical case narrative of the Indian telephony sector to inductively develop a process model of institutional change in an industry within an emerging economy. Our findings highlight the turbulent nature of migrating institutional logics—one that involves processes we term subverting, maneuvering and bolstering. We demonstrate how these institutional dynamics impact entrepreneurial activity and explicate the role of the state as a constrained institutional entrepreneur in these scenarios. In highlighting the contested and capricious nature of such migration, we make contributions to the institutions-based view of strategy and entrepreneurship and the institutional logics and institutional entrepreneurship literatures.

Author-Name: Paik, Yongwook
Abstract: This article investigates the effects of prior firm founding experience, prior venture capital (VC) financing experience, and prior success with regard to subsequent venture survival by distinguishing serial entrepreneurs with and without prior VC financing experience. My analysis shows that ventures founded by serial entrepreneurs perform better than those founded by novice entrepreneurs regardless of whether entrepreneurs had prior success or failure. However, contrary to expectations, this study finds that serial entrepreneurs without prior VC financing experience perform better than serial entrepreneurs with prior VC financing experience, suggesting that there may be an inadvertent cost of learning about the VCs.

Abstract: Theoretically, social capital allows entrepreneurial firms to capitalize on learning advantages of newness and gain access to knowledge as the foundation for improved performance. But this understates its complexity. We consider whether learning through social capital relationships has a direct effect on performance and whether absorptive capacity mediates and moderates this relationship. We find that network-based learning has no direct relationship with performance, but this is mediated in each instance by absorptive capacity and is moderated twice. Our findings challenge the learning advantages of newness thesis and reveal how absorptive capacity can enable business performance from a firm's network relationships.

Title: Explaining the Variance in Underpricing among Venture Capital‐Backed IPOs: A Comparison Between Private and Corporate VC Firms
Author-Name: Wang, Xiaodan ‘Abby’
Author-Name: Wan, William P.
Abstract: In this study, we argue from the resource-based view and multiple agency theory that private and corporate VC firms have different impacts on IPO underpricing among VC-backed IPOs due to their different interests, motivations, and resources. Private VC firms are primarily financial oriented, but corporate VC firms generally are strategic in orientation. Using a sample of 200 VC-backed IPOs from 2000 to 2007, we found support for the hypotheses that among VC-backed IPOs, private VC ownership is positively associated with underpricing, whereas corporate VC ownership is negatively associated with underpricing.

Title: Firm‐Specific Determinants of Product Line Technology Strategies in High Technology Markets
Author-Name: Sarangee, Kumar R.
Author-Name: Echambadi, Raj
Abstract: In high technology industries, product line technology strategies are critical to firm success. However, the determinants of these product line strategies are still unclear. We suggest that a joint consideration of firm size, firm age, and pre-entry experience better explains the choice of a specific strategy. Results obtained from the personal computer industry reveal that larger firms and older firms were more likely to pursue broad product line technology strategies, whereas the oldest firms reverted to a narrow technology strategy after a particular age. Furthermore, the contingent relationships between firm size, firm age, and pre-entry experience also yielded interesting results. Copyright © 2013 Strategic Management Society.

Title: The Selection and Nurturing Effects of Corporate Investors on New Venture Innovativeness
Author-Name: Park, Haemin Dennis
Author-Name: Steensma, H. Kevin
Abstract: Corporate investors can provide valuable resources to their new venture investees, but their interests may conflict with those of independent venture capitalist (IVC) coinvestors. We explore how the preferences, resources, and influence of corporate investors vis-à-vis their IVC coinvestors affect their selection of investment opportunities and subsequent nurturing of new venture investees. We show that corporate investors tend to fund new ventures with greater pre-funding innovative capabilities and new ventures receiving corporate funding exhibit greater post-funding rates of innovation compared to those funded solely by IVCs, particularly when their corporate investors are highly reputable relative to their IVC coinvestors.

Title: Anticipatory Learning
Author-Name: Bingham, Christopher B.
Author-Name: Kahl, Steven
Abstract: Learning from negative outcomes is of fundamental interest to scholars. Yet most research in this area explores learning from actual outcomes. By contrast, we add to the literature by setting forth a theoretical framework that highlights learning from the anticipation of negative outcomes rather than actual outcomes. Using an inductive, multiple case research design, we develop an emergent typology for how anticipatory learning occurs. We show how each type of anticipatory learning is triggered and uniquely influences search and solutions. We also detail how anticipatory learning is similar to, but different than, learning from actual negative outcomes. A central contribution of this study is setting forth anticipatory learning as a primary form (versus a special case) of learning in most organizations. We conclude by identifying implications for organization theory and strategy. Copyright © 2013 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Entrepreneurial Opportunities, Implicit Contracts, and Market Making for Complex Consumer Goods
Author-Name: Godley, Andrew Christopher
Abstract: This article extends the theory of entrepreneurial opportunity exploitation, outlining how under certain conditions, opportunity exploitation is dependent on market making innovations. Where adverse selection and moral hazard characterize markets, consumers are likely to withdraw regardless of product quality. In order to overcome consumer resistance, entrepreneurs must signal credible commitments. But because consumers purchase without fully specifying requirements, entrepreneurs' commitments take the partial form of implicit contracts, creating strong mutual commitments to repeated transactions. These commitments enable novel markets to function, but introduce additional costs. This article illustrates the theory with the historic case of Singer in sewing machines. © 2013 The Author.

Author-Name: Volberda, Henk W.
Abstract: This study proposes top management team (TMT) shared leadership as an important enabler of organizational ambidexterity. Moreover, we examine both how and when TMT shared leadership enhances organizational ambidexterity by considering two TMT processes as mediators (i.e., cooperative conflict management style and decision-making comprehensiveness) and two elements of organizational structure (i.e., connectedness and centralization of decision making) as important contingencies. We test our moderated mediation framework using time-lagged data from a cross-industry sample of 202 firms. We discuss how our findings extend strategic entrepreneurship, ambidexterity, and leadership research and provide implications for practice. Copyright © 2013 Strategic Management Society.

Title: International Alliances with Competitors and Non‐Competitors: The Disparate Impact on Sme International Performance
Author-Name: Nakos, George

Author-Name: Dimitratos, Pavlos
Abstract: The international entrepreneurship literature maintains that small- and medium-size firms can suffer from resource constraints as they move abroad. To alleviate this problem, research suggests participating in strategic alliances. We develop and test the theoretical perspective that not all alliances are the same; cooperative agreements with non-competitors and competitors have disparate direct and moderating impacts on international performance. Based on an analysis of 162 British and U.S. private SMEs, our results indicate that alliances with non-competitors are positively associated with international performance, but that alliances with competitors are negatively related. In addition, our findings suggest that in alliances with non-competitors, entrepreneurial orientation helps SMEs increase international performance and that in alliances with competitors, entrepreneurial orientation simply reduces the negative impact.

Title: In the mood for entrepreneurial creativity? How optimal group affect differs for generating and selecting ideas for new ventures
Author-Name: Perry‐Smith, Jill E.
Author-Name: Coff, Russell W.
Abstract: Superior entrepreneurial creativity arises when teams are effective at both generating diverse alternatives and culling them to select the best solution. We develop theory about how the optimal group mood varies for the generation and selection stages of creativity. Using data from an entrepreneurial creativity task, we find that these stages require distinct collective moods. While an activated-pleasant mood promotes variance generation, idea selection requires a very different mood. Findings suggest that some teams fail to make transitions to the appropriate mood. We conclude by discussing implications for promoting entrepreneurial creativity. Copyright © 2011 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Simultaneous Experimentation as a Learning Strategy: Business Model Development Under Uncertainty
Author-Name: Andries, Petra
Author-Name: Debackere, Koenraad
Author-Name: Looy, Bart
Abstract: Ventures operating under uncertainty face challenges defining a sustainable value proposition. Six longitudinal case studies reveal two approaches to business model development: focused commitment and simultaneous experimentation. While focused commitment positively affects initial growth, this commitment and lack of variety jeopardize long-term survival. Simultaneous experimentation implies lower initial growth levels, but facilitates long-term survival by enacting variety in a resource-effective manner. This article enriches organizational learning theory by demonstrating that not only distant search but also simultaneous experimentation results in variety. Moreover, simultaneous experimentation implies effectual behavior and reconciles the apparent juxtaposition between ‘action’ and ‘planning.’ Copyright © 2013 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Source and Patterns of Organizational Defiance of Formal Institutions: Insights from Nollywood, the Nigerian Movie Industry

Abstract: We extend research on informal economic activity and investigate why organizations adopt informal rules when formal ones exist and how and why patterns of defiance vary across organizations. We build on data from an in-depth study of four organizations operating in the Nigerian movie industry. We identify ambiguity of formal institutions as a major source of organizational defiance. We also find that the organization's domain of embeddedness mediates the relationship between institutional ambiguity and organizational defiance. According to our analysis, the rationale for organizing propelled by the dominant domain of embeddedness affects whether organizations consistently or selectively defy ambiguous formal rules. Our findings highlight the importance of the interplay between institutional and organizational dynamics in understanding informality within an economy. Copyright © 2014 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Shades of Grey: How do Informal Firms Navigate Between Macro and Meso Institutional Environments?
Author-Name: De Castro, Julio O.

Author-Name: Bruton, Garry D.
Abstract: Our qualitative research shows that when making decisions about informality, entrepreneurs in emerging economies purposefully navigate between the enabling and constraining rules of the macro institutional environment and the norms of the meso institutional environment. We show that: (1) informality is a multidimensional continuum along which path to formalization unfolds; (2) as entrepreneurs grow more successful they become simultaneously more attuned to the countervailing constraints of both the macro and meso institutional environments; and (3) informal firms and formal firms weave together an exchange system that legitimizes the persistence of informality. In the context of informality, meso institutions serve as the connective tissue which cross-link levels of the environment and shape the context in which entrepreneurs make decisions.

Abstract: Base-of-the-Pyramid (BoP) enterprises seek to serve impoverished customers in informal markets. While BoP enterprises have grown in prominence, comparatively little multidimensional theoretical work has explored why these customers ultimately elect to purchase their products. Using a sample of 555 potential customers in rural India, our results indicate that the influence of different dimensions of poverty on likelihood of purchase is largely a function of the strength of the formal institutional environment. Specifically, stronger formal institutional environments can act as both a complement to, and a substitute for, the influence of individual- and network-level norms on purchasing decisions in informal markets.

Abstract: Scholarly attention to strategy and entrepreneurship within the informal economy appears to be on the rise, but a large gap remains between the importance of the informal economy and the amount of research that is devoted to it. The survey reported herein is an effort to offer insights to researchers who wish to help build the knowledge base about strategy and entrepreneurship within the informal economy. Specifically, we surveyed members of the Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal's editorial board regarding what they view as the most promising theories, research questions, and methods to leverage in order to develop greater understanding of the informal economy. Board members' views vary, but in general institutional theory and network theory are seen as the best perspectives to fuel major contributions at this time. The research questions that attracted the strongest support centered on the boundaries of and interchanges between the formal and informal economies. Finally, field interviews, case studies, and ethnography were ranked as the most promising investigative methods. Taken together, these findings offer a possible agenda for research into the informal economy. Copyright © 2014 Strategic Management Society.

Author-Name: Ketchen, David J.
Abstract: The informal economy consists of business activities that occur outside of formal institutional boundaries but within the boundaries of informal institutions. A large gap exists between the significant importance of the informal economy to commerce around the world and the small amount of informal economy research with which entrepreneurship and strategic management scholars have been involved. As a step toward filling this gap, this special issue includes four articles with the potential to significantly advance our understanding of business activities within the informal economy. In introducing these four articles, we discuss the myriad activities that fall within the boundaries of the informal economy and distinguish between the institutional foundations of informality in developed versus developing economies. The articles included within the special issue each offer a unique understanding of how entrepreneurs are influenced by and manage their institutional contexts in various informal economy settings, providing contributions that should give rise to a series of promising future research questions.

Author-Name: Yiu, Daphne W.
Author-Name: Hoskisson, Robert E.
Author-Name: Bruton, Garry D.
Author-Name: Lu, Yuan
Abstract: Focusing on a period of institutional friction when institutions are in transition, this study examines the dueling institutional logics that simultaneously operated as business groups were implemented to foster strategic entrepreneurship activities in China. Our findings from 1,095 Chinese business group-affiliated firms show that the original institutional logic of state control and ownership remains a potent factor, while the new institutional logic in support of strategic entrepreneurship takes place through business groups' informal and formal organization controls. Further, the state logic causes rigidity and inflexibility for firms to react to the new institutional demands, thus weakening the positive effects of business group formal and informal controls on strategic entrepreneurship. This study contributes to the institution-based view by highlighting that dueling logics coexist in business groups and investigating how they can be sources of variation in advancing strategic entrepreneurship during periods of institutional friction.

Title: How do Corporate Venture Capitalists do Deals? An Exploration of Corporate Investment Practices
Author-Name: Souitaris, Vangelis
Author-Name: Zerbinati, Stefania
Abstract: How do corporate venture capitalists (CVCs) do deals? Conversations with CVCs suggest that the putative view of venture capital investing is incomplete. We draw on 13 cases of CVC programs to document eight ‘corporate investment practices’ that are unique to CVCs. These practices reflect pressure on the CVC units for strategic fit and engagement with the corporation and also an opportunity to utilize parental resources. We then show that CVCs vary their emphasis on corporate investment practices, diverging into two distinct investment logics, ‘integrated’ versus ‘arm's-length.’ Focus of isomorphism on internal versus external stakeholders explains the emergence of the two logics.

Abstract: The age distribution of a population may influence aggregate entrepreneurship and economic growth. Because of rigidities in the mobility of resources and the substitutability of employment across age groups, countries whose populations are excessively skewed toward old or young cohorts may experience low levels of entrepreneurial activity. We develop a model characterizing the conditions sufficient for aggregate entrepreneurship to decrease as a population ages or becomes younger. At a time when poorer countries confront unprecedented increases in population and developed ones see their populations aging, we provide important insights on the relationship between demographic structure, aggregate entrepreneurship, and growth.

Abstract: The nature of economic opportunity has recently received significant attention in entrepreneurship, organization science and strategy. The notion of boundedly rational search on an (NK) opportunity landscape has been particularly relevant to these conversations and debates. We argue that the focus on bounded rationality and search is highly problematic for the fields of entrepreneurship and strategy and does not allow us to explain the origins of economic novelty. We contrast the NP problem with the frame problem to illustrate our point, and highlight the role of adjacent possibilities and novel affordances. We discuss the entrepreneurial and economic implications of these arguments by building on unique insights from biology, the natural and computational sciences.

Title: The Academic Entrepreneur: A Biographical Sketch of Ian C. MacMillan's Contributions to Establishing the Field of Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: McGrath, Rita Gunther
Abstract: Ian C. MacMillan, originally from Africa, is a seminal figure in forging the contours of the present-day field of entrepreneurship. He was the first to empirically explore topics such as venture capital decision making; entrepreneurial networks; cultural influences on entrepreneurial behavior; and many issues in corporate venturing. Through the creation of vibrant, global, scholarly networks, the founding of the Journal of Business Venturing, his dedication to training and mentoring the next generation of scholars, and establishing the first large-scale systematic global data collection in the field, Mac has made an irreplaceable contribution to the well-established field that entrepreneurship has become. He and his students have been acknowledged as having made significant breakthroughs in our understanding of entrepreneurial phenomena, recognized by a burgeoning number of awards and testaments to scholarly recognition. He argues that the challenge for future researchers will be to tackle big, messy problems that do not lend themselves to the popular methodologies employed by academia today.

Author-Name: Morris, Shad
Abstract: While templates may facilitate knowledge sharing within the base-of-the-pyramid, it is often necessary for entrepreneurs to adapt the template for reasons of resource scarcity. We explore the role of social interaction in determining whether these adaptations are beneficial or detrimental. Our results suggest that interactions between the entrepreneur and technical experts who understand the ‘why’ behind each practice can result in improved performance while interactions with entrepreneurial peers can produce more varied results. Thus, the type of knowledge generated through social interaction plays a significant role in the degree to which adaptations to templates are principled versus presumptive in nature.

Abstract: This article studies entrepreneurs' forecast errors around market entry. Using data on nascent entrepreneurs in the U.S. and start-ups in Finland, we find that besides being overoptimistic on average in both countries, entrepreneurs' survival expectations can barely distinguish survival from exits. Moreover, about one fourth of the entrepreneurs do not provide an estimate for the survival of a typical venture. However, among those that do provide it, the estimates are less overoptimistic. We also compare the forecast accuracy of entrepreneurs to those of macroeconomic forecasters. Our findings provide guidance for the development of positive theories of entrepreneurial belief formation and overoptimism. Copyright © 2014 Strategic Management Society.

Author-Name: Wuebker, Robert
Author-Name: Hampl, Nina
Author-Name: Wüstenhagen, Rolf
Abstract: Drawing from social network theory, scholars have identified two ways in which social ties influence venture capital investment decisions: directly through personal ties and indirectly through status hierarchies. Previous research has examined these effects independently. Our study is the first to perform a joint examination of the role of social ties and status hierarchies in venture capital decision making. We examine the relative importance of these two mechanisms through an adaptive choice-based conjoint experiment comprising of 3,132 investment decisions made by 86 venture capitalists from the United States and Europe. Our experimental context allows us to explore whether, under high levels of market uncertainty, strong personal ties exert more influence over investment decisions than the presence of a high-status investor in the deal. We also explore the moderating effects that market structure and experience play in shaping these decision processes. Our findings reveal that personal ties are more important in venture capital decision making when compared to the relative status of other venture capital firms participating in the investment syndicate. Building on our main findings, we show that the influence of personal ties is less pronounced in the European investment community, as compared to more densely networked U.S. investors. We also find a U-shaped relationship between venture capitalist experience and the influence of personal networks on investment decisions. Copyright © 2014 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Changing the Business Model: Effects of Venture Capital Firms and Outside CEOs on Portfolio Company Performance
Author-Name: Gerasymenko, Violetta
Author-Name: De Clercq, Dirk
Author-Name: Sapienza, Harry J.
Abstract: This study extends extant research on business model change by examining the impact of venture capital firms (VCFs) on the performance of young ventures that have substantially changed their business model. The analysis, using a unique dataset of 163 venture capital-backed portfolio companies (PFCs), reveals a positive relationship between the scope of VCF involvement and PFC performance. Furthermore, the VCFs' experience with business model change and the recruitment of an outside CEO to the PFC both increase the positive impact of VCF involvement. These findings have implications for theory and practice. Copyright © 2014 Strategic Management Society.

Author-Name: Nordqvist, Mattias
Abstract: We contrast the performance consequences of intra-family versus external ownership transfers. Investigating a sample of all private family firms in Sweden that went through ownership transfers during 10 years, we find that firms transferred to external owners outperform those transferred within the family, but that survival is higher among intra-family transfers. We attribute these performance differences to the long-term orientation of family firms passed on to the next generation and to the entrepreneurial willingness of acquirers to bear uncertainty. Based on distinct ownership transition routes and theoretical mechanisms explaining performance differences, we outline implications for family business and entrepreneurship research.

Abstract: We develop an analytical framework on the basis of the economics of business performance to provide quantitative insight into the link between a firm's business model choices and their profit consequences. The method is applied to Walmart by building a qualitative representation of its business model and mapping that representation on an analytical model that quantifies the company's sources of advantage over time. The analysis suggests that the effectiveness of a particular business model depends not only on its design (its levers and how they relate to one another) but, most importantly, on its implementation (how the levers are pulled).

Title: Unlocking the Hidden Value of Concepts: A Cognitive Approach to Business Model Innovation

Author-Name: Rindova, Violina P.
Author-Name: Greenbaum, Bruce E.
Abstract: We advance a theory of how business models can be innovated proactively in the absence of exogenous changes, through processes of generative cognition. We contribute to the cognitive perspective in strategy by analyzing business models as schemas that organize managerial understandings about the design of firms' value-creating activities and exchanges and by theorizing how they can be innovated through processes for proactive schema change. Drawing on cognitive psychology research on two major cognitive processes through which individuals change their schema to cope with novelty, analogical reasoning and conceptual combination, we theorize firm-level strategic processes for designing innovative business models.

Title: Explorative Versus Exploitative Business Model Change: The Cognitive Antecedents of Firm‐Level Responses to Disruptive Innovation
Author-Name: Osiyevskyy, Oleksiy
Author-Name: Dewald, Jim
Abstract: We develop a typology of incumbent adaptations to emerging disruptive business model innovations, based on two generic strategies: (1) explorative adoption of a disruptive business model; and (2) exploitative strengthening of the existing business model. We derive and test hypotheses concerning the cognitive antecedents of managerial intentions to embrace each of the two adaptation strategies. The results from our study of the real estate brokerage industry show that the explorative intentions are driven by opportunity perception, perceived performance-reducing threat, and risk experience. Exploitative intentions are negatively associated with perceived critical threat and industry tenure and positively associated with risk experience. We contribute to the literature on disruptive business models by combining prior research into a definable framework and by testing the cognitive influences on strategic response.

Title: Business Model Innovation Performance: When does Adding a New Business Model Benefit an Incumbent?
Author-Name: Kim, Stephen K.
Author-Name: Min, Sungwook
Abstract: Many incumbent firms respond to the emergence of a disruptive business model by adding the business model into their existing ones. But, not all incumbents perform better after adding new business models to their existing ones; that raises the question about the conditions under which adding a new business model improves incumbent performance. We develop a theoretical framework to address that question. After identifying two types of incumbent assets, complementary and conflicting, we highlight the influence of two managerial choices—timing and organizational mode of the new business model addition—that create opportunities to translate the potential provided by incumbent assets into higher performance. The proposed discriminating alignment thesis states that incumbent performance after new business model addition improves when the incumbent firm aligns complementary assets with earlier addition of the new business model and conflicting assets with an autonomous business unit for the new business model. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed the performance change of those physical store-based retailers that added online retailing as a new business model. The test results supported all hypotheses, and key theoretical and managerial implications are presented. Copyright © 2015 Strategic Management Society.

Author-Name: Demil, Benoît

Author-Name: Ricart, Joan E.
Author-Name: Zott, Christoph
Abstract: The study of business models involves exploring how firms do business at the system level. It lies at the intersection of strategy and entrepreneurship research and is, therefore, a topic of interest for scholars of strategic entrepreneurship. The purpose of this special issue is to publish work that develops theory on business models, or empirically investigates the phenomenon, and to inspire future research on the topic. In our introduction, we briefly review the main conceptual developments of the past two decades. We highlight three contributions that business model research is poised to make to the domain of strategic entrepreneurship, and, by extension, to its constituent disciplines of strategy and entrepreneurship: (1) reconnecting strategy with entrepreneurship; (2) suggesting a more central place for customers in our frameworks and analyses; and (3) emphasizing the importance of implementation. We subsequently present the articles in this special issue and explain how they relate to these themes. We conclude with suggestions for future research.

Title: Proposing Social Resources as the Fundamental Catalyst Toward Opportunity Creation
Author-Name: Tocher, Neil

Author-Name: Hall, Dianne J.
Abstract: The growing body of research on the creation view of opportunities suggests that social processes between potential entrepreneurs and interested parties often account for why many technically brilliant business ideas are abandoned sometime between conceptualization and market launch. Surprisingly though, few studies have comprehensively examined the different roles various categories of social resources play at different stages of the opportunity-creation process. Hence, the present article fills this gap by outlining how the unique resources of social capital and social competence facilitate entrepreneurs' ability to guide imagined ideas through the multistage, path dependent, socially complex opportunity-creation process.

Abstract: The subjective belief that an opportunity allows value generation is a key driver of entrepreneurial action. We advance research on opportunity evaluation by investigating how people may diverge in their views of what defines an attractive business opportunity; that is, we seek to understand heterogeneity among individuals' ‘opportunity templates.’ Using unique data from a conjoint experiment with 141 respondents (6,728 opportunity evaluations), our analysis reveals significant differences in the opportunity preferences of individuals with technological, management, and entrepreneurship experience. We also find that people with specialist experience (technology) emphasize fewer opportunity dimensions than people with generalist experience (management, entrepreneurship).

Abstract: We examine the impact of nascent entrepreneurs' cognitive attributes and human capital on business planning behavior. We find that entrepreneurial self-efficacy facilitates development of formal business plans and entrepreneurial perseverance promotes engaging in business planning activities. Further, advanced academic education leads nascent entrepreneurs to engage in business planning activities and create formal business plans, but prior work experience has a marginal effect on business plan formality. The results further indicate that a nascent entrepreneur's striving for outside financing promotes business planning activities, while being in a supportive environment or a member of a business association does not impact business planning behavior.

Author-Name: Liu, Gordon
Abstract: Through analyzing in-depth interview data obtained from representatives of U.K.-based social enterprises, we explore how traditional third-sector organizations acquire entrepreneurial knowledge via knowledge spillover and use this to transform themselves into more market-driven, businesslike social enterprises. An integrated framework for knowledge spillover is developed to highlight the connection with organizational efforts at each stage of the knowledge spillover process; this framework assists organizations in collecting leaked knowledge and turning it into both organizational action and specific social and human capital that can play an important role in facilitating these connections. This research contributes toward our further understanding of the knowledge spillover phenomenon. Copyright © 2015 Strategic Management Society.

Title: The Effect of Defense Agency Funding of University Research on Regional New Venture Creation

Author-Name: Gilbert, Brett Anitra
Abstract: This study explores the effects of defense agency funding of university research on regional new venture creation. We argue that ‘closed’ university research may constrain the direct flow of new knowledge into the entrepreneurial process, but does not restrict more tacit and indirect flows of university research. We find a negative (positive) effect of the defense share of university research funding on short-term (long-term) regional start-up rates. This may indicate that while defense-funded research may not seed start-ups directly, the knowledge carried into the private sector through more indirect channels may contribute, albeit slowly, to regional entrepreneurial activity.

Title: Concentrated ownership and firm performance: does family control matter?
Author-Name: Singal, Manisha
Author-Name: Singal, Vijay
Abstract: In developed markets including the United States, family-controlled firms, in particular founder-controlled firms, have been associated with higher firm performance than their nonfamily counterparts. Such family-controlled firms have concentrated ownership, which, according to agency theory, reduces agency costs and leads to superior firm value. Extant research, however, is not clear whether it is the family control or concentrated ownership that bestows the advantages that lead to enhanced firm performance. By examining different types of concentrated ownership, this study evaluates whether family ownership adds value beyond that provided by concentrated ownership. Based on analyses of panel data from the Indian corporate sector, we find that, in general, firms with concentrated ownership outperform firms with dispersed ownership. Surprisingly, and more importantly, however, we find there are no significant performance differences among family-controlled firms and firms controlled by either foreign corporations or the state. This result is consistent with the notion that concentrated ownership, not family control, is a key determinant of firm performance. Copyright © 2011 Strategic Management Society.

Abstract: This study draws upon effectuation and causation as examples of planning-based and flexible decision-making logics and investigates dynamics in the use of both logics. The study applies a longitudinal process research approach to investigate strategic decision making in new venture creation over time. Combining qualitative and quantitative methods, we analyze 385 decision events across nine technology-based ventures. Our observations suggest a hybrid perspective on strategic decision making, demonstrating how effectuation and causation logics are combined and how entrepreneurs' emphasis on these logics shifts and re-shifts over time. We induce a dynamic model that extends the literature on strategic decision making in venture creation. Copyright © 2015 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Does Social Influence Span Time and Space? Evidence from Indian Returnee Entrepreneurs
Author-Name: Qin, Fei

Abstract: We study returnee entrepreneurship through the lens of social influence. Contrary to the conventional view that treats returnee entrepreneurship as discrete decisions by individuals, we examine the transmission of entrepreneurship through important peer networks—university dorm peers and ethnic association networks. We propose enduring effects from peer influence funnelling entrepreneurship entry in distant locations by shaping career aspirations and facilitating resource and information transfer. Using a unique dataset of overseas alumni of a top Indian university, we find strong evidence of the impact of peer influence on the likelihood of returnee entrepreneurship. However, the effect of university peer influence does not extend beyond immediate peer groups in the same cohort.

Title: New Firm Performance and the Replacement of Founder‐CEOs
Author-Name: Chen, Jing
Author-Name: Thompson, Peter
Abstract: We study the causes and consequences of the replacement of founder-CEOs in a sample of 4,172 Danish start-ups. We propose that founder-CEO replacement is driven in part by mismatches between business quality and founder ability. Our framework suggests that replacements are more likely among the worst- and best-performing firms, with low (high)-ability founders replaced by manager with higher (lower) ability. Replacement is not unambiguously associated with better subsequent performance. Firms that replaced the founder were much more likely to fail, but the surviving firms among them grew considerably faster. Our empirical results are consistent with these proposed predictions.

Abstract: Entrepreneurs develop innovations, fulfill customer needs, and spur economic growth by recognizing, evaluating, and exploiting opportunities. Despite progress, scholarly understanding of how entrepreneurs achieve these objectives may be incomplete. For instance, little explanation exists for why entrepreneurs may pursue activities seemingly at random, nor is there a clear endpoint to the entrepreneurship process. To address these concerns, we present a framework that integrates sensemaking and structuration perspectives to specify the cognitive and behavioral influences on the entrepreneurship process. Within this framework, entrepreneurs ultimately pursue opportunities through developing and deploying capabilities to create value for customers.

Abstract: The literature reveals a broad range of inconsistencies in defining entrepreneurship and in identifying personal characteristics that predict and explain the phenomena of entrepreneurship. The purpose of this work is to propose a model for consistency in predicting entrepreneurial propensity. This article acknowledges categories of entrepreneurs such as: business enterprise creating entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurs, student entrepreneurs, academic entrepreneurs, and corporate entrepreneurs. The proposed theory is specifically focused on business enterprise creating entrepreneurs, defined as Type One. These are individuals who risk their personal capital, time, and reputation in the pursuit of business ventures. Existing theories and observations regarding affect and personality as characteristics of entrepreneurs are reviewed and a new three-dimensional taxonomy of personal characteristics for predicting Type One entrepreneurial propensity is introduced.

Abstract: How do external venturing units effectively achieve external knowledge search and integration of their initiatives with mainstream organizational units? We investigate this largely unexplored question through an inductive study of 17 corporate venture capital units. We document a set of five novel practices that influence the efficacy of a unit's external search and internal integration and identify how these practices complement a broader set of practices used by all units. We highlight the entrepreneurial nature of managing an external venturing unit, often to overcome unfavorable corporate contexts, a perspective that prior research has largely overlooked. Our findings provide unique insights into why some corporate investors are better at learning from external start-ups than others.

Title: Hire, Fire, or Train: Innovation and Human Capital Responses to Recessions
Author-Name: Knudsen, Eirik Sjåholm
Author-Name: Lien, Lasse B.
Abstract: We examine how firms' relative emphasis on exploration and exploitation influence their human capital responses to recessions. We hypothesize and find that the higher the focus on exploration, the more firms invest in training, the more likely they are to hire, and the more likely they are to lay off employees during a recession. Finally, we also find that exploration-oriented firms are more likely to combine the accumulation of human capital through training, with both hiring and firing. This indicates that firms focusing on exploration more actively pursue the opportunities created by increased labor market imperfections during recessions. These results contribute to the literature by highlighting how recessions affect firms' flow of human capital investments, and subsequently stocks, depending on their strategic orientations.

Abstract: This study examines the relationships of founding CEOs' intangible resources (human, social, and psychological capital) with the performance of their firms in environmental contexts of discovery (stable industry conditions that are characterized by risk) versus creation (dynamic industry conditions that are characterized by uncertainty). Results from a national (USA) random sample of founding CEOs (n = 223) found entrepreneurial experience (an aspect of human capital) to be positively related to performance in discovery contexts, whereas educational attainment, strong ties, and psychological capital (a composite index of optimism, self-efficacy, resilience, and hope) were positively related to performance in creation contexts. These findings extend theorizing concerning discovery and creation perspectives from the pre-entry phase (opportunity recognition) to the post-entry phase (opportunity exploitation) of the entrepreneurial process.

Abstract: Entrepreneurs often need resources controlled by stakeholders to form and exploit opportunities. While many of these resources can be acquired through simple contracts, the acquisition of some may require efforts on the part of stakeholders that go beyond what can be specified contractually. Such efforts—extra-role behaviors—generally involve the formation of deep psychological bonds between stakeholders and entrepreneurial endeavors. In an entrepreneurial context, the process of creating these bonds can be called stakeholder enrollment. Critical attributes of this process are shown to vary by the informational setting (risky or uncertain) within which entrepreneurship takes place.

Abstract: The phenomenon of portfolio entrepreneurship has attracted considerable scholarly attention and is particularly relevant in the family firm context. However, there is a lack of knowledge of the process through which portfolio entrepreneurship develops in family firms. We address this gap by analyzing four in-depth, longitudinal family firm case studies from Europe and Latin America. Using a resource-based perspective, we identify six distinct resource categories that are relevant to the portfolio entrepreneurship process. Furthermore, we reveal that their importance varies across time. Our resulting resource-based process model of portfolio entrepreneurship in family firms makes valuable contributions to both theory and practice. Copyright © 2011 Strategic Management Society.

Abstract: We review existing theoretical propositions on the equilibrating and disequilibrating effects of entrepreneurship in the market process. We then introduce a game theoretical model of the market process and employ computer simulation to analyze it through time. The formal analysis suggests that entrepreneurship as the creation of new opportunities may not always be disequilibrating, and entrepreneurship as the discovery and exploitation of existing opportunities may not always be equilibrating. We identify specific conditions that produce counterexamples to the generic equilibration and disequilibration propositions previously considered to be the central premises of entrepreneurship research.

Title: Prediction‐ and Control‐Based Strategies in Entrepreneurship: The Role of Information
Author-Name: Kuechle, Graciela

Author-Name: Carr, Sean D.
Abstract: Prediction- and control-based strategies are the two main hypotheses of how entrepreneurs deal with uncertainty in theories of entrepreneurship. Prediction-based strategies focus on estimating unknowns via sampling methods, whereas control-based strategies focus on shaping unknowns via proactive behavior. These strategies may lead to different propensities to undertake uncertain prospects, as they differ in terms of cognition and involvement. In an experimental test, we study the conditions under which prediction- and control-based strategies lead subjects to accept bets in ambiguous environments. Individuals who use control methods to mitigate uncertainty are more likely to accept the bet after a favorable outcome compared to those who use predictive methods. These results revert in the presence of unfavorable outcomes. We discuss the implications for entrepreneurship theory and practice.

Author-Name: Saxton, Todd
Author-Name: Wesley, Curtis L.
Author-Name: Saxton, M. Kim
Abstract: Venture founders rely on the help of others in their community to move their emerging enterprises forward. While these helping behaviors, here called venture advocate behaviors (VABs), are critical for founders with limited resources, they have received little theoretical or empirical attention. We explore VABs and develop propositions regarding a venture advocate's propensity to engage in such behaviors. Using social exchange theory, we examine how reciprocity between different actors, including paying back and paying forward, and other factors promote VABs.

Abstract: Entrepreneurial passion has gained credence in recent years in explaining entrepreneurial efforts, yet examination of the dynamics of this emotion and its effects on venture growth is still in its infancy. Building on the literature on entrepreneurial motivation and entrepreneurial passion, we develop and test a model of entrepreneurial passion, goals, and venture growth. We utilize path analysis on a two-wave sample of founders from 122 high technology firms. We find direct positive effects of passion for developing on venture growth and an indirect positive effect mediated by goal commitment, but not goal challenge. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

Title: Entrepreneurial Finance and Innovation: Informal Debt as an Empirical Case
Author-Name: Wu, Jie
Author-Name: Si,, Steven
Author-Name: Wu, Xiaobo
Abstract: Drawing on entrepreneurial finance theory, we examine the trade-offs among different sources of capital for entrepreneurial firms in emerging economies and their impact on innovation. In emerging economies, one of the unique aspects of firm financing is the presence of informal capital, as many formal sources of capital for new entrepreneurs have more constrained access than is the case in mature economies. We suspect that informal debt has an important effect on innovation, and this effect is contingent on the accessibility of formal debt and institutional development. The hypotheses are tested using survey data from 3,235 entrepreneurs in an emerging economy, China.

Title: Bridging Behavioral Models and Theoretical Concepts: Effectuation and Bricolage in the Opportunity Creation Framework
Author-Name: Welter, Chris
Author-Name: Mauer, René
Author-Name: Wuebker, Robert J.
Abstract: Opportunity creation, effectuation, and bricolage are three concepts that describe value creation and the central role of entrepreneurial action in that process. Although research often conceptualizes these concepts as interrelated, precisely how they relate to and complement one another and where they diverge remains unclear. This article examines the roots of each of these concepts and their underlying assumptions, organizing them within a unifying conceptual frame. Our analysis reveals a set of entailing implications that can guide future conceptual and empirical work in entrepreneurship, and it advances our understanding of value creation and capture in strategy, organization theory, management, and related fields.

Title: The Foundational Contribution to Entrepreneurship Research of William J. Baumol
Author-Name: Minniti, Maria
Abstract: William J. Baumol has made an impressive number of important contributions to our understanding of entrepreneurship. This article presents an interview in which Baumol discusses the role and importance of innovation in the economy, as well as his views on methodological and pedagogical issues. In addition to summarizing briefly Baumol's classic argument on productive, unproductive, and destructive entrepreneurship, the article highlights some areas of his work that are less known among entrepreneurship scholars. In particular, the article discusses Baumol's work on economic growth and his theory of contestable markets. Both topics offer fruitful research venues for those interested in the relationship between strategic entrepreneurship, market entry, and innovation. Copyright © 2016 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Resource orchestration in family firms: investigating how entrepreneurial orientation, generational involvement, and participative strategy affect performance
Author-Name: Chirico, Francesco
Author-Name: Sirmon, David G.
Author-Name: Sciascia, Salvatore
Author-Name: Mazzola, Pietro
Abstract: Drawing on the process of resource orchestration, we argue a co-alignment of multiple factors is needed for family firms to increase performance through entrepreneurship. Specifically, we posit that entrepreneurial orientation provides the mobilizing vision to use the heterogeneous yet complementary knowledge and experiences offered by increased generational involvement toward entrepreneurship. However, without a coordinating mechanism, generational involvement leads to conflict and negative outcomes. When, instead, it is also coordinated via a participative strategy, performance gains are achieved. In sum, results suggest that realizing the benefits from entrepreneurship in family firms is a complicated matter affected by the synchronization of entrepreneurial orientation, generational involvement, and participative strategy.

Title: Venture Debt Financing: Determinants of the Lending Decision
Author-Name: Rassenfosse, Gaétan
Author-Name: Fischer, Timo
Abstract: Venture debt lending is a form of start-up financing that lies at the intersection of venture capital and traditional debt. We analyze the lending decision criteria of 55 senior U.S. venture debt lenders (VDLs) using a discrete choice experiment in order to understand how VDLs overcome barriers that traditionally hamper start-ups’ access to debt. We find, first, that the provision of patents as collateral is as important as the provision of tangible assets to lenders. Second, VDLs showed a marked preference for start-ups that offered warrants. Third, venture capitalists' backing substitutes for a start-up's positive cash flows.

Title: Evolution of Entrepreneurial Judgment With Venture‐Specific Experience
Author-Name: Uygur, Ugur
Author-Name: Kim, Sung Min
Abstract: This study advances research on entrepreneurial cognition by investigating how entrepreneurial judgment evolves during new venture creation. We conceptualize entrepreneurial judgment as a cognitive process in the minds of entrepreneurs that operates on the causal map—i.e., a knowledge structure concerning what factors they believe will help the chances of profitability under uncertainty. At the time of initial epiphany, entrepreneurs construct cognitive causal maps, which guide resource allocation decisions. Over time, venture-specific experience accumulates and entrepreneurial judgment evolves in response to their observations. Using a dataset of 524 nascent entrepreneurs, we find that entrepreneurs with more venture-specific experiences have more selective judgments, and they have stronger conviction in those judgments. We also find that perceived uncertainty and cognitive dispositions of the individuals affect entrepreneurial judgment.

Author-Name: Wright, Mike
Abstract: This study examines the role of resource orchestration for the exploration and exploitation of opportunities through portfolio entrepreneurship. Adopting a single-case study approach, we identify eight distinctive resource orchestration subprocesses that we group into three aggregate resource orchestration processes that enable the development and exploitation of a set of resources and capabilities across a portfolio of ventures. Our findings extend the literature on enduring entrepreneurship by building theory on how resource orchestration across a portfolio of ventures facilitates the emergence of synergies when exploring and exploiting opportunities.

Author-Name: Gutiérrez‐Cillán, Jesús
Abstract: This article analyzes the personal, professional, associative, and institutional relationship networks in which the entrepreneur is involved and the resources embedded therein, and it proposes that an entrepreneur's social capital resources are determinants of his/her business' economic performance. The effect of social capital resources is moderated by competitive intensity in the industry and the entrepreneur's experience. A questionnaire survey and a sample of 951 small- and medium-sized firms were used to test the proposed hypotheses. Results show that economic performance is influenced more by professional and institutional network resources than by the other network resources. However, competitive intensity reduces the effect of institutional resources and increases the relevance of personal resources, whereas the entrepreneur's experience in the sector reinforces the impact of professional and institutional resources.

Title: Bringing the Stages Back in: Social Network Ties and Start‐up firms’ Access to Venture Capital in China
Author-Name: Wang, Yanbo
Abstract: Social networks are believed to help start-ups access venture capital (VC). However, the causal mechanisms remain unclear because social ties probably influence both a start-up's likelihood of being screened for evaluation and its likelihood of being funded. Whereas prior studies conceptualize venture financing as a single-moment event, in this article, it is theorized as a dynamic multistage process in which a screening decision precedes a funding decision. Failure to address the selection effects at each stage could lead to biased findings regarding how social ties confer advantage in venture financing. This study uses a hand-collected dataset from China to empirically examine these arguments.

Abstract: The purpose of this special issue is to promote research on the role of family in nurturing entrepreneurial ventures as well as on the importance of strategic entrepreneurship in maintaining the strength and viability of established and multigenerational family firms. Two related research questions are at the heart of this inquiry: (1) In what ways does the influence of family matter to strategic entrepreneurship?; and (2) How can strategic entrepreneurship contribute to understanding and strengthening family firms? We begin this introductory paper by providing a brief overview of the contributions of each of the papers in this issue. We then develop a framework for addressing the role of family firms in strategic entrepreneurship that highlights the input-process-output nature of strategic entrepreneurship in family business and the contexts in which they occur. We conclude by outlining a research agenda for future research in this area along the themes relating to this framework. Copyright © 2011 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Ethnic Enclave and Entrepreneurial Financing: Asian Venture Capitalists in Silicon Valley
Author-Name: Zhang, Jing
Author-Name: Wong, Poh Kam
Author-Name: Ho, Yuen Ping
Abstract: We examine the dilemma of ethnic investors in using ethnic network ties to invest by extending the ‘ethnic enclave’ concept to incorporate two dimensions: social network and social status. Our analysis of the first round of venture capital funding in Silicon Valley from 1976 to 2004 shows a higher likelihood of Asian venture capitalists (VCs) investing in Asian-led ventures than mainstream VCs. In addition, the valuation of their investments in mainstream ventures is higher than those by mainstream VCs in such ventures. In contrast, this premium effect is not observed when mainstream VCs invest in Asian ventures. These asymmetrical findings suggest the premium Asian VCs pay to compete in the mainstream venture market is due to their lower social status rather than their social network disadvantages.

Abstract: This study focuses on Dyer and Singh's (1998) relational view in the context of corporate venture capital (CVC) investors and their portfolio companies, who mutually strive for interorganizational rent generation. Aiming to better understand this relational rent-generation process, our article entirely operationalizes and refines Dyer and Singh's (1998) model. While our findings attest strong explanatory power to the original model in the context of CVC investment relationships, they suggest the existence of additional relationships between the constructs of the relational view. Specifically, we identified relation-specific assets as well as knowledge-sharing routines as mediators between complementary resources and capabilities and relational rent.

Abstract: Recent entrepreneurship research has examined how opportunities are developed, highlighting the engagement of external actors. However, we know little about how entrepreneurs should interact with external actors to sustain their engagement. Since opportunity development is a process that unfolds over time, sustaining actor engagement is critical because it enables continued feedback and access to actors’ resources. We present a process model that explains how entrepreneurs can sustain external actor engagement through two iterative phases: translation and transformation. We also propose that entrepreneurs can sustain actor engagement by structuring the timing of interactions and by modifying actors’ perceptions of the time available for novel opportunity development. We conclude with an agenda for future research on actor engagement and entrepreneurs’ temporal capabilities.

Abstract: This conceptual article discusses when and why family firms are motivated to engage in entrepreneurial activities. Drawing on family development theory, we offer midrange reasoning about the impact of enterprising family dynamics—such as the birth of a child or children leaving home—on the motivation for corporate venturing and its changes over time. Moreover, our model also accounts for the contingent effect of ownership and business developmental dimensions. Finally, we predict that motivation for corporate venturing can, in turn, spur the development of the enterprising family.

Author-Name: Akhter, Naveed

Author-Name: Chirico, Francesco
Abstract: How does a business family manage its business portfolio in times of declining performance to sustain the portfolio's long-term endurance? Drawing on social identity theory and six family business portfolios from Pakistan, we find that business families may prefer to shut down a satellite business rather than sell it, which is primarily driven by identity considerations. In addition, the family's goal to recycle the assets, the aim to restart the business later, and the increasing decline in performance are important contingency factors. This study contributes to the literature on portfolio entrepreneurship, business exit, and the enduring entrepreneurship of family firms.

Title: After the Venture: The Reproduction and Destruction of Entrepreneurial Opportunity
Author-Name: Wood, Matthew S.
Author-Name: Mckinley, William
Abstract: The endogenous formation of entrepreneurial opportunity has become an important theoretical perspective. Research to date focuses on initial opportunity creation dynamics leading to venture formation. This excludes the ongoing enactment of opportunity that takes place after venture founding. We focus on this phenomenon, arguing that opportunities must be continually reproduced through maintenance of consensus among stakeholders about their viability. If consensus fails, the objectivity of the opportunity is ‘destroyed’ in a process we label ‘opportunity de-objectification.’ We identify predictors of opportunity de-objectification and summarize their effects in propositions suitable for future empirical testing. Implications for future theory and research are also discussed.

Title: Are Formal Planners More Likely To Achieve New Venture Viability? A Counterfactual Model And Analysis
Author-Name: Greene, Francis J.
Author-Name: Hopp, Christian
Abstract: This study develops and tests a counterfactual model of the relationship between formal written business plans and the achievement of new venture viability. This is important because extant theory remains oppositional, and there is a practical need to provide guidance to founders on the utility of formal plans. To test our model, we use propensity score matching to identify the impact that founder, venture, and environmental factors have on the decision to write a formal plan (selection effects). Having isolated these selection effects, we test whether or not these plans help founders achieve venture viability (performance effects). Our results, using data on 1,088 founders, identify two key results: (1) selection effects matter in the decision to plan; and (2) it pays to plan.

Title: Behavioral and cognitive factors in entrepreneurship: entrepreneurs as the active element in new venture creation
Author-Name: Baron, Robert A.
Abstract: Entrepreneurs play a central role in new venture creation. Because they do, careful attention to relevant aspects of their behavior and cognition can offer useful insights into key aspects of this complex process. Specifically, investigation of carefully selected behavioral and cognitive factors can add appreciably to our understanding of the basic processes that underlie new venture creation (e.g., how opportunity recognition or creation actually occurs, how and what entrepreneurs learn from increasing experience in launching and operating new ventures). Evidence is reviewed concerning the role of behavioral and cognitive factors in several key activities performed by entrepreneurs. In addition, the potential role of a variable that has not yet been systematically investigated in the context of new venture creation—affect—is explored. Finally, suggestions are offered for future research designed to further explicate the role of behavioral and cognitive factors in new venture creation (e.g., research on the role in entrepreneurship of self-regulatory and metacognitive mechanisms; research on the cognitive and foundations of entrepreneurial alertness).

Title: Building bridges: the social structure of interdependent innovation
Author-Name: Kleinbaum, Adam M.
Author-Name: Tushman, Michael L.
Abstract: Multidivisional firms often fail to take advantage of innovations that involve combining resources from distinct divisions. This failure of cross-line-of-business innovation is a consequence of design choices employed to execute the firm's strategy: in organizing around its core businesses, the firm renders interdependence between divisions residual to the formal structure. As a result, those innovations which involve cross-line-of-business interdependence are trumped by the firm's articulated strategy and structure. Social structures could, potentially, fill this coordination gap. But social structures associated with the initiation of interdependent innovation are inversely associated with their execution. We build a dynamic, corporate-level, evolutionary model in which individuals autonomously initiate cross-line-of-business projects not through the formal structure of the firm, but using contacts from their own social networks. Some of these projects are selected and actively supported by senior executives; this support sends clear signals about what collaboration is valued by the firm, which gives other actors powerful, albeit informal, incentives to connect with others across the interunit boundary. As a result, the sparse interunit social structure that was conducive to initiation changes, becoming much more cohesive (at least locally) and is able to support execution and retain these interdependent innovations. Thus, where intra-divisional innovations are primarily driven by organizational structure, we suggest that interdivisional innovations are driven primarily by social networks.

Title: The accidental entrepreneur: the emergent and collective process of user entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Shah, Sonali K.
Author-Name: Tripsas, Mary
Abstract: We develop a process model of how users, an understudied source of entrepreneurship, create, evaluate, share, and commercialize their ideas. We compare and contrast our model to the classic model of the entrepreneurial process, highlighting the emergent and collective nature of the user's entrepreneurial process. Users are often ‘accidental’ entrepreneurs who happen upon an idea through their own use and then share it with others; more specifically, the development of an idea and subsequent experimentation, adaptation, and preliminary adoption often occur before that idea is formally evaluated as the basis of a commercial venture. Users also tend to engage in collective creative activity prior to firm formation—often within the social context provided by user communities—that results in the improvement of ideas. Finally, we provide detailed data on the prevalence of user entrepreneurship in the juvenile products industry. Copyright © 2007 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Strategic networks and entrepreneurial ventures
Author-Name: Stuart, Toby E.
Author-Name: Sorenson, Olav
Abstract: Much research suggests that social networks shape the emergence and development of nascent ventures. Scholars have argued that founders' and firms' networks influence innovation and the identification of entrepreneurial opportunities, as well as facilitate the mobilization of resources for growth and the harvesting of value from fledgling firms. It is not an exaggeration to claim that existing empirical findings point to the centrality of networks in every aspect of the entrepreneurial process. However, with exceptions so few they may be counted on one hand, this research untenably treats network structures as exogenous—in other words, as if entrepreneurs and enterprises do not pursue valuable connections. In this article, we review the literature on networks in entrepreneurial contexts, argue that it disproportionately focuses on the consequences of networks at the expense of research on their origins, and consider the implications for the literature of the fact that most entrepreneurs and young ventures are strategic in their formation of relations. We then articulate a research agenda composed of five areas of inquiry we consider critical to a better understanding of networks and entrepreneurship. Copyright © 2008 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Doing versus seeing: acts of exploitation and perceptions of exploration
Author-Name: Adner, Ron
Author-Name: Levinthal, Daniel
Abstract: The challenge of organizational adaptation is often presented in terms of the tension between the exploration of new possibilities and the exploitation of existing accomplishments. Whether framed in the language of invention versus refinement or local search versus long jumps, the spirit of the argument is of an explicit trade-off that resource-constrained organizations must make to secure their survival and success. While we do not dispute the fundamental truth that underlies this tension, we do believe this dominant characterization of the process of exploration may be masking key drivers of this tension and potential paths towards its resolution. We argue that, from the perspective of an actor, all activities are inherently exploitative in their nature, in the sense that they are undertaken with the explicit expectation that they may achieve meaningful progress on some dimension of performance. The key distinction regards the extent to which the dimension of performance is recognized and legitimated from the perspective of the organizational context in which the actor is operating. Acts perceived as ‘exploratory’ are, thus, more accurately characterized as acts of exploitation directed along new performance dimensions. We consider the organizational challenges that such exploratory action poses and the implications for entrepreneurial initiatives. From the perspective of the focal actor engaged in the exploratory initiative, the challenge is to identify ‘projections’ of the payoff of the initiative they are pursuing, either onto those dimensions of performance that are of interest to the organization, or onto more concrete measures of product-market acceptance and financial return. Low-dimensional representations of the business landscape are an inevitable by-product of bounded rationality and the need for organizations and their strategies to coordinate and direct collective action. In this regard, the most powerful form of entrepreneurship may be the initiation of the cognitive shifts that offer a different topology of the competitive landscape.

Title: What makes a process a capability? Heuristics, strategy, and effective capture of opportunities
Author-Name: Bingham, Christopher B.
Author-Name: Eisenhardt, Kathleen M.
Author-Name: Furr, Nathan R.
Abstract: While organizational processes, such as internationalization, acquisition, and alliance, are a fundamental concept within many literatures and central to firm capabilities, controversy exists regarding how they become high performing. One view emphasizes the role of experience while a second view emphasizes cognition and, in particular, the role of articulated heuristics. Using qualitative and quantitative field data on the internationalization process of entrepreneurial firms from three culturally distinct regions (Finland, U.S., Singapore), we juxtapose these two competing theoretical views to better gain insight into organizational processes and capabilities. The core contribution of our paper is insight into the structure of firm capabilities. Results show that organizational heuristics more closely relate to the development of a high performing process and hence a firm capability. At a broader level, we contribute to strategy by empirically validating the strategic logic of opportunity, a logic that is particularly relevant in dynamic markets and growth oriented firms. We also contribute to entrepreneurship by adding to the opportunity discovery vs. opportunity creation debate, and by shedding light on the relationship between structure and performance in new ventures. Overall, we contribute to the emerging but growing body of research emphasizing a more cognitive view of firms. Copyright © 2007 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Strategic entrepreneurship, collaborative innovation, and wealth creation
Author-Name: Ketchen, David J.
Author-Name: Ireland, R. Duane
Author-Name: Snow, Charles C.
Abstract: Strategic entrepreneurship refers to firms' pursuit of superior performance via simultaneous opportunity-seeking and advantage-seeking activities. Both small and large firms face impediments while pursuing strategic entrepreneurship. While small firms' opportunity-seeking skills may be strong, their limited knowledge stocks and lack of market power inhibit their ability to enact the competitive advantages necessary to appropriate value from opportunities the firms choose to pursue. In contrast, large firms are skilled at establishing competitive advantages, but their heavy emphasis on the efficiency of their existing businesses often undermines their ability to continuously explore for additional opportunities. Building on a variety of theories, including network, learning, resource-based, and real options, we suggest that collaborative innovation can enable both types of firms to overcome their respective challenges. Collaborative innovation is the pursuit of innovations across firm boundaries through the sharing of ideas, knowledge, expertise, and opportunities. For small firms, we contend that pursuing entrepreneurship collaboratively allows them to preserve their creativity and flexibility while mitigating the inherent liabilities of smallness. We argue that collaborative innovation permits large firms to exploit their advantage-creating skills while concurrently exploring for opportunities outside their current domain. Thus, small and large firms that learn how to integrate strategic entrepreneurship and collaborative innovation are well positioned to create wealth. Copyright © 2008 Strategic Management Society.

Abstract: Research on innovation routinization emphasizes public aspects of this process. The issues such research addresses are important, but do not fully describe routinization processes or account for all the characteristics that generate them. Based on a study of an innovative course, we explore organizational factors that affect the diminished routinization of innovations, the loss of core components of the innovation while it is being routinized. We develop a model of how organizational structure and intergroup dynamics affect the diminished routinization of innovations by impacting knowledge sharing and links between the innovation and its core organizational purpose.

Title: Commentary on Front and backstages of the diminished routinization of innovations, An entrepreneurial perspective on the firm‐environment relationship, and Cross‐boundary disruptors
Author-Name: Covin, Jeffrey G.
Abstract: The papers by Bartunek, Trullen, Immediato, and Schneider (Front and backstages of the diminished routinization of innovations: what innovation research makes public and organizational research finds behind the scenes), Smith and Cao (An entrepreneurial perspective on the firm-environment relationship), and Burgelman and Grove (Cross-boundary disruptors: powerful interindustry entrepreneurial change agents) address the topic of change. The specific foci of these papers are quite different. While commonalities among the papers are certainly identifiable, highlighting the value of these writings is perhaps better achieved by focusing on their unique contributions to the change literature rather than by seeking to identify points of theoretical overlap within the broad domain of change. With this belief in mind, this commentary reviews several of the principal contributions of the three papers to the change literature. Promising research directions pertaining to the topic of change that build directly on observations made in the papers are then discussed. Copyright © 2008 Strategic Management Society.

Title: An entrepreneurial perspective on the firm‐environment relationship
Author-Name: Smith, Ken G.
Author-Name: Cao, Qing
Abstract: In the organizational theory literature, two perspectives to explain the firm-environment relationship—the ecology view and the adaptation view—are dominant. We review these perspectives and present a third, less recognized perspective—the entrepreneurial view. The entrepreneurial view recognizes the potential for top managers and firms to, on occasion, proactively shape and influence their environment. Purposeful individual top managers with their variable belief systems take primacy in the entrepreneurial model as they are motivated to engage in aspirational search and take entrepreneurial actions. Entrepreneurial actions potentially disrupt the existing belief systems of market participants by disseminating new information that causes dissonance. This dissonance and debate as part of the market process can lead to a revision in the belief systems of market participants. We show that although the multilevel entrepreneurial perspective is distinct from the ecology and adaptation perspectives, they are, in fact, complementary.

Abstract: Entrepreneurs who focus on innovation in their products, their production techniques, and their markets play a key role in economic growth. The direction of their activity is guided by their goals: wealth, power, and prestige. Current institutions, shaped by history and government are critical in determining where entrepreneurs will find it most promising to direct their efforts, sometimes, but not always, benefiting the general welfare. One goal of good policy, therefore, is redesign of institutions so as to attract entrepreneurial activity to beneficial directions. Copyright © 2008 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Cross‐boundary disruptors: powerful interindustry entrepreneurial change agents
Author-Name: Burgelman, Robert A.
Author-Name: Grove, Andrew S.
Abstract: Based on comparative case studies of Apple Computer's strategic actions in the music and cellular telephony industries, we develop the concept of cross-boundary disruptor as a new type of entrepreneurial actor in interindustry strategic dynamics. We document how the confluence of forces that drove the convergence of the music and computing industries gave rise to Apple becoming a defining example of a cross-boundary disruptor to the music industry, and examine Apple's chances to do the same in the cellular telephony industry. Using our preliminary conceptual framework, we further examine what kind of company could become a cross-boundary disruptor in the U.S. health care industry to help overcome its long-standing stasis. We summarize our case study-based findings into a preliminary substantive theory of the cross-boundary disruption phenomenon, and discuss several implications for further strategic entrepreneurship research and strategic leadership practice.

Abstract: Entrepreneurs take strategic action to create value. They can do so individually or collaboratively, and currently researchers are interested in learning the extent to which collaboration can increase the total entrepreneurial value created. Taking entrepreneurial strategic action naturally involves the pursuit of self-interest, but entrepreneurial self-interest can only be served if it simultaneously serves collective interests, such as those of customers, investors, partners, and other relevant constituencies. Currently, researchers are also interested in identifying the most effective ways in which individual and collective interests can be jointly pursued. Copyright © 2008 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Risk and rationality in entrepreneurial processes
Author-Name: Miller, Kent D.
Abstract: This study begins with a historical overview of the connection between risk and rationality. It then broadens beyond this historical trajectory by taking entrepreneurship as a point of departure for understanding risk and rationality. Drawing from the research of Littlechild (1986), Buchanan and Vanberg (1991), and Sarasvathy et al. (2003), this study considers three entrepreneurial processes: opportunity recognition, opportunity discovery, and opportunity creation. Associated with each of these processes are unique conceptualizations of risk and rationality, reflected in distinct research streams. The final section of the study considers implications of the process-contingent nature of risk and rationality, and motivates a broadening of the research agenda from entrepreneurial decision making to practices.

Abstract: In the canonical work of economics, Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, he explained that nations grow wealthy through changes in the division of labor. Using Smith's insight, entrepreneurship can be defined as the study of human actions that lead to changes in the division of labor. This definition gives theoretical and empirical meaning to studies examining new venture formation and economic growth, and can be used by scholars for intellectual profit, as illustrated by Baumol and Strom, Casson and Wadeson, and Agarwal, Audretsch, and Sarkar.

Abstract: Much research in strategic entrepreneurship has focused on the consequences of network structure for firm performance. Despite this emphasis, little is known about variation in network structure across industries, or about the antecedents of this variation. In a comparative study of alliance networks in 32 industries, we demonstrate substantial variety in network structure, and develop a typology of network structures. We then endeavor to explain this variation by focusing on dimensions of the products and technologies that characterize these industries—such as technological uncertainty and dynamism, product modularity, and architectural control—and associating them with underlying characteristics of network structure. We conclude with a discussion of implications of our findings for research in strategic entrepreneurship. Copyright © 2008 Strategic Management Society.

Abstract: Entrepreneurs are often portrayed as rugged individualists who go it alone to build new organizations and programs that maximize their self-interests. This portrayal is incomplete, because it does not account for the fact that entrepreneurs also pursue collective interests. It fails to recognize a basic paradox in human beings of simultaneously seeking individual and collective interests. We argue that an appreciation of the dialectical nature of human beings leads to fundamentally different conceptions of entrepreneurship than those commonly found in literature on entrepreneurship theory and practice. To illustrate our central premise, we focus on entrepreneurial opportunity realization, resource mobilization, and running in packs. Copyright © 2008 Strategic Management Society.

Abstract: This paper develops a formal model of the impact of entrepreneurship on macroeconomic performance. It examines the role of entrepreneurs in creating markets for novel products. Entrepreneurs take over the coordination role that in traditional neoclassical economic models is performed by the Walrasian auctioneer. Entrepreneurs specialize in collecting information that permits them to make judgmental decisions about innovation. The quality of their judgment determines the success of innovations, and thereby impacts the long-run performance of the economy. The model demonstrates rigorously that constraints on the supply of entrepreneurship reduce economic performance, and serves to identify the policy instruments that can improve performance by alleviating these constraints.

A substantial part of this variance was mediated by the psychological trait of sensation seeking, suggesting that genes affect the tendency of people to engage in entrepreneurship by affecting the distribution of sensation seeking across people.

Abstract: Although (opportunity) beliefs are becoming increasingly recognized as fundamental to understanding entrepreneurial cognition and strategic action, little is understood about the mechanisms that are responsible for the formation and evolution of these beliefs. Introducing the mechanisms of gists, matching, and updating from philosophy's and psychology's coherence theory, we propose a theoretical framework to explain how third-person opportunity beliefs (beliefs that one has recognized an opportunity for someone with the right knowledge and motivation) are formed and how they evolve to become first-person opportunity beliefs (beliefs that one has recognized an opportunity for himself or herself). We conclude by examining how the model contributes to literatures ranging from entrepreneurial cognition and action, to strategic myopia and organizational attention, to opportunity recognition, discovery, and creation.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of team creative cognition and discuss how it is transferred and infused within the team to enable the team's creativity. Specifically, we propose that diverse personal ties outside of the team shape and strengthen individual team member's ‘creative muscle,’ and that this individual creative cognition is infused within the team through modeling processes, ultimately resulting in team creative cognition. We further propose that team member centrality in the team's sociocognitive network, as well as the evolution of the entrepreneurial team, are critical to fully understanding the infusion process and the resulting emergence of team creative cognition.

Abstract: This article maintains that the consistent application of subjectivism helps reconcile contemporary entrepreneurship theory with the strategic management literature, particularly the resource-based view of the firm. The article synthesizes theoretical insights from Austrian economics, Penrose's (1959) resources approach, and modern resource-based theory, focusing on the essential subjectivity of the entrepreneurial process. This new synthesis describes entrepreneurship as a creative team act in which heterogeneous managerial mental models interact to create and arrange resources to produce a collective output that is creatively superior to individual output.

Title: When does entrepreneurial self‐efficacy enhance versus reduce firm performance?
Author-Name: Hmieleski, Keith M.
Author-Name: Baron, Robert A.
Abstract: The entrepreneurial self-efficacy of lead founders has been generally considered to be a robust predictor of the performance of their firms. Few studies, however, have considered variables that might moderate this relationship. The current study attempts to fill this gap in the literature by examining two possible moderators of the effects of entrepreneurial self-efficacy on firm performance: dispositional optimism and environmental dynamism. Results indicate that these factors do indeed moderate the effects of entrepreneurial self-efficacy; in fact, a three-way interaction between self-efficacy, optimism, and environmental dynamism was observed with respect to firm performance. Consistent with predictions, in dynamic environments, the effects of high entrepreneurial self-efficacy on firm performance were positive when combined with moderate optimism, but negative when combined with high optimism. In stable environments, in contrast, the effects of self-efficacy were relatively weak, and were not moderated by optimism. Overall, results suggest that high self-efficacy is not always beneficial for entrepreneurs and may, in fact, exert negative effects under some conditions.

Abstract: Social entrepreneurship has emerged as an important research topic in the literature. This interest stems from social entrepreneurs' role in addressing serious social problems on a worldwide scale while enhancing social wealth, often without regard for profits. In this article, we explain the forces contributing to the formation and rapid internationalization of social ventures. We use the behavioral theory of the firm to distill key attributes of social opportunities and show how these attributes influence the timing and geographic scope of social ventures' international operations.

Title: Entrepreneuring as a puzzle: an attempt to its explanation with truncation of subjective probability distribution of prospects
Author-Name: Deligonul, Z. Seyda

Author-Name: Cavusgil, S. Tamer
Abstract: This research presents entrepreneuring as a puzzle where entrepreneurs venture at a risk-return level that is worse than that of the private equity index and much worse than the public equity index. Under subjective rationality, we explain this puzzle by the possibility that entrepreneurs configure their outlook by dismissing some possible future performance states. Their forward view reflects a truncated and conditional distribution with overcredence. The unfavorable odds under a nontruncated distribution become very attractive after truncation.

Title: Values and judgment under uncertainty: evidence from venture capitalist assessments of founders
Author-Name: Matusik, Sharon F.

Author-Name: Heeley, Michael B.
Abstract: We examine how judgments in the context of uncertainty vary, depending on the values of those making these judgments. We test these ideas in the context of venture capitalists' (VCs') evaluations of founders. Drawing on theoretical and empirical research on the role of values in judgment and decision making and on Schwartz's (1992, 1996) conceptualization of the basic motivational dimensions underlying human values, we hypothesize and find that decision makers' process values (i.e., values governing the types of means to an end that an individual values) influence the perceived worth of founders' human capital. We discuss implications of these findings for judgment and decision-making research, as well as practical implications for entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.

Title: How private enterprises respond to government bureaucracy in emerging economies: the effects of entrepreneurial type and governance
Author-Name: Luo, Yadong
Author-Name: Junkunc, Marc
Abstract: This study examines how private enterprises in emerging economies politically respond to government bureaucracy they face. With an emphasis on two political responses, engagement and influence, we propose that private enterprises react to bureaucracy differently, depending on their entrepreneurial traits, and this leads to different susceptibilities to bureaucracy. Our analysis of 9,123 private enterprises in 72 emerging economies suggests that political engagement and influence are positively associated with bureaucracy for all firms, but the levels of political engagement and influence vary according to a firm's entrepreneurial type (new vs. established venture; venture of entrepreneurial origin vs. other private) and governance (family vs. nonfamily; with vs. without government or foreign ownership). Firms in different groups of emerging economies also display some different propensities to political engagement and influence. Copyright © 2008 Strategic Management Society.

Title: The virtuous cycle of discovery and creation of entrepreneurial opportunities
Author-Name: Zahra, Shaker A.
Abstract: Researchers have debated whether entrepreneurial opportunities are discovered or created. However, they have often overlooked the importance of the contextual variables that stimulate, shape, and define the entrepreneurial act. This article focuses on entrepreneurial activities within technology-based established companies and shows how and why certain contexts are more conducive for discovery, while others promote the discovery and creation of opportunities. The article suggests a virtuous and dynamic cycle where discovery enriches creation which, in turn, fosters the discovery of new opportunities. The focus on the context and key features of entrepreneurial search contributes to the behavioral theory of and the debate on the origins of opportunities.

Abstract: This article examines the population level implications of microlevel theories of entrepreneurship. The actions of those who seek to organize opportunities, as well as the hurdles that they must overcome to successfully exploit them, give rise to an evolutionary multistage selection process. The article indicates that the consideration of selection events leads to a more complete understanding of the entrepreneurial process and how microlevel theories influence important outcomes in entrepreneurship. Other theoretical and empirical implications of staged selection for research in entrepreneurship are discussed. Copyright © 2008 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Understanding opportunity discovery and sustainable advantage: the role of transaction costs and property rights
Author-Name: Foss, Kirsten
Author-Name: Foss, Nicolai J.
Abstract: To add insight in new value creation, opportunity discovery should be integrated with strategic management theory. Based on the resource-based view and the economics of property rights, we build a framework that accomplishes this. Our key argument is that property rights and transaction costs are important antecedents of opportunity discovery. We identify two mechanisms that establish this influence and examine alternative ways in which knowledge, transaction costs, and property rights influence opportunity discovery and sustainable advantage.

Title: Discovery and creation: alternative theories of entrepreneurial action
Author-Name: Alvarez, Sharon A.
Author-Name: Barney, Jay B.
Abstract: Do entrepreneurial opportunities exist, independent of the perceptions of entrepreneurs, just waiting to be discovered? Or, are these opportunities created by the actions of entrepreneurs? Two internally consistent theories of how entrepreneurial opportunities are formed – discovery theory and creation theory – are described. While it will always be possible to describe the formation of a particular opportunity as an example of a discovery or creation process, these two theories do have important implications for the effectiveness of a wide variety of entrepreneurial actions in different contexts. The implications of these theories for seven of these actions are described, along with a discussion of some of the broader theoretical implications of these two theories for the fields of entrepreneurship and strategic management.

Title: Opportunity discovery, entrepreneurial action, and economic organization
Author-Name: Klein, Peter G.
Abstract: This article reviews and critiques the opportunity discovery approach to entrepreneurship and argues that entrepreneurship can be more thoroughly grounded, and more closely linked to more general problems of economic organization by adopting the Cantillon-Knight-Mises understanding of entrepreneurship as judgment. The article begins by distinguishing among occupational, structural, and functional approaches to entrepreneurship and distinguishing among two influential interpretations of the entrepreneurial function—discovery and judgment. It turns next to the contemporary literature on opportunity identification and argues that this literature misinterprets Kirzner's instrumental use of the discovery metaphor and mistakenly makes opportunities the unit of analysis. The article then describes an alternative approach in which investment is the unit of analysis and link this approach to Austrian capital theory. I close with some applications to organizational form and entrepreneurial teams. Copyright © 2008 Strategic Management Society.

Author-Name: Mitchell, Ronald K.
Author-Name: Mitchell, J. Robert
Author-Name: Smith, J. Brock
Abstract: To better understand opportunity creation, we investigate the extent to which recognition of failure impacts the new transaction commitment mindset of entrepreneurs. In a PLS model, we utilize data gathered from a sample of 220 entrepreneurs, and augment these results with an ANOVA analysis that provides a deeper exploration of the theory. In this article, we: (1) elaborate on the critical dimensions that represent a multi-construct view of the new transaction commitment mindset and describe ways that these dimensions can be measured; (2) examine the extent to which the recognition of new venture failure impacts the new transaction commitment mindset; and (3) explore the implications of the interaction between failure recognition and the new transaction commitment mindset for an entrepreneur's decision to continue or abandon opportunity creation efforts. Our results suggest that recognition of failure does indeed impact the new transaction commitment mindset and, by extension, can enable opportunity creation.

Author-Name: Chandler, Gaylen N.
Abstract: Our study extends a long-running debate into the domain of entrepreneurship by examining firm and industry effects on the performance of new ventures. We examine to what extent firm and industry levels explain sales, sales growth, and survival among 7,256 young Swedish firms over a five-year period, and compare these findings to a sample of 12,692 established firms. We found that the industry level ‘matters’ little for the survival of either sample of firms, and industry membership matters less for the sales and sales growth of new ventures than for established firms. Post hoc analysis revealed that size affects new venture performance, and that new venture funding is related to both sales and survival. At a broad level, our findings shed new light on the roles of the liabilities of newness and smallness for the performance of new ventures. Copyright © 2009 Strategic Management Society.

Abstract: While recent literature has advocated the transfer of venture capital (VC) practices and structures to corporate venture (CV) units, the wisdom of this advice has not been subject to rigorous empirical scrutiny. We test the implications of the VC model for CV unit performance using a longitudinal database combining survey, archival, and survival data on 95 CV units. VC model elements of high-powered incentives, autonomous organization, investment syndication, investment staging, and specialization were each associated with higher CV unit performance. Critically, different elements of the VC model predicted improvements in either strategic or financial performance in CV units. Survival of the CV unit was strongly associated with employing the VC model, partially mediated by enhanced performance. Copyright © 2009 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Can cognitive biases explain venture team homophily?
Author-Name: Parker, Simon C.
Abstract: Although venture teams whose founders are dissimilar (heterophilious) tend to outperform teams whose founders are similar (homophilious), most new venture teams are characterized by homophily. I try to explain this puzzle with a learning model in which founders are prone to two cognitive biases: overoptimism and self-serving attributions. Founders choose cofounders with similar beliefs as themselves because they expect this to promote the most effective allocation of effort to the venture. Self-serving bias reinforces and perpetuates these beliefs. In principle, informed outsiders (e.g., practitioners or hands on investors) can improve venture team composition compared with private choices by founders.

Title: Regulatory focus and new venture performance: A study of entrepreneurial opportunity exploitation under conditions of risk versus uncertainty
Author-Name: Hmieleski, Keith M.
Author-Name: Baron, Robert A.
Abstract: Research on cognitive fit suggests that entrepreneurs will be most successful at leading their firms when approaching the entrepreneurial process through the self-regulatory mode that most closely matches the requirements of their environment and its accompanying perspective on the nature of entrepreneurial opportunities. Consistent with the discovery view of entrepreneurial opportunities, it is suggested that a prevention focus will be the most effective self-regulatory mode for entrepreneurs leading their firms within stable industry environments, which are characterized by risk. Building from the creation view of entrepreneurial opportunities, it is argued that a promotion focus will be the most effective self-regulatory mode for entrepreneurs leading their firms within dynamic industry environments, which are characterized by uncertainty. These arguments are tested using a national (United States) random sample of 201 lead entrepreneurs. The findings indicate that in dynamic environments, entrepreneurs' promotion focus is positively associated with venture performance (i.e., lagged measures of revenue and employment growth), while entrepreneurs' prevention focus is negatively related to performance in such environments. In both cases, these effects are found to be fully mediated by deviation from firms' original business concepts. In stable environments, however, no significant relationships between entrepreneurs' promotion or prevention focus and new venture performance were observed. These results suggest that low cognitive fit (a mismatch between entrepreneurs' mode of self-regulation and the decision-making context in which they operate) is more damaging in dynamic environments (i.e., a context of uncertainty) than in stable environments (i.e., a context of risk).

Title: Factor payments, resource‐based bargaining, and the creation of firm wealth in technology‐based ventures
Author-Name: Townsend, David M.
Author-Name: Busenitz, Lowell W.
Abstract: A central tenet of resource-based logic is that undervalued resources utilized by firms organized to exploit them will produce superior economic performance over the long run. Yet when young technology-based ventures pursuing new opportunities do not possess full property over these resources, input providers retain the right to bid up factor prices to match each resource's marginal productivity. In response to these limitations in extant resource-based logic, we apply and extend Lippman and Rumelt's full payments and bargaining perspectives and propose an alternative method by which entrepreneurs can generate firm wealth through the unique bundling of cospecialized resources. Both theoretical implications and directions for future research are discussed as well. Copyright © 2009 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Entrepreneur behaviors, opportunity recognition, and the origins of innovative ventures
Author-Name: Dyer, Jeffrey H.
Author-Name: Gregersen, Hal B
Author-Name: Christensen, Clayton
Abstract: This study traces the origins of innovative strategies by examining the attributes of ‘innovative entrepreneurs.’ In an inductive grounded theory study of innovative entrepreneurs, we develop a theory that innovative entrepreneurs differ from executives on four behavioral patterns through which they acquire information: (1) questioning; (2) observing; (3) experimenting; and (4) idea networking. We develop operational measures of each of these behaviors and find significant differences between innovative entrepreneurs and executives in a large sample survey of 72 successful and unsuccessful innovative entrepreneurs and 310 executives. Drawing on network theory, we develop a theory of entrepreneurial opportunity recognition that explains why these behaviors increase the probability of generating an idea for an innovative venture. We contend that one's ability to generate novel ideas for innovative new businesses is a function of one's behaviors that trigger cognitive processes to produce novel business ideas. We also posit that innovative entrepreneurs are less susceptible to the status quo bias and engage in these information-seeking behaviors with a motivation to change the status quo.

Title: Exercising entrepreneurial opportunities: The role of information‐gathering and information‐processing capabilities of the firm
Author-Name: Sleptsov, Alexander
Author-Name: Anand, Jaideep
Abstract: In this article, we study two capabilities that influence firms' effectiveness in exercising entrepreneurial opportunities: information-gathering and information-processing capability. We argue that their effects are not always positive or symmetrical. When the firm's information-processing capability is low, high levels of its information-gathering capability may result in lower effectiveness because of managerial cognitive overload. The effects of high information-processing capability are more nuanced and depend on whether the firm's information processing has experiential or cognitive character. Our analysis offers a counterintuitive insight: the firm may fail to exercise entrepreneurial opportunities effectively not only when it has low levels of information capabilities, but also when its levels are high but unbalanced.

Abstract: This study explores the label ‘opportunity’ in the strategic issue literature as a point of departure for offering an attributional framework for categorizing opportunities entrepreneurs offer as they undertake efforts to start businesses. The strategic issue literature broadly labels opportunities as being positive and controllable and involving potential gain. We demonstrate that this is similar to an attribution theory approach. In preparing this article, the authors analyzed open-ended questions from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED). Entrepreneurs were more likely to offer attributions about their opportunities that can be categorized as dependent on their abilities (internal and stable attributions) and efforts (internal and variable attributions).

Title: How relational capital and knowledge combination capability enhance the performance of work units in a high technology industry
Author-Name: Carmeli, Abraham
Author-Name: Azeroual, Benny
Abstract: The defense industry in Israel has long been considered a critical platform for the development of the high-technology sector. This study examines the importance of knowledge combination capability work units build through social relationships to enhance their performance. Specifically, we probe how both intraunit relational capital (within a unit) and interunit relational capital (across units) enable units to build knowledge combination capabilities and how such capabilities affect their performance. Data collected from senior managers in 122 knowledge units indicate that: (1) both intra- and interunit relational capital are positively related to knowledge combination capability; (2) knowledge combination capability is positively associated with enhanced unit performance; (3) knowledge combination capability fully mediates the relationship between interunit relational capital and unit performance; and (4) intraunit relational capital impacts both directly and indirectly (through knowledge combination capability) on unit performance. The findings suggest that interunit relational capital entails greater variation in knowledge stocks and thus may lead to more radical innovation than intra-relational capital that entails more similar knowledge bases and, thus, produces more incremental innovations.

Title: Investment dynamics and financial constraints in IPO firms
Author-Name: Chaddad, Fernando R.
Author-Name: Reuer, Jeffrey J.
Abstract: We join research in entrepreneurship and corporate finance to investigate financial constraints on investments by IPO firms. The evidence indicates that IPO firms generally possess valuable growth opportunities, yet financial constraints also limit their ability to exploit them. Capital expenditures decline significantly post-IPO, and information asymmetries between IPO firms and external capital providers help explain why some IPO firms are more financially constrained than others. Intangible assets that are often seen at the root of IPO firms' competitive advantages can also exacerbate external financing costs, constraining IPO firms' abilities to make future strategic investments. We also find that financial constraints are persistent, as they do not diminish as younger IPO firms mature. Copyright © 2009 Strategic Management Society.

Abstract: Affordable loss involves decision makers estimating what they might be able to put at risk and determining what they are willing to lose in order to follow a course of action. Using the entrepreneur's new venture plunge decision, this article combines insights from behavioral economics to develop a detailed analysis of the affordable loss heuristic. Specifically, we develop propositions to explain how individuals: (1) decide what they can afford to lose; and (2) what they are willing to lose in order to plunge into entrepreneurship. The article also discusses the implications of affordable loss for the economics of strategic entrepreneurship. Copyright © 2009 Strategic Management Society.

Abstract: What are the origins of entrepreneurial beliefs about new opportunities and the value of resources? In this article, we outline a theory and model of the emergence of entrepreneurial beliefs and novel strategies. We first summarize extant literature by highlighting both the experiential and perceptual (or observational) origins of entrepreneurial beliefs and strategies. Thereafter we carefully explicate the role that entrepreneurial theorizing plays in the emergence of novel beliefs about new opportunities and make links with experiential and perceptual arguments. We specifically discuss three key mechanisms of entrepreneurial theorizing, namely: (1) the triggering role of experiential and observational fragments; (2) the imagination of possibilities; and (3) reasoning and justification. Importantly, we also explicate the social mechanisms of entrepreneurial theorizing and the emergence of entrepreneurial beliefs and novel strategies, specifically by discussing the role of social interaction and self-selection in entrepreneurial activity.

Abstract: Technology ventures must often navigate through difficult times during their existence. In the entrepreneurship literature, however, relatively little research explores the question of how ventures weather the more acute adverse event. Analogous to captains who prepare their vessels for tumultuous waters, entrepreneurs establish the organizational characteristics to enable the survival of the initial shock of an adverse event. Thus, in this article we address the research question of what firm characteristics mitigate the impact of an adverse event based on the resource-based perspective and organizational slack literature. Our findings point to the importance of building capabilities to enable a venture to navigate difficult times. Copyright © 2009 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Research in social entrepreneurship: past contributions and future opportunities
Author-Name: Short, Jeremy C.
Author-Name: Moss, Todd W.
Author-Name: Lumpkin, G. T.
Abstract: Social entrepreneurship has been a topic of academic inquiry for nearly 20 years, yet relatively little scholarly output has appeared in mainstream management and entrepreneurship journals. Our review of this literature reveals that conceptual articles outnumber empirical studies, and empirical efforts often lack formal hypotheses and rigorous methods. These findings suggest that social entrepreneurship research remains in an embryonic state. Future research would benefit from the incorporation of multivariate methods to complement the case study techniques that have dominated previous efforts. Our review also suggests that social entrepreneurship is informed by common areas of interest to management scholars like entrepreneurship, public/nonprofit management, and social issues, all of which represent fruitful venues for future research efforts. Therefore, we recommend that scholars embrace key themes in strategic entrepreneurship and frame their research using established theories, such as contingency theory, creation theory, discovery theory, innovation diffusion theory, resource dependence theory, and other theoretical bases relevant to strategic entrepreneurship research.

Title: Dance with the one that brought you? Venture capital firms and the retention of founder‐CEOs
Author-Name: Pollock, Timothy G.
Author-Name: Fund, Bret R.
Author-Name: Baker, Ted
Abstract: We consider how a venture capital firm's perceived uncertainty in new and uncertain industry environments affects its decisions to retain founder-CEOs at companies they take public. We further consider how the human capital of the founder-CEO, the overall experience of the venture capital firm (VCF), and the VCF's specific experience with the new industry moderate the relationship between industry-based uncertainty and founder-CEO retention. We explore these issues in the context of 340 venture capital firm investments in Internet sector start-ups that went public from 1995 to 2000. We find evidence that industry-based uncertainty decreases the likelihood of founder-CEO retention, that founder-CEO human capital and VCF Internet-sector experience decreases the effects of these uncertainties on founder-CEO retention for business-to-business (B2B) firms, but increases them for business-to consumer (B2C) firms, and that VCF age further decreases the likelihood that the founder-CEOs of B2C firms will be retained.

Title: Understanding the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and strategic learning capability: an empirical investigation
Author-Name: Anderson, Brian S.
Author-Name: Covin, Jeffrey G.
Author-Name: Slevin, Dennis P.
Abstract: This research explores the relationship between strategic learning capability—a firm's proficiency at generating, and then acting on, strategic knowledge—and entrepreneurial orientation (EO). While theory posits the inevitably of building strategic learning capability from behaving entrepreneurially, there is little empirical research to validate this proposition and even less understanding of how and why EO contributes to strategic learning capability. Empirical results from 110 manufacturing firms confirm the direct effect of EO on strategic learning capability, and support is found for three constructs—structural organicity, market responsiveness, and strategy formation mode—that fully mediate the EO-strategic learning capability relationship.

Title: Does self‐efficacy affect entrepreneurial investment?
Author-Name: Cassar, Gavin
Author-Name: Friedman, Henry
Abstract: We empirically examine the effect of self-efficacy on entrepreneurial investment choices. We identify various attributes of entrepreneurial investment and argue that higher self-efficacy is associated with more aggressive entrepreneurial investment decisions. We show that self-efficacy increases the likelihood of being a nascent entrepreneur and creating an operating business. Self-efficacy also increases the proportion of personal wealth invested in the venture and the amount of hours per week the entrepreneur devotes to the venture. These results are significant even when controlling for other known characteristics associated with entrepreneurial investment. Copyright © 2009 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Placing the choice between exploration and exploitation in context: a study of geography and new product development
Author-Name: Coombs, Joseph E.
Author-Name: Deeds, David L.
Author-Name: Duane Ireland, R.
Abstract: Beginning with seminal research on organizational learning and continuing with the exploration versus exploitation and regional economics literatures, knowledge search has become central to innovation research. Drawing from these contributions, we examine the impact of a firm's geographic location munificence on benefits received either from exploiting its local knowledge base or from exploring for new knowledge beyond its local geographic boundaries. Results indicate that firm geographic context moderates the relationship between search strategies and new product development. In particular, firms located in munificent geographic locations benefit from geographically localized and international searches, while firms in less munificent geographic locations benefit from balanced and domestic search strategies.

Abstract: This article provides an overview of the literature on international entrepreneurship (henceforth, IE). In doing so, we adopt a broad perspective on IE, consistent with the notion that entrepreneurship refers to how opportunities to create future goods and services are discovered, evaluated, and exploited (Venkataraman, 1997). After providing focused summaries of the articles included in the special issue, we outline a research agenda to improve our understanding of the determinants and outcomes of IE. We also highlight several methodological issues of particular importance to IE research. Copyright © 2009 Strategic Management Society.

Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean A.
Abstract: International knowledge is a key intangible resource for international entrepreneurship. Yet, given the liabilities of newness and foreignness, how do new ventures obtain international knowledge? In this study, we draw on the knowledge-based view to investigate both internal and external sources of international knowledge for 206 new ventures. The findings suggest international knowledge may be sourced externally, including from alliance partners, venture capital firms, and firms in close proximity. Interestingly, and contrary to absorptive capacity arguments, new ventures with limited internationally experienced top management teams benefited most from external international knowledge sources.

Title: Oscillating improvisation: how entrepreneurial firms create success in foreign market entries over time
Author-Name: Bingham, Christopher B.
Abstract: This study explores how entrepreneurial firms become successful in foreign market entries over time. The setting is the foreign market entries of entrepreneurial firms with headquarters in Singapore, the U.S., and Finland. There are several findings. Firms with more successful foreign market entries decrease improvisation in opportunity selection but increase improvisation in opportunity execution. In contrast, firms with less successful foreign market entries do the opposite. Intriguingly, data suggest that increased improvisation in opportunity execution may be influenced by decreased improvisation in opportunity selection, whereas decreased improvisation in opportunity execution may be influenced by increased improvisation in opportunity selection. Overall, besides contributing fresh insights about the relationship between improvisation and performance in new venture firms, a central contribution of this study is shedding light on the texture of entrepreneurial cognition and the little known relationship between cognition, action, amended cognitions, and redirected action.

Abstract: In this article, we use the theoretical lens of resource and competence-based perspectives and global strategic network theory to analyze the effects of international R&D alliances on the performance of high-tech start-ups. In the empirical section of the article, we consider the European Union-funded international R&D alliances established by a large sample of Italian high-tech start-ups over the period from 1994 to 2003. We measure firm performance through total factor productivity, and we resort to generalized method of moments system estimates to detect the treatment effect of alliance formation according to type and home country of the partners. The econometric results suggest that international R&D alliances are most beneficial to high-tech start-ups if (1) they involve industrial partners located in a variety of countries and (2) these countries are closer to world knowledge sources.

Title: Signalling reputation in international online markets
Author-Name: Reuber, A. Rebecca
Author-Name: Fischer, Eileen
Abstract: Although online technology enables young and small firms to gain access to buyers in foreign markets efficiently, it does not overcome the liability of being an unknown seller among a sea of largely unknown firms. In order to internationalize effectively through online markets, such firms need to establish an online reputation within a context where there are a large number of competitors, most of (or all of) are relatively unfamiliar to customers. The purpose of this article is to explore how they might do so. Drawing on economics-based signalling theory as well as past research in the areas of strategic management, marketing, and MIS, we hypothesize that firm-controlled reputation signals with credible commitments—price, advertising, and umbrella branding—will impact reputational performance and moderate the impact of user-generated reputation signals. We test the hypotheses using data collected about software products sold on the Web site Download.com. Our results show that signalling by advertising and umbrella branding affects reputational performance. The article provides insights about signalling in online markets for managers developing reputation-building strategies, as well as for international entrepreneurship researchers.

Title: Technology emergence through entrepreneurship across multiple industries
Author-Name: Woolley, Jennifer
Abstract: Radical process discontinuities provide opportunities for the founding of new firms across multiple industries; however, little is known about such emergence activity. This article examines nascent technology emergence by studying patterns of related entrepreneurial activity across multiple industries based on a radical process discontinuity. Using historical and statistical methods to examine all nanotechnology firms founded before 2005, I find that during technology emergence, entrepreneurship occurs first in upstream industries. These upstream entrepreneurs provide the technological foundations that enable the founding of firms in other industries developing the technology. The results show the role of industry interaction in the development of both upstream and downstream industries. Implications for entrepreneurs and technology emergence are discussed.

Title: How alliance formation shapes corporate venture capital investment in the software industry: a resource‐based perspective
Author-Name: Dushnitsky, Gary
Author-Name: Lavie, Dovev
Abstract: Corporate venture capital (CVC) investments serve as interfirm relationships that enable established firms to tap into emerging technology markets. Nevertheless, firms may also leverage their strategic alliances to this end. Does alliance formation reinforce or attenuate a firm's tendency to invest in entrepreneurial ventures? We introduce a resource-based perspective whereby resource complementarity and network resource visibility prompt a reinforcing association between CVC investment and alliance formation. In turn, external resource redundancy and internal resource allocation constraints yield an attenuating effect of alliance formation on CVC investment. Analyzing the alliances and CVC investments of 372 software firms during the 1990s, we reconcile these opposing arguments by revealing an inverted U-shaped association between CVC investment and alliance formation. Accordingly, the number of CVC investments first increases, but then decreases, with the number of alliances formed. Moreover, the positive association between CVC investment and alliance formation diminishes as firms invest in their internal resource stocks, mature, and accumulate experience with prior CVC investments. We advance strategic entrepreneurship research by elucidating the tendency of established firms to engage in CVC investment and by unpacking the complex association between different types of interfirm relationships that these firms leverage.

Title: How entrepreneurs acquire the capacity to excel: insights from research on expert performance
Author-Name: Baron, Robert A.
Author-Name: Henry, Rebecca A.
Abstract: Most new ventures fail, but a few prosper and attain rapid growth. Many factors contribute to such outcomes, but we propose that among these are mechanisms identified by cognitive science research on the origins of expert performance. Literature on this topic indicates that across many fields (e.g., medicine, science, sports, music), outstanding performance derives largely from participation in intense, prolonged, and highly focused efforts to improve current performance—a process known as deliberate practice. By comparison, mere experience in a field and individual talent play smaller roles in generating expert performance. Additional evidence indicates that participation in deliberate practice does not simply expand domain-specific knowledge and skills; it also generates actual enhancements to basic cognitive resources (e.g., memory, perception, metacognition). We suggest that to the extent entrepreneurs acquire enhanced cognitive resources through current or past deliberate practice, their capacity to perform tasks related to new venture success (e.g., accurate identification and evaluation of business opportunities) is enhanced and, hence, the performance of their new ventures, too, is augmented. Specific ways in which entrepreneurs can gain enhanced cognitive resources are described, and implications for entrepreneurship theory and practice are considered.

Title: The production of entrepreneurial opportunity: a constructivist perspective
Author-Name: Wood, Matthew S.
Author-Name: McKinley, William
Abstract: This article presents a conceptual model of entrepreneurial opportunity production from a constructivist perspective. The model assumes that opportunity production proceeds through several stages, including conceptualization of an opportunity idea by an entrepreneur, objectification of that idea, and enactment of the opportunity into a new venture. However, not all opportunity ideas survive this full process. Between the conceptualization stage and the objectification stage, some ideas are abandoned due to inadequate objectification. Also, between the objectification stage and the enactment stage, some objectified opportunities are abandoned due to insufficient resource support. We identify variables that influence the likelihood that opportunity ideas will be objectified and other variables that influence the likelihood that objectified opportunities will be enacted, and these variables are incorporated into empirically testable propositions. In the discussion section, we describe several boundary conditions for our theory, contrast the theory with objectivist (discovery) theory, and derive implications for future research.

Title: Foreign entry and survival in a knowledge‐intensive market: emerging economy countries' international linkages, technology competences, and firm experience
Author-Name: Giarratana, Marco S.
Author-Name: Torrisi, Salvatore
Abstract: This article examines the entry into and survival in the U.S. software market by a sample of firms based in India, Ireland, and Israel, with a focus on the pre-entry technological capabilities, international linkages, and home-based experience of these firms as determinants. Using a novel measure of foreign activity, namely, the registration of software trademarks in the United States, this study applies the date of the first trademark application filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as a proxy for a firm's U.S. entry. Trademark renewals and new trademark applications trace the sample firms' survival. The analysis shows that international linkages have a positive relationship with entry and survival, whereas firm technological capabilities and age are not associated with entry, though technological capabilities affect the likelihood of survival.

Title: A story of breakthrough versus incremental innovation: corporate entrepreneurship in the global pharmaceutical industry
Author-Name: Dunlap‐Hinkler, Denise
Author-Name: Kotabe, Masaaki
Author-Name: Mudambi, Ram
Abstract: Breakthrough innovations are difficult to create, yet they are critical to long-term competitive advantage. This highlights the considerable opportunities and risks that face corporate entrepreneurs. We study the complex explorative and exploitative entrepreneurial processes of multinational firms operating in the global pharmaceutical industry. We analyze over 1,500 new drug approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We find that a successful track record in breakthrough innovation significantly increases the likelihood of a current breakthrough, while achievements in nongeneric incremental innovation do not have a significant effect. A strong foundation in generic incremental innovation hinders breakthrough performance. Thus, incremental innovation processes appear to be heterogeneous. Products that emerge from joint ventures and alliances are more likely to be breakthroughs. Foreign subsidiary participation in innovation processes did not significantly inhibit breakthroughs. These suggestive findings support the decentralization literature that highlights the benefits associated with exploiting knowledge from foreign centers of excellence. Contrary to the literature arguing that younger firms tend to have greater advantages in exploration, we do not find firm age to be a significant predictor of the likelihood of breakthrough innovation.

Title: Spiky globalization of venture capital investments: the influence of prior human networks
Author-Name: Iriyama, Akie

Author-Name: Madhavan, Ravi
Abstract: We demonstrate a spiky globalization pattern in the cross-border spread of venture capital: rather than being uniformly distributed, cross-border venture capital flows are unevenly distributed, in that certain regions of the U.S. display particularly intense linkages with certain foreign nations. We posit that such spiky globalization of venture capital is driven by the spiky globalization pattern of prior human networks between locations, and we provide empirical results supportive of our hypothesis. Specifically, we reason that immigrant entrepreneurs inherently tend to collocate with each other in their host nation, thus advantaging certain regions in the competition to act as sources and destinations of cross-border venture capital. This study sheds new light on geographical patterns in international venture capital and entrepreneurship. Copyright © 2010 Strategic Management Society.

Title: The effects of network's structural holes: polycentric institutions, product portfolio, and new venture growth in China and Russia
Author-Name: Batjargal, Bat
Abstract: This study examines the effect of network's structural holes (i.e., the absence of a link between two contacts who are both linked to an actor) on product development and profit growth of software ventures in two different institutional contexts—China and Russia. Using interview data of 159 software entrepreneurs in Beijing and Moscow, the study found that the effect of structural holes is contingent upon country institutional context and venture development stage. Specifically, structural holes have a positive main effect on product portfolio, but a negative main effect on profit growth in the second revenue year (early stage of venture development). Structural holes are more useful in the Russian institutional context compared to the Chinese institutional context due to the polycentricity of institutions. The research implications of the findings are discussed. Copyright © 2010 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Learning from experience and learning from others: how congenital and interorganizational learning substitute for experiential learning in young firm internationalization
Author-Name: Bruneel, Johan
Author-Name: Yli‐Renko, Helena
Author-Name: Clarysse, Bart
Abstract: This article addresses a critical issue for entrepreneurs and managers pursuing internationalization strategies: how firms can accumulate the knowledge and skills required for successful international expansion. Specifically, we examine how young firms may compensate for their lack of firm-level international experience by utilizing other sources of knowledge. Drawing on organizational learning theory, we develop an integrative framework that looks at the joint and interactive effects of experiential learning by the firm, the management team's pre-start-up international experience (i.e., congenital learning), and interorganizational learning from key exchange partners (customers, suppliers, investors, etc.). Utilizing empirical data on 114 young, technology-based firms in Flanders, Belgium, we find that a firm's level of international experience negatively moderates the effects of congenital and interorganizational learning on the extent of internationalization. That is, the lower a firm's experiential learning, the more significant the effects of the start-up team's prior international knowledge base and the knowledge and skills acquired through key partners. These results make important theoretical and empirical contributions to the international entrepreneurship and organizational learning literatures by highlighting some of the factors underlying learning advantages of newness that facilitate the internationalization of young firms and by explicating substitutive interrelationships among different learning mechanisms.

Title: Small worlds, infinite possibilities? How social networks affect entrepreneurial team formation and search
Author-Name: Aldrich, Howard E.
Author-Name: Kim, Phillip H.
Abstract: The social network perspective has become an important analytical lens for understanding strategic actions among entrepreneurs. Social theorists offer two competing visions of networks' configurations: one of infinite opportunities for individuals to develop heterogeneous circles of affiliations and the other of constrained opportunities privileging only certain individuals. We draw on this tension to describe three models of network formation – random, small world, and truncated scale free – and apply them to entrepreneurial team formation and resource mobilization strategies undertaken by entrepreneurs. We compare and contrast two models of team formation – a rational process model and an interpersonal relations model – and identify the network contexts under which each is most applicable. Mundane entrepreneurial teams arise within localized clusters and appear unlikely to take advantage of what network theorists have called small world networks, which depend upon bridging ties between clusters. Nonetheless, there are entrepreneurial strategies through which new ventures might achieve the advantages of small world networks. To the extent that new ventures emerge in truncated scale free networks, their founders must work within a highly centralized structure, with its institutionalized standards making team formation and entrepreneurial search more instrumental than within small worlds.

Author-Name: Carr, Jon C.

Author-Name: Zahra, Shaker A.
Abstract: Research on firm internationalization has focused primarily on the antecedents, rather than outcomes, of the strategic decision to enter foreign markets. In addition, factors moderating the outcomes of internationalization have not received systematic analysis. Aiming to fill these gaps in the literature, the current study examines the moderating effects of firm age on postinternationalization survival and growth. Consistent with the liabilities of newness perspective, we suggest that firm age will have a positive moderating effect on postinternationalization survival. Building from the liabilities of aging perspective, we propose that firm age will have a negative moderating effect on postinternationalization short-term growth. We test these arguments using a longitudinal sample of 787 firms. Results showed that, postinternationalization, younger firms experienced significantly higher rates of short-term growth than older firms. Findings regarding firm age and survival, postinternationalization, were, however, not conclusive. Overall, our findings indicate that the timing of internationalization has important implications with regard to the short-term growth of firms. Copyright © 2010 Strategic Management Society.

Title: A family firm variant of the behavioral agency theory
Author-Name: Lim, Elizabeth N. K.
Author-Name: Lubatkin, Michael H.
Author-Name: Wiseman, Robert M.
Abstract: There is currently a debate in the literature regarding whether family firm ownership fosters or discourages risk-taking activities. In this article, we propose a contingency framework that shifts the focus of investigation: instead of asking whether family firms tend to be risk takers, we suggest specific ownership conditions under which privately owned family-managed firms are more likely to engage in risk taking. We do so by integrating concepts from the behavioral agency model and a resource-based concept known as familiness to advance a base proposition that explains the effects of different ownership structures (controlling ownership, sibling partnership, and cousin consortium) on risk-taking behaviors in family firms. Then, drawing insights from the family firm and household economics literatures, we discuss the contingent effects of three distinct forms of altruism (parental, paternalistic, and psychosocial) on the base proposition. The framework advances our current understanding of risk taking in family businesses in two ways: first, by proposing how and when risk-taking behaviors differ across these firms; and second, by offering a variant of the base behavioral agency model that is better suited for explaining risk taking at family firms.

Abstract: This article applies a real options approach to analyzing the impact of a firm's investment in appropriable technology (as represented by the intensity of its patenting activities and capital investment) on the firm's opportunities to create value through future investment (as represented by Tobin's q). Recognizing the mixed results with regard to the relationship between patenting and firm value, we argue that such investment may primarily create value by offering future technology options and that the relationship may be more appropriately modeled on the basis of real options theory. We argue that patenting creates and replenishes a firm's technology options whereas capital investment entails the exercise of such options. Three hypotheses are derived from a valuation model based on the real options approach and tested using a fixed-effects panel data procedure. The results of our empirical analysis using a sample of 161 U.S.-based biotechnology firms are consistent with our predictions. Copyright © 2010 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Intellectual property protection and the formation of entrepreneurial growth aspirations
Author-Name: Autio, Erkko
Author-Name: Acs, Zoltan
Abstract: Applying real options logic, we build and test a multilevel model that explicates the influence of a country's intellectual property protection regime on the effect of an individual's human and financial capital on entrepreneurial growth aspirations. The results suggest that the strength of the intellectual property regime moderates negatively the relationship between an individual's education and entrepreneurial growth aspirations; and it moderates positively the relationship between an individual's household income and growth aspirations. Intellectual property protection, thereby, encourages specialization amongst differently qualified entrepreneurs. Our findings support claims that strategic entrepreneurial behaviors cannot be fully understood without giving attention to the context in which those behaviors are observed.

Title: Parent firm effects on founder turnover: parent success, founder legitimacy, and founder tenure
Author-Name: Boeker, Warren
Author-Name: Fleming, Brandon
Abstract: Empirical studies examining new ventures have demonstrated a significant degree of founder turnover after start-up as founders are replaced by ‘professional’ managers. We examine how founders' past experience in their prior employer (their parent firm) affects their tenure in the new venture. Founders coming from more successful parent firms, with more prior affiliations among the venture's cofounders and with prior start-up experience are more likely to remain with the new venture after founding. These effects are more pronounced in cases where the technologies employed by the start-up are more uncertain. Copyright © 2010 Strategic Management Society.

Title: Knowledge spillovers and strategic entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Agarwal, Rajshree
Author-Name: Audretsch, David
Author-Name: Sarkar, Mb
Abstract: Knowledge spillovers and strategic entrepreneurship has each been the subject of much scholarly attention, but have largely been considered separately rather than in conjunction with each other. In this article, we develop implications of the link between knowledge spillovers and strategic entrepreneurship and identify key topics, themes, and issues for future research. In doing so, we also showcase the articles of the special issue, as they shed light on some unanswered questions and identify additional areas for fruitful research.

Title: Spillovers, spill‐ins, and strategic entrepreneurship: America's first commercial jet airplane and Boeing's ascendancy in commercial aviation
Author-Name: Kotha, Suresh
Abstract: Building on recent studies on knowledge spillovers and spill-ins, this study traces the post-World War II knowledge spillovers during the early days of the modern commercial aviation industry. It examines the impact these spillovers had on opportunity- and advantage-seeking behaviors (i.e., strategic entrepreneurship) of the leading American incumbents: Douglas, Lockheed, Boeing, and a new entrant, de Havilland of Great Britain. Specifically, it highlights the processes triggered by knowledge spillovers that led to internal knowledge generation, innovations and, ultimately, Boeing's ascendancy in commercial aviation. It shows that knowledge spillovers and the concomitant processes they trigger can provide a powerful lens for studying opportunity- and advantage-seeking behavior in incumbents and entrants and the resultant outcomes of this dynamic. This study sensitizes researchers to examine the nuanced and complex interplay among knowledge generation, knowledge spillovers and spill-ins, and strategic entrepreneurship within a specific industry context to explain performance outcomes.

Title: A predator–prey model of knowledge spillovers and entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Parker, Simon C.
Abstract: Knowledge spillovers are known to generate positive benefits for entrepreneurs, but may come at the expense of knowledge creation by the incumbent firms which generate them. This article develops a predator–prey model of knowledge spillovers which captures the interdependence between idea-creating incumbents and knowledge spillover-appropriating entrepreneurs. The values of the model's parameters determine whether these two populations of firms settle down in a stable equilibrium; cycle over time with entrepreneurs doing well when incumbents do badly and vice-versa; or drive each other to extinction. This sheds light on disparate industry life cycle patterns observed in previous research and generates some novel insights relating to public policy. In particular, the model suggests that governments ought to adopt a dynamic policy stance, initially implementing policies which favor incumbents before shifting their intervention efforts toward encouraging entrepreneurs.

Title: Localized knowledge spillovers and skill‐biased performance
Author-Name: Gambardella, Alfonso
Author-Name: Giarratana, Marco S.
Abstract: This article focuses on a relatively unappreciated consequence of localized knowledge spillovers: their implications for productivity across skills. Spillovers benefit skilled workers more than unskilled ones, weaken complementarity between them, and widen their productivity gap. To test this theory, the authors use data from 146 U.S. cities and find that cities with a greater intensity of localized knowledge spillovers exhibit a bigger productivity gap across skills, after controlling for the endogeneity of knowledge spillovers, interindustry differences, and other factors. These results imply that in the long run, economies characterized by localized knowledge spillovers encourage investments in education and attract skilled people, raising the relative share of the skilled population. When complementarity across skills weakens, this analysis also offers a framework to link localized knowledge spillovers to the formation of entrepreneurial skill-intensive firms.
