Title: Being Different: How Normative and Cognitive Aspects of Institutional Environments Influence Technology Transfer
Author-Name: Kamal A. Munir
Abstract: This article provides a novel perspective on technology transfer by arguing that incorporation of a new technology into an organization may require it to become different in more ways than existing research would have us believe. This is especially true when host and home organizations are based in two widely different institutional environments. Because institutional pressures exert themselves on organizational behavior from both outside and inside the organization, they are critical in determining whether the transfer process is successful. Borrowing from institutional theory, the institutional environment of an organization is divided into regulative, normative and cognitive aspects. It is argued that, although less obvious in their influence, normative and cognitive institutions are no less important than the relatively more visible regulatory institutions. This article discusses how normative and cognitive aspects of the institutional environment affect international technology transfer and offers pr...

Title: Interlocking Interactions, the Diffusion of Innovations in Health Care
Author-Name: Louise Fitzgerald

Author-Name: Chris Hawkins
Abstract: This article aims to provide a reassessment of the processes of diffusion of innovations into organizations, based on new empirical data. The focus of the article is the latter stages of the diffusion process. The article draws on the results of two studies, which examined the diffusion of innovations in health care in the UK. These projects were a matched pair of qualitative studies, using purposeful selections of comparative case studies. The results demonstrate the ambiguous, contested nature of new scientific knowledge. The highly interactive nature of diffusion, with active adopters is illustrated. There is no evidence of a single adoption decision. The science is socially mediated. The features of context and of actors interlock to influence diffusion.

Title: At the Critical Moment: Conditions and Prospects for Critical Management Studies
Author-Name: Valerie Fournier
Author-Name: Chris Grey
Abstract: We have recently witnessed a growing, if still arguably marginal, interest in `Critical Management Studies' (CMS). Our aim in this paper is to reflect upon the popularization of CMS; more specifically, we propose to examine the various factors that have contributed to its emergence, and to review the significance of its project. We start by exploring the conditions of possibility for CMS and point to a combination of political, institutional and epistemological trends. In the second part of the paper, we consider what constitutes `CMS' and suggest that whilst it draws upon a plurality of intellectual traditions, CMS is unified by an anti performative stance, and a commitment to (some form of) denaturalization and reflexivity. Finally, we articulate the polemics around which CMS politics have been contested, in particular we review the debates between neo-Marxism and post-structuralism, and discuss the issue of engagement with management practice.

Title: Creating a Hybrid Organizational Form from Parental Blueprints: The Emergence and Evolution of Knowledge Firms
Author-Name: Amalya L. Oliver
Author-Name: Kathleen Montgomery
Abstract: Using a case study of a new biotechnology firm, we examine the formation of a new organizational form as a hybrid emerging from two `parent' organizational forms. We focus on key internal labor processes that are selected from existing organizations and replicated in the hybrid form and argue that this inheritance process strengthens the likelihood of survival of the new form. We propose that analyzing the micro-level processes of inheritance contributes to the understanding of macro-level phenomena of organizational births and deaths, examined by population ecologists.

Title: The Role of Intuition in Strategic Decision Making
Author-Name: Naresh Khatri
Author-Name: H. Alvin Ng
Abstract: Although intuitive processes are critical for effective strategic decision making, there is little in the way of applied research on the topic. Apart from many popularized treatments of intuition in the literature today, there are only a handful of serious scholarly works on the subject. The majority of them are essentially theoretical in nature; field research in management settings is virtually nonexistent. This study examined this neglected but important process in strategic decision making. We surveyed senior managers of companies representing computer, banking, and utility industries in the United States and found that intuitive processes are used often in organizational decision making. Use of intuitive synthesis was found to be positively associated with organizational performance in an unstable environment, but negatively so in a stable environment.

Title: The Meaning Professionals Give to Management... and Strategy
Author-Name: John McAuley

Abstract: The relationship between professionals and the organizations in which they work has been seen over the years as problematic. There is literature which suggests that the type of organization in which they work and are allowed to flourish is the quintessential form of organization for our times. There is also literature which suggests that professionals are reluctant, idiosyncratic members of the organizations in which they work, related to this perspective, there is literature which suggests that they are essentially placed in reactive mode as they are exposed to the cut and thrust of management agendas that are designed to control their activities. In all these strands of literature, there is a strong suggestion that professionals take little interest in the activity known as managing. This paper is primarily concerned to explore the issues that confront one particular group of professionals - research scientists who work in the public sector-as they experience a particular approach to management known as...

Abstract: While ascribing beliefs to one's subjects is a common practice for most ethnographers, I argue that this task is far more difficult and error-prone than commonly realized. I lay out the fundamental epistemological problems for belief ascribers and explain why certain sorts of ascriptions are especially difficult to make accurately. I suggest some guidelines for making ethnographic belief ascription less error-prone.

Title: What Do Ethnographers Believe?
Author-Name: John R. Weeks
Abstract: Jones overstates his case when he labels ethnographic belief ascription as `inherently risky' and `fraught with fundamental epistemological difficulties'. The logical problem he identifies is this: ethnographic techniques of observation and interrogation cannot determine with certainty whether particular beliefs actually exist in the form of mental objects of psychological structures in the minds of subjects. But there is no evidence that ethnographers believe themselves to be describing mental objects or psychological structures in their work. The problems of accurately ascribing beliefs to others are real enough, but they are practical, not logical, and ethnography remains the best method for overcoming them.

Abstract: This introductory chapter looks at the antecedents, the nature and the various dimensions of'teamworking'. Teamworking is drawing on a variety of traditions, which has resulted in a number of different types and designs of teams. It is necessary to keep all dimensions in mind in order to reach a historically informed judgement of the current forms of teamworking and their shortcomings. Variants of teams need to be analysed by employing a multidimensional framework - teamworking will be more appropriate in some settings than in others. This caution, which had been an aspect of sociotechnical systems thinking from its inception, is shared by all the papers selected for this special issue.

Title: High Road and Low Road Teamworking: Perceptions of Management Rationales and                 Organizational and Human Resource Outcomes
Author-Name: Nicolas Bacon
Author-Name: Paul Blyton
Abstract: In this article, we explore the relationship between two different types of teamworking, perceptions of management rationales for introducing teamworking and organizational and human resource outcomes. Teamworking is classified into two different types: `high road' and `low road' teamworking. Management rationales for introducing teamworking are categorized as economic, social and cultural. Organizational performance is assessed by perceptions of plant competitiveness, customer care and product quality. We measure human resource outcomes through worker responses, training and promotion, communication and consultation, role of trade union and health and safety. The findings indicate that `high road' teamworking is associated with broader management rationales, and is perceived to have a greater positive impact upon both organizational performance and human resource outcomes. Particular features of high road teams - delayered management, flexible job descriptions, fewer pay bands and grades - were associate...

Title: Shopfloor Responsibilities Under Lean Teamworking
Author-Name: Rick Delbridge
Author-Name: James Lowe
Author-Name: Nick Oliver
Abstract: This paper reports managerial views of the responsibilities of teams, team members and functional specialists under lean production, based on the findings of an international study of management practices in the automotive components industry. The findings show limited evidence of shopfloor worker autonomy under lean team-working or of increases in technical skill; blue-collar specialists remain responsible for maintenance activities. However, the Taylorist separation of planning and execution appears to be partially reversed as operators are expected to make significant contributions to problem solving, innovation and improvement activities. Personnel issues remain largely the prerogative of senior management and white-collar specialists. The role of middle managers appears to be `hollowed out' as shopfloor employees, particularly team leaders, take more responsibility for some activities. The findings emphasize the importance of distinguishing between the roles of members and leaders within teams, and b...

Title: Bewitched, bothered and bewildered: The meaning and experience of teamworking                 for employees in an automobile company
Author-Name: David Knights
Author-Name: Darren McCabe
Abstract: Recent managerial discourses share similar assumptions about organizations and the means to their greater efficiency. One of these is a faith in teamworking as a method of ensuring that human resources are effectively mobilized to achieve the unquestioned benefits of any specific technology or prescriptive programme. In this article we will explore what teamworking means for employees' lives within an automobile manufacturing company. We question the taken-for-granted assumption within managerialist accounts that teamworking will simply be welcomed by, and is beneficial for, employees. We also offer a ray of hope to those critics who warn of the normalizing effects of teamworking. We argue that, just as there is no single form of teamworking, there is also no single experience of teamworking. We broadly identify the reactions of three types of employees as a heuristic device. First, there are those who seem `bewitched' by the discourse of teamworking and who internalize its norms and values. Second, there...

Title: Production Teamworking: The Importance of Interdependence and Autonomy for                 Employee Strain and Satisfaction
Author-Name: Christine A. Sprigg
Author-Name: Paul R. Jackson
Author-Name: Sharon K. Parker
Abstract: A UK manufacturer introduced a common model of teamworking which achieved quite different performance results in wire-mills and roperies. Survey data (n = 231) showed higher job-related strain and lower job satisfaction in the wire-mills, where teamworking was not a success. Findings indicated that the differences in employee well-being could be accounted for by contrasting levels of process inter-dependence in the two production areas. Teamworking was a success in the roperies where process interdependence was high, but not in the wire-mills where there was a mismatch between this production process characteristic and a team-based form of work organization. Interactions between interdependence and autonomy were also found, such that higher autonomy had a positive impact only for those working in low interdependence processes. The unintended consequence of teamworking under low interdependence is to create winners and losers, as individual team-members take on responsibilities of the team as a whole.

Title: In Search of Perfect People Teamwork and Team Players in the Scottish Spirits Industry
Author-Name: Patricia Findlay

Author-Name: Paul Thompson
Abstract: Much of the mainstream and critical literatures stress the potential of teamwork for normative integration through socialization and peer pressure. This article utilizes case studies in the large bottling halls of spirits producers in Scotland to explore the characteristics of and limits to such integration. A multi-dimensional model of team-work and an examination of both practices and attitudes enables the research to identify the variety of managerial objectives and out-comes across and within the plants. Though the extent of integration varies between the teams, the overall results lead to scepticism about whether team members can be considered as socially engineered individuals who have internalized company normative demands. These findings, it is argued, are compatible with the majority of comparable case study research.

Title: Trust and the Design of Work Complementary Constructs in Satisfaction and Performance
Author-Name: J. Barton Cunningham
Author-Name: James MacGregor
Abstract: The article presents results that indicate that trust and job design are complementary concepts in understanding outcomes like intention to quit and satisfaction. We conceptualized a worker's beliefs that a supervisor can be trusted as being composed of three main elements - beliefs in the supervisor's predictability, benevolence and fairness. This was motivated in part by a desire to conceptualize trust in a way that distinguished it from leader-member exchange (LMX) quality. The capacity of this measure of trust to predict self-reported outcomes was then compared with a job's motivational potential score, as a way of testing the trust measure's criterion validity. To do so, the results from two separate surveys were analysed. The first was based on the questionnaire responses of 535 employees in the telephone industry in the province of British Columbia; the second, of 230 service station employees from across Canada. In the studies reported here, supervisor relationships accounted for a significant amo...

Title: Ethnography and Sister Sciences: Why Refuse Assistance? A Reply to Weeks
Author-Name: Todd Edwin Jones
Abstract: Social scientists (most recently John Weeks) tend to reply to arguments about epistemological difficulties for belief ascription with two responses. An epistemological response goes: Behavioral evidence for underlying beliefs `is all we have and all we need'. A metaphysical response argues that beliefs, being merely instrumental entities are not really subject to worries about underdetermination. In this article, I argue that these responses are inadequate, and that social science practice can be greatly improved by incorporating cognitive-science constraints into the practice of ascribing beliefs.

Abstract: Personal control over one's work environment is an important theme in many branches of the social sciences. In the present study, longitudinal field data were used to assess a model of personal control in organizational settings. Business school graduates completed questionnaires prior to graduation and after 4 months (n = 297) and 10 months (n = 231) on the job. The results suggest two distinct responses to perceived personal control. The first implies a proactive orientation where control begets control: self-efficacy was positively associated with control, both variables were positively associated with problem-focused reactance, control and reactance were both negatively related to helplessness, and helplessness was negatively related to work adjustment. The second response to personal control implies a reactive orientation where unmet expectations prompt a sense of futility and withdrawal: control was negatively associated with unmet expectations, and unmet expectations were positively associated with...

Abstract: The present study examined the impact participation in decision-making (PDM) had on the relationship between perceptions of organizational politics and expressions of job satisfaction among 1251 public sector employees. We hypothesized that perceptions of organizational politics would reduce job satisfaction and that the detrimental effect of poltics on job satisfaction would be weakest among workers who engage in consensus decision-making with their supervisors. We used confirmatory factor analyses to determine whether the variables used in this study reflected distinct constructs. Then, we used correlational analysis and hierarchical moderated multiple regression analyses to test the hypotheses. Results indicated that the variables reflected distinct constructs and confirmed the hypotheses. Examination of the interaction indicated that the effect of PDM on job satisfaction was robust at high levels of perceived politics.

Abstract: This study examined perceived political behaviors as a critical, yet largely overlooked, component in the traditional organizational politics perceptions model. Further, this study developed an expanded version of the traditional antecedents to politics perceptions and examined the mediating effect of perceptions of politics in the model. Results from 260 full-time employees suggested that the use of reactive/defensive political behaviors exacerbated the already negative effects of perceived organizational politics on outcomes. Further, the set of variables that come from the job/work environment were found to explain more variance in perceptions of organizational politics than the set of organizational or individual variables. Finally, perceptions of politics demonstrated mediation effects between the antecedent variables and job satisfaction, job anxiety, and intent to turnover Discussion centers around the expanded model and the need to conceptually and empirically link politics perceptions with politi...

Title: The Relationship between Commitment Forms and Work Outcomes: A Comparison of Three Models
Author-Name: Aaron Cohen
Abstract: This study examined three models of the relationships between commitment foci and work outcomes such as turnover intentions, actual turnover, and absenteeism. The first is based on the traditional literature that argues that the relationship between commitment foci and outcomes is direct. The second is based on Morrow's model of universal forms of work commitment. According to this model, job involvement mediates the relationship between the other commitment foci and outcomes. The third model is based on the conceptualization proposed by Randall and Cote. According to their model organizational commitment and occupational commitment should mediate the relationship between commitment foci and out-comes. In the study 283 nurses from three small hospitals in Israel were surveyed with a response rate of 62 percent. The results of path analysis (LISREL VIII) showed a better fit to the data of the Randall and Cote model. The article concludes with implications regarding the continuing assessment of Morrow's con...

Abstract: This study expands theoretical research on negotiated culture by testing basic assumptions in the context of a German-Japanese joint venture. Data collected by semi-structured interviews are analyzed using textual analysis software to uncover key issues that became catalysts for negotiation. Results include a model of cultural negotiation linking organizational events with issue domains as points of departure for negotiations. Results show that aggregate models of cultural difference are useful only to the extent that they serve as latent conceptual anchors guiding individuals' cultural responses to events. The study shows that structural/contextual influences together with individuals' culturally determined sense-making with regard to specific organizational events are more useful determinants of negotiated outcomes. Authors conclude that, while it is unlikely we can predict organizational culture formation in complex cultural organizations, we can understand the process of cultural negotiation and as a ...

Title: Life Role Salience: A Study of Dual-Career Couples in the Indian Context

Abstract: To explain career development of professional men and women, the developmental approach is becoming increasingly popular as it allows for a broad perspective encompassing both work and family roles. It recognizes the fact that developmentally men and women are different. The present study explored whether, for dual-career couples working in the Indian context, the salience attached to different life roles by male and female partners does indeed vary differentially across the life cycle in keeping with the propositions of the adult developmental theories of men and women. Data were collected from 92 dual-career couples. Results provided only partial support for the propositions of adult development theories, examined in terms of the differences between the life role salience of male and female partners. In particular, the expected reversal of salience attached to work and family roles at mid-life, between men and women, was not evident. Our results seem to challenge the universality of the existing develop...

Title: Organizational Commitment as a Mediator of the Relationship between Islamic Work Ethic and Attitudes toward Organizational Change
Author-Name: Danvish A. Yousef
Abstract: This study investigates the role of organizational commitment as a mediator between the Islamic work ethic (IWE) and attitudes toward organizational change. The study uses a sample of 474 employees from 30 organizations in five districts in the United Arab Emirates. The results of path analysis indicate that the IWE directly and positively influences various dimensions of both attitudes toward organizational change and organizational commitment. Furthermore, affective commitment mediates the influences of the IWE on both affective and behavioral tendency dimensions of attitudes toward organizational change. On the other hand, continuance and normative commitments mediate the influences of the IWE on cognitive dimension of attitudes toward change, while continuance commitment mediates the influences of the IWE on the behavioral tendency dimension of attitudes toward change. Implications, limitations and lines of future research are discussed.

Title: Research Note Measuring Organizational Culture Clashes: A Two-Nation Post-Hoc Analysis of a Cultural Compatibility Index
Author-Name: John Veiga

Abstract: Though the concept of `culture clash' has been widely discussed and written about in the context of mergers and acquisitions, the literature has been relatively silent about how to empirically measure this phenomenon. Given the difficulties associated with developing and testing such a measure - especially gaining access to sufficient numbers of firms which have recently experienced a merger - it is not surprising that little has been done. In this paper, we present a post-hoc analysis of a cultural compatibility index that was developed as part of a multi-study survey that we conducted. In addition, we provide evidence of the measure's integrity in two different national cultures. The analysis is based on a survey of executives of acquired British and French firms as to their perceptions of compatibility with the organizational values of the buying firms. We found evidence to suggest that the measure is a reliable and valid congruence index within and across national contexts.

Title: Who Accumulates Directorships of Big Business Firms in Israel?: Organizational Structure, Social Capital and Human Capital
Author-Name: Daniel Maman
Abstract: This article studies which of the directors of the largest corporations in Israel were invited to sit on additional boards of directors between the years 1974 and 1988. The article compares organizational affiliations, and the human and social capital of directors who accumulate directorships with those who do not. The study uses logistic regression to discern which variables increase the likelihood of being invited on to an additional board. The findings strongly support the hypothesis that it is a combination of the structure of the national economy and human and social capital of the directors which determines who will join additional boards.

Title: Scientific Management, Culture and Control: A First-Hand Account of Taylorism in Practice
Author-Name: Oswald Jones
Abstract: In this article I examine the changes that occurred in a large domestic appliance factory over a 12 year period. The appointment of a new managing director was the catalyst for many innovations in the plant including the ending of PBR (payment by results) and the use of stopwatches by work study engineers (WSEs). Despite senior managerial efforts to change the organizational culture those employed in the work study department continued to exert considerable influence over factory design and work organization. In the article I present a first-hand account of the way in which individual identity and subjectivity contributed to a distinctive subculture. This masculine culture encouraged conflict with shopfloor workers even after the PBR scheme had been discontinued. Hence, the article focuses on the way in which the subjective experiences of a small group of WSEs influenced the organization of shopfloor work as well as relationships between workers and manager

Title: Honourable Members and Dishonourable Deeds: Sensemaking, Impression Management and Legitimation in the `Arms to Iraq Affair'
Author-Name: Andrew D. Brown
Author-Name: Matthew Jones
Abstract: The general assumption of consonance between belief and action in individual and organizational behaviour has meant that relatively little attention is paid in the organizational literature to how individuals and organizations respond to allegations of belief/act discrepancy. In this article we identify three forms of response to such allegations, self-deception, hypocrisy and scapegoating, and suggest how they may be interrelated. It is proposed that these responses may be seen as important means whereby individuals make sense of events and present their actions to others. The argument is developed and deployed with reference to the British `Arms to Iraq Affair', which was the subject of detailed scrutiny through an extensive public inquiry. The principal research contribution of our article is to problematize the issue of belief/act discrepancy in a way which invites the juxtaposition of sensemaking and impression management concepts.

Title: Managers' Business School Education and Military Service: Possible Links to Corporate Criminal Activity

Abstract: This study examined the moderating influence of two top management team (TMT) characteristics, namely managers possessing an MBA education or prior military experience, on the relationships between firm size and corporate criminal activity, and firm strategy and corporate criminal activity. The study utilized data from 184 Fortune 500 companies. The results suggest that both graduate business education and prior military service among members of a firm's TMT strengthen the relationship between firm size and corporate criminal activity. Further, the results provide no support for the moderating influence of managers' graduate business education or prior military experience on the relationships between firm strategy and corporate criminal activity.

Title: Professionals: Back to the Future?
Author-Name: Louise Fitzgerald
Author-Name: Ewan Ferlie
Abstract: This article examines empirical evidence on the impact of the introduction of a quasi-market in healthcare in the UK on professionals, especially doctors. Data are drawn from two longitudinal studies occurring between 1990 and 1994, of aspects of the changes to the health system. Data collection involved a range of methods, including observation, interviews, questionnaires and archival material. The findings show that a unilateral analysis of the impact of the quasimarket on professionals is inadequate to understand the situation. The responses of the professionals to change have had a major influence on the outcomes. Professionals have not uniformly lost power, some have gained considerably. Explanations of the variance of impact and the substantial power shifts have to take account of a range of contextual factors. The market has not had a major impact on the technical autonomy of the doctors. Consequential structural changes have produced a new category of professional managers who are actively managin...

Abstract: This article introduces work/family border theory - a new theory about work/family balance. According to the theory, people are daily border-crossers between the domains of work and family. The theory addresses how domain integration and segmentation, border creation and management, border-crosser participation, and relationships between border-crossers and others at work and home influence work/family balance. Propositions are given to guide future research.

Title: Ambiguity, Complexity and Dynamics in the Membership of Collaboration
Author-Name: Chris Huxham
Author-Name: Siv Vangen
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the role that membership structures of inter-organizational collaborations have on the achievement of collaborative advantage in the context of tackling social issues. Based on action research involving participants in a wide variety of collaborative situations, the paper aims to explore the nature of the membership of collaborations in practice. A picture of membership is built up from two perspectives. The first considers the structure of collaboration, and argues that ambiguity and complexity in structure may be demonstrated over many dimensions. The second adds another layer of complication through exploring the dynamics of the way in which membership structures change over time. The paper concludes by examining the implications for practitioners and policy makers of this picture in terms of its effect on the design of collaborations and on the factors which tend to lead to colloborative inertia instead of collaborative advantage.

Title: The Relationship between Job and Life Satisfaction: Evidence from a Remote Mining Community
Author-Name: Roderick D. Iverson
Author-Name: Catherine Maguire
Abstract: Although the relationship between job and life satisfaction has attracted much attention, little research has been undertaken in geographically remote settings. The present study addresses this deficiency by testing a causal model that incorporates job-related, personal, environmental, and community-related variables. The LISREL results, based on a sample of 286 male employees from an open-cut coal mine in remote central Queensland, Australia, indicate that the community variables of family isolation and kinship support have the largest total (direct and indirect) effects on life satisfaction. Job satisfaction is found to be the next most important factor, and mediates the impact of routinization, industrial relations (IR) climate, promotional opportunity, work overload, family isolation, kinship support, positive affectivity, community participation, and negative affectivity on life satisfaction. In addition, job satisfaction is observed to have a stronger effect on life satisfaction than vice versa. The...

Abstract: This paper reports a case study that analyzes changes in organizational boundary activities carried out in a bank during and after restructuring from a functional to a team-based structure. Results suggest that the need for spanning, buffering, and bringing up boundaries does not disappear as organizations become `boundaryless'. Rather, boundary activities increase in significance and migrate to lower organizational levels. Several propositions are generated for future research.

Title: Employee Demography, Organizational Commitment, and Turnover Intentions in China: Do Cultural Differences Matter?

Abstract: This study investigates the main effect of demographic variables on organizational commitment (OC) and the moderating effect of gender and education on the relationship between OC and turnover intentions (TI) based on a survey of 333 employees in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Only position positively influenced employees' OC while other demographic variables had no main effects on OC. Gender was found to moderate the relationship between OC and TI but education did not. The results demonstrated that, under the influence of traditional Chinese culture, Chinese employees behave differently from their western counterparts. These differences were explained in terms of cultural variables, particularly, personalism and guanxi (personal relationship network).

Title: The Emergence of a Surrealist Movement and its Vital `Estrangement-Effect' in Organization Studies
Author-Name: Adrian N. Carr
Author-Name: Lisa A. Zanetti
Abstract: Beginning as a subversive and anti-establishment movement in France in the 1920s, surrealism was primarily a movement whose `voice' came through the written word. Later the movement extended into the visual arts, with which it is more generally associated. Surrealism was always intended as a way of thinking, a way of feeling and, indeed, a philosophy of life. This way of thinking now appears to have permeated the discourse of organization theory in both the orientation and `techniques' that are advocated by a group of writers who claim, or invoke, the insights of postmodernists (/poststructuralists). Drawing on recently published work by the critical theorists Adorno, Benjamin and Marcuse, we argue that the field needs to consider carefully `its' response to oil `surrealist movements'. We argue that the surrealist movement is an essential part of a healthy ongoing dialectic for the field and needs to be recognized in exactly that context.

Abstract: The current study explored the extent to which college graduates with and without physical disabilities reported experiencing discrimination in their overall work histories. Resufts suggested that respondents with disabilities reported experiencing significantly more access discrimination than respondents without disabilities and that the specific type of physical disability influenced the extent of access discrimination experienced. There were no significant differences in the extent of treatment discrimination experienced by individuals with and without disabilities. The current study also explored the level of job satisfaction reported by currently employed respondents with and without physical disabilities. Results indicated that access discrimination significantly reduced current job satisfaction, and, when it was statistically controlled, individuals with disabilities reported marginally higher levels of job satisfaction than individuals without physical disabilities. These and other resufts are pre...

Title: A Dialogical Approach to Skill and Skilled Activity
Author-Name: David Holman
Abstract: The focus of this paper is on the nature of the linguistically based skills that are generally thought to be significant at an intra-personal, interpersonal and organizational level of analysis (e.g. communication, teamwork, decision making, critical thinking). The aim is to develop a dialogical account of skill and skilled activity by drawing on ethnomethodology, activity theory and social constructionism. The paper starts by outlining mainstream cognitive and social psychological accounts of skill and skilled activity, and discussing the main problems associated with these accounts. Following this, the dialogical approach is described and put forward as an alternative to mainstream accounts. In the dialogical approach, there is a particular emphasis on the narrative and non-narrative aspects of skill and skilled activity. Implications for organizational practice and teaching practice are then drawn, and these are followed by concluding comments on possible future avenues of research.

Relying on research in social cognition andbusiness ethics, we hypothesized that moral awareness is influenced byissue-related factors (magnitude of consequences of the moral issueand issue framing in moral terms) and social contextrelated factors(competitive context and perceived social consensus that the issue isethically problematic). The hypotheses were tested in a fieldexperiment involving 291competitive intelligence practitioners.Results generally supported the hypotheses. Qualitative analysisyielded additional insights into the content of respondents' moralawareness.

Title: Emotions and Leadership: The Role of Emotional Intelligence
Author-Name: Jennifer M. George
Abstract: This paper suggests that feelings (moods and emotions) play a central role in the leadership process. More specifically, it is proposed that emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage moods and emotions in the self and others, contributes to effective leadership in organizations. Four major aspects of emotional intelligence, the appraisal and expression of emotion, the use of emotion to enhance cognitive processes and decision making, knowledge about emotions, and management of emotions, are described. Then, I propose how emotional intelligence contributes to effective leadership by focusing on five essential elements of leader effectiveness: development of collective goals and objectives; instilling in others an appreciation of the importance of work activities; generating and maintaining enthusiasm, confidence, optimism, cooperation, and trust; encouraging flexibility in decision making and change; and establishing and maintaining a meaningful identity for an organization.

Title: Where Learning is: Metaphors and Situated Learning in a Planning Group
Author-Name: Silvia Gberardi
Abstract: Organizational learning is a root metaphor which sets organizational processes in relation to knowledge and knowing. An action-learning intervention in a municipality provides the stage for observing several metaphors at work in advancing learning within the planning group. The aim of the paper is to explore the role of language in producing and expressing situated knowledge and to further the interpretation of metaphors as organizational artifacts instead of linguistic or mental materials. The understanding of metaphors is always a creative endeavour, and metaphors can be both facilitators of learning and the tangible manifestation of something learnt. Understanding metaphors as the dreamwork of language collapses the traditional distinction among metaphors either as heuristic or generative.

Abstract: This paper takes lived experience of students who feel they have been sexually harassed to show how sexual harassment is similarly experienced and construed, then how this subjectivity contributes to fear of action to stop the harassment. The stories also demonstrate that, even if action is taken to stop the harassment, the consequences can still be negative and fear inducing. The paper also aims to challenge theories of sexual harassment, arguing that much theory does not adequately explain the complex dynamics of the phenomenon.

Title: Varieties of Discourse: On the Study of Organizations through Discourse Analysis
Author-Name: Mats Alvesson
Author-Name: Dan Karreman
Abstract: Discourse is a popular term used in a variety of ways, easily leading to confusion. This article attempts to clarify the various meanings of discourse in social studies, the term's relevance for organizational analysis and some key theoretical positions in discourse analysis. It also focuses on the methodological problem of the relationship between: a) the level of discourse produced in interviews and in everyday life observed as `social texts' (in particular talk); b) other kinds of phenomena, such as meanings, experiences, orientations, events, material objects and social practices; and, c) discourses in the sense of a large-scale, ordered, integrated way of reasoning/ constituting the social world. In particular, the relationship between `micro and meso-level' discourse analysis (i.e. specific social texts being the primary empirical material) and `grand and mega-level' discourse (i.e. large-scale orders) is investigated.

Title: In the Name of the Client: The Service Ethic in Two Professional Services Firms

Author-Name: Keith Robson
Abstract: In this article we explore how notions of the client and client service are constructed within two `Big 5' professional services firms. Drawing upon a range of qualitative materials, we argue that the client is a central term in the socialization of trainee accountants within these firms and the emergence of their professional identities. We illustrate this with reference to recruitment, appraisal and daily work practices. We then move on to consider the power effects of a discourse that privileges the client in this way by attending to what is `written out' of such a discourse. We suggest that management control, friends, family and the profit motive are all written out. However, we also point to what such a discourse enables, both materially and symbolically, for the trainees in the study.

Abstract: One community's resistance to the projected siting of a hazardous waste facility provides a case study of clashing discourse between modernity's champions and its sceptics. The events and outcomes of this case raise questions about the widespread assumption that science, reason and rationality are necessarily the bases for good decisions in society. This study highlights the contemporary citizen, deeply sceptical of the rational state and modern business practice, and fearful that personal and communal identity will be threatened by forces over which local residents have no control. In this case, site developers and community members engaged in numerous rhetorical exchanges. The developers conducted their side of the discourse according to the tenets of reason and rationality. The community, however, imposed emotional interpretations on the situation, thus radically undermining the possibilities of communicative rationality and challenging the tacit `rules' of modern discourse. The public debate between t...

Title: Discourse as a Strategic Resource
Author-Name: Cynthia Hardy
Author-Name: Ian Palmer
Author-Name: Nelson Phillips
Abstract: In this article, we outline a model of how discourse can be mobilized as a strategic resource. The model consists of three circuits. First, in circuits of activity, individuals attempt to introduce new discursive statements, through the use of symbols, narratives, metaphors, etc. aimed at evoking concepts to create particular objects. These activities must intersect with circuits of performativity. This occurs when, for example, concepts are contextually embedded and have meaning for other actors; when symbols, narratives and metaphors possess receptivity; and when the subject position of the enunciator warrants voice. Third, when these two circuits intersect, connectivity occurs as the new discursive statements `take'. Using an illustrative example of an international NGO operating in Palestine, we show how an individual brought about strategic change by engaging in discursive activity.

Abstract: Many organizations are concerned about the potential for workplace aggression and violence, yet pay little heed to lesser forms of interpersonal and organizational mistreatment. Drawing from knowledge and experiences of managers, attorneys, law enforcement officers and emergency medical professionals, we report a multi-method, multidisciplinary inductive study addressing two questions: (1) what is the nature of workplace incivility and how does incivility differ from and fit among other types of workplace mistreatment; and (2) what are some implications of incivility for employees and organizations?

Author-Name: Charles E. Harvey
Abstract: This article considers data from a hospital that was introducing an experimental new facility onto an existing site, including the process of institutionalization of the argument ‘The new facility requires radically new working practices.’ The data are used to test a proposed integration of Barley and Tolbert’s (1997) model of the psychological mechanisms involved in institutionalization with a political model of how motives vary during the stages of organizational change. There is some empirical support for a congruence between the two models, namely, that psychological encoding matches with political recognition, psychological enactment matches with political transition, and psychological replication and externalization match with political consolidation.

Title: Sense of Entitlement to Support for the Reconciliation of Employment and Family Life
Author-Name: Suzan Lewis
Author-Name: Janet Smithson
Abstract: This article explores young European women and men’s expectations of support - from the state and employers - for reconciling paid employment and family life. It is based on a qualitative study employing focus groups with young women and men in Norway, Sweden, Portugal, Ireland and the UK. Drawing on the concept of sense of entitlement, derived from social justice theory, it was expected that the type of welfare state and ‘gender contract’ that young adults have experienced will influence their sense of entitlement to support for work and family life. Findings indicate that participants perceived their entitlement to state and employer support differently across national context. However this is moderated by gender, parental and occupational status, and particularly by awareness of provisions in other countries in the case of state support, while perceived entitlement to employer support varies according to the specific policy considered, gender and perception of benefits to employers. Some implications f...

Title: Reactions to Organizational Politics: A Cross-Cultural Examination in Israel and Britain
Author-Name: Eran Vigoda
Abstract: This article reports a comparative analysis of reactions to organizational politics (OP) in two substantially different cultures, Israel and Britain. Two resembling samples of public personnel (n1 = 303 and n2 = 149 in Israel and Britain, respectively) were used to examine employees’ perceptions of organizational politics as well as several possible work outcomes (e.g. intentions of exit, voice, loyalty, neglect, job satisfaction, met expectations, and absenteeism). No differences were found between employees’ levels of politics perception in the two samples. However, a between-sample analysis supported the hypotheses of differences in reactions to OP across cultures. Generally, perceptions of organizational politics affected British employees more strongly than Israeli. The former responded with higher intentions of exit and neglect and lower levels of loyalty, job satisfaction, and met expectations. From these results, our main speculation is that reactions to OP may depend on cultural variants relevant...

Title: Workplace Romances between Senior- Level Executives and Lower-Level Employees: An Issue of Work Disruption and Gender
Author-Name: Gary N. Powell
Abstract: This study examined co-workers’ reactions to a hierarchical workplace romance between an older, married senior-level executive and a younger, single lower-level employee. Part-time MBA students, nearly all of whom were employed full time, responded to a randomly assigned vignette in which they were asked to assume the role of co-worker of the two romantic partners. The effect of the workplace romance on participants’ productivity and the gender of the two participants were manipulated in vignettes, resulting in a 2 × 2 between-subjects experimental design. Consistent with gender stereotypes about hierarchical workplace romances, respondents were more likely to attribute a job motive to a female lower-level employee than to a male lower-level employee. In turn, consistent with a work-disruption perspective, respondents regarded the relationship as representing a more serious problem for the organization when they believed that the lower-level participant was motivated by job concerns. Further, when respond...

Title: Trust and Control in Anglo-American Systems of Corporate Governance: The Individualizing and Socializing Effects of Processes of Accountability
Author-Name: John Roberts
Abstract: This article reformulates the problem of corporate governance through a shift of analytic focus, away from the problems of securing the interests of remote owners, to an understanding of processes of accountability and their effects, both objective and subjective, within Anglo-American systems of corporate governance. In place of the essentialist assumptions about human nature upon which both agency theorists and their organizational critics build, processes of accountability are instead held to be themselves constitutive of subjectivity. A distinction is drawn between different processes and practices of accountability in terms of either their ‘individualizing’ or ‘socializing’ effects. Individualizing effects, which are associated with the operation of market mechanisms and formal hierarchical accountability, involve the production and reproduction of a sense of self as singular and solitary within only an external and instrumental relationship to others. In contrast, socializing forms of accountability...

Title: Achieving Acculturation in Mergers and Acquisitions: An International Case Survey

Abstract: Various explanations have been suggested concerning the causes of ‘cultural clashes’ and prescriptions for harmoniously integrating the beliefs and values of merging firms. Using a form of meta-analysis known as a case survey design, which combines the ideographic richness of case studies with the statistical generalizability of larger samples, and a sample consisting of 50 mergers and acquisitions (23 US domestic, 15 Swedish domestic and 12 Swedish cross-border), we found that acculturation is best achieved when the buying firms rely on social controls. That is, by participating in such activities as introduction programs, training, cross-visits, retreats, celebrations and similar socialization rituals, employees will create, of their own volition, a joint organizational culture regardless of expectations of synergies, the relative organization size and differences in nationalities and cultures. A post hoc analysis of a proposed integration control typology further suggests that social controls also indi...

The article documents a base of research on which to build, reveals important gaps in our knowledge and provides suggestions for future work that can lead to an integration of community into work and family research.

Title: The Drama of Dysfunction: Value Conflict in US Managed Care
Author-Name: Diana D. Mrotek
Abstract: The transformation of the American health care environment from retrospective fee-for-service to managed care has been both rapid and chaotic. This period of change has been infected by value conflict, evoking unconscious processes in system participants as they have attempted to cope with personally threatening situations. This article attempts to elucidate this process by presenting an account of events and accompanying value conflict as it occurred over time. It also includes a systems analysis of the rapidly changing mosaic of unconscious processes that resulted from the divergent values held by the public and health care professionals, using various organization behavior theories. Examples of the types of theory used are Jungian archetypes, scapegoating and mutual negative stereotyping, the Karpman Drama Triangle, and Wells' `group-as-mother' analogue.

Abstract: The effects of applicant race and applicant quality on recall errors and on decision making in the employment interview were examined. Eighty-eight white undergraduates in the mid-Western United States reviewed paper credentials and then interviewed a high or low quality black or white applicant in a controlled experimental setting. Results showed that, although the interviewers hired the black and white applicants in equal proportion, one week later they recalled the answers to the interview questions given by the black applicants as having been significantly less intelligent then those of whites - when in fact the actual interview content in the two race conditions was identical. Presumably, the participants of this study had negative schemas towards blacks that they were able to suppress when making hiring decisions, but that were revealed when unobtrusive measures were used.

Title: Organizational Technologies and Human Resource Management
Author-Name: Chester S. Spell
Abstract: This article develops a model that integrates organizational level technology research with human resource management strategies. The model relates dimensions of technical processes to human resource practices, focusing on practices used to develop employees. These relationships are mediated by the type of skills employees use. An empirical study of 139 employees found support for two hypotheses developed from the model. Results suggested that technology and HRM activities are connected through the level of cognitive skill complexity and the amount of support employees receive in developing new skills. Due to changes in the way decisions are made in organizations today (for example, making more decisions at lower levels) the connection between the work process, the skills employees need, and the emphasis on developing employees will become increasingly important.

Title: Cooperation and Resistance in Work Innovation Networks

Abstract: This study deals with the process of introducing total quality programmes in two metallurgical industry firms in which managers, unions representatives and workers actively participated through a network in which alliances were made by translating the interests of each party. The emergence of this network is put into context by considering workers' gains and losses. Based on the actor-network theory of innovation, the article describes the intentional creation and diffusion of innovation through cooperation and the resistance that took shape among certain groups of workers in each plant. The workers opposed to the network must have a high degree of autonomy in relation to the joint strategy of regulating the innovation process so that they can impose their conditions for integration into the network There is a strong association between the role of the trade union in the innovation process and the achievement of cooperation at the shopfloor level, but resistance gives way to another intermediary figure - ...

Title: The Interim Manager: Prototype of the 21 st-Century Worker?
Author-Name: Kerr Inkson

Author-Name: Denise M. Rousseau
Abstract: As organizations restructure to increase flexibility, interim management by contractors is increasing as an alternative to employment of `permanent' managers. Interim managers begin their new role on the basis of transactional psychological contracts with their employer Their careers are based on a logic of accumulation of learning across organizations. However, there are also forces that may over time cause the redefinition of the psychological contract, employment relationship and career orientation. Based on an interview survey of 50 interim managers, various metaphors are proposed to assist understanding. Interim managers may be considered, for example, as displaced persons, customers at a dating agency, or hired guns. A number of metaphors are employed to extend understanding of their developing employment relationships and careers. The implications of the findings are examined in relation to predictions concerning 21st-century forms of employment, organization and career.

Title: Employer Control of Employees: Extending the Lincoln-Kalleberg Corporatist Model of Satisfaction and Attachment
Author-Name: Munyae M. Mulinge
Abstract: Data from Kenya are utilized to revisit the Lincoln-Kalleberg corporatist control argument with a view to extending it to incorporate a fourth category - stress-reducing structures - of structural determinants of satisfaction and attachment. The results show strong support for the extended model and are consistent with Mueller et al. (1994) and Wallace's (I1995) position that the Lincoln-Kalleberg model is a general one that explains satisfaction and attachment even in non-corporatist work settings. It is concluded that the importance of work structures as determinants of satisfaction and attachment may differ across work settings but they are the basis of any initial model for explaining the same.

Abstract: Snell in his article in this issue has argued that the moral basis of the learning organization is comprehensively and systematically at odds with the moral foundations of the conventional organization. In this article, this critique of the learning organization is taken a step further It is argued that, as defined by its proponents, the learning organization is limited by conventional organizational structures and hierarchy, by organizational cultures that frequently encourage anti-learning values and routines, and by shared structures of organizational cognition. It is argued that the learning organization also over-looks the extent to which standards of rationality within organizations arise from dominant external discourses of government and organization.

Title: Family Dynamics in a Small Consultancy Firm: A Case Study
Author-Name: Monder Ram
Abstract: Family-run enterprises are noted contributors to the small business population, particularly in terms of job creation and wealth generation. Moreover, it is well established that the presence of the family can be an important influence upon social relations in small firms. This paper examines whether family dynamics impinge upon the management of small consultancy firms, a sector that is closely associated with a discourse of' knowledge', `expertise', and `competence'. Based on a year-long case study of Whit Co, a husband and wife-owned small consultancy business, three questions are investigated. What is the nature of the family role in the consultancy business? How do employees in such settings view the family? What tactics do these usually credentialized workers deploy to handle family relations? The findings demonstrate that household relations rather than the activity of an `entrepreneurial individual' are important in understanding the operation of the small business; moreover, there is a tendency t...

Using a framework that integrates both the cognitive and affective components of individual sensemaking and interpretation, we develop a process model that systematically analyses the psychology of the individual change process, and, in particular, the sources of resistance to change or inertia. A series of steps in the change process are identified if second-order change is to come about, and a series of testable propositions about the forces that may facilitate or stymie change are developed.

Title: Can Blaming Victims of Rape be Logical? Attribution Theory and Discourse Analytic Perspectives
Author-Name: Irina Anderson
Author-Name: Geoffrey Beattie
Author-Name: Christopher Spencer
Abstract: While it is frequently assumed that blaming the victims rather than the perpetrators of rape is the result of biases in causal reasoning, one rape perception study (Calhoun et al., 1976) suggests that blame attributions directed at the victim can occur as a result of logical attributional processes through the systematic and rational application of the covariational rules of inductive reasoning. The aim of the present study was to investigate this assertion. The study is unique in two ways. First, participants were asked to discuss a rape incident rather than evaluate it using questionnaire methods. Second, the study focused on the rape of males as well as the rape of females. Two analyses were performed on the conversational data - a content analysis yielding quantitative data and a qualitative discourse analysis. The main findings were that, contrary to predictions, participants did not use the covariation information to blame the victim of rape `logically'. Instead, the most frequently utilized categor...

Title: The Paradox of Autonomy: A Case of Academic Research Scientists
Author-Name: Rose Trevelyan
Abstract: This paper considers the paradoxical effects of an autonomous leadership style. The well-documented empowering effect of autonomy on work attitudes is shown to be counterbalanced by the negative effects of isolation and a deprivation of valued inputs when a leader is uninvolved. The paradox of autonomy lies in these dual positive and negative influences. The diverse effects of autonomy are explained by the dynamic processes by which autonomy is granted to group members, using an interactionist perspective. The core dimensions of the autonomy process are direction and involvement. The interactions between leader and group member along these dimensions influence satisfaction differently, and motivation very little. It is suggested that there are substitutes for leadership that more directly affect motivation. Data were collected from an academic scientific research institute, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, from which these propositions emerged.

Abstract: In this article, we draw on actor-network theory (ANT) to reflexively investigate the role of the researcher and the research community in the production of a research subject. We review our earlier work, which explores how the dynamics of refugee systems help to produce the research subject - in this case, the refugee. We then use ideas from ANT to move beyond the more conventional institutional and discursive analyses that are used in these articles. We include not just the activities of actors in the refugee system in our analysis, but also our own activities as researchers, as well as those of the broader research community We use the concept of translation to explore the role of these actors in the processes of social construction that produce refugees as a subject of academic study, which is related to, but distinct from, the `social' subject produced in the social setting under study. Generalizing from our own research experience, we argue for a reconceptualization of reflexivity in organization an...

Specifically, ideology was associated with support for AA, but only among individuals who had not experienced discrimination. Among these individuals, egalitarians, who view fairness in terms of group equality, were more supportive of AA than were individualists, who view fairness from the perspective of the individual. Conversely, among individuals who had experienced discrimination, ideology was not related to attitude toward AA: support was high and approximately equal regardless of ideology. Findings were interpreted in terms of Referent Cognitions Theory (Folger, 1986).

Title: The Anarchist within: Clinical Reflections on Russian Character and Leadership Style
Author-Name: Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries
Abstract: This article highlights a number of salient aspects of the culture and character of Russia (now the Russian Federation) in order to facilitate an informed understanding of the way Russians deal with organizations and approach leadership style. When appropriate, the clinical paradigm is applied, dimensions derived from cultural constructs are utilized, and examples are given of the author's fieldwork in Russian organizations. The article starts by examining how a number of contextual factors contribute to stoicism as a typical Russian character trait and make for a collectivist outlook. The implications of Russian child-rearing and educational practices are then discussed and the article analyses the development of a `false self' - a public self that is split from the true private self - particularly during the Soviet era. Other themes explored include emotional expressiveness, a particularistic outlook toward other people, Oblomovism and oscillation between order and disorder The destructive bureaucracy i...

Title: Age Stereotypes and Discriminatory Attitudes towards Older Workers: An East-West Comparison

Author-Name: Ed Snape
Author-Name: Tom Redman
Abstract: This study compared age stereotypes among 567 respondents sampled in the UK and Hong Kong and examined how these stereotypes were related to discriminatory attitudes at work. Compared to the Hong Kong sample, UK respondents saw older workers as more effective at work, but less adaptable to change. As expected, respondents' own age was predictive of positive age stereotypes, although for supervisors this relationship was moderated in the case of perceptions of work effectiveness. Stereotypical beliefs were found to significantly affect respondents' attitudes towards the training, promotion and retention of older workers, their willingness to work with older workers, and their support for positive discrimination. Findings also suggest that anti-age discrimination policies in the respondent's organization had a positive impact on beliefs about the adaptability of older workers and possibly also on attitudes towards providing them with training. Implications of the findings were discussed in light of the exis...

Title: Teacher Stress and the Management of Accountability
Author-Name: Alexa Hepburn
Author-Name: Steven D. Brown
Abstract: In this article we explore how teachers can draw upon the language of stress to perform strategically important and often politically sensitive social acts. Our aim will be to show that the description of teaching problems as a matter of ‘stress’ has important social and political implications for teachers. To do this we draw upon interviews with Scottish secondary school teachers; these interviews have been subjected to close textual analysis, informed by some of the basic principles of discursive psychology. The analysis shows teachers flexibly employing stress as a way of managing their own accountability, and of making sense of their institutional roles and relationships. To conclude, we suggest that employing stress as an individualized category not only suppresses its flexibility, but also encourages both teachers and their employers to offer token measures to manage it at a psychological level, rather than engaging in proper debate about the state of the profession.

Title: Stress and Strain Crossover
Author-Name: Mina Westman
Abstract: Studies investigating the crossover of job stress and strain between partners have shown that job demands are transmitted from job incumbents to their partners, affecting their psychological and physical health. Based on the crossover literature and on models of job stress and the work-family interface, this study develops a comprehensive framework to integrate the literature conceptually, delineating the mechanisms that underlie the crossover process. Key constructs include job stress, life events, strain, personal attributes and interpersonal factors. The literature pertaining to each construct in the model is reviewed and summarized. Gaps in the literature are identified, recommendations for future research are proposed, and the implications for organizational theory and practice are discussed.

Title: Magic, Meaning and Leadership: Weber’s Model and the Empirical Literature
Author-Name: Harold B. Jones
Abstract: Weber’s (1946) model of charismatic leadership offers a framework within which more recent theories and findings can be shown to have a place. The process he described begins as a challenge to an existing status quo and paves the way for another. The charismatic leader elicits a willing response from followers, who begin in the faith that they are pursuing purposes greater than their own but lay the foundations of a new status quo when they seek to legitimate their positions of power. Empirical theories and findings elucidate the stages of this process. The initial status quo, leader dependence upon the support of followers, attributions of charisma and the importance of follower feelings have been described under the headings of substitutes for leadership, leader traits and behavior, implicit leadership and transformational leadership. Leader-member exchange (LMX) and strategic contingencies theory describes the appearance of an administrative staff and tendencies toward a new status quo. Descriptions of...

Title: Asserting Property Rights: Knowledge Codification in the Professional Service Firm
Author-Name: Timothy Morris
Abstract: Despite the frequent assertion that knowledge management is an important strategic activity, there have been relatively few empirical studies of the processes involved in this, particularly in knowledge intensive firms. The paradox inherent to codification projects is that they are dependent on professional staff willingly transferring the knowledge that often underpins their status. My purpose in this article is to examine whether and how this paradox is resolved by presenting a case study of a knowledge codification project under- taken by a professional service firm (PSF). I argue that the successful assertion of property rights relates, ironically, to its limitation. Codification takes place in a way that does not nullify the consultants’ expert role in front of the client. That there appear to be limits to how far such a reductive exercise can capture the activities of the consultants has implications for grammatical models that aim to describe and theorize about organizational processes or sequences...

Title: Fear of Exploitation and Fear of Contamination: Impediments to Knowledge Transfer in Mergers between Professional Service Firms
Author-Name: Laura Empson
Abstract: Previous studies of knowledge transfer have identified a variety of impediments that derive from the knowledge base and the organizational context. However such explanations do not take account of the central role that individuals play in the knowledge transfer process, specifically in articulating and legitimizing the knowledge base and in shaping and interpreting the organizational context. This article examines the merger process as experienced within six accounting and consulting firms. It finds that professionals resist knowledge transfer when they perceive that the merging firms differ fundamentally in terms of the quality of their external image and the form of their knowledge base. Whilst professionals may attribute their resistance to commercial and objective concerns, their responses are also governed by highly personal and subjective factors. This study identifies this complex combination of factors as the twin fears of exploitation and contamination.

Title: Knowledge Work: Ambiguity, Image and Identity
Author-Name: Mats Alvesson
Abstract: This article takes a sceptical view of the functionalist understanding of the nature and significance of ‘knowledge’ in so-called knowledge- intensive companies. The article emphasizes the slipperiness of the concept of knowledge, the ambiguity of knowledge, its role in what is constructed as knowledge work and the evaluation of work outcomes. Given this ambiguity, the management of rhetoric, image and social processes appears crucial in organizations of this kind. Difficulties in demonstrating competence and performance - as well as the significance of producing the right impression - make work identity difficult to secure. However, this is a key element in doing knowledge work. Successful rhetoric, image production and orchestration of social interactions call for the regulation of employee identities.

Abstract: Theories about trading in financial markets are well developed and practically influential. However, traders’ behaviour within these markets appears to deviate substantially from that predicted by theory. Using data from a study of traders within financial markets in London, this article seeks to document this apparent paradox and assess its implications. General theories about how the financial world works are distinct from, but compatible with, more instrumental behavioural rules about how to work in the financial world. The latter may be seen as internally consistent recipes for action which require concurrent belief in both the validity of the general theories - for example about the relationship between risk and return - and in the ability of individual agency to secure outcomes which, in terms of the general theory, have low probability.

Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive framework for the analysis of value creation and knowledge development in general and, in particular, for professional service firms (PSFs). The framework integrates the relationship between the domain choice and the resource (or knowledge) base, and argues that the bridge between the two is best explained as value creation processes (VCPs) with two interrelated dimensions: direct value creation for the clients, and indirect value creation in terms of enhancing the knowledge base.

Title: Colonizing Knowledge: Commodification as a Dynamic of Jurisdictional Expansion in Professional Service Firms
Author-Name: Roy Suddaby
Author-Name: Royston Greenwood
Abstract: This paper provides a field level analysis of the process by which management knowledge is produced. Two linked dynamics are identified as important components of this process. The first is the commodification of management knowledge, or the tendency to reduce knowledge to a routinized and codified product. We argue that the commodification of management knowledge is a cyclical process that has been institutionalized by the interests of distinct categories of social actors. The second dynamic, termed colonization, refers to the migration of Big Five professional service firms into adjacent professional jurisdictions. Colonization is the result of intensification of commodification and has produced intense conflict and change in the organizational field of management knowledge production.

Title: Reflections on Knowledge and Knowledgeintensive Firms
Author-Name: Lex Donaldson
Abstract: Knowledge in organizations and, more particularly, in knowledgeintensive firms is an important topic. However, some contemporary approaches tend to over-use the concept of tacit knowledge leading to mystification and magification. Knowledge creation, storage and transmission in organizations may be rationalized and foster bureaucratization, consonant with the Weberian tendency towards formal rationality. The ideationalist nature of certain theorizing may lead to unrealistic accounts of knowledge in organizations. Antithetic positivist theory can offer illumination on some aspects of organizations and so analysts should not confine themselves to ideationalist theories. Arguments for the importance of knowledge in organizations can become enmeshed in claims that society is post-capitalist, which are best avoided. Future researchers would do better to follow the lead of the articles in this special edition and analyse knowledge in organizations in a careful empirical and skeptical fashion.

Title: Complex Thinking, Complex Practice: The Case for a Narrative Approach to Organizational Complexity
Author-Name: Haridimos Tsoukas
Author-Name: Mary Jo Hatch
Abstract: Complexity is not only a feature of the systems we study, it is also a matter of the way in which we organize our thinking about those systems. This second-order complexity invites consideration of the modes of thinking we use to theorize about complexity, and in this article we develop the idea of second-order complexity using Jerome Bruner’s contrast between logico-scientific and narrative modes of thinking. Using Bruner’s framework, we examine and critique dominant forms of thinking about organizational complexity that are rooted in the logico-scientific mode, and suggest alternatives based in the narrative mode. Our evidence for the value of doing this comes from the logic of complexity theory itself, which we claim indicates and supports the use of the narrative mode. The potential contribution of the narrative approach to developing second-order thinking about organizational complexity is demonstrated by taking a narrative approach to the matter of recursiveness. By extension, similar insights are i...

Title: Job-Seeking in a Turbulent Economy: Social Networks and the Importance of Cross-Industry Ties to an Industry Change
Author-Name: Deborah Wright Brown
Author-Name: Alison M. Konrad
Abstract: This study extends previous research on the micro-level processes of job-seeking and demonstrates that job-seeking behaviors are affected by macro-level factors. Using a longitudinal research design, we monitored the job-seeking strategies of a diverse sample of recently unemployed labor market participants. Specifically, we examined the impact of shrinking or growing industry sectors on the use of personal contacts. Overall, results indicated that growth or decline in employment levels of the job-seeker’s pre-displaced industry subsequently affected the likelihood of using cross-industry contacts during a job search. In addition, the use of cross-industry contacts significantly increased the likelihood of making an industry change. Limitations of the study and practical implications for conducting a job search in a contemporary environment are also discussed.

Abstract: In this article, we argue that trust is a system-related concept and that it is a continuously evolving state of information gathering, processing, and feedback. Based on this argument, we demonstrate the usefulness of the conceptual framework of cybernetics to an understanding of the dynamics of developing and sustaining trust. We begin with some background information about the science of cybernetics and the basic principles relevant to this framework that enable a system to function effectively. We then use the principles of cybernetics to illustrate the dynamic nature of trust within the social system of a complex organization and externally between organizations in an environment. We summarize by relating our model to recent theoretical developments in the trust literature and by providing suggestions for future research using a cybernetic framework.

Abstract: This article tests a theoretically driven model of the relationship between work environment, specifically, management practices, and employee mental health, specifically depression. It draws on theoretical perspectives connecting work environment and stress, and on others linking stress and depression. It also examines sense of coherence as a possible mediator of the relationships among work environment, work stress, and depression. Results showed that perceived exposure to employee involvement management practices was related to perceived work stress, sense of coherence, and depression. A model was specified to assess potential causal relationships using LISREL. Results suggested that increased exposure to employee involvement practices was indirectly associated with lower levels of depression through both perceived work stress and sense of coherence. The implications of these findings for management practice are discussed.

Title: Intrapersonal Dilemmas
Author-Name: Daniel Read
Abstract: Intrapersonal dilemmas arise when people face choices between something that is good right now but bad for them in the long run (vice), and something that is not so good now but better in the long run (virtue). This article develops the idea that these dilemmas have many similarities to social dilemmas, in which options that are best for society are not best for the individual who gets to choose them. Intrapersonal dilemmas are like social dilemmas because: (i) hyperbolic discounting means that individuals are divisible into a society of selves with competing interests, with the currently active self wanting vice for him or herself, but virtue for future selves; and (ii) the effect of choosing vice is to impose a cost on future selves, analogous to the social concept of externality. Using concepts from game theory, I model intrapersonal dilemmas as sequential games, in which choices made by one self can influence the utility of later selves, but not that of earlier selves. The analysis is applied to two p...

Title: Beyond Structure: The Role of Social Accounts in Implementing Ideal Control
Author-Name: Anthony T. Cobb

Author-Name: George Watson
Abstract: In order to survive, the contemporary organization must quickly adapt to its ever-changing markets and environment. The methods of structural control associated with the bureaucratic organizational form impede such adaptation. As a result, organizations are supplanting structural control with newer means of control - the control of ideas. Drawing on and extending social accounts theory, the authors explore how social accounts are used as one method to help to gain control of ideas, lessening management’s dependence on bureaucratic structures. The article exemplifies the managerial use of social accounts by reviewing the text of a videotape used by one organization in its attempt to influence workers’ ideas about management, unions and their own interests in order to keep the organization union free. The authors conclude with a discussion of how managerial uses of social accounts can be resisted by workers.

Author-Name: Kwok Leung

Author-Name: Michael W. Morris
Abstract: The effects of justice and dispositional attribution on reactions to negative supervisory feedback were examined in two studies. Study 1 showed that criticism delivered with greater interpersonal fairness resulted in more favourable dispositional attributions about the supervisor, more acceptance of the feedback, and more favourable reactions towards the superior and the organization. The beneficial influence of just interpersonal treatment was general across various feedback contexts, although the magnitude varied. Study 2 clarified the causal ordering: just interpersonal treatment reduced negative dispositional attribution, which in turn increased feedback acceptance and improved attitudes towards the supervisor. Study 2 also distinguished the consequences of perceived fairness in the formal procedures applied to forming the feedback, as opposed to interpersonal treatment during its delivery.

Title: The Metamorphosis of Workplace Conflict
Author-Name: Bruce Fortado
Abstract: The indirect and informal ways subordinates use to ‘get even’ are explored based on a literature review and fieldwork. The multiple causal factors at work and the interactive nature of these scenarios make chaos theory applicable. The metaphor of ‘metamorphosis’ is used to describe how unresolved conflicts twist and change form over time. Five case examples from the USA are included as illustrations. The transformations conflicts undergo are categorized into four forms: namely, the restatement of an issue, pressure tactics, acts of retribution and compensatory acts. The tactics and meanings that are commonly associated with each category are described. Previously, conflicts have been framed narrowly in short-term, individualistic, rational and substantive terms. Much can be learned by viewing these situations in long-term, social, interactive, emotional and symbolic terms. Elements of subordinate subcultures often come into conflict with the dominant organization culture. These clashes produce unique and ...

Abstract: Over the past two decades there has been a shift in the career literature from the view of a career as being a linear progression of job responsibilities within an industry, to that of a ‘boundaryless’, competency-based exploration that evolves in unexpected ways. This article argues that core constructs from ‘new science’ (non-linearity, interdependence and emergence) can provide a useful theoretical foundation for understanding the current dynamics of career behavior. The article also discusses implications of these constructs for career development practice and its contexts.

Author-Name: Michaela Driver
Abstract: Based on Coopey’s critical review of the terms ‘Utopian sunshine’ and ‘Foucauldian gloom’ with regard to the learning organization (Coopey, 1998), this article explores the learning organization from two opposing perspectives. While researchers agree that the learning organization concept is an important one for organization science, two seemingly irreconcilable research communities are arguing about whether the learning organization is a dream or a nightmare for its members, particularly with regard to three critical dimensions: control, ideology and potentially painful employee experiences. The purpose of this article is to review and critically examine both the optimistic view of the learning organization as positive ideal and the more critical view of the learning organization as negative ideology. Based on this examination, the article aims to synthesize a new middle-ground perspective on the learning organization, referred to as the ‘fluorescent light’ view, incorporating elements from both optimist...

Title: From ‘I’ to ‘We’: The Role of Putdown Humor and Identity in the Development of a Temporary Group
Author-Name: Jenepher Lennox Terrion
Author-Name: Blake E. Ashforth
Abstract: Participant observation of a 6-week Executive Development Course suggests that humor provides a key mechanism for enacting a sense of community for group members. Specifically, the study examines the process through which putdown humor helps foster group identity and cohesion in a temporary group. Putdowns followed a pattern of development that signaled increasing trust and inclusion, and was regulated by implicit rules that incubated the emergent solidarity. The meaning of certain humorous episodes was equivocal, but the act of laughing together glossed over the equivocality so that the sense of community was reaffirmed. Further, social identity dynamics appeared to strongly affect perceptions of the appropriateness of humor.

Title: Transformational Leadership, Corporate Cultism and the Spirituality Paradigm: An Unholy Trinity in the Workplace?
Author-Name: Dennis Tourish
Author-Name: Ashly Pinnington
Abstract: Leadership is a perennially popular topic in the academic and practitioner literature on management. In particular, the past twenty years have witnessed an explosive growth of interest in what has been termed ‘transformational leadership’ (henceforth, TL). The theory is closely linked to the growth in what has been defined as corporate culturism - an emphasis on the importance of coherent cultures, as a means of securing competitive advantage. This article outlines the central components of TL theory, and subjects the concept to a critical analysis. In particular, similarities are identified between the components concerned and the characteristics of leadership practice in organizations generally defined as cults. This connection has been previously unremarked in the literature. These similarities are comprehensively reviewed. Trends towards what can be defined as corporate cultism in modern management practice are also discussed. We conclude that TL models are overly concerned with the achievement of cor...

Title: Why School Systems Resist Reform: A Psychoanalytic Perspective
Author-Name: Howell S. Baum
Abstract: School reformers have proposed various innovations to improve education, but school systems have adopted few proposals. Three perspectives offer different interpretations of this resistance. The rational perspective views educators as rejecting proposals because they are not based in solid knowledge. The social-political perspective holds that conflicting interests prevent consensus about directions for change and concerted action. A psychoanalytic perspective, introduced in this article, calls attention to the ways in which inadequacy of knowledge and conflicts of interest, compounded by the psychological structure of teaching, arouse anxiety for school system members and lead them to defend themselves by resisting outsiders, new ideas, and innovative practices. The article examines paranoid and obsessive-compulsive patterns in school systems’ thinking, culture, and structure. These patterns lead systems to avoid relations with other entities and to constrain their own members from acting. Reforming scho...

Title: Toward Diversity and Similarity Curves: Implications for Theory, Research and Practice
Author-Name: Joseph C. Ofori-Dankwa
Author-Name: Scott D. Julian
Abstract: Curvilinear models have been proposed to reflect the simultaneous consideration of both differences and similarities. We build on these models and propose a heuristic model of diversity and similarity curves based on supply and demand curves from economics. We use the curves to graphically show how changes in demographic differences (diversity) and value congruence (similarity) can affect the extent of competition/cooperation, which will subsequently affect the extent of creativity in an organization. We capture this graphically by flattening or steepening the slopes of the diversity and similarity curves. We conclude by discussing the advantages of using diversity and similarity curves and explore the implications for theory, research, and practice.

Abstract: This study presents an analysis of the benefits of two team structures - quality circles and self-managing work groups - for Australian work organizations utilizing the Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey for 1995. The analysis indicates that firms with team structures have higher labor productivity, a flatter management structure and reduced employee turnover. The presence of team structures in Australian firms indicates a decrease in industrial harmony. The findings were inconclusive regarding absenteeism and profitability.

Title: Multiparadigm Inquiry: Exploring Organizational Pluralism and Paradox
Author-Name: Marianne W. Lewis
Author-Name: Mihaela L. Kelemen
Abstract: Organization studies is a robust field, replete with diverse, often contentious perspectives that may enrich understandings of pluralism and paradox. Yet polarization of modern paradigms and ruptures between modern and postmodern stances may inhibit researchers from tapping this potential. In response, this article delves into a provocative alternative - multiparadigm inquiry. First, we juxtapose modern, postmodern and multiparadigm approaches to contrast their underlying assumptions. We then review three multiparadigm strategies, exploring their objectives, exemplars and limitations. Our conclusion addresses how multiparadigm inquiry fosters greater reflexivity, while posing considerable challenges.

Title: Nothing Serious? Candidates’ Use of Humour in Management Training
Author-Name: Irena Grugulis
Abstract: This article explores the use made of humour in three different private sector organizations. It draws on observations of managers working towards a management qualification and, from the jokes they exchange, it argues that studying humour may offer insights into sentiments not easily articulated in ‘serious’ conversation. Humour’s ambiguity enables contentious statements to be made without fear of recrimination. Equally, constructing jokes by juxtaposing two different frames of reference provides a glimpse of alternative (and shared) perceptions of ‘reality’. This sensitivity to complexity makes humour a particularly appropriate vehicle for conveying ambitions, subversions, triumphs and failures and this article considers some of the ‘serious’ messages underlying the jokes.

Title: Time and Innovation in Independent Technological Ventures

Abstract: This article explores the process of small-scale technological innovation through the concept of experienced and enacted time. By conducting a series of semi-structured, deep interviews with 10 entrepreneurial innovators around issues of time and their ventures, we were able to construct four higher order concepts: time as a force, time as a flow, time as relations and time as a personal, cognitive resource; as well as 12 subcategories depicting ways in which time and innovation are weaved together. The study concludes with a number of suggestions as to how previous research on innovation may be extended in the light of the present findings. Especially important in this respect is the call for a stronger emphasis in innovation research on intentionality, uncertainty creation, vision and social action as being significant denominators of this phenomenon.

Title: What Makes Whistle-Blowers Effective? Three Field Studies
Author-Name: Marcia P. Miceli
Author-Name: Janet P. Near
Abstract: Organization members face difficult choices when they encounter situations which they consider illegitimate, immoral, or unlawful, but lack corrective power. They can ‘blow the whistle’ to authorities, but often, their organizations do not change the objectionable practice. Circumstances under which whistle-blowers succeed in terminating perceived wrongdoing have not been studied, so this study tests portions of a preliminary model of effectiveness derived from power theories. Results from three field studies show that whistle-blowers perceive that wrongdoing is more likely to be terminated when: (i) it occurs less frequently, is relatively minor in impact, or has been occurring for a shorter period; and (ii) whistle-blowers have greater power - reflected in the legitimacy of their roles and the support of others. Implications for research and for would-be whistle-blowers, their organizations, and policy makers, are discussed.

Title: ‘Waiting for Dead Men’s Shoes’: Towards a Cultural Understanding of Management Innovation
Author-Name: Darren McCabe
Abstract: Managers are often represented as exercising power over others through different discourses such as strategy, total quality management and reengineering. This article seeks to add to our understanding of innovation by considering how managers are also constituted through power relations such that their subjectivity becomes embedded within a particular cultural context that in turn imbues the innovations they adopt. A case study of an insurance company is drawn upon so as to explore how managers may resist new discourses that seem to threaten established ways of thinking and acting. It is argued that innovations reflect and reproduce the past, while simultaneously reshaping it, in ways that are intended and unintended.

Title: The Corruption of Managerial Techniques by Organizations

Abstract: Public sector organizations are under pressure to adopt private sector tools to sustain legitimacy despite uncertainty about the compatibility of the techniques with this context. We explore the consequences of the misfit between the theories underlying two widely adopted managerial techniques (strategic planning and quality management) and the pluralistic power structure and values of public hospitals. We identify four scenarios of adaptation and use qualitative data to examine their empirical prevalence. We suggest that when the compatibility gap is large, there is greater likelihood that formalized techniques will be captured by and integrated into existing organizational dynamics (corruption of the technique) than that the technique will change these dynamics in a way consistent with its objectives (transformation of the organization). We examine the implications of our observations for understanding the role of managerial techniques in organizational change.

Title: Failure as a Consequence of Partner Politics: Learning from the Life and Death of an International Cooperative Venture
Author-Name: Oded Shenkar
Author-Name: Aimin Yan
Abstract: While it is widely recognized that international cooperative ventures suffer a high rate of failure, current theories, namely transaction costs, partner selection, bargaining and learning, offer limited and disjointed reasoning for it. Each of these theories is focused on a single aspect and on a limited phase in the venture’s life, neglecting the process that leads to eventual termination. To study this process, an in-depth analysis of the demise of an international cooperative venture in China traces the critical events in the venture’s life cycle. The analysis shows that escalation of partner political behavior played a key role in the venture’s failure. An integrative political process model incorporating the dynamic aspects of the relationships between parents within their environmental context is developed.

Abstract: This article examines the relationship between demographic variables (age, sex, education), knowledge of, and attitudes towards, savings, pensions and life assurance in a sample of British 16-21year-olds.In all 452 young people from a variety of backgrounds completed a questionnaire, divided into three knowledge and three attitude sections. A factor analysis of each of the attitudes towards savings, pensions and life assurance scales revealed clearly interpretable factors. A correlational analysis showed participants’ knowledge of each of the three economic issues to be positively correlated. Regression analysis showed that age, education, amount of money saved and knowledge of savings, pensions and life assurance were among the most important predictors of attitudes towards the three economic issues.

Title: Aesthetics, Morality and Power: Design as Espoused Freedom and Implicit Control
Author-Name: George Cairns
Abstract: This article is intended to contribute to debate on the arguments that are propounded both in support and in condemnation of new forms of workplace aesthetic. I draw upon experience in organizational intervention and on literature from the arenas of physical and social workplace design to support a multi-contextual debate on the new workplace aesthetic and on interpretations that are placed upon it within different contexts of study. While an essential tension of freedom and control is identified in the literature, I offer no conclusion in support or in condemnation of any particular viewpoint. Rather, I argue for a multi-perspective analysis of workplace aesthetic in order to surface meaning for different groups of actors within their own context of thinking/acting. From this, general theories for analysis of other situations may be derived rather than particular models or recipes for application.

Title: Overcoming Aesthetic Muteness: Researching Organizational Members’ Aesthetic Experience
Author-Name: Steven S. Taylor
Abstract: Direct questioning about the ‘felt sense’ of organizational actions or artefacts is an accepted way to explore organizational members’ aesthetic experience. However, this requires organizational members to be able to talk about their aesthetic experience, to translate that felt sense into language. I suggest this is often difficult due to aesthetic muteness, which is a significant problem, not just for research but for organizational practice in general. I use empirical data to illustrate how this aesthetic muteness is manifested in the research process as organizational members’ difficulty in approaching their experience from an aesthetic perspective, reframing from ‘feeling’ to ‘thinking’, inability to recall aesthetic experience and denial of aesthetic experience. I then speculate that aesthetic muteness might be caused by threats to harmony, efficiency and images of power and effectiveness and that the consequences of aesthetic muteness are aesthetic amnesia, a narrowed conception of organizational ae...

Title: Disgust and Organization
Author-Name: Peter Pelzer
Abstract: The author’s experience of changes inside organizations is the basis for some speculation about the specific reactions of people who were subject to these changes. ‘I could have puked’ as a comment points to a deeper concern than the feelings of unrest, anger or disappointment. It is disgust they express about what they perceive. Disgust is the most extreme reaction to perceptions, a reaction not only of considering right or wrong in a specific situation and arguing against it but an involuntary reaction, a revolt of the body against a perception of something unacceptable, harmful, damaging, poisoning. Starting from a concrete case during a project in a large bank three aspects are explored. Disgust is interpreted as a means of knowledge; it is set into the classical framework with discussion of the perfect body; and it is viewed from the perspective of Kafka’s novels. All three offer valuable insights which aid in the interpretation of the case presented and demonstrate the power of aesthetic theory for ...

Title: Sensations, Bodies, and the ‘Spirit of a Place’: Aesthetics in Residential Organizations for the Elderly
Author-Name: Patricia Yancey Martin
Abstract: This article uses data collected in the 1970s and 1980s from old people’s homes (OPHs) in the United Kingdom to explore how aesthetics are organized in residential organizations for the elderly. The analysis reviews the sensations to which OPH members are subjected and reveals the role of power in organizing aesthetic experiences. Paradoxes associated with framing residential organizations as homes and with controlling residents’ bodies are explored. I focus on the senses of smell, sight, touch, and sound with attention to staff and residents’ views of residents’ bodily messes and their constructions of residents’ death and dying. In exploring the ‘spirit of a place,’ I differentiate homey from institutional facilities (as ideal types) by noting their physical, cultural, and social attributes. In a section on socially constructing residents’ bodies, I explore how homey (more than institutional) OPHs use power to enhance residents’ dignity and rights. Conclusions affirm the value of placing the ethnographe...

Abstract: The current study extends the concept of relational demography by considering both demographic similarities and demographic dissimilarities in supervisor-subordinate dyads. We further examined the effects of relational demography on both basic task performance and extra-role behaviors of the subordinates. We propose that demographic similarity, which engenders attraction, will be associated with extra-role behavior but not with basic task performance. We further propose that demographic dissimilarities that are consistent with relational norms will be associated with both types of performance. We tested these ideas on 335 supervisor-subordinate dyads in 10 US companies and found reasonable support for both hypotheses. We discuss the implications of these findings for future research on organizational demography and management of demographic differences that are inconsistent with social cultural norms.

Author-Name: Ifat Maoz

Author-Name: Mueen Fakhereldeen
Abstract: This study assumes that the collective identities of both Jews and Palestinians in Israel have long been constructed around the Jewish-Palestinian conflict, a major focus of social and historical reality in the Middle East region. Monolithic in their early stages, these constructions of identity underwent a process of deconstruction and reconstruction, primarily due to changes in the political reality (the peace process), globalization, and the surfacing of conflicts that were hidden within the monolithic construction. The deconstruction process, though painful and problematic, creates new opportunities for a dialogue that engages elements of identity, which no longer ‘fit’ the contenders. Such a dialogue took place in ‘laboratory’ form at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev from October 1996 and June 1997 between two leading participants in an ongoing workshop for Jewish and Palestinian Israeli students. Most conflict group encounters are measured by outcomes, not by process. We identified problems when t...

Abstract: Existing studies of maintenance skills mainly follow one of two traditions: that within the framework of the labour process debate and that of the need for (new) maintenance skills for organizational and national competitiveness. This article intends to broaden the framework of analysis concerning maintenance skills which has so far been fragmented and narrowly focused. Drawing on findings from an indepth case study of five manufacturing firms through semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire survey, this article argues that maintenance workers have a more important role to play in technological change than is commonly assumed by their managers and by writers on maintenance work. Instead of being passive recipients of, or a source of resistance to, technological change, they can, and are willing to, facilitate and initiate technological change in their organizations. However, this enabling role is conditioned by organizational factors such as management style, product market, organization of maintena...

In this article we define organizational analogs for Mead’s ‘I’ and ‘me’ and explain how these two phases of organizational identity are related. In doing so, we bring together existing theory concerning the links between organizational identities and images, with new theory concerning how reflection embeds identity in organizational culture and how identity expresses cultural understandings through symbols. We offer a model of organizational identity dynamics built on four processes linking organizational identity to culture and image. Whereas the processes linking identity and image (mirroring and impressing) have been described in the literature before, the contribution of this article lies in articulation of the processes linking identity and c...

Abstract: Although many UK-based refugees have professional qualifications and experience, they experience high unemployment. This article draws on a study of organizations providing employment-related services to refugees. It explores the discourses and narratives of the providers and refugee users of these services in relation to contrasting constructions of refugee identity. Both the official discourse of refugee resettlement and providers’ accounts emphasize the idea of ‘empowerment’, reflected also in refugee participants’ presentation of themselves as active subjects. But, in an environment characterized as largely unfriendly to refugees, enacting such an identity is difficult. Empowerment has become increasingly associated with refugee participation, self-help and the involvement of refugee community organizations. However, the association of ‘community’ with a position on the margins may serve to reinforce refugees’ outsider status. The question is raised, for both individual refugees and refugee organizati...

In examining higher education in England, one of the countries where the NPM is thought to have been embraced at least relatively enthusiastically, the article explores research on the experiences and reactions of those working in academe to recent attempts to change working practices through an analysis of the stresses and strains experienced by those subjected to the processes of managerialism. In drawing on published sources and the authors’ own empirical work it is argued that the NPM, not least in intensifying the labour of academics as intellectual workers, has provoked a range of responses which include col...

Abstract: In this study, we examine whether individualism/collectivism (I/C) orientations predict employee attitudes and behavioral intentions, and also consider whether I/C orientation moderates the relationship between equity perceptions and these variables. Four hundred and two employees from 11 high technology and financial services companies participated in this study. Results indicated that the competitiveness dimension of I/C moderated the relationships between equity perceptions and effort, and equity perceptions and obligations towards teamwork. Similarly, the solitary work preference dimension of I/C moderated the relationships between equity perceptions and career intent, and equity perceptions and obligations towards teamwork. The interactions between equity perceptions and I/C dimensions produced interesting effects. The results suggest that varying levels of equity perceptions are associated with different effects on employee attitudes and behavioral intentions depending on the level of employee indiv...

Abstract: This article argues that the concept of organizational identification can provide new and valuable insights into the dynamics of organizational change and its management. It introduces the notion of shift in identification, which consists of dis- and re-identification states that organizational members experience during change, and proposes a framework for the study of the communication-based influence strategies used by management to induce such shifts. The article introduces the concept of confluence, which involves providing some sense of self-consistency to members during change. Two empirical examples illustrating the influence strategies used by management are analyzed. Implications to the wider discourses on language, identification and change are addressed.

Title: Political Correctness and Organizational Nihilism
Author-Name: Howard S. Schwartz
Abstract: Political correctness represents the attempt to eliminate the father, often referred to as the patriarch, who is seen as having deprived us of our connection to mother and all of her goodness. But what has really deprived us of our connection to mother’s goodness is not the father, but reality itself. Political correctness therefore represents an attempt to destroy reality. This attempt to destroy the father as the representation of reality represents a different way of constructing meaning than we have in the traditional Oedipal arrangement. But the traditional arrangement made organization possible, whereas anti-paternal psychology undertakes to destroy organization. When organizations give themselves to political correctness they therefore reorganize themselves toward self-destruction. I call that process organizational nihilism.

Author-Name: Kelly McManus

Author-Name: E. Kevin Kelloway
Abstract: Differences in the experience of work-family (W-F) issues between employed single and married mothers were investigated among women in lower level (Study 1) and higher level (Study 2) occupations. Few differences were found. For both single and married mothers in lower level occupations, higher organizational and supervisor support and greater use of formal policies were related to lower work interference with family (WIF) and higher family and job satisfaction. For women in higher level occupations, results depended upon marital status, family demands and income. Married women with lower family demands and higher incomes reported less informal support, but were more satisfied with formal W-F policies and rated them as more important. This was related to higher WIF, but lower family interference with work (FIW), and higher job and family satisfaction.

Title: The ‘Long March’ of the Management Modernizers: Ritual, Rhetoric and Rationality
Author-Name: Chris Carter
Author-Name: Frank Mueller
Abstract: This article deals with a transition process from a professional engineering archetype to a modernizing managerialist archetype in a British electricity utility. This took place in the context of the substantially changing utility sector characterized by privatization, the introduction of efficiency targets, the introduction of a regulatory system, the prospect of mergers and predatory takeovers. The high-flying rhetoric of modernizing managerialists needs to be seen in the context of institutional templates, which carried substantial mimetic legitimacy, in particular programmes such as total quality management, teamworking and job redesign. They provided a basis to displace entrenched engineering rituals, and establish a new ‘dominant rhetoric’. One reading ascribes such projects as striving towards objectified and technocratic organizational improvements - the modernizers’ rhetoric. An alternative reading is one that problematizes such an understanding by instead drawing attention to the largely ceremon...

Title: Forward from a Critique of Hofstede’s Model of National Culture
Author-Name: Dermot Williamson
Abstract: McSweeney’s critique (2002) rejects Hofstede’s model and finds national culture implausible as a systematically causal factor of behaviour. His critique is examined for its useful warnings to those who follow Hofstede’s research and for its logical consistency. A paradigmatic perspective identifies where McSweeney argues against Hofstede’s logic and where he rejects Hofstede’s paradigm and premises. This indicates that both the functionalist and other paradigms are needed for future research into national culture and for understanding social behaviour in different national cultures.

Title: The Content of Effective Teamwork Mental Models in Self-Managing Teams: Ownership, Learning and Heedful Interrelating
Author-Name: Vanessa Urch Druskat
Author-Name: Anthony T. Pescosolido
Abstract: A growing stream of theory and research suggests that overlap in team member mental models (i.e. socially constructed theories about systems and their expected behavior) has a positive influence on team processes and outcomes. In this article we argue that for self- managing work teams (SMWTs), the content of those shared mental models is also important. We begin by reviewing theory on SMWT effectiveness to determine the content of effective teamwork mental models in SMWTs. These are proposed to include: (1) psychological ownership of team processes and outcomes; (2) a need for continuous learning; and (3) a need for heedful interrelating. We then conduct content analyses of four published longitudinal studies of SMWTs to uncover the opportunities and challenges to developing and sustaining these mental models in dynamic organizations. Results suggest these mental models flourish when organizational supports back up their existence. However, since mental models are fluid and adapt to explicit and implicit...

Title: Letters of Recommendation: An Evolutionary Psychological Perspective
Author-Name: Stephen M. Colarelli

Author-Name: Kristophor G. Canali
Abstract: This article develops a theoretical framework for understanding the appeal and tone of letters of recommendation using an evolutionary psychological perspective. Several hypotheses derived from this framework are developed and tested. The authors’ theoretical argument makes two major points. First, over the course of human evolution, people developed a preference for narrative information about people, and the format of letters of recommendation is compatible with that preference. Second, because recommenders are acquaintances of applicants, the tone of letters should reflect the degree to which the relationship with the applicant favors the recommender’s interests. We hypothesized that, over and above an applicant’s objective qualifications, letters of recommendation will reflect cooperative, status and mating interests of recommenders. We used 532 letters of recommendation written for 169 applicants for faculty positions to test our hypotheses. The results indicated that the strength of the cooperative ...

Title: Network Learning: Exploring Learning by Interorganizational Networks
Author-Name: Louise Knight
Abstract: The importance of interorganizational networks in supporting or hindering the achievement of organizational objectives is now widely acknowledged. Network research is directed at understanding network processes and structures, and their impact upon performance. A key process is learning. The concepts of individual, group and organizational learning are long established. This article argues that learning might also usefully be regarded as occurring at a fourth system level, the interorganizational network. The concept of network learning - learning by a group of organizations as a group - is presented, and differentiated from other types of learning, notably interorganizational learning (learning in interorganizational contexts). Four cases of network learning are identified and analysed to provide insights into network learning processes and outcomes. It is proposed that ‘network learning episode’ offers a suitable unit of analysis for the empirical research needed to develop our understanding of this pot...

Author-Name: Miguel Pina e Cunha
Abstract: Paradox is gaining more and more pervasiveness in and around organizations, thus increasing the need for an approach to management that allows both researchers and practitioners to address these paradoxes. We attempt to contribute to this project by suggesting a relational approach to paradoxes. To this aim, we first present the state of the art of research on management paradoxes and then explain four regularities surfaced in the literature on this topic. We conclude by arguing that taking these regularities as a whole allows us to suggest a new perspective on paradoxes - one with a positive regard for the co-presence of opposites but that takes seriously the potential relationship between these.

Title: The Structure of the Meaning of Work: A Relative Stability Amidst Change
Author-Name: Itzhak Harpaz
Author-Name: Xuanning Fu
Abstract: The theoretical and empirical literature assumes stability of important attitudes and values. Accordingly, this study examined the hypothesis that the structure of the meaning of work will remain stable over time. This hypothesis was tested on two independent samples of the Israeli labour force. The first (n = 407) was a group of individuals who were interviewed twice, once in 1981 and again in 1993. The second was a new representative sample (n = 942) of the labour force, assembled in 1993, to serve as a comparison with the first sample. The findings generally support the hypothesis regarding the stability over time of the structure of the meaning of work concept.

Title: Customers, Boardrooms and Gossip: Theme Repetition and Metapatterns in the Texture of Organizing
Author-Name: Piers Myers
Abstract: This article draws together theoretical strands from cognitive science, psychoanalysis, and small-group psychology in order to discuss theme repetition in organizations. It suggests that attending to the possibility of theme repetition, even in apparently inconsequential interactions and small talk, can bring to light previously unnoticed connotations of policy or strategy. This discussion leads on to a re-examination and expansion of the notion of metapatterns. These are tacit, emergent patterns of theme repetition in the meanings of organizational contexts. Metapatterns may contribute to enculturation, culture formation and the establishment of organizational stories, histories and artefacts. They may also form a critical obstruction to organizational learning and change. Consequences for researchers and consultants are investigated and it is proposed that, if metapatterns are to alter, recognition of a change agent’s own involvement in metapattern themes is required.

Title: The Organization and the Symbolic: Organizational Dynamics Viewed from a Lacanian Perspective
Author-Name: Gilles Arnaud
Abstract: For many rationalist observers, organizational dysfunctions, such as recurrent failures in the implementation of strategic orientations, the constantly aggressive behaviour of managers, and so on, are nothing other than manifestation of deficiencies in decision-making or in the well thought-out application of decisions. In the light of psychoanalysis, however, such phenomena can be regarded differently, in particular as compulsions to repeat or actings-out. Indeed, in this perspective, it is on a ‘stage’ other than that of ‘reality’ that the game is played out: the stage of the imaginary and unconscious symbolic determinations. The object of this article is to propose a fresh reading of organizational life based on the work of Jacques Lacan. Although Lacanian notions are often seen as posing numerous problems for those brought up in an Anglo-American tradition of intellectual endeavour, this article upholds that such notions suggest rigorous alternative ways of approaching organizations.

Abstract: This article argues, based on the work of Bakhtin and de Certeau, that there is no aesthetics without politics and that all academic discourse and practices are enacted through aesthetic forms with inherently political and ethical effects. The article is written in a script-form with indications on how to perform it, acting out or ‘performing’ in a direct way rather than adding to the arguments already present in organizational literature. In a prologue (which can be read after reading the script by readers who do not want to harm its open impact), we discuss aspects of this choice: through the use of a different form for telling a story, we want to focus on the political and ethical implications of an aesthetic approach to organizing and how this can influence scholarly work. The script wants to move readers through various spaces of speech where society becomes organized. Through such movements we want to contribute to the imagination of possible ways of ‘performing oneself’ as an academic citizen in so...

Title: A Qualitative Investigation of Perceived Executive Ethical Leadership: Perceptions from Inside and Outside the Executive Suite

Abstract: Senior executives are thought to provide the organization’s ethical ‘tone at the top’. We conducted an inductive interview-based study aimed at defining the perceived content domain of executive ethical leadership. We interviewed two types of key informants - corporate ethics officers and senior executives - about executive ethical leadership and then a contrasting category we labeled ‘ethically neutral’ leadership. Systematic analysis of the data identified multiple dimensions of ethical and ethically neutral leadership. The findings suggest that ethical leadership is more than traits such as integrity and more than values-based inspirational leadership. It includes an overlooked transactional component that involves using communication and the reward system to guide ethical behavior. Similarities and differences between ethics officers’ and senior executives’ perceptions also led to insights about the importance of vantage point and social salience in perceptions of executive ethical leadership.

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to explore psychoanalytically grounded approaches to organizational consultation. The article draws on existing literature as well as personal interviews with several contributors in the field to articulate certain critical concerns over psychoanalytically grounded organizational study and intervention. These include the inappropriate analyzing of clients, non-systemic interventions, wild analysis and collusion. The article examines in detail how contributors in the field see the work they carry out and how they respond to various criticisms. It is suggested that the parameters of clinical psychoanalysis may be used as the basis for a constructive dialog in the field aimed at addressing critical concerns and developing both theory and applications.

Abstract: We proposed that the social exchange relationships individuals form in the workplace would mediate the relation between perceptions of interactional and distributive justice and social loafing. Specifically, we argued that both leader-member exchanges (LMX) and team-member exchanges (TMX) would mediate the relation between interactional justice and social loafing, and that LMX would mediate the relation between distributive justice and social loafing. In a field study, 124 manufacturing employees responded to questionnaires and their immediate supervisors were interviewed. The results indicated significant relationships between interactional justice and LMX, and between interactional justice and TMX. LMX, but not TMX, was negatively related to social loafing. Distributive justice was not significantly related to LMX. Thus no support was found for LMX as a mediator of the relationship between distributive justice and social loafing.

Title: Does Privatization Create a ‘New Breed’ of Managers? A Study of the UK Railway Industry
Author-Name: Andrew Pendleton
Abstract: The article enquires whether privatization leads to an influx of managers with different characteristics, attitudes, and perspectives from incumbent state enterprise managers, as has been widely suggested in studies of privatization in both economics and sociology. These questions are addressed with reference to an empirical study of managers in several companies in the UK privatized railway industry. The characteristics and views of new entrants are compared with those of incumbents. Clear differences in demographic and career characteristics are observed between the two groups, but there is little difference between them in attitudes and perspectives on management. The main exception is in the area of labour-management relationships. These findings suggest that accounts by scholars and practitioners overstate the differences between the two groups of managers.

Title: Promoting Role Breadth Self-Efficacy Through Involvement, Work Redesign and Training
Author-Name: Carolyn M. Axtell
Author-Name: Sharon K. Parker
Abstract: This article examines the influence of organizational practices on role breadth self-efficacy (RBSE); a person’s confidence in performing proactive, interpersonal tasks that go beyond traditional boundaries. A longitudinal study showed that increased task control, membership of an active improvement group, and breadth of training were associated with increased RBSE. Providing a stronger basis for causal inference, membership of active improvement groups at Time 1 also had a positive lagged effect on later RBSE. These findings support the proposition that RBSE can be enhanced via organizational intervention. The study also showed that, after controlling for greater involvement, job enlargement had a negative lagged effect on RBSE. This suggests the potential detrimental consequences of enlarging jobs without also expanding employees’ autonomy and influence.

Author-Name: Mary Ann Hazen
Abstract: Perinatal loss is a life-altering event for a mother, affecting every aspect of her existence, including her work and career. Fifteen women describe how such loss affected their work and how the responses of others influenced their healing. I consider the effects on grief of silence, disenfranchisement, attachment, trauma, shame, secrecy, and the social context. I note patterns of healing: connection to the self, attachment to the dead child, and linking the self and child to the family and community. Community attachments include those made in the workplace. Relationships at work and work itself can contribute to disenfranchised grief or healing from perinatal loss.

Title: Ethical Choice in Managerial Work: The Scope for Moral Choices in an Ethically Irrational World
Author-Name: Tony J. Watson
Abstract: Ethical and moral aspects of the work of managers are given less direct attention in the literature than we might expect given the growing attention being paid to business ethics more generally. Theoretical analysis together with an account of one self-avowedly ethically sensitive senior manager is used to argue that corporate managers may be less ‘morally mute’ than they are often alleged to be. Managers - ‘strategic’ ones at least - necessarily deal with ethically sensitive pressures coming from the various constituencies with which an organization strategically exchanges. In this, there is scope for individual managers (who are, themselves, resource-dependent constituencies) to bring to bear their personal ethical preferences on decisions and to mediate corporate priorities. The extent to which managers generally recognize this scope and exploit opportunities to adopt ‘ethically assertive’ as opposed to ‘ethically reactive’ orientations is an important question for detailed research.

Title: Your Money or Your Life? Psychotic Implications of the Pension Fund System: Towards a Socio-Analysis of the Financial Services Revolution
Author-Name: Burkard Sievers
Abstract: The present Anglo-American pension funds system is based on totally different images of man, society, and social relatedness than the traditional social security systems and retirement schemes characteristic of welfare states in many European countries. This article is guided by the working hypothesis that the pension fund system, because of its inherent defenses against persecutory and depressive anxieties, is based on psychotic dynamics. Participation in the pension fund system encourages a psychotic dynamic; the expected pension after retirement is seen to protect one from a ‘miserable’ way of life, from deprivation, from annihilation and feelings of dependency, gratitude, love, and guilt. As people increasingly strive for an affluent retirement, commoditized money nurtures the illusion that the more money one accumulates the more certain death will be kept away. It further will be argued that the psychotic dynamic inherent in the pension funds system is not limited to those who invest in the funds, bu...

Title: The Use of Personality Typing in Organizational Change: Discourse, Emotions and the Reflexive Subject
Author-Name: Karin Garrety
Author-Name: Richard Badham
Author-Name: Viviane Morrigan
Author-Name: Will Rifkin
Author-Name: Michael Zanko
Abstract: This article is based on a study of an organizational change program that sought to alter employees’ self-perceptions, emotions and behavior through the use of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, a popular personality-typing tool. The program affords an opportunity to explore the various ways in which discourses advocating personal and organizational change work through employees’ subjectivity. We argue that theoretical approaches that view the targets of such programs as passive - as either ‘colonized’ or constructed by discourses - fail to capture the complex and contradictory nature of organizational control, and subjects’ changing positions within it. Drawing on symbolic interactionism, we argue that the power of discourses is mediated through an active, reflexive, and often emotional engagement on the part of individuals. Through their involvement, employees variously reproduce, resist or reconfigure power relationships which, during organizational change, are themselves unstable and inconsistent.

Title: The Complexity of Improvisation and the Improvisation of Complexity: Social Science, Art and Creativity
Author-Name: Alfonso Montuori
Abstract: The concept of improvisation has become increasingly popular in the discourse of organizational theory. This paper explores several aspects of improvisation, in the context of musical, organizational, and everyday activities, in order to address some of the philosophical and practical issues relevant to this emerging interest. Connections are made between the modernist concept of organization and scholarly inquiry, and postmodern or complexity-based approaches that stress creativity as an emergent property of the relationship between order and disorder. It concludes by suggesting that the study of improvisation demands a profound immersion in (inster-)subjectivity, emotions, time, aesthetics, performance, and social creativity, none of which have traditionally been the focus of organization and management studies, or the social sciences in general. It also suggests that the practice of social sciences itself should reflect upon, and attempt to incorporate these elements.

Title: Consulting as a Liminal Space
Author-Name: Barbara Czarniawska
Author-Name: Carmelo Mazza
Abstract: The growing literature on management consulting views consultants as allies of management, in temporary positions of power. This article attempts to complement this perspective by assuming a metaphor of consulting as a liminal space. Liminality is a condition where the usual practice and order are suspended and replaced by new rites and rituals. We build on the anthropological analyses of Arnold van Gennep and Victor Turner to find theoretical support for the idea of liminality as applied to the consulting activity. This article is based on our experience as consultants and observers. It collects on-the-job reflections - ours and those of other consultants we have met. These participating observations support the suggestion that consulting can be represented as a liminal space for both consultants and their client organizations.

Title: Workaholism: Its Definition and Nature
Author-Name: Itzhak Harpaz
Author-Name: Raphael Snir
Abstract: The term ‘workaholism’ is widely used, but there is little consensus about its meaning, beyond that of its core element: a substantial investment in work. Following Snir and Zohar, workaholism was first defined in the present study as the individual’s steady and considerable allocation of time to work-related activities and thoughts, which does not derive from external necessities. Subsequently, it was measured as time invested in work, while controlling the financial needs for this investment. The relation between workaholism and possible attitudinal (meaning of work indices), demographic (gender, marital status), and situational (occupation type, employment sector) variables was examined through two representative samples of the Israeli labor force. The following predictor variables were significantly related to workaholism: work centrality, economic orientation, occupation type, employment sector and gender. From those variables, gender was found to be the strongest predictor - that is, men, in compari...

Author-Name: Stijn Vanheule
Author-Name: An Lievrouw
Author-Name: Paul Verhaeghe
Abstract: This article examines the intersubjective process connected with burnout. On the basis of qualitative research data we investigate to what extent Lacan’s model of intersubjectivity enables us to under-stand the burnout process and to differentiate between people who suffer from burnout and those who do not. We first outline Lacan’s theory of intersubjectivity through a discussion of the dialectical master/slave relationship and the difference between imaginary and symbolic interactions. This model is then tested against the interview material of 30 special educators drawn from the results of a wider random sample survey of 765 respondents in response to a burnout questionnaire. We found that Lacan’s distinction between imaginary and symbolic functioning allows us to make a difference between high and low scorers. High scorers - among whom two subtypes can be distinguished - function mainly in an imaginary way. Among low scorers we similarly found two subgroups - one that interacts symbolically and one tha...

Title: Cultures within Culture: Unity and Diversity of Two Generations of Employees                in State-Owned Enterprises
Author-Name: Shuang Liu
Abstract: This study adopts integration and differentiation perspectives to examine why unity and diversity of organizational cultures emerged as a function of economic reform, and how subcultural differences were reflected in employees' perceptions of cultural practices. Data were gathered from in-depth interviews and a large-scale survey in two large, state-owned enterprises in north-east China. Results indicated that, although all employees were oriented towards a common set of cultural themes, the two generations of employees did not exemplify the themes in the same way. Specifically, unity was illustrated by employees' desire to maintain Harmony and to reduce Inequality. Diversity was revealed by first-generation employees' higher ratings on Loyalty, Security and even Bureaucracy. The findings are discussed in the light of traditional Chinese cultural values, political ideology and the social context. Implications are drawn for organizational cultural theory and research.

Author-Name: Eero Vaara

Author-Name: Risto Säntti
Abstract: This article focuses on cultural identity-building in the cross-border merger context. To provide an alternative to the dominant essentialist analyses of cultures and cultural differences, cultural identity-building is conceptualized as a metaphoric process. The focus is on two processes inherent in the cross-border merger context: construction of images of Us and Them and construction of images of a Common Future. Based on an analysis of a special metaphor exercise carried out in a recent Finnish-Swedish merger, the article illustrates how the metaphoric perspective reveals specific cognitive, emotional and political aspects of cultural identity-building that easily remain `hidden' in the case of more traditional approaches.

Title: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Participative Decision-Making in Organizations
Author-Name: Abraham Sagie
Author-Name: Zeynep Aycan
Abstract: Despite considerable awareness about various forms and meanings of participative decision-making (PDM) in different parts of the world, there is less agreement on the causes of variation in PDM. This article argues that among other exogenous (e.g. sociopolitical, legal, historical) forces, the sociocultural context plays an important role in the observed differences among PDM approaches and practices across nations. Similarly, subcultures and organizational cultures may influence PDM within nations. Two cultural dimensions: individualism-collectivism and power distance, are linked with four widespread employee participation approaches: face-to-face PDM, collective PDM, pseudo-PDM, and paternalistic PDM. The attributes of each PDM form, including the cultural determinants, underlying beliefs, the types of decisions made, and the relationship between a specified form and other PDM meanings (e.g. self-managing teams) are elaborated.

Title: Psychoanalytic Perspectives on Organizational Consulting: Transference and Counter-Transference
Author-Name: William Czander
Author-Name: Kenneth Eisold
Abstract: There is a plethora of publications offering methodologies and styles of consultation for the hundreds of thousands of people who engage in organizational and management consulting work. Yet we know little about the psychodynamics of the consultation process, how the consultant influences this process and is, in turn, influenced by it. This is where a psychoanalytic perspective on the process can be especially valuable. In this article, we explore the challenges and complexities associated with a psychoanalytic orientation to the consulting process. In particular, we explore the transference and counter-transference issues that a consultant typically faces when engaging in this work. We establish the analysis of transference as a key to diagnosis and intervention and then offer a methodology for this form of consulting.

Title: The Cornerstone of Psychoanalytic Organizational Analysis: Psychological                Reality, Transference and Counter-Transference in the Workplace
Author-Name: Michael Diamond
Author-Name: Seth Allcorn
Abstract: We start with the premise that organizations are processes of human behavior that are experienced as experiential and perceptual systems governed by unconscious processes. This starting point leads us to discuss psychoanalytically informed organizational perspectives as a means of understanding how psychological reality shapes organizational dynamics. In particular, we argue that psychoanalytic organizational diagnosis requires a central role for transference and counter-transference. That is, interpreting data through the lens of transference and counter-transference assists in unpacking organizational identity and culture by relying upon an `experience near' stance for examining the narratives of organizational life. This introspective and empathic stance makes transference and counter-transference one of the core elements of a psychoanalytically informed organizational consultation. We provide a case illustration and conclude with some thoughts on how leaders and members of organizations can improve or...

Title: Unbounded Irrationality: Risk and Organizational Narcissism at Long Term                Capital Management
Author-Name: Mark Stein
Abstract: This article focuses on the near collapse of the highly prestigious hedge-fund Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) in September 1998, causing widespread fears that its demise may lead to global financial meltdown. Explanations pivoting on the idea of bounded rationality - that rationally functioning organizations may collapse because of a lack of information or the capacity to process such information - are found not to apply. The article postulates the irrational functioning of LTCM, and proposes a psychoanalytic theory of organizational narcissism as a means of explanation. This theory comprises well-explored themes of organizational narcissism such as hubris, omnipotence and omniscience, as well as newer themes of contempt, triumph, and the embeddedness of narcissism in the organization's socio-technical system. The article concludes by examining these ideas in relation to other theories of risk as well as the implications for practice.

Title: Breaking the Glass Ceiling: The Effects of Sex Ratios and Work-Life Programs                on Female Leadership at the Top
Author-Name: George F. Dreher
Abstract: Data, at the level of the corporation, revealed that the percentage of lower-level managerial positions held by women in the 1980s and early 1990s was positively associated with the number of work-life human resource practices provided in 1994 and with the percentage of senior management positions held by women in 1999. In turn, the number of work-life human resource practices provided in 1994 was positively associated with the percentage of senior management positions held by women in 1999 and partially mediated the effect of lower-level female representation on senior level female representation. These results support the blending of a social contact theory perspective and a strategic human resource management perspective when explaining the glass-ceiling phenomenon, and have important implications for managing human resources and individual careers.

Title: A Narratological Approach to Understanding Processes of Organizing in a UK Hospital
Author-Name: Graeme Currie
Author-Name: Andrew D. Brown
Abstract: This article outlines a narratological approach to understanding how middle managers and senior managers in a UK National Health Service (NHS) hospital made sense of the introduction of a series of interventions, led by senior managers. The research contribution this article makes is fourfold. First, it illustrates the role of individual and group narratives in processes of collective sensemaking. Second, it discusses the importance of work narratives in the efforts of individuals and groups to define their shared identities. Third, it outlines a view of organizations as storytelling milieux in which group narratives play important hegemonic and legitimatory roles. Finally, our focus on narratives, and the plurivocal understandings of actions and events they often encompass, is, we maintain, one useful means by which polysemy can be read back into case study research.

Abstract: This article describes the new qualitative methodology developed for use in CIRAS (Confidential Incident Reporting and Analysis System), the confidential database set up for the UK railways by the University of Strathclyde. CIRAS is a project in which qualitative safety data are disidentified and then stored and analysed in a central database. Due to the confidential nature of the data provided, conventional (positivist) methods of checking their accuracy are not applicable; therefore a new methodology was developed - the Applied Hermeneutic Methodology (AHM). Based on Paul Ricoeur's `hermeneutic arc', this methodology uses appropriate computer software to provide a method of analysis that can be shown to be reliable (in the sense that consensus in interpretations between different interpreters can be demonstrated). Moreover, given that the classifiers of the textual elements can be represented in numeric form, AHM crosses the `qualitative-quantitative divide'. It is suggested that this methodology is mor...

Title: Social Dreaming as Sustained Thinking
Author-Name: Gordon Lawrence
Abstract: This article begins by describing Freud's work on dreams, and the importance this had for dream theory. Bion's perspective follows, with his questioning of Freud's theory that dreams exist to disguise the wishes and conceal the needs of the dreamer. The article then goes on to consider what happens if dreaming is regarded as a normal human activity, and the working through of thinking and creativity while the dreamer is asleep. From this point, it moves on to look at the emergent theory of social dreaming, which takes place in a matrix - where the matrix is the name given to the collection of people meeting to share their dreams. Finally, seven working hypotheses of the developing theory of social dreaming are described.

Title: Ask and you shall Receive? Gender Differences in Negotiators' Beliefs about                Requests for a Higher Salary
Author-Name: Lisa A. Barron
Abstract: Men and women have been shown to negotiate different salary amounts, but little research has investigated whether their behavior differs and how their beliefs might affect behavior. Using quantitative data from simulated negotiations and qualitative data from post-negotiation interviews, this study examines differences in the amounts of men's and women's salary requests and their beliefs about these requests. Qualitative data show differences in the nature of men's and women's beliefs about requesting a higher salary. Quantitative findings show that men made significantly larger salary requests than women and that beliefs were related to these requests. Theoretical implications are discussed.

Author-Name: David A. Buchanan
Abstract: This article explores the lived experience of change drivers involved in a whole-hospital re-engineering programme. As these drivers were not a select management group, but included staff from all organization levels, this illustrates a `dispersed responsibility' model of change implementation. Other research suggests that many public and private sector organizations may similarly be blurring demarcations between change `drivers' and `driven'. The findings from this study indicate that, despite the pressures and unpredictabilities of strategic change, there can be significant personal development, and career benefit, for those in driving roles. Human resource management issues concerning the appointment, support, career progression and retention of change drivers may thus become critical.

Author-Name: Majella O'Leary
Abstract: This article examines the stories told by employees in a 160-year-old newspaper production and publishing company, the Courier. Over 100 interviews with employees of the newspaper company (past and present) were carried out over a six-year period during which the Courier was undergoing major change, including the move from a local to a national newspaper. In this article, I organize these stories into four narrative constructions ('paternalism', `profit', `career' and `cynicism') which represent different ways of thinking about organizations, variously emphasizing family and community, competition and prohibition, publicity and success, and injustice and deception.

Abstract: The merger of the head offices of two public service organizations in Sweden was used to examine differences in the meanings that employees attach to the organizations involved and their expectations of the new merged organization, nine months prior to the merger. A two-stage methodology was used, combining the repertory grid method with a survey questionnaire based on the elicited constructs. Predictions from a social constructivist perspective on culture and social identity theory were largely confirmed. The results showed that both groups expected one of them to be dominant after the merger. Members of this organization expected to change very little, while employees in the non-dominant group felt themselves to be threatened by the prospect of merger and this led them to emphasize their own distinctiveness. The findings suggest that the success of the integration process after a merger is critically dependent on how employees of merger partners perceive the culture of the organizations involved and the...

Title: Male Emotions/Relationships and Violence: A Case Study
Author-Name: Thomas J. Scheff
Abstract: In this article, a theory of the emotional/relational origins of male violence is outlined, and illustrated by episodes in Hitler's life. Drawing on earlier work on aggression and violence, it is proposed that three conditions lead to rage and violence: (i) no affectional attachments, (ii) a single overarching obsession, and (iii) the complete repression of shame. Only to the extent that all three of these conditions are fully met is destructive violence likely. Although women in whom these three conditions were present would be as likely as men to commit violent acts, men qualify much more frequently and fully than women. Key features of the theory are illustrated by applying it to details in biographies of Hitler. This case suggests a way in which emotions unite leaders and led, leading to collective violence. Finally, a method that would provide a preliminary test of the theory is suggested.

Title: Terrorism: A Positive Feedback Game
Author-Name: Mary Douglas
Author-Name: Gerald Mars
Abstract: This article offers an approach to political systems in enclaves (i.e. closed, dissident minorities) from the standpoint of Cultural Theory; it seeks to identify different kinds of organized dissent, as well as the constraints facing them, most especially those deriving from manipulation and control of information. In this latter case, the resulting choices have implications with regard to both structure and behaviour, which defy all explanations that are based exclusively on the personalities of members or leaders. This approach provides a means of classifying and subdividing enclaves, and proposes, in so doing, a bimodal developmental schema with four forks. The first fork examines demographic security: it focuses on concerns regarding defection, and on the means of controlling information. The second considers internal organization, as well as alternatives to defection. The third fork, on external relations, looks into the alternative steps that are available in order to control factionalism and negoti...

Abstract: In a longitudinal field study of a random sample of employees in an organization undergoing major restructuring and downsizing, we investigated the moderating influence of job security on the effect of role clarity on employee performance. The results support our hypothesis. That is, job performance increased over time under higher levels of role clarity. Moreover, this increase in performance was maximized when both role clarity and job security were high, while deterioration in performance was greatest when role clarity was low and job security was high.

The object of the research is change management processes in the work systems at subsidiary level. The central research question of the study is to analyse how these processes are shaped by globalization on the one hand and national institutional contexts on the other hand. In doing so, the authors position their research between the two dominant families of approaches in international business research, recently characterized by Child as `low-context' and `high-context' approaches.

Title: Organizational Learning: A Socio-Cognitive Framework

Abstract: Organizational learning is a popular topic in business and academia and attracts many researchers and practitioners from different fields. Even though organizational learning scholarship is still growing, there are few studies that cross-fertilize social cognition and organizational learning. This investigation examines organizational learning from the perspective of social cognition. It is argued that social cognition explains the organizational learning process better by integrating fragmented studies on the processes of learning, and the study proposes that organizational learning is an outcome of reciprocal interactions of the processes of information/knowledge acquisition, information/knowledge dissemination, information/knowledge implementation, sensemaking, memory, thinking, unlearning, intelligence, improvisation, and emotions - connected by organizational culture. In addition, the implications of social cognition on organizational learning are discussed.

Abstract: This article compares traditional offline flirting with cyber-flirting. We begin by providing a definition of offline flirting, which we follow up with our own elaboration of cyber-flirting. The article then draws from psychoanalytic theory, in particular Winnicott's object-relations theory, to propose that cyber-flirting can be a form of play. While this is not an empirical study, we do attempt to present a theoretical framework for the conception of cyberspace. In presenting this framework, we draw from past qualitative and quantitative studies on Internet relationships. We emphasize the problems with past researchers' obsessive attention to the absence of the body online, and suggest that new theorizing on Internet relationships needs to consider how the body is re-constructed. We propose that cyberspace can be what Winnicott would describe as a `potential space' for play, and this particularly applies to online spaces such as MUDs, MOOs and chat rooms. In addition, we suggest that cyber-flirting may p...

Based on qualitative case study research, this article analyses policies for managing human resources in a German non-profit repertory theatre. Referring to Marsden's theory of employment systems, the article suggests regarding these policies as being embedded in an interorganizational employment system, which comprises rules of job design and task assignment, the labour market, inter-firm institutions and the education system. This employment system for German theatre artists is marked by a high labour mobility and contingent work arrangements, but is also characterized by an ensemble structure providing (temporary) stability of the workforce. By studying how employment relationships are `managed' in theatres and how the organizational level is linked to the field's labour market characteristics, this article aims at contributing to the exploration of institutional prerequisites and organizational consequences of contingent work arrangements. In doin...

Title: Against Learning
Author-Name: Alessia Contu

Author-Name: Anders örtenblad
Abstract: This article is a critique of the broad ensemble which we identify as `learning discourse' and its pervasive ideological content which determines learning as a `good thing for all'. We consider how the signifier `learning' works as a nodal point which constitutes (legitimizes and sustains), yet glosses over, antagonistic and contradictory organizational and social practices. With our critique we endeavour to go beyond a simple rebuke or rebuttal. We, rather, point out the problematic nature of the truths engendered in `making the social' and constituting the promise of a learning society whose ambit encompasses learning in general, the learning organization and the political economy of the `knowledge economy'. By doing so we expose the political character of the learning discourse which, we argue, works as the surface of intelligibility pro-posing the reality of work, self-hood, citizenship and society. We antagonize its `no alternative' trope by questioning the equivalence it creates between social inclu...

Title: From Knowledge-Creation to the Perfecting of Action: Tao, Basho and Pure                Experience as the Ultimate Ground of Knowing
Author-Name: Robert Chia
Abstract: The idea of knowledge-creation and knowledge management has become an important area of research in management studies. This preoccupation with the creation and accumulation of knowledge in its explicit representational form is underpinned by the epistemological priorities of an alphabetic-literate1 culture that takes written knowledge as the only reliable basis for effective action. Documented knowledge necessarily precedes and hence determines action and performance. Such a metaphysical orientation precludes the possibility of attaining a form of direct unmediated knowing through the relentless perfecting of action. In traditionally based oral-aural communities or in non-alphabetic East Asian cultures knowing is more often achieved directly through the immediate engagement of tasks rather than through the acquisition of abstract written signs and symbols: learning by direct observation and doing is the order of the day. Consequently, there is little systematic documenting and recording of knowledge in t...

Title: Reflexive Inquiry in Organizational Research: Questions and Possibilities
Author-Name: Ann L. Cunliffe
Abstract: Over the last 20 years, social science scholars have challenged conventional conceptions of social reality, knowledge, and the validity of our methods of inquiry. Many have criticized the aim of mainstream social science to provide an absolute, objective view of the world and have called for a reflexive stance in which we recognize all social activity, including research itself, as an ongoing endogenous accomplishment. Three main themes have emerged: a crisis of representation, an emphasis on the constitutive nature of language, and a call for reflexive approaches to research. Contemporary organizational theorists have found themselves drawn into the debate and struggling with a number of questions around how to carry out reflexive research. I examine those questions and explore the implications for organizational research. In doing so, I attempt to enact reflexivity through one layer of narrative circularity.

Title: When a Leader Dies
Author-Name: Paula Hyde
Author-Name: Alan B. Thomas
Abstract: The reactions of followers after losing a leader are an important and neglected area of study. In fact, little is known about reactions to changes of leadership in organizational settings, generally. The effects of loss and specifically of bereavement within the family are well known. Whilst organizational life differs from family life, some relationships and reactions to loss may be comparable. One way of illuminating reactions to the loss of a leader is to look empirically at cases of leadership loss. This article presents one example taken from the health service of a team whose leader died after a short illness. Members of this team reacted differently according to their previous attachment to the leader and their reactions ranged from grief to indifference. The death of a leader is an extraordinary occurrence that may illuminate reactions to loss more generally within organizations.

Abstract: This is a case study of managerial identity work, based on an in-depth case of a senior manager and the organizational context in which she works. The article addresses the interplay between organizational discourses, role expectations, narrative self-identity and identity work. Identity is conceptualized in processual terms as identity work and struggle. The article illuminates fragmentation as well as integration in the interplay between organizational discourses and identity. It aims to contribute to a processual oriented identity theory and to the methodology of identity studies through showing the advantage of a multi-level intensive study.

Title: Between the Millstones: A Narrative Account of the Vulnerability of Middle                Managers’ Storying
Author-Name: David Sims
Abstract: This article seeks to illuminate our understanding of the lives of middle managers by considering the special pressures on them to tell stories about their organization that make sense to three different audiences; their superiors, their subordinates and themselves. Each of those audiences will demand to hear a convincing account, but the senior audience may trample unaware on middle managers’ stories, the junior audience may view them with scepticism or hostility, and the self audience may be fearful of losing the plot. Illustrated by four middle management storytelling situations, the article offers a narrative understanding of the peculiar loneliness, precariousness and vulnerability that characterize middle management, and suggests why these characteristics may be debilitating for middle management practice.

Title: Ways of Explaining Workplace Bullying: A Review of Enabling, Motivating and                Precipitating Structures and Processes in the Work Environment
Author-Name: Denise Salin
Abstract: This article summarizes the literature explaining workplace bullying and focuses on organizational antecedents of bullying. In order to understand better the logic behind bullying, a model discussing different explanations is put forward. Thus, explanations for and factors associated with bullying are classified into three groups, enabling structures or necessary antecedents (e.g. perceived power imbalances, low perceived costs, and dissatisfaction and frustration), motivating structures or incentives (e.g. internal competition, reward systems and expected benefits), and precipitating processes or triggering circumstances (e.g. downsizing and restructuring, organizational changes, changes in the composition of the work group). The article concludes that bullying is often an interaction between structures and processes from all three groupings.

Title: Organizational Learning Mechanisms and Managers’ Perceived Uncertainty
Author-Name: Shmuel Ellis

Abstract: The present study examined the relations between perceived environmental/technological uncertainty among managers and intensity of use of organizational learning mechanisms. Confirming the research hypotheses, negative relations were found between the intensity of use of each of the five factors of organizational learning mechanisms (formal learning processes, information dissemination, training, information gathering, information storage and retrieval) and perceived environmental/technological uncertainty. These correlations were higher in the organizations that function under uncertain as opposed to certain environments. Finally, when perceived uncertainty was regressed on the five factors of organizational learning mechanisms, information gathering came out with a positive regression weight, that is, when organizational learning mechanisms like information dissemination, training or information storage and retrieval are held constant, information gathering is positively related to uncertainty.

Abstract: Sexuality and the experience of sexual minorities in the workplace are under-researched areas. The research reported here - a case study in one government department in the UK - utilizes a discursive research method to uncover a theme that is at the centre of this experience - silence. In-depth semi-structured interviews were carried out with individuals eliciting their stories on their experience as lesbians and gay men in the workplace, and these stories were then used to promote more general discussion within focus groups. Understanding silence in the research process with relation to both the researcher and the respondent was found to be vital for research in this area, and the article raises issues to do with uncovering previously silenced voices. Silence also emerged as a recurrent theme in the research and found that there were many ways in which this silence can play an integral role in organizational discourse and the creation of social identity. We have therefore suggested that silence could be ...

Abstract: In this article, we argue that research concerning workplace discrimination could be advanced by considering ‘everyday discrimination,’ that is, the subtle, pervasive discriminatory acts experienced by members of stigmatized groups on a daily basis. Three studies are reported which use secondary data analysis techniques to provide evidence for the existence of everyday workplace discrimination against Blacks. In addition to demonstrating the occurrence of such discrimination, evidence is presented which indicates that the experience of everyday discrimination is negatively associated with various indicators of well-being. The implications of these findings for organizations and for discrimination researchers are discussed.

Title: Conflict Escalation: Dispute Exacerbating Elements of E-mail Communication
Author-Name: Raymond A. Friedman
Author-Name: Steven C. Currall
Abstract: In this article, we proffer new theoretical ideas regarding how the structural features of e-mail make it more likely that disputes escalate when people communicate electronically compared to when they communicate face-to-face or via the telephone. Building upon Rubin et al.’s (1994) conflict escalation model, we propose a new conceptual framework that articulates: (i) the structural properties of e-mail communication; (ii) the impact of these properties on conflict process effects; and (iii) how process effects, in turn, trigger conflict escalation. Propositions specify the nature of relationships among process effects and the components of conflict escalation. We also discuss how the extent of familiarity between individuals acts as a moderator of these relationships. Our conceptual framework, the dispute-exacerbating model of e-mail (DEME), is designed to be a foundation for future empirical research.

Title: Multiple Types of Psychological Contracts: A Six-cluster Solution

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to identify a variety of employment relationships based upon an economy-wide, representative sample. We turn to psychological contract studies examining different types of psychological contracts. We expand two existing typologies by incorporating multiple features or underlying dimensions of psychological contracts. Such a feature-oriented approach allows us to construct a meaningful conceptualization of employer and employee obligations across different settings and to identify multiple types of psychological contracts in which combinations of different dimensions are prevalent. Cluster analysis indicates the existence of six types of psychological contracts, all having different patterns of mutual expectations: instrumental, weak, loyal, unattached, investing and strong psychological contract. To validate the six-cluster solution, we develop cluster profiles based upon individual, job, formal contract and organizational characteristics and further differentiate between the...

Title: The Uncertainty of Knowing: An Analysis of the Nature of Knowledge in a Small                 Business Context
Author-Name: Andrew Atherton
Abstract: Experiencing and coping with uncertainty is common to most small businesses. The knowledge that is generated and applied as a result is a product of and a response to this condition, and so can be considered as knowing in and through practice. A consideration of knowledge as contingent upon unpredictable internal and external factors leads to the identification of multiple types of knowledge-asknowing. As such, knowledge within small businesses can be characterized as contextualized ‘bundles’ of knowing that are shaped by, and in turn shape, the business and the uncertainty of its internal dynamics and external environment.

Title: Work at Leisure and Leisure at Work: A Study of the Emotional Labour of Tour Reps

Abstract: This article explores the work of one particular type of leisure worker: the overseas tour rep. Drawing on theoretical debates, it analyses qualitative observation and interview data collected from tour reps working in Mallorca, Spain for a British budget tour operator. We explore the paradoxes of delivering emotional labour in a job where the boundaries between work and leisure are blurred, and which is both explicitly about delivering fun and also about the ‘dirty work’ of managing holidaymakers’ complaints and excesses. We argue that reps actively seek spaces where they are able to buy into a lifestyle that they see as reflecting their authentic selves. This enables them to accept the negative part of their work and they become disciplined workers.

Title: Managers Doing Leadership: The Extra-Ordinarization of the Mundane

Abstract: Based on a case study of managers in a large, international knowledge-intensive company this article suggests a rethinking of leadership, taking the mundane, almost trivial, aspects of what managers/leaders actually do seriously. In the study, the managers interviewed emphasized the importance of listening and informal chatting. Managers listening to subordinates are assumed to have various positive effects, e.g. people feel more respected, visible and less anonymous, and included in teamwork. Rather than certain acts being significant in themselves, it is their being done by managers that gives them a special, emotional value beyond their everyday significance. Leadership is conceptualized as the extra-ordinarization of the mundane.

Abstract: This study used published arbitration decisions as a data source to explore identifiable behavioral patterns of sexual harassment perpetrators. The results of the multi-method analysis generally supported the need to distinguish between different types of perpetrators and provided the basis for a new typology of sexual harassers. Two dominant themes emerged around the number of targets and the nature of the harassing behavior. Some harassers appear to target a small number of victims persistently, while others appeared to harass any and all targets whenever possible. Whereas some harassers engaged in very sexualized behaviors, others seem to prefer aggressive actions. A discussion of research and managerial implications focuses on the importance of distinguishing between different types of sexual harassers.

Abstract: This study examined the effects of demographic similarity and dissimilarity on perceptions of performance appraisals and reactions to negative feedback. We surveyed a sample of 180 non-supervisory employees from an organization whose members represent over 120 nationalities. Consistent with predictions based on status characteristics theory, employees reacted more favorably to feedback from White managers. An asymmetrical dissimilarity effect was observed in which men reacted more unfavorably to feedback from women. Contrary to predictions based on the similarity–attraction hypothesis, employees reacted more unfavorably to negative feedback from same-race managers. Implications with regard to self-identity threat are discussed as a possible explanation for this phenomenon.

Abstract: As perhaps the highest profile group of management speakers in the world, so-called management gurus use their appearances on the international management lecture circuit todisseminate their ideas and to build their personal reputations with audiences of managers. This article examines the use of humour by management gurus during these public performances. Focusing on video recordings of lectures conducted by four leading management gurus (Tom Peters, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Peter Senge and Gary Hamel), the article explicates the verbal and nonverbal practices that the gurus use when they evoke audience laughter. These practices allow the gurus to project clear message completion points, to signal their humourous intent, to ‘invite’ audience laughter, and to manipulate the relationship between their use of humour and their core ideas and visions. The article concludes by suggesting that the ability of management gurus to use these practices effectively is significant because audience laughter can play an im...

Abstract: This article describes a brand of ‘psychosocial studies’ that adopts a critical attitude towards psychology as a whole, yet remains rooted in an attempt to theorize the ‘psychological subject’. Principles for psychosocial studies work of this kind are discussed, arising out of the actual work of one academic centre within a university department of psychology. These principles are: concern with the human subject as a social entity; interest in the emergence of subjectivity in the social domain; interest in critique, defined as a concern with ideological issues in psychology; methodological pluralism, including an active assertion of the value of qualitative and theoretical research, as well as more traditional quantitative research; theoretical pluralism, including interest in discourses traditionally marginalized in academic psychology (e.g. psychoanalysis, systems theory, feminist theory, phenomenology); interest in inter- and transdisciplinary approaches to psychological theory and research; and intere...

Abstract: Although it is currently common to speak of organizational learning, this notion is still surrounded by conceptual confusion. It is unclear how notions like learning, knowledge and cognitive activities can be applied to organizations. Some authors have tried to unravel the conceptual and ontological problems by giving an account of the role of individuals in organizational learning. However, this has not yet led to an agreed upon analysis. In this article we use structuration theory to overcome the dualism of individual and organization in organizational learning. We support, illustrate and elaborate our structurationist perspective by an ethnographic and historical study of an industrial research laboratory. We show how organizational learning evolves from distributed social practices, creatively realized by knowledgeable individuals, and illustrate how these practices are enabled and constrained by existing structur

Abstract: This article addresses the relative lack of empirical studies of how self-managed teams in high velocity environments handle unexpected critical incidents. It presents an interpretive case study of the LEGO Mindstorms project team, and focuses in particular on how this team responded to three critical incidents. Our study results in three core findings concerning how this team responded to the unexpected in its high velocity environment. These include: the importance of increasing presence; creating a context for a shared and emotionally grounded identity; and developing a shared set of guiding principles for action, behaviour, and decision-making. The authors further describe interconnections among these three core findings, proposing a higher-level ‘virtuous circle’ that illustrates how this team responded effectively to critical incidents.

Abstract: This research applies theoretical propositions from macro-organizational research to the level of task-based work as performed by individual workers. A model, theoretical propositions, and testable hypotheses are developed which relate sociotechnical demand to decisional discretion and worker skill at the task level. Measures of sociotechnical demand are developed for the purpose of this research and the remaining measures of decisional discretion and worker skill are taken from the Functional Job Analysis system. An archival set of 100 tasks from a wide variety of jobs was rated by trained raters on measures of sociotechnical demand, decisional discretion, and worker skill. Analysis of these ratings provided generally good support for our theoretical predictions, with decisional discretion mediating the impact of both technological and social demands on cognitive skill. Complexity of social skill increased exponentially as a function of greater social demand, suggesting some important implications for la...

Title: Studying Composite Boundaries: A Framework of Analysis
Author-Name: Tor Hernes
Abstract: A basic tenet of this article is that the nature of an organization’s or group’s boundaries influences the ability of its members to exert influence on other organizations and groups. The organizations in the study are of different size and form, including an informal group, institutional sub-units, educational institutions and a virtual organization. A framework of interpretation is developed to assist in the distinction between organizations on the basis of their boundary properties. The framework is applied to the setting up and development of a virtual organization. It is used to interpret how three key developments between the organizations were possible due to differences in their respective boundary characteristics. The findings are critiqued and implications are suggested.

Title: The Surface of Organizational Boundaries: A View from Psychoanalytic Object                 Relations Theory
Author-Name: Michael Diamond
Author-Name: Seth Allcorn
Author-Name: Howard Stein
Abstract: Organizational life contains many influences. Among these are its many divisions, sections, departments, professions and groups. The presence of these constituent parts of an organization directs attention to the points at which they connect to each other. Contemporary discussion of the relationship of these parts is confined to exploring organizational boundaries that contain a conceptual concreteness that belies their ultimate experiential significance. We suggest that the notion of boundary may be extended to explore their sensate surfaces that contain primitive, pre-verbal, pre-symbolic, and pre-subjective characteristics. Human beings experience the world as surface-to-surface contact where tactile sensation reveals hardness or softness, warmth or cold, pattern and shape, and most of all a sense at the point of surface-to-surface contact of containment. We suggest that it is within the autistic–contiguous mode of experience that the sensation of organizational boundaries is located and with it the ul...

Title: Boundaries and Role Conflict When Work and Family are Colocated: A                 Communication Network and Symbolic Interaction Approach
Author-Name: Michelle Shumate
Author-Name: Janet Fulk
Abstract: As virtual workplaces and homework programs become more common, workers often find themselves inhabiting multiple worlds and multiple roles simultaneously. For these individuals, boundary transitions are both more frequent and more challenging. This paper expands current theory on work-related boundary transitions by: (1) conceptualizing role conflict in the logic of dynamic communication networks, and (2) reconceptualizing ritual and routine behavior in boundary transitions as not simply aids to mental transitions but also as communicative and symbolic performance that is oriented toward other role senders. Underlying the framework is the concept of time-space paths (Giddens, 1979; Heidegger, 1996) as critical elements of role boundary identification and demarcation. This paper contributes to a better understanding of boundary issues for homeworkers by using a communication framework and emphasizing the agency that homeworkers have to mold others' expectations.

Title: ‘You Can Checkout Anytime, but You Can Never Leave’:                 Spatial Boundaries in a High Commitment Organization
Author-Name: Peter Fleming
Author-Name: AndrÈ Spicer
Abstract: This article suggests that the concept of organizational boundaries evokes a spatial metaphor. While the scant literature exploring the social geography of organizational life has pointed to the powerladen nature of spatiality, it does so only within the workplace. Our article maintains that the very boundary separating the inside from the outside of organizations is an equally important instrument for controlling labour. In light of the permutations that this boundary is currently undergoing, a field study is presented identifying aspects of a culture management programme aimed at significantly reorganizing the meaning of the inside/outside spatial divide among call-centre employees. This entailed a two-way process in which typically ‘private’ spatial practices are drawn into the site of production and organizational norms are encouraged outside work. The implications that these techniques have for employee autonomy are raised as important concerns.

Title: Rituals and Resistance: Membership Dynamics in Professional Fields
Author-Name: Thomas B. Lawrence
Abstract: In this article, the concept of membership is examined from an institutional perspective, focusing on the dynamics of membership in professional fields. It is argued that membership in professional fields is a product of interaction rituals that structure the boundaries of fields, work to distribute power differentially within fields, and consequently engender strategies of resistance on the part of those not privileged by existing conditions. This framework motivates an empirical examination of Canadian public accountants’ membership strategies in the emerging field of environmental audit. Based on this study, a three-part typology of membership strategies in professional fields is proposed: association, stratification, colonization, each of which effects particular sets of interaction rituals, transforms subject positions in the professional field, and depends on specific sets of conditions.

Title: An Analysis of Industrial-Organizational Psychology’s Indifference                to Labor Unions in the United States
Author-Name: Michael J. Zickar
Abstract: Although many writers have bemoaned psychology’s indifference toward labor unions, there has been little critical analysis of why this indifference exists. In this article, several explanations that have been offered to explain this indifference are identified and evaluated. These explanations are: (i) limited access to relevant data; (ii) limited financial rewards;(iii) early psychologists’ attitudes toward unions; and (iv) the failure to appreciate power differences between workers and management. The history of psychology in the US is compared with the history of sociology and economics in order to investigate the viability of these hypotheses. It is concluded that the two crucial reasons for the neglect of labor union issues by applied psychologists are the psychologists’ reluctance to address the presence of conflict between employers and employees and the dearth of early, pro-union psychologists.

Title: Political Decision-Making Climates: Theoretical Processes and Multi-Level Antecedents

Author-Name: Gary Johns
Abstract: This study addressed some of the research gaps in the area of organizational politics by examining politics as a group-level construct, directly testing for the cross-level effects of various predictors, and providing insight into the nature of conflict processes involved in the development of politics. Data from 69 academic departments in six prominent Canadian universities provided support for the precursory role of conflict processes. Both intradepartmental task and relationship conflict were associated with political climate perceptions. Using the climate etiology literature, several multi-level antecedents (individual, departmental, disciplinary) of department-level politics were examined, but only individual-level role conflict emerged as a predictor. The non-significant effects of macro-level paradigm development and department rank heterogeneity are discussed in light of substantive and methodological factors.

Title: Network Development by Means of Network Evaluation? Explorative Insights from                a Case in the Financial Services Industry
Author-Name: Jörg Sydow
Abstract: This article reports on the case of a network of industrial insurance brokers that has been the subject of a longitudinal study over a period of 10 years. Among other things, the development of this network has been observed with respect to when and how it was evaluated, and what effects this evaluation had on the evolution of the network. In this respect, it is one of the very few studies to have investigated evaluation practices in interorganizational networks. The case shows that, on the one hand, ‘reflexive monitoring’ (Giddens) is a common practice and a necessary condition for organizing and managing networks, and, on the other hand, more formal evaluation procedures, which are supportive to network development at some point in time, may not always be possible or even necessary. This insight does not contradict the thesis that we are increasingly moving towards an ‘auditing society’ (Power). However, it highlights questions regarding the general demands for a more or less permanent evaluation of org...

Abstract: Sustainability and sound ecological management of the natural environment, allied to the expanding body of work on managing tacit and explicit knowledge, has led to an increased interest in the contribution which anthropology can make to the practical adaptation of indigenous environmental knowledge and practice to the improvement of organization in western societies. In an exemplary ethnographic study of an indigenous beaver trapper belonging to the Cree Nation, Whiteman and Cooper introduced the concept of ecological embeddedness. Their study could be considered a model that reverses the traditional practice of viewing managers as though they were primitives and applying concepts employed in studying native communities to organizations. They consider indigenous practitioners as managers, identify their management practices, and then reconsider contemporary management practice towards the environment in this light. They argue that to be ecologically embedded as a manager is to identify personally with th...

Title: A Study of the Relationship Between Organizational Commitment            and Human Values in Four Countries

Author-Name: Kenneth M. Short
Abstract: Cross-cultural comparisons of the relationship between human values and both continuance commitment (CC) and affective commitment (AC) are presented using data collected from 1259 nurses from Hungary, Italy, the UK, and USA. That correlations between Schwartz’s (1992) values and both AC and CC will differ between communal and contractual cultures was partially supported. Moreover, certain values correlate more often with AC or CC depending on the culture one is in. Openness to change values accounted for significant variance in AC in Hungary, Italy and the USA. Pan-culturally, openness to change values partially mediated the effects of countries on AC. It is concluded that values likely influence one’s organizational commitment and that the values people endorse might be influenced by national culture.

Title: Psychological Similarity in Work-Based Relationships and the            Development of Self-Efficacy Beliefs
Author-Name: Joe Jaina

Abstract: The subject of work-based relationships as a source of support, feedback and development has centrality in much of the research into management development. Specifically, work dealing with manager/subordinate and peer relationships, as well as more formally defined developmental relationships such as that of the mentor, coach or counsellor, are of interest to the management researcher. This article examines the concept of psychological similarity through shared meanings, in relation to the maintenance and development of self-efficacy beliefs. This examination is carried out through comparative case studies in two very different organizational settings; the corporate and the not-for-profit sector. It was found that in work-based relationships in which the parties are psychologically similar, such relationships are more likely to support the maintenance and development of self-efficacy beliefs.

Title: Blowing the Whistle on Sexual Harassment: Test of a Model of            Predictors and Outcomes
Author-Name: Jeong-Yeon Lee
Author-Name: Sharon Gibson Heilmann
Author-Name: Janet P. Near
Abstract: Earlier research on whistle-blowing in organizations has usually investigated whistle-blowing about wrongdoing of various types, with the possibility that results are influenced by the great variety of types of wrongdoing reported by whistle-blowers. Earlier research on sexual harassment has focused primarily on antecedents of the event and outcomes for the individual only, rather than organizational consequences. In this study we attempted to examine both questions: is sexual harassment different from other forms of organizational wrongdoing in its consequences for whistle-blowers and their organizations, and does examination of the sequential process of whistle-blowing about sexual harassment provide a fuller understanding of consequences as well as antecedents for whistle-blowing generally? Results of LISREL modeling of questionnaire data collected in 1994 from some 13,000 US government employees were similar to findings from earlier studies of organizational wrongdoing and whistle-blowing, where the n...

Author-Name: Nagarajan Ramamoorthy

Abstract: Two-hundred and four blue-collar employees participated in a study in which we tested for the effects of individualism/collectivism (I/C) orientations (solitary work preference, supremacy of individual goals, competitiveness, and self-reliance dimensions) and perceived task interdependence on two employee attitudes: team loyalty and prosocial behavior. We found support for the hypothesis that perceived task interdependence had positive effects on team loyalty and prosocial behavior. Further, solitary work preference, supremacy of individual goals, and self-reliance dimensions of I/C had main effects on loyalty to the team. The supremacy of individual goals dimension of I/C also had a main effect on pro-social behavior. We also found that task interdependence moderated the relationships between solitary work preference and pro-social behavior. The implications of our findings are discussed.

Title: Concepts of Interdisciplinarity: Configurations of Knowledge           and Action
Author-Name: John D. Aram
Abstract: Twelve faculty directors of graduate liberal studies programs primarily in the US were interviewed by recorded telephone conversation in an effort to understand how they define interdisciplinarity, the intellectual aims to which they aspire, and their views about the nature of reality in knowledge development. Classification of their comments reinforces other writers’ observations that scholars differ in the degree to which knowledge integration defines interdisciplinarity and they differ in the degree to which they believe interdisciplinary knowledge is endogenous or exogenous to the university. Based on their views of knowledge integration and the social relevance of knowledge, four types of interdisciplinary scholars are hypothesized. Of additional interest are the perceived functions of interdisciplinary work and the way that these scholars by-pass philosophical debates about the nature of reality in favor of their practices of scholarship. Implications for the nature, meaning, and practice of interdi...

Abstract: In this study the reasons employees perceived for promotions of both themselves and others, and their reactions to those perceptions were examined. Previous research usually ignores (i) the potential antecedents of organizational justice regarding promotions and (ii) justice perceptions’ relations to the treatment of self versus others. Results showed that people consider promotions based on performance fair, whereas they consider non-performance criteria for promotions unfair. Furthermore, perceptions of promotion channels for self and others’ promotions each demonstrated unique prediction of justice, and gender interacted with employee promotion perceptions to predict promotional justice. Discussion focuses on implications regarding (i) similarities and differences in views of self versus others’ outcomes, (ii) equal opportunity, and (iii) future research.

Title: From Outward Bound to Inward Bound’: the Prophetic Voices           and Discursive Practices of Spiritual Management Development
Author-Name: Emma Bell
Author-Name: Scott Taylor
Abstract: This article seeks to identify the theoretical foundations and practical features of spiritual management development (SMD) through social movements which have enabled the diffusion of religious practices into secular life and led to the development of a more spiritualized psychology. Although similarities can be seen with outdoor management development, SMD is distinctive because it encourages subjects to search for meaning in their everyday working life through engagement with an inner self. It thus encourages an internalized, implicit form of religiosity where the search for self-understanding and the search for meaning are closely aligned. Through a recontextualized, critical reading of the idealistic, Utopian visions portrayed by Maslow and Fromm and the spiritual, transpersonal psychologies of Jung and Assagioli, the intellectual foundations from which SMD practice has developed are traced. Analysis of the texts associated with SMD practice illustrates how these discourses are made meaningful to man...

Title: The Transitional Space and Self-Recovery: a Psychoanalytical           Approach to High-Potential Managers’ Training
Author-Name: Maryse Dubouloy
Abstract: In France, more and more high-potential managers seek an additional diploma in management (Executive MBA). They then begin a long (2-year) part-time training programme. As they look for new knowledge in order to obtain that coveted job, they discover that they are involved in process of a self-recovery. Confrontation with other participants, the training methods as a whole, and in particular coaching, help them to discover new possibilities. Usually they have talents and repressed desires that have been hidden for a long time. The training programme actually works as a true transitional space that permits them to abandon their false self, erected as protection against a threatening environment. Few of them will be CEOs. However, the others will be able to choose their careers according to who they are, and not according to what they are asked to be.

Title: Powerlessness and Impossibility in Special Education: a Qualitative           Study on Professional Burnout from a Lacanian Perspective
Author-Name: Stijn Vanheule
Author-Name: Paul Verhaeghe
Abstract: This article describes how experiences of professional burnout and difficulty in the job are linked to people’s expectations concerning the outcomes they aim to realize. Based on a random sample of respondents to a burnout questionnaire, two groups of special educators were interviewed. The interview data are interpreted taking Lacanian psychoanalytic theory about how people deal with their subjective lack as a point of departure. We conclude that burnt out people can be characterized by their imaginary stance towards outcomes (they cherish clear images of the products of their efforts, feel powerless, tend to fuse with the other, have the impression that the other is taking advantage of them and feel unable to speak freely). By contrast, the group with a low burnout score can be typified by their symbolic distance towards their job experiences and outcomes (they support the other in the process of realizing outcomes, feel impossibility, react with creativity and speak freely).

Abstract: Numerous studies that have demonstrated interaction effects between individual and contextual factors suggest the potential positive effect of congruent personal and environmental characteristics on creativity. None of the prior studies, however, has explicitly and systematically tested the formal theory of person–environment fit in the context of creativity. This study examined the effects of two versions of person–environment fit (supplies–values and demands–abilities fit) on creative behavior and context satisfaction. The results, based on longitudinal data collected from management students and their instructors, showed that creative behavior was almost exclusively predicted by personal characteristics (desire for creative climate, actual creative abilities), whereas context satisfaction was strongly influenced by environmental characteristics (current creative climate, required creative abilities). The present results indicate a potential division of roles between personal and environmental character...

Author-Name: David Collins
Abstract: This article assesses the merits of analyses that have called for a more developed and constructive engagement with the management advice industry. It argues that attempts to reconstitute academic interest in the advice industry will do little to improve our appreciation of the complex and mediated nature of management advice so long as these (i) remain tied to a debunking agenda and (ii) focus exclusively on the production of advice. Accordingly, the article refocuses attention on the consumption of management knowledge and on the users of advice. Directing attention to the users of recipes and cookbooks the article argues that a more constructive relationship with management practitioners awaits those who can conceive of the reasons, circumstances and processes that might translate business process reengineering (BPR) into total quality management (TQM) and ‘brandy butter’ into ‘vodka margarine’.

Abstract: Previous studies of social systems have shown that organizations develop mechanisms to defend against anxiety inherent in the system. This article uses field theory, systems psychodynamics and a participant observer methodology to examine certain defenses that became activated within a US commercial airline in the post-11 September 2001 period. In particular, it analyzes forces affecting the event of arming pilots with handguns at work. This article’s central claim is that pilots’ desire to be armed resulted from a combination of external and internal pressures, personal valencies and work life changes.

Title: Bridging the Micro–Macro Divide: A New Basis for Social Science
Author-Name: Chris Goldspink
Author-Name: Robert Kay
Abstract: A ‘pervasive’ problem in the social sciences, referred to as the ‘micro to macro problem’ concerns our capacity to explain the relationship between the constitutive elements of social systems (people) and emergent phenomena resulting from their interaction (i.e. organizations, societies, economies). Without a capacity to explain this relationship there is, in effect, no substantive theory of sociality. In this article, we explore the potential of a synthesis between autopoietic and complexity theory for understanding social systems in a way that addresses this issue. It is argued that autopoietic theory provides a basis for understanding the characteristics of the microlevel agents that make up social systems – human individuals, whereas complexity theory provides a basis for understanding how these characteristics influence the range and type of macro-level phenomena that arise from their interaction. The synthesis proposed here provides the basis for a theory of sociality that deals consistently with th...

Abstract: This article attempts to reflect critically on the extent to which the discourses, techniques and imperatives associated with the management of work organizations are increasingly colonizing the everyday sphere of human communication and sense-making.

It then proceeds, drawing on recent research involving a critical analysis of post-Excellence management books, to map out the discourse commonly encountered in such texts before going on to explore the presence of a notably similar discourse appearing within contemporary cultural resources such as self-help manuals and, more notably, lifestyle magazines. It is then argued that such texts constitute a material signifier of what is an ongoing managerialist colonization of...

Title: Measuring Nothing: The Case of the Greek National Health System
Author-Name: Apostolos A. Ballas
Author-Name: Haridimos Tsoukas
Abstract: Several critical studies in accounting have approached the introduction of accounting systems in the public sector in terms of enforcing and sustaining competition-based resource allocation mechanisms. In this study, we reverse the question and ask: why has accounting not been used in certain public bureaucracies as much as it might? We investigate the extent to which accounting systems have been used in the management of the Greek National Health System (ESY) and find that accounting has played a marginal role in its development. Attempting to explain this puzzling feature we first note and then contrast the main underlying features of accounting systems with those of the Greek political system in general, and ESY in particular. Briefly, our explanation is that the historically high politicization that has characterized the Greek political system has tended to over-shadow the economic-cum-managerial dimension of running public bureaucracies, favouring overtly political evaluation criteria of organization...

Title: The Culture of Objectivity: Quantification, Uncertainty, and the Evaluation                 of Risk at NASA
Author-Name: Steven P. Feldman
Abstract: For over three decades social studies of science have investigated ‘objectivity’ as a central, socially constructed assumption in scientific and engineering work. This literature has seldom been utilized in the study of organizations despite the fact that knowledge production and knowledge use in scientific and engineering organizations are presumed to be objective or independent of individual and social influences. In this article, the social studies of science literature as it conceptualizes and understands objectivity is reviewed. An analysis of the data on decision-making at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) during the years preceding the explosion of Challenger is carried out using concepts from this literature. Data on decision-making at NASA during the years preceding the explosion of Columbia are also analyzed. It is shown that the culture of objectivity at NASA interacted with time pressures to produce a misunderstanding of flight risk. This misunderstanding resulted from t...

Title: Getting the Measure of Emotion - and the Cautionary Tale of Emotional Intelligence
Author-Name: Stephen Fineman
Abstract: This article examines critically the recent growth of emotion measurement in organizational behaviour. The epistemological and phenomenological consequences of psychometrically ‘boxing’ emotion are, it is argued, problematic and restrictive. This may be seen in the power and professional prestige it affords to the measurers and in the consequences to those classified by measurement. This is particularly so when an emotion is presented as key to personal or organizational success. Emotional intelligence is a strong illustration of these issues, where ‘experts’ ascribe positive value to people with high emotional intelligence quotients (EQ), and low EQs are regarded as suitable cases for training. How can emotion be ‘known’, other than through measurement and numbers? The article suggests some different approaches towards researching an important, but enigmatic, concept.

Title: Measuring the Unmeasured: An Institutional Entrepreneur Strategy in an                 Emerging Industry
Author-Name: Frédérique Déjean
Author-Name: Jean-Pascal Gond
Author-Name: Bernard Leca
Abstract: The organizational literature on emerging industries has emphasized the need for institutional entrepreneurs - actors who give the new activity legitimacy and determine its patterns of behaviour. However, little empirical research has been carried out on the strategies that institutional entrepreneurs employ in order to achieve legitimacy for their activity. In this article, we suggest that an institutional entrepreneur can use the development of measurement tools as a strategy to develop its own legitimacy and power. By looking at a French entrepreneurial company’s development of tools to measure corporate social performance, we analyse how measurement tools influence the legitimacy of an industry and the systemic power within it. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for research into measurement tools in the areas of management or business and society.

Title: Counting, Control and Calculation: Reflections on Measuring and Management
Author-Name: Michael Power
Abstract: This article explores fundamental issues in performance measurement systems broadly conceived. Three key moments or themes are identified. First, the foundations of measurement in counting practices, and their inherent reductionism, are considered. Second, the relations between measurement and technologies of monitoring and control, such as auditing, are discussed. Third, first- and second-order measurement (meta-measurement) are distinguished, respectively as particular institutions of counting and data production, and as related dense networks of calculating experts operating on these numbers within specific cultures of objectivity. Finally, arguments about the consequences of performance measurement systems are evaluated, contrasting democratic enthusiasm for performance measurement control technologies with the view that they are some kind of ‘fatal remedy’. In place of a simple dichotomy of trust or distrust in numbers, the development of performance measurement instruments is argued to be a cycle of...

Title: Social Power, Social Status and Perceptual Similarity of Workplace Victimization: A Social Network Analysis of Stratification
Author-Name: Kai Lamertz
Author-Name: Karl Aquino
Abstract: This article develops and tests a comprehensive social structural model of social power and status effects on victimization in organizations. Victimization focuses on the extent to which individuals perceive themselves to be the target of negative or aggressive behaviors by others. The conceptual framework elucidates how formal and informal status differences associated with access to social powers in three different social networks are related to victimization perceptions. Using dyads as the unit of analysis in a sample of government employees, we find that asymmetric relationships between two actors in the friendship and advice networks, and structural equivalence in the advice and dislike networks are associated with perceptual agreement. The results suggest that stratification in a social system may create the context in which victimization thrives because it affects access to informal forms of social power.

Abstract: This study focuses on the crossover of state anxiety between spouses in working couplesin Israel when one of them faces unemployment. We assessed state anxiety, financial hardship and social support for both spouses at two points in time. Participants were 113 unemployed people who came to the Academics Employment Exchange to apply for the ‘unemployment grant’. They and their spouses completed questionnaires at the beginning (wave 1) and end (wave 2) of the 2-month period for which they were entitled to the ‘unemployment grant’. Findings demonstrate that on both occasions, the economic hardship was a positive predictor of anxiety for both the unemployed and their spouses and social support was inversely related to their anxiety. Furthermore, there was a significant bidirectional crossover effect of state anxiety from the unemployed to the spouse and from the spouse to the unemployed at both waves after controlling for all relevant variables. We concluded that prevention programs dealing with the unemploye...

Title: Kindling Activism? Union Commitment and Participation in the UK Fire Service
Author-Name: Tom Redman
Author-Name: Ed Snape
Abstract: Using survey data from a UK fire service, this article examines the antecedents of members’ intent to participate in their union. The authors identify three dimensions of intent to participate – in rankandfile activities, in militant activitiesand in standing for union office. Affective union commitment is the main direct determinant of all three. Affective union commitment itself reflects solidaristic prounion beliefs and instrumental union commitment, providing some support for interactionist and rational choice theories. There is also evidence of frustration–aggression effects, with perceived industrial relations climate and pay equity having negative direct effects on intent to participate. Perceived industrial relations climate moderates none of these relationships. Implications for union strategy and renewal are discussed.

Title: For Queen and Country? National Frames of Reference in the Talk of Soldiers in England
Author-Name: Stephen Gibson
Author-Name: Jackie Abell
Abstract: Social scientists frequently use the iconic figure of the soldier who fights and dies for the nation to exemplify the power of processes of national identification. However, little work has considered how soldiers themselves orient to the possibility of being motivated by a desire to ‘serve the country’. The present study explored this through a series of interviews with members of the British Army and Territorial Army. Although in explicit talk about ‘the country’ the soldiers typically downplayed the importance of ‘serving the country’ as motivation, in discussing the prospect of a European army the national basis of armies was taken for granted. The findings are discussed in terms of the problematic nature of displays of English ‘patriotism’ or ‘pride’. It is argued that the relationship between national identity and military service, often assumed to be straightforward in social scientific texts, is oriented to as a delicate issue by soldiers themselves.

Title: Yabba-Dabba-Doo! Evolutionary Psychology and the Rise of Flintstone Psychological Thinking in Organization and Management Studies
Author-Name: Graham Sewell
Abstract: Seven years have passed since Nigel Nicholson published his manifesto for evolutionary psychology (EP) in Human Relations. Given EP’s continued popularity, this article undertakes a timely reappraisal of its assumptions and practical implications. In particular, it assesses EP’s claim to unify the social and natural sciences by establishing a foundation for psychology in the evolutionary biological sciences. I demonstrate that EP is found wanting in both these areas: it cannot satisfy the rigorous demands of experimental evolutionary biology and does not deal well with some of the key problems faced by mainstream psychologists. As a result, EP’s claims as they pertain to management and organizations are speculative and highly normative, despite vigorous protestations to the contrary.

Title: Expatriation as a Maturation Opportunity: A Psychoanalytical Approach Based on ‘Copy and Paste’
Author-Name: Jean-Luc Cerdin
Author-Name: Maryse Dubouloy
Abstract: In order to understand the success of an expatriation, the traditional approach generally focuses on theoretical models of the expatriate’s adjustment. The psychoanalytical approach seems more powerful in that it sheds light on the significant changes in the individual’s perception of himself and of his environment brought about by the experience of expatriation. In the psychoanalytical approach developed in this article, expatriation may be seen as a maturation opportunity for the individual. The concept of transitional space helps us to understand how people move from ‘copy and cut’ to ‘copy and paste’. Moving from copy to paste is a necessary stage to achieve autonomy. Using the psychoanalytical approach throws light on and reinforces the discoveries presented in the traditional approach literature. An empirical study allows us to confront our theoretical approach to individuals’ factual experiences of expatriation. Implications for both organizations and individuals are presented, in particular, the s...

Title: Poles and Germans: An International Business Relationship

Abstract: In this article, we aim to identify and explain how Polish managers, in the Polish affiliates of German companies, view their German partners. The theoretical background for this article comes from the field of social anthropology. The empirical data were collected during face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with executives in Poland. The findings presented here are the result of qualitative analysis. We argue that the Polish/German contrast, as perceived by Polish managers, bears a strong resemblance to other core/periphery ethnic relationships in Europe. Parallels are drawn from the British Isles. We argue that the characterizations discussed play an important role in allowing managers to understand their business roles and capabilities within an international business context. A major shortcoming in international business research is the poor understanding of these ingrained attitudes. Our study aims to fill this gap.

Title: Evaluating Appreciative Inquiry: A Relational Constructionist Perspective
Author-Name: Dorieke van der Haar
Author-Name: Dian Marie Hosking
Abstract: Appreciative inquiry (AI) has become increasingly popular as a social constructionist approach to organizational change and development. Many claims are made about its status and value but there are few published evaluation studies. Furthermore, some interesting and important issues arise as to how AI can be evaluated appropriately – given its social constructionist context. The heart of our argument is that AI could appropriately and usefully be evaluated using the approach of ‘responsive evaluation’. We lay out our views by putting forward a particular, relational, narrative of social construction processes. We then draw upon this relational narrative to develop three themes. One theme is that both AI and social constructionism should be viewed as variable social constructions and not fixed ‘things’. This means that AI manifests in many different ways in different local-cultural and local-historical contexts. 1 A related theme is that, if theory and method co-define one another, then AI is much more tha...

Author-Name: Summer Jaber-Massarwa
Abstract: This study analyzes a dialogue process aimed at building relationships between Jews and Palestinians in Israel using an innovative research approach of following the story of the encounter. It attempts to explore whether such dialogue groups are able, in practice, to actually get away from the unbalanced political–structural conditions of the conflict between them. Usually we try to learn about such processes through successful ‘good enough’ encounters. This study takes the opposite position of looking at what we can learn from an unsuccessful encounter: A ‘bad enough’ one. Analysis of the dynamics that evolved in this dialogue shows the different tactics that were used by two Jewish-Israeli students to control the dialogue and emphasize themes of ‘togetherness’, ‘we want quiet’ and ‘we are all human beings’. We follow the futile attempts made by both other Jewish and Palestinian participants to counter these control attempts and to center the discussion on national identity and conflict. Finally, we disc...

Title: Managerial elites making rhetorical and linguistic                 ‘moves’ for a moving (emotional) display
Author-Name: Dalvir Samra-Fredericks
Abstract: This article contributes to sociological studies of emotions in organizations. It resides upon an innovative move to extend the ethnographic approach to include audio-recording, in this case managerial elites’ naturally occurring interactions, to provide the basis for an ‘empirical filling out’ of emotions research. Furthermore, theoretically to develop this field in ways that encompass the simultaneous speaking of emotionality and rationality, Nash’s account of rhetoric as emotion is drawn upon. In particular, the four discursive constituents which orators are said to need for ‘moving an audience’ are deployed to analytically trace how elites intertwine emotional expressiveness and a rhetoric of rationality to influence management/strategic processes. These four constituents are empathetic matter/great theme, stance, utterance design (taxis) and utterance relation (lexis). Three brief transcribed extracts of elites-at-talk are reproduced from one ethnography to illustrate the scope of a fine-grained anal...

Title: Defined by our strategy or our culture? Hierarchical differences in                 perceptions of organizational identity and change
Author-Name: Kevin G. Corley
Abstract: While theory and research have identified the possibility for multiple organizational identities to exist within an organization, there is little empirical evidence on how differentiation occurs or what its implications are for the organization. In the course of inductively studying an organizational spin-off, evidence of identity differentiation based on hierarchy level emerged in interview-, documentation-, and observation-based data. Higher levels of the hierarchy tended to see identity in light of the organization’s strategy, whereas lower aspects of the hierarchy saw it in relation to the organization’s culture. This identity differentiation was evident in marked differences in the perceptions organizational members had about: (i) the nature of organizational identity; (ii) the most salient identity-based discrepancies; (iii) the basis for organizational identity change; and (iv) how identity change can be implemented. After examining how and why this hierarchical differentiation occurred, I discuss ...

Abstract: Those engaged in conducting qualitative research frequently acknowledge the presence of contradiction in their data. However, within the organization studies literature little attention is paid to teasing out these contradictions and subjecting them to critical analysis. This article advances our knowledge of contradiction in accounts of organizational life. Drawing on new empirical evidence from a qualitative interview study of employees working in a large blue-chip corporation, we critically assess a number of instances of contradiction or ‘doublethink’ within this particular organizational setting. We challenge the assumption underpinning much of the existing literature that individuals are uncomfortable with contradiction and seek to resolve it whenever it arises. We argue that doublethink provides a means of containing contradiction such that it is neither acknowledged as contradiction nor experienced as uncomfortable. We consider the findings in relation to notions of role positions which reflect/co...

Abstract: Research indicates that job satisfaction is significantly related to life satisfaction. However, previous studies have not included variables that may confound the relationship. Furthermore, the vast majority of studies have relied on cross-sectional data. I tested a comprehensive model that examined the relationship between job and life satisfaction and a broad personality construct called ‘core self-evaluations’, as well as nonwork satisfaction and environmental variables, using a nationally representative (US), longitudinal data set. Results indicated that core self-evaluations was significantly related to both job satisfaction and life satisfaction over time, and that the relationship between job satisfaction and life satisfaction was not significant after taking into account the effects of core self-evaluations and nonwork satisfaction. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to deepen our understanding of the period during which a disaster unfolds, here called the ‘critical period’. Previous research has shown cases in which sense-making is essential for survival during this period, but it is argued here that there are other cases in which sense-making compounds the problems. Drawing on psychoanalytic theory, the capacity for anxiety toleration is postulated as a moderating variable that influences whether correct sense can be made of the situation, and, in turn, whether the likelihood of survival will increase. Implications for theory are examined.

The analysis contributes to research on the role of teams in organizational disasters by considering team learning and development as the basis for success in complex and changing organizations. Multiple qualitative methods reveal three precursors associated with the breakdown of learning in teams: narrowly defined purpose, directive leadership and failure to sense an ill-defined problem. Findings have implications for normal disasters and sense-making, performance in short-term project teams, and organizational learning.

Title: Conceptualizing organizational discourse as situated symbolic action
Author-Name: Loizos Heracleous
Author-Name: Robert J. Marshak
Abstract: This article presents a conceptualization of organizational discourse as situated symbolic action, drawing from the fields of speech act theory, rhetoric, ethnography of communication and social constructionism. This conceptualization is illustrated through analysis of an episode of negotiated order accessed through an organization development intervention; a meeting of senior managers of Systech, a major IT organization, to decide on a new business model. This perspective helps to respond to some of the key challenges facing the organizational discourse field in terms of developing more clearly specified conceptualizations of discourse suited to the organizational level of analysis, achieving a more holistic and discourse-sensitive understanding of empirical contexts by organizational researchers, and illustrating that organizational discourse analysis is not simply an intellectual luxury but can have pragmatic, relevant implications.

Abstract: It has been argued that organizational life typically contains paradoxical situations such as efforts to manage change which nonetheless seem to reinforce inertia. Four logical options for coping with paradox have been explicated, three of which seek resolution and one of which ‘keeps the paradox open’. The purpose of this article is to explore the potential for managerial action where the paradox is held open through the use of theory on ‘serious playfulness’. Our argument is that paradoxes, as intrinsic features in organizational life, cannot always be resolved through cognitive processes. What may be possible, however, is that such paradoxes are transformed, or ‘moved on’ through action and as a result the overall change effort need not be stalled by the existence of embedded paradoxes.

Author-Name: Robert A. Giacalone
Author-Name: Carole L. Jurkiewicz
Abstract: The postmaterialist values paradigm has long argued whether materialist and postmaterialist values are opposite ends of a single continuum or two values on separate continua, ignoring the possibility that these values are interactive as well. In two studies, using a strong inference approach, we tested whether a previously unexplored interactive formulation of the materialism-postmaterialism relationship explained more variance than Inglehart’s unidimensional or a bidimensional conceptualization. Using a revised materialism-postmaterialism scale (R-MPMI), we assess the individual and interactive utility of these values in predicting dimensions of personal and social identity (DPSI), key correlates of Inglehart’s postmaterialist theory. Results indicate that the interactive conceptualization explains more variance of DPSI. The findings suggest that a restructuring of the conceptualization of postmaterialism is necessary, and a rubric toward that end is discussed.

Author-Name: Huw T.O. Davies
Abstract: While there is emerging evidence to suggest that (organizational) culture can affect the performance and quality of health services, little attention has been directed at how these relationships might be mediated, facilitated or attenuated by aspects of service design (i.e. those arrangements that combine facilities, staff and service users in the co-production of care). Using two case studies set in mental health services, this article explores how both culture and performance may be viewed as emergent properties of service design configurations. Thus central to ideas of service re-design should be notions of service users as the co-producers (with staff) of both organizational culture and organizational performance, as well as a clearer understanding of how such co-production processes are modulated by specific design configurations.

Title: Reversing a conspicuous absence: Mindful inclusion of emotion in                 structuration theory
Author-Name: Jamie L. Callahan
Abstract: As the concept of emotion in organizations gains popularity in both research and practice, the danger of atheoretical application grows. Scholars of emotion in organizations have begun to refer to Giddens’ (1979) structuration theory as potentially relevant for the phenomenon of emotion. This article demonstrates how existing research on emotion can be framed in the context of emotion structuration that depicts how emotions both structure and are structured by social systems. Unlike Giddens’ structuration theory, which does not address the role of emotion in social systems and structures, emotion structuration explicitly focuses on emotion. Essentially, emotion structuration is an attempt to reframe Giddens’ work to describe the process of how emotions and social contexts interact and, as a result, modify each other.

Title: Conceptualizing social science paradoxes using the diversity and similarity                 curves model: Illustrations from the work/play and theory novelty/continuity paradoxes
Author-Name: Joseph Ofori-Dankwa
Author-Name: Scott D. Julian
Abstract: A major challenge that social science researchers face is the development of a framework that conceptualizes paradoxical concepts across different social science disciplines. We propose that researchers use the logic of the diversity and similarity curves (DSC) model to meet this need by conceptualizing the tension, reinforcing cycles, and paradox management elements of Lewis (Academy of Management Review, 2000, 25, 760-76). We further make a contribution to the paradox literature by highlighting and representing the interwoven nature of dual tensions that exist within paradoxical phenomena. We use the DSC model to capture the interactive effects of dual paradoxes associated with work/play and job stress/task creativity. The DSC model also allows us to represent the interactive effects of different permutations of theory novelty/continuity on perceived theory complexity and theory assimilation. Finally, we discuss the implications of this article for theory and research on paradox conceptualization.

Title: Explaining the process of innovation: The dynamic reconciliation of action                 and structure
Author-Name: Shih-Chang Hung
Abstract: Problems of action and structure underpin key issues in research on innovation processes. The question of entrepreneurial activity is an enduring one, from the risk-taking actor debate right through to recent discussions of strategic leadership and new venturing for wealth creation. But we can also detect deterministic tendencies in those arguments that find innovation activity defined by the sector’s institutionalized regime or paradigm. To this extent, concern for the reconciliation of action and structure has been particularly neglected. Drawing on insights from structuration theory, institutionalism and resource dependence, this article develops a new model that attempts to reconcile the action-structure dichotomy in the innovation process in industry. The article concludes by considering the implications of this model for issues of life cycle effects, technology strategy and systems of innovation.

Title: Time in careers - careers in time
Author-Name: Lotte Bailyn
Abstract: This article deals first with the temporal patterns of everyday career activities - time in careers - and then with the life-long career line - careers in time. In the former, it introduces the concept of grandmother time and uses telecommuting as an example. In the latter, it builds on the concept of a life-stage responsive career and uses the academic career as an example. The article argues that the accepted notions of time in both daily activities and the life course need serious modification if people are to be productive in the public professional-occupational world as well as in the private world of family and community.

Title: Careering alone: Careers and social capital in the financial services and                 television industries
Author-Name: Sue Tempest

Author-Name: Ken Starkey
Abstract: The relationship between career and social capital is an important but relatively unexplored research topic. In this article, we draw on the literatures on social capital and careers, and on empirical studies of the shifting nature of careers in financial services and television production firms, to argue that, in labour markets where key skills are in short supply, the concept of social capital constitutes a rich resource for understanding the implications of changing forms of organization. We argue that social capital has a particularly important impact on an organization’s ability to leverage knowledge and is, thus, of strategic significance. The ability to manage social capital might, therefore, prove to be a major management competence. Use of the social capital concept gives us an important insight into the changing nature of careers and organizations.

Title: Target-based team working: Groups, work and interdependence in the UK civil service
Author-Name: Stephen Procter
Author-Name: Graeme Currie
Abstract: In terms of its implications for work and production, studies of teamworking have generally relied on concepts of autonomy and flexibility. An in-depth, qualitative case study of the UK Inland Revenue reveals a form of teamworking in which both autonomy and flexibility play little part. It is argued that teamworking in this case is best conceptualized by giving greater weight to interdependence. In particular, teamworking in the Inland Revenue works through the outcome interdependence engendered by the emphasis on the team’s work targets. This form of teamworking is given the name ‘target-based teamworking’. Certain aspects of the nature of production appear to encourage this form of teamworking. More generally, the case promotes interdependence as a means of understanding teamworking, and suggests that the key to this understanding is an analysis of the relationship between interdependence and autonomy.

Title: Defining the ‘public’ in a public healthcare system
Author-Name: Damien Contandriopoulos
Author-Name: Jean-Louis Denis
Author-Name: Ann Langley
Abstract: Using data from a larger study on public participation in the Quebec healthcare system, we draw on the sociological theory of Bourdieu to analyze speakers’ in-use definition of ‘the public’ in some 100 interview and observation notes. We found that the definition of ‘the public’ is the subject of a vigorous struggle at the symbolic level. Many actors share a common, but often conflicting, interest in the elaboration and objectification of a given definition of ‘the public’ because their legitimacy is strongly related to their ability to be perceived either as representing the ‘public’ will or as acting in the ‘public’s’ interest. Building upon the categorizations used in the discourses, we are also able to draw a picture of each group of actors’ positions and strategies in this struggle. This picture reveals how the claim to directly represent the public’s ‘will’ is closely related to actors’ lack of formal power to influence decision-making in the system. We then use these observations to discuss the rol...

Title: Playing the grim reaper: How employees experience carrying out a downsizing
Author-Name: Judith A. Clair
Author-Name: Ronald L. Dufresne
Abstract: This article reports a qualitative study that explores how employees who are responsible for carrying out a downsizing - ‘downsizing agents’ - experience and react to their downsizing responsibilities. Our results demonstrate that, when the work of carrying out a downsizing becomes emotionally taxing, downsizing agents react by cognitively, emotionally, and physically distancing themselves from their roles. We explore forces that make carrying out a downsizing more taxing and the conditions under which distancing reactions become more likely.

Title: Nursing on the line: Experiences from England and Quebec (Canada)
Author-Name: Caroline Collin-Jacques
Author-Name: Chris Smith
Abstract: Some industries, like telecommunications, finance and retail, have been operating call centres for several years and there has been growing academic interest in exploring the work experience of employees taking calls and answering telephone queries assisted by computers. Nurses who staff telephone centres in the healthcare industry are different from their counterparts in other fields. These are highly qualified workers with a strong occupational identity and distinct spheres of competence. However, occupation is not a constant as a mediator of technology and it is argued that the extent to which nurses were able to shape their call centre work differed cross-nationally owing to the simultaneous interplay of different societal constructions of nursing and the national-historical development of tele-health centres. This article uses cross-national qualitative case study research to examine the different effects of occupation, nation and timing of industry formation on the design and experience of call cent...

Title: The relationships of national gender equality and organizational support with                 work-family balance: A study of European managers
Author-Name: Karen S. Lyness
Author-Name: Marcia Brumit Kropf
Abstract: Most prior research about employees’ work-family balance has examined relationships to organizational characteristics or individual characteristics, but ignored the larger national context in which these relationships occur. We developed a model suggesting that the degree of national gender equality is an important contextual variable that is positively related to organizational work-family supports (i.e. supportive work-family culture and flexible work arrangements), which are in turn related to individual managers’ balance of their work and family responsibilities. We tested the model using survey responses from 505 managers and professionals from 20 European countries and United Nations’ Gender Development Index scores of national gender equality for their countries, and found some support for the predicted relationships. These results highlight the importance of considering the larger context, and especially a nation’s standing in terms of its gender equality, for understanding work-family balance.

Title: The future of the business school: Knowledge challenges and opportunities
Author-Name: Ken Starkey

Abstract: Despite its importance, there is relatively little serious academic research into the business school. This article sets out to stimulate debate that will fill this gap. We review the origins and evolution of the business school and debates about management research and teaching in terms of ideals and practice. Increasingly, the role of the business school is being questioned but much of this debate looks at the business school in isolation from changes in the wider university sector. We situate our analysis within the broader context of debates about the university as a privileged knowledge space. We conclude by suggesting that the future of the business school can best be discussed in terms of changes in knowledge production and that the business school has the opportunity to position itself as a unique site of knowledge generation and diffusion.

Title: Things fall apart? Discourses on agency and change in organizations
Author-Name: Raymond Caldwell
Abstract: The history of the concept of ‘agency’ in organizational theory over the last 50 years makes dismal reading. From a position of unbounded optimism that organizational change could be managed as a rational or planned process with a transparent agenda, we now confront restructured workplaces characterized by new forms of flexibility, hypercomplexity and chaos in which the nature, sources and consequences of change interventions have become fundamentally problematic. How did this occur and what implications does it have for our understanding of agency and change in organizations? Should we assume that rationalist concepts of centred agency are no longer viable, or should we welcome the plural and promising new forms of decentred agency emerging within organizations? This article presents a selective interdisciplinary history of competing disciplinary discourses on agency and change in organizations, classified into rationalist, contextualist, dispersalist and constructionist discourses. Although the four dis...

Title: Sound from silence: On listening in organizational learning
Author-Name: Claus Jacobs
Author-Name: David Coghlan
Abstract: One of the central challenges for organizational learning at an intersubjective level has been proposed in terms of developing a shared language as a prerequisite for shared understanding in a community. In this respect, social learning theory suggests communities of practice as loci, and discourse as the medium of such learning. Rather than knowledge acquisition, social learning refers to identity formation through competent participation in a discursive practice. Listening as a central, yet so far neglected, element of discursive practice involves the constitution of a relational basis that allows for intersubjective meaning generation. We suggest listening as a condition for the possibility of social learning and illustrate our suggestion with an empirical case. We discuss the implications of our argument for organizational and social learning as well as its broader relevance.

Author-Name: David Greatbatch
Abstract: NHS Direct is a relatively new, nurse-based, 24-hour health advice line run as part of the UK’s National Health Service (NHS). The service delivers health advice remotely via the telephone. A central aspect of the service is the attempt to provide a standard level of health advice regardless of time, space or the background of the nurse. At the heart of this attempt is an innovative health software called CLINICAL ASSESSMENT SYSTEM (CAS). Using a number of qualitative methods, this article highlights how the interaction between the nursing staff and this technology is key to the service. The technology is based on management’s attempt to standardize and control the caller-nurse relationship. Thus the software can be seen as part of an abstract rationality, whereas how it is deployed by nurses is based on a practical rationality that places practice and experience first and sees the technology and protocols as tools.

Title: The concrete particulars of the everyday realities of street children
Author-Name: Jan Grundling
Author-Name: Irma Grundling
Abstract: The problem of street children in Namibia corresponds with that seen in other Third World countries where the economic and socioeconomic climate favours unemployment and poverty, resulting in cultural degeneration and desperate antisocial behavioural patterns. An example of this phenomenon is the growing numbers of street children who are not an integral part of a family, supportive neighbourhood or healthy surroundings. A recovery plan based on the concrete particulars of the everyday realities of these children is urgently required to reverse the situation. It demands a clear understanding of the problem within the specific context of Namibia. This article describes the general characteristics, behavioural patterns and causes of the phenomenon in order to enable the government to prevent, manage and provide an efficient service to households in Namibia so as to defuse and respond to those factors contributing to children living on the streets.

Abstract: This study examined the effects of sex and sex dissimilarity on the task and social experiences of members of ongoing teams of management students. We hypothesized that women would have lower levels of social exchange, and ultimately, lower levels of attachment to their groups than would men, and that there would be no sex differences in task exchanges or task contributions. Sex dissimilarity between individuals and their teams was expected to impair individuals’ experiences. As predicted, women had lower social exchanges than men. There were no sex differences in attachment. Surprisingly, women had higher task exchanges and made greater task contributions. Sex dissimilarity had no effect on the experiences of men or women. Overall, women seemed to do more work or better work, but receive less social support, than did men.

Title: Rational or demoralized responses to work restructuring in Hong Kong?
Author-Name: Chau-kiu Cheung
Abstract: Owing to the paucity of data demonstrating workers’ reactions to work restructuring, the study examines possible reactions in terms of job performance, attendance at training, and voicing of discontent. It predicts the effects of work restructuring and background characteristics with reference to the exit-voice-loyalty model and demoralization theory. A telephone survey of a random sample of households collected data from 1176 workers in Hong Kong. Supportive of the demoralization theory, work restructuring over the previous past year appeared to reduce workers’ intended job performance, attendance at training, and voicing of discontent. These findings hold for workers with various characteristics and restructuring in work outcomes, work processes, and staffing. Demoralization theory offers a reasonable explanation of the findings regarding the negative effects of work restructuring. In addition, income and social class have profound influences on workers’ reactions.

Title: Subtextual gendering processes: A study of Japanese retail firms in Hong Kong
Author-Name: May M.L. Wong
Abstract: This study examined equal opportunities for women employees in two Japanese-owned retail companies (Tairo and Okadaya) in Hong Kong. This article initially discusses the various explanations for gender inequality put forward by scholars. Since equal opportunities legislation - specifically the Sex Discrimination Ordinance (SDO) - was introduced in Hong Kong in 1996, little research has been able to explain why gender inequality persists. The issue can alternatively be understood by examining the subtextual gendering processes. Concealed gendering processes (re)produce gender inequality based on hegemonic power, through structural, cultural, interaction and identity arrangements. Accounts of female staff at various hierarchies reveal that they are subject to these organizational and individual arrangements to various extents under the cover of SDO, which it was claimed, the companies implemented.

Abstract: This article draws on a product innovation perspective to explore the process of knowledge commodification. It is argued that key suppliers of management knowledge do not particularly regard this process as unproblematic. Using interviews with management consultants, this study provides an understanding of the internal elements that may inhibit or encourage the development of new knowledge products. Exploratory results reveal several major impediments to linking commodification efforts with the consultancy and suggest the importance of internal legitimation efforts before market launch. The findings indicate the importance of considering the process in which management ideas gain ‘good currency’ within the system of knowledge supply. This has some notable implications for research on knowledge commodification and management fashion.

Abstract: Contrary to current definitions of diversity as a set of a priori sociodemographic characteristics, this study re-conceptualizes diversity as an organizational product. Through the analysis of qualitative data from four service organizations, we show that organization-specific understandings of diversity are based on the way employees’ sociodemographic differences affect the organization of work, either contributing to it or hampering it. Such understandings of diversity, in turn, shape organization-specific approaches to diversity management. From our empirical results, we further inductively derive two dimensions of service processes that appear to play a central role in shaping diversity (management) in service organizations: customers’ proximity versus invisibility and diversity-customized versus profession-customized service. We conclude the article on a more critical note, reflecting on how specific constellations of work/understanding of diversity/diversity management enable and/or constrain employ...

Abstract: Groups are increasingly responsible for accomplishing critical, complex tasks for organizations, but understanding and developing effective teamwork have proved difficult. Findings from groups in Chinese enterprises supported recent theorizing that confidence in the group’s interpersonal relationships promotes team effectiveness. Results also suggested, in contrast to traditional theorizing about Chinese values, that conflict management was an important foundation for this confidence in relationships. Specifically, the structural equation analysis supported the reasoning that cooperative conflict builds confidence in relationships that, in turn, results in team effectiveness. Results were interpreted as providing support for the universalistic aspirations of the theory of cooperation and competition and that managing conflict cooperatively is a foundation for team effectiveness in China as well as in the West.

Author-Name: Louise Knight
Author-Name: Annie Pye
Abstract: Building on a previous conceptual article, we present an empirically derived model of network learning - learning by a group of organizations as a group. Based on a qualitative, longitudinal, multiple-method empirical investigation, five episodes of network learning were identified. Treating each episode as a discrete analytic case, through cross-case comparison, a model of network learning is developed which reflects the common, critical features of the episodes. The model comprises three conceptual themes relating to learning outcomes, and three conceptual themes of learning process. Although closely related to conceptualizations that emphasize the social and political character of organizational learning, the model of network learning is derived from, and specifically for, more extensive networks in which relations among numerous actors may be arms-length or collaborative, and may be expected to change over time.

Title: Objections to evolutionary psychology: Reflections, implications and the                 leadership exemplar
Author-Name: Nigel Nicholson
Abstract: A recent exchange of articles in Human Relations debated the validity, philosophical coherence and applicability of the ideas of evolutionary psychology (EP), with specific reference, inter alia, to previous writings where the author has sought to apply EP to the field of organizational behaviour. This article aims to analyse key areas of controversy about the logic and assumptions on both sides of the debate and to explore the possibilities for common ground to be found between them. It is argued that this entails an inter-actionist approach to the analysis of individual agency and action, and a co-evolutionary perspective on the social context. Leadership is taken as an exemplar of how this would be applied.

Author-Name: Toby D. Wall
Author-Name: Stephen J. Wood
Abstract: It is often assumed that research over the last decade has established an effect of human resource management (HRM) practices on organizational performance. Our critical assessment of existing studies finds that, although collectively they have opened up a promising line of inquiry, their methodological limitations make such a conclusion premature. We argue that future progress depends on using stronger research methods and design that, in turn, will require large-scale long-term research at a level of magnitude that probably can only be achieved through partnerships between research, practitioner and government communities. We conclude that progress so far justifies investment in such big science.

Title: Job uncertainty and personal control during downsizing: A comparison of                 survivors and victims

Abstract: This study developed and tested a model of job uncertainty for survivors and victims of downsizing. Data were collected from three samples of employees in a public hospital, each representing three phases of the downsizing process: immediately before the announcement of the redeployment of staff, during the implementation of the downsizing, and towards the end of the official change programme. As predicted, levels of job uncertainty and personal control had a direct relationship with emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction. In addition, there was evidence to suggest that personal control mediated the relationship between job uncertainty and employee adjustment, a pattern of results that varied across each of the three phases of the change event. From the perspective of the organization’s overall climate, it was found that levels of job uncertainty, personal control and job satisfaction improved and/or stabilized over the downsizing process. During the implementation phase, survivors experienced higher l...

Title: Independently verified reductionism: Prison privatization in Scotland
Author-Name: Christine Cooper
Author-Name: Phil Taylor
Abstract: The Scottish Parliament recently considered proposals, which, if implemented, would lead to a considerable expansion of prison privatization. Both the Scottish Prison Service and the Scottish Executive used what they claimed to be an independently verified cost saving of £700 million as the major justification for these proposals. The way this figure was constructed and used provides an example of the increasing tendency on the part of government to quantify what cannot be quantified, to ‘make the invisible visible’. This article uses several methods to interrogate this figure of £700 million, particularly the role played by ‘net present value’ in its construction. Its fuller significance emerges from an understanding of the contexts of the Private Finance Initiative and Public Private Partnership, the experience of prison privatization and the foreclosure of alternatives to privatization. This article is based upon an analysis of government documentation, interview evidence with key players and testimony...

Title: Employees’ overall perception of HRM effectiveness
Author-Name: Eunmi Chang
Abstract: Although the effects of a company’s overall human resources (HR) practices, or HR bundle, have been extensively examined, the effects of employees’ overall perception of HR effectiveness have rarely been studied. The current research examines whether a company’s commitment HR bundle measured at the company level is associated with an employee’s overall perception measured at the individual level, and whether the overall perception influences his/her perceived procedural justice and organizational commitment. Using data collected from 37 companies and 959 employees in Korea, the results show that the company’s HR bundle affects the overall perception of the employees, and that the overall perception predicts organizational commitment, which is partially mediated by procedural justice perception. Discussions and implications of the results are included.

Title: Academic nostalgia: A narrative approach to academic work
Author-Name: Oili-Helena Ylijoki
Abstract: This article argues that one of the core narratives within the present-day university is a nostalgic story line. Drawing on focused interviews with 23 senior researchers in three academic environments in Finland, the article shows that although the nostalgic plot structure cuts across the data, it has different contents in each of the three settings, thus emphasizing the internal diversity in academic life. However, in all cases nostalgic yearning refers to the loss of academic freedom and autonomy in work. The article concludes that nostalgia does not describe the actual past but rather the problems and tensions of the present. It is an idealization of the past, the function of which is to clarify the values and morals of the organization, which in turn can help to come to terms with the conflicting pressures of the current situation.

Title: Relationship building in small firms: The development of a model
Author-Name: Elizabeth Chell
Author-Name: Paul Tracey
Abstract: This article investigates relationships between Owner Managers and First Line Managers (supervisors) in small firms. A model comprising four components - competency, role, style and vision - was developed to consider the operating reality of this dyad, and its robustness considered using an embedded case study design (n= 15). The analysis relied upon ‘pattern matching’ in which a set of a priori propositions were examined, and (a) the predicted outcome (based on the model) compared with (b) the observed outcome (based on respondents’ assessment of the relationship). Two types of factor were identified: style and vision were found to be contingent, varying according to the dynamic of the relationship and expectations of those involved, while competency and role were deemed to be core elements without which effective interrelating is unlikely. Finally, the model was revised to include a fifth dimension - an emotional bond comprising trust/mutual respect - which appeared to be a crucial feature of effective ...

Title: Entrepreneurship and ‘the social’: Towards a                 deference-emotion theory
Author-Name: David Goss
Abstract: This article offers an alternative to the dominant individualistic theories of entrepreneurship. It develops Scheff’s notion of the deference-emotion system to propose a theory of entrepreneurial conduct that emphasizes social interaction and emotion. This theory proposes that the emotions of pride and shame, produced by the giving and withholding of deference, can motivate action that resists the innovation-inhibiting effect of social sanctions. By suggesting a social basis for the generation and reproduction of entrepreneurial conduct, it is able to explain the frequently volatile and inconsistent nature of this conduct, an important dimension of entrepreneurial behaviour that, whilst recognized empirically, normally escapes theoretical attention. The article advocates making social situations rather than individuals the analytical starting point for fresh and potentially valuable insights into the nature of entrepreneurial behaviour.

Title: The effects of mentoring on academic careers over time: Testing performance                 and political perspectives
Author-Name: Catherine Kirchmeyer
Abstract: Mentors have been associated with protégé career success. In this study, two perspectives on the means by which mentoring advances careers were compared. The performance perspective implies that the effects of mentoring on career advancement operate through performance whereas the political perspective assumes direct effects. Hypotheses derived from the perspectives were tested at early and middle-career stages in a sample of American academics. The amount of mentoring as measured by the number of traditional mentors and other developers predicted achieved rank and the relationship was not mediated by publication productivity. This finding supports the political perspective. In addition, the presence of an outside developer was associated with more publications and having an emotionally-close relationship was associated with higher salary.

Title: The crossover of burnout and work engagement among working couples
Author-Name: Arnold B. Bakker
Author-Name: Evangelia Demerouti
Author-Name: Wilmar B. Schaufeli
Abstract: The present study tested the hypothesis that burnout and work engagement may crossover from husbands to wives and vice versa. Data were collected among 323 couples working in a variety of occupations. The Job Demands-Resources model was used to simultaneously examine possible correlates of burnout and engagement for each partner separately. The results of a series of hierarchical regression analyses provide evidence for the crossover of burnout (exhaustion and cynicism) and work engagement (vigor and dedication) among partners. The crossover relationships were significant and about equally strong for both partners, after controlling for some important characteristics of the work and home environment. These findings expand previous crossover research, particularly by showing that positive experiences at work may be transferred to the home domain. We argue that the crossover of positive feelings among partners should be placed more prominently on the research agenda.

Title: The career life of academics: Boundaried or boundaryless?
Author-Name: Karen O. Dowd
Author-Name: David M. Kaplan
Abstract: The existence of tenure exerts opposing forces on the careers of academics. Ideally, tenure ensures academic freedom and individual autonomy. Yet tenure also regiments the lives of those on the tenure-track and often creates inertia for individuals once receiving it. Consequently, academic careers can be characterized as either boundaried or boundaryless, depending on the individual. This article develops a typology of four academic career types that identifies what differentiates tenure-track individuals who perceive themselves as having either boundaried or boundaryless careers in academia. The typology was developed using interview data from business school faculty, and then confirmed using qualitative data including faculty from multiple academic departments and disciplines. Finally, the typology makes its contribution to career theory by considering the additional impact of career stage theory for academics.

Title: The corrupt organization
Author-Name: David P. Levine
Abstract: This article explores the psychic meaning of corruption understood as an attack on norms of conduct in organizations. The primary focus is on why individuals fail to become securely attached to norms, and on the part played in this failure by certain key features of corruption: greed, arrogance, a sense of personal entitlement, the idea of virtue as personal loyalty, and the inability to distinguish between organizational and personal ends. The essay considers the moral dimension of the problem and suggests that conduct normally interpreted as corrupt often expresses a powerful attachment to primitive moral thinking rather than a rejection of morality.

Title: Commitment, flexibility and the choice of employment contracts
Author-Name: Subodh P. Kulkarni
Author-Name: Nagarajan Ramamoorthy
Abstract: The study of the factors influencing a firm’s choice of employment contract occupies a critical role in the strategic human resource management literature. However, existing research does not adequately address an important question in an uncertain environment: Can a firm balance the apparently conflicting considerations of ‘commitment’ and ‘flexibility’, underlying employment contracts? By integrating research on transaction cost economics and the resource-based view, we propose that a firm may avoid the tradeoff between commitment and flexibility by differentiating between two types of human asset specificity: ‘firm specificity’ and ‘usage specificity’. The interplay between the two types of human asset specificity and their value-creation potential has fundamentally different implications for a firm’s choice of employment contract. By distinguishing between behavioral and competitive uncertainties, we propose that different types of uncertainties may influence levels of commitment and flexibility, and ...

Title: Women’s appeals for equity at American universities
Author-Name: Sonia Goltz
Abstract: Statistics indicate that sex discrimination is still very evident at American universities. To explore whether inadequate university responses when individuals complain of inequities may be a factor, a qualitative study was conducted using individual interviews with 14 students and faculty who experienced sex discrimination. Results indicated the women first made attempts to address their situations informally and were hopeful that changes would result. Although changes sometimes occurred, responses to these informal appeals were generally characterized by non-response, denial of responsibility, or retaliation. Fewer of the women reported hopes for the formal processes they used following the informal ones and many had difficulty accessing these processes. For the most part, the universities responded to the formal complaints in the same way as they had responded to the informal ones, stimulating the women to seek justice outside the university.

Author-Name: Helen Collins

Abstract: This article examines ethics in work organization and in academic, particularly Critical Management Studies, research. It is centred on empirical data exploring the actions of three employees of a higher education institution who variously failed to resist and/or colluded in the sex discrimination of a colleague. We bring ethics to bear in our analysis of these data in three ways. First, reflecting upon our own methodology, we highlight the difficulties of balancing competing ethical responsibilities when engaging in critical research in contexts defined by adversarial relationships. Second, we highlight how research subjects, who we interpret as exercising problematic agency, draw upon discourses of care, friendship and responsibility to discursively construct their behaviour as moral. Third, drawing upon feminist theory, we reflect upon the ethical warrant of academic critiques of research subjects’ agency. Our analysis raises unsettling implications both for the ethics of Critical Management Studies re...

Title: The way it really happened: Competing narratives in the political process of                 technological change
Author-Name: Patrick Dawson
Author-Name: David Buchanan
Abstract: Corporate narratives concerning technological change are often constructed around a linear event sequence that presents the organization in a positive light to internal and external observers. These narratives often sanitize the change process, and present data from which commentators can formulate neat linear prescriptions on how to implement new technology. In contrast, this article draws on processual-contextual theoretical perspectives to argue that technological change is a more complex political process represented by multiple versions of events which compete with each other for dominance as definitive change accounts. It also calls for an analysis of narratives over time (before, during and after change) in seeking to demonstrate the analytical significance of identifying and unpacking the multiple interpretive frameworks that are utilized in organizational struggles over technology and change at work. These struggles draw attention to the ways in which power is exercised through the construction a...

Title: The political process of inscribing a new technology
Author-Name: André Spicer
Abstract: What shapes the use of a new technology? Instead of assuming that a use is already built into a technology, I argue that technology use is shaped by political processes. A central component of this involves interested organizational actors mobilizing discourses to inscribe a function into a technology. I explore this dynamic in a case where interested groups attempt to inscribe the possible use of an Australian public broadcaster's website during a public inquiry. I identify a progressive narrowing of the possible uses of the website that occurred across four successive ‘inscriptions’. This saw the website shifted from being a public resource to being a privatized outlet for advertising.The shift was not a neat process, but involved significant contestation and resistance at every step.The study shows that technical inscriptions are continually contested and resisted, inscription happens in a path-dependent fashion, and inscription is dependent on institutional platforms such as public inquiries.

Title: The politics of discourse: Marketization of the New Zealand science and                 innovation system
Author-Name: Shirley Leitch
Author-Name: Sally Davenport
Abstract: The politics of change are both played out within the arena of discourse and dedicated to transforming that arena. In this article, we bring together critical discourse theory and political process theory in order to highlight the ways in which a process of discourse transformation can be deployed by organizations to effect political and economic change. In the process we examine the discursive interplay between the actors as well as the discursive constraints on action. The context for our analysis was the attempt by a national science funding body to transform the New Zealand discourse of science and innovation in order to significantly change the behaviour of multiple stakeholder organizations. This discourse transformation had internal and external dimensions and required a radical restructuring of the organization to create a structure capable of driving and supporting the desired changes.

Title: The politics of networked innovation
Author-Name: Jacky Swan
Author-Name: Harry Scarbrough
Abstract: Existing studies suggest that, because knowledge is becoming more widely distributed, innovation increasingly needs to occur ‘at the interstices’ of collaborating groups and organizations. Networked innovation processes are therefore emphasized, over more hierarchical or market-based forms, as having distinct advantages for the creation and integration of knowledge. Whilst the structural properties of networks have been heavily scrutinized, there is relatively less understanding of processes, in particular the political dynamics that shape networked innovation. This article aims to develop understanding of networked innovation processes, by identifying and relating the characteristics of networked innovation to the productive, or constraining, effects of different dimensions of power (power of resource, meaning and process). It does this through comparative analysis of three case studies of networked innovation, each involving the development of new technology. This analysis suggests that understanding th...

Title: Beyond the metaphor: The morphology of organizational decline and turnaround

Abstract: This study is based on the thesis that Vladimir Propp's (1928/2001) theory of folktale structure functions not only as a morphology of folktales, but also as a structural, deep-level model of any process that includes crisis and recovery. We essentially suggest that corporate decline and turnaround processes can be emplotted into a folktale-like structure that supports Propp's theory and thereby helps uncover deep-level mechanisms governing the process. The developed model describes seven mechanisms that drive the organization from initial strategic harmony to disharmony, and furthermore to the construction of a new strategic harmony, thus creating a perspective for the interpretation of long-term organizational decline and turnaround processes. Theoretical and practical implications are offered.

Author-Name: Zella King

Author-Name: Jim Pemberton
Abstract: Many scholarly attempts to ascribe meaning to contemporary employment have adopted terms such as ‘new’ or ‘boundaryless’ careers.We argue that it makes more sense to conceptualize careers as ‘bounded’ than as ‘boundaryless’. We argue that careers are bounded by prior career history, occupational identity and by institutional constraints imposed by ‘gatekeepers’ to job opportunities. We present an empirical study of employment outcomes in a mediated labour market. Drawing on placement history and CV data from IT professionals, we examine the impact of occupation-specific human capital, prior career mobility and agency relationships on the probability of being shortlisted for a vacancy. We find that a candidate's prior history with the recruitment agency is a more important factor than occupation-specific human capital in determining access to job vacancies, indicating that intermediaries structure labour market opportunities. Even in a high-turnover industry, prior career mobility has a negative effect on ...

Semi-structured interviews with individuals from a variety of occupations provided qualitative data that were coded to identify the types of personal activities that take place on company time (e.g. personal phone calls, e-mails to friends, office betting pools) and the underlying factors behind engaging in personal business on the job (i.e. the balance between work and personal life realms, the various rationale or meanings people construct to rationalize this behavior, and the meaning or importance that people place upon home, work, and leisure). These findings have implications for (i) future researchers by increasing understanding of the behavioral manifestations of the overlap...

Abstract: Changes in organizational structures, logics and employment practices in the media industries – critically the outsourcing of labour, whereby employees become freelance workers – supply an ideal context in which to explore the extent to which, and the ways in which, ideological and structural pressures encourage workers to accept the logic and imperatives of enterprise. An important and influential body of literature identifies the ‘enterprising self ’ as a central paradigmatic concept underpinning the rationale of new, alternative, work forms and relationships. And enterprising forms or logics of organization, or of organizational employment practices and relationships are closely associated with management pressures on workers (contract freelance workers or permanent employees) to accept enterprise as a major element of their self-identities.This study of media workers contributes to the debate about the ‘enterprising self ’. Many writers have noted that workers in the enterprise economy are exposed to ...

Author-Name: Nicholas Bacon
Abstract: A discourse analysis of employee rhetoric before and after the introduction of shop floor work teams in a steel mill reveals important changes in expressions of ‘us’ and ‘them’ attitudes. The normative rhetoric of teamworking used by managers, insisting that all employees are working towards the same goal, raised an expectation of change in the traditional ‘them’ and ‘us’ divide between managers and workers. When workers detected little subsequent change they used the new language of teamworking to critique management in private although working in teams they reported pressure to behave differently. New working roles in teams did undermine traditional ‘them’ and ‘us’ loyalties, which fragmented to encompass finer distinctions (e.g. middle and upper management, workers and slackers) and employee attitudes became more individualistic.

Abstract: Economists often play crucial roles in designing and implementing policies in the private and public sectors; thus it is important to better understand the values that underlie their decisions. We explore the value hierarchies that characterize economists in five studies. Findings indicate that students of economics attribute more importance to self-enhancement values and less importance to universalism values than students in other fields. This profile is already apparent at the beginning of the first year of study and persists throughout the degree. The values distinctive to economists are related to work-related perceptions and attitudes and hence may influence the policy decisions and recommendations of economists.

Title: Union effects on employee relations in Britain
Author-Name: Alex Bryson
Abstract: I estimate the effects of trade unions on employee and employer perceptions of workplace management-employee relations in Britain using linked employer-employee data from the 1998 Workplace Employee Relations Survey. Associations between these relations and unionization vary with institutional arrangements in relation to bargaining and lay representation. There is support for McCarthy’s view that union lay representatives can act as a ‘lubricant’ assisting with employment relations, but this is apparent from an employer perspective, not an employee perspective. The only union effect common across employers and employees is poorer perceptions of employment relations where union coverage is at the level known to generate a union wage premium.

Title: Toward the construction of a profession’s boundaries: Creating a                 networking agenda
Author-Name: Amalya L. Oliver
Author-Name: Kathleen Montgomery
Abstract: Attention to the boundaries of an organization or profession is an essential precursor to facilitating boundary-spanning activities. We follow a four-stage process model of constructing boundaries to delimit a profession’s membership and domain prior to its recognition as an institutionalized entity. A set of networking activities forms the basis of boundary construction, yet identifying and prioritizing which activities to pursue is a challenge that can jeopardize the success of an aspiring group. We use a case study of the emerging Jewish legal profession in pre-state Israel to analyze how an agenda for creating membership and domain boundaries implicitly surfaces through interactions among members of the new group. We employ content analysis of a key meeting transcript and network analytical methods to reveal a shared cognitive map of priorities. The study adds to the literature on professional boundaries and demonstrates the utility of an innovative qualitative-quantitative research approach.

Title: An investigation of silence and a scrutiny of transparency: Re-examining                 gender in organization literature through the concepts of voice and visibility
Author-Name: Ruth Simpson
Author-Name: Patricia Lewis
Abstract: This article presents a review of the literature on gender and organizations through the twin concepts of ‘voice’ and ‘visibility’. In gender studies, as in other areas, the concepts have been used at different levels of abstraction to analyse inequality and exclusion. However, we argue that their potential richness has not been fully exploited and we accordingly produce a ‘framework’ which is based on ‘surface’ and ‘deep’ conceptualizations. These conform broadly to liberal feminist and post-structuralist interpretations respectively. With ‘voice’, we therefore distinguish between the ‘surface’ act of speaking/being heard as discussed within ‘women’s voice’ literature and, at a deeper level, the power of silence as discursive practices eliminate certain issues from arenas of speech and sound. Similarly, we can see visibility as a ‘surface’ state of exclusion and difference while, at a deeper level, conceptualizations can usefully explore the power of ‘invisibility’ and the battle for the (male) norm. Thr...

Title: Constructing identity and participation during technological change
Author-Name: Gillian Symon
Author-Name: Chris Clegg
Abstract: The organizational practice of user participation in IT system development remains problematic. Two of the major issues identified are establishing the most effective strategy and selecting the most appropriate user representatives. Opinions on these issues vary according to theoretical perspective and empirical evidence does not provide definitive solutions. Taking a social constructionist perspective, this longitudinal case study of a contested technological change process allowed the exploration of organizational talk about user participation over time. In particular, we focus on differing and changing constructions of ‘the user’ and ‘effective participation’. We argue that claims about who represented an appropriate user and what was an appropriate participative strategy varied across time and fulfilled particular political functions. We conclude that issues identified as problems in the literature on user participation may rather be manifestations of the political and socially constructed nature of o...

Title: From empty speech to full speech? Reconceptualizing spirituality in                 organizations based on a psychoanalytically-grounded understanding of the self
Author-Name: Michaela Driver
Abstract: Based on a psychoanalytic perspective, the article develops a new theoretical framework with which to examine organizational spirituality. Proponents of spirituality claim that it leads to the experience of an authentic self at work, one that is connected to others and a higher order, fully integrated, balanced, complete and ultimately fulfilled. This article suggests that these current definitions rest on conceptualizations of the self that capture little more than the imaginary function of the ego and the empty speech in which it engages. The article reconstructs core dimensions of spirituality in organizations as full speech, that is, as a discourse in which true subjectivity can emerge.

Author-Name: Tim Finch-Lees
Author-Name: Chris Mabey
Author-Name: Andreas Liefooghe
Abstract: This article illustrates a number of ways in which competency or capability-based management development (CBMD) can work simultaneously both for and against the interests of organizational agents. It does so by demonstrating how CBMD might usefully be understood as both ideological and quasi-religiously faith-based. These features are shown to provide opportunities for resistance and micro-emancipation alongside those for repression and subordination. The study employs a combination of ‘middle range’ discourse analytical techniques. In the first instance, critical discourse analysis is applied to company documentation to distil the ideological stance of an international organization’s CBMD programme. Critical discursive psychology is then used to assess the ways in which employees’ evaluative accounts both support and resist such stance. The analysis builds upon previous insights from Foucauldian studies of CBMD by foregrounding processes of discursive agency. It also renders more visible and discussible ...

Title: Knotted strands: Working lives of Indian women migrants in New Zealand
Author-Name: Edwina Pio
Abstract: While the burgeoning field of ethnic identity has been fuelled by the changing demographics of nations, such scholarship has given more concentration to general life contexts with much quantitative research done in America and Europe, and more recently in Australia. In this context the Indian Diaspora and ethnic identity have been studied, but there is a dearth of research on ethnic identity and Indians in New Zealand. This article draws on evidence from qualitative interviews with ethnic minority Indian women in New Zealand to illustrate ethnic identity negotiation. Three strands of experience were explored: 1) entry into the world of work; 2) staying in the world of work; and 3) the impact of work experiences on ethnic identity. The evidence indicates the difficulties encountered in entering the workforce and in sustaining work, creating knotted strands in the lives of the women. It seems to take approximately two years to start integrating experiences and coming to terms with life in the new country as...

Title: Preaching and practising ‘flexibility’: Implications for                 theories of subjectivity at work
Author-Name: Andrea Whittle
Abstract: This article explores the relationship between discourse and subjectivity in organizations with reference to an ethnographic study of UK management consultants. The article reveals the contradiction, criticism, cynicism and ambivalence involved in their role as preachers and practitioners of flexible work. These findings question the assumption that management consultants are evangelists that are identified with the discourses they sell. However, I also argue that the dis-identification and contradiction I observed did not in fact disrupt or disturb the production and promotion of their flexible working discourse. I suggest that the consultants constructed pragmatic, instrumental and dramaturgical selves in order to manage the tension between being preacher and practitioner. I conclude by suggesting that cynicism, ambivalence and contradiction constitute important but neglected features of work and organization.

Title: Bringing humility to leadership: Antecedents and consequences of leader humility
Author-Name: J. Andrew Morris
Author-Name: Céleste M. Brotheridge
Author-Name: John C. Urbanski
Abstract: As noted by McGill and Slocum (1998), effective leadership tends to operate as a contingency theory. The romanticized notion of celebrity CEOs that has been lionized in the popular business press has its place in the leadership pantheon, but, like any other approach to leadership, has limitations in its application. In particular, as discussed by Collins (2001a), sustained organizational functioning is more likely to be the result of the celebrity’s antithesis, a person possessing a blend of humility and strong personal will. This article draws from a diversity of sources in order to explore this potential nexus between humility and leadership. It offers a precise conceptualization of the concept of humility, identifies traits that are predictors of humility as well as the specific leadership behaviors that are likely to be the outcomes of high levels of humility.

Title: Dirty work designations: How police officers account for their use of                 coercive force
Author-Name: Penny Dick
Abstract: The concept of ‘dirty work’ has much potential to offer insights into processes related to the construction of organizational identities and work-group cultures. In this article, I use a social constructionist framework, to argue that ‘dirty workers’ perform their identities in two conceptually distinct contexts: ‘front regions’ and ‘back regions’ (Goffman, 1959), each producing its own subjective challenges. I use a critical discourse analysis to explore how, within the research interview setting, police officers deal with the moral dilemma of their use of coercive authority. I argue that what is designated as ‘dirty’ within any specific role differs according to the perspective of the observer, revealing the boundaries and landscape of different moral and social orders and how these overlap and compete. It is further argued that, within specific interactional contexts, occupational identity comprises a site of contestation for these different moral and social orders. The utility of the dirty work concep...

Abstract: Job insecurity has become an important issue for western organizations in the last decade due to uncertain economic conditions, global competition, and the advancement of information technology. In this study, we integrate social exchange theory and rational choice theory to explain employees’ responses to job insecurity in the Chinese context. We distinguish short-term transactional exchange from long-term relational exchange, and argue that joint ventures (JVs) and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are characterized by different kinds of employee-organization exchange. An integrated theoretical framework is developed to explain why workers in these organizations respond differently to job insecurity. A total of 548 supervisor-subordinate dyads in a JV and a SOE in China are used to test the hypotheses derived from our framework. The results of hierarchical regression analysis indicate that the effects of job insecurity on organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and job performance depend on both organiza...

Title: Dialectics of leadership
Author-Name: David Collinson
Abstract: Mainstream leadership studies tend to privilege and separate leaders from followers. This article highlights the value of rethinking leadership as a set of dialectical relationships. Drawing on post-structuralist perspectives, this approach reconsiders the relations and practices of leaders and followers as mutually constituting and co-produced. It also highlights the tensions, contradictions and ambiguities that typically characterize these shifting asymmetrical and interdependent leadership dynamics. Exploring three interrelated ‘dialectics’ (control/resistance, dissent/consent and men/women), the article raises a number of issues frequently neglected in the mainstream literature. It emphasizes that leaders exercise considerable power, that their control is often shifting, paradoxical and contradictory, that followers’ practices are frequently proactive, knowledgeable and oppositional, that gender crucially shapes control/resistance/consent dialectics and that leaders themselves may engage in workplace ...

Title: Making friends: A nonexperimental analysis of social pair formation
Author-Name: Gigi Foster
Abstract: Economists and psychologists often assume that people sort into groups based on similarities. In this article, the validity of this assumption is examined using pairwise data and a new application of a proven analytical technique. I use a unique administrative data set that follows undergraduate students as they move from quasi-randomly assigned housing into self-selected residence groups; social pair formation is measured using behavior, not survey responses. Sorting is observed from the baseline ‘clean slate’ of random groupings, creating a quasi-experimental environment and circumventing problems inherent in examining selection processes when starting groups are not randomly formed. A wide array of covariates, including original campus location, race, and academic ability is exploited to determine the most important factors driving students’ choices about with whom to live. Results support a role for ability in friendship formation, both conditionally and unconditionally, but also a significant and mor...

Title: Problems, problems, problems: The social construction of ‘leadership’
Author-Name: Keith Grint
Abstract: The invasion of Iraq was premised upon accounts of the situation that have proved unsustainable, but that has not generated a change in the strategy of the coalition forces. Conventional contingency accounts of leadership suggest that accurate accounts of the context are a critical element of the decision-making apparatus but such accounts appear incapable of explaining the decisions of those engaged. An alternative model is developed that adapts the Tame and Wicked problem analysis of Rittell and Webber, in association with Etzioni’s typology of compliance, to propose an alternative analysis that is rooted in social constructivist approaches. This is then applied to three asymmetric case studies which suggest that decision-makers are much more active in the constitution of the context than conventional contingency theories allow, and that a persuasive rendition of the context then legitimizes a particular form of action that often relates to the decision-maker’s preferred mode of engagement, rather than ...

Author-Name: Robert G. Lord
Abstract: This study took a unique approach to the study of anticipatory injustice by differentiating between implicit and explicit justice judgments when participants were faced with a manager of similar or dissimilar race. Automatic, implicit justice expectations were assessed using reaction time in addition to the more traditional paper and pencil measures of justice expectations. Results indicated that regardless of manager race, minority status significantly predicted implicit (but not explicit) injustice expectations such that minorities were more likely to expect unfair treatment. Implicit expectations of injustice, as assessed by reaction time, were significantly related to explicit expectations. Finally, explicit expectations of injustice significantly predicted subordinate reduced self-esteem, but not stress levels. The implications of the results and the usefulness of a new implicit measure of justice expectations are discussed.

Author-Name: Sigrid De Wever

Author-Name: Koen Vandenbempt
Abstract: In this article, we build a conceptual framework that models the influence of social capital as a multidimensional concept on strategic resource acquisition through interorganizational networks. Interorganizational networks are considered as effective when they allow for the acquisition of strategicresources. Our conceptual framework reflects that network effectiveness is dependent on the structural and the relational dimension of social capital. The main focus is on how the relational dimension of social capital – in this article conceptualized as trust – in interorganizational networks can directly and indirectly influence the acquisition of strategic resources through those networks. Based on the network literature, social capital literature and the literature on trust, we seek to develop propositions that detail the relationships among trust, interorganizational network characteristics, strategic resource acquisition/network effectiveness and performance. Basically, we argue 1) that different types of...

Title: Metaphorical images of organization: How organizational researchers develop                 and select organizational metaphors
Author-Name: Joep P. Cornelissen
Author-Name: Mario Kafouros

Abstract: The article examines how metaphors are developed and selected within organizational theorizing and research. The issue addressed is not whether metaphors exist and play a part in organizational theorizing – as this is now widely accepted – but to draw out how metaphors are actually used and are of conceptual value, particularly as such insights may aid organizational researchers in a better use of them.Working from this position, the article reviews the extant theoretical literature on metaphor, surveys the organizational literature to document past and contemporary metaphors-in-use (1993–2003), and identifies the heuristics (i.e. judgmental rules) that have been used by organizational researchers in developing and selecting these metaphors. The identified heuristics are the integration, relational, connection, availability, distance and concreteness heuristics. On the basis of these identified heuristics, and the biases and errors associated with them, the article also posits a number of governing rules ...

To illustrate this argument I analyse the account of the collapse of Barings Bank given in the Report of the Board of Banking Supervision, and juxtapose this with other versions of the events given by investigative journalists, Nicholas Leeson, and management scholars.The Report, I suggest, promulgates a public discourse myth designed to mitigate public anxieties, and is an explicit attempt to maintain and reproduce the legitimacy of the Bank of England, the City of London, and existing regulatory structures.

Abstract: The article seeks to advance the view that the selection interview frequently serves as a political arena for various power networks in the organization whose interests may be conflicting. Members of the interview panel try to advance the interests of the power networks to which they belong by lobbying for the candidates whose background and values concur most with those interests. The notion of the interview as a political and power game is illustrated with a case from the academic environment. It is concluded that there is a need for systematic investigation to establish the prevalence of the phenomenon, develop taxonomies, and examine its relationship with variables and outcomes of importance to organizations.

Title: Conflict, ambivalence, and the contested purpose of public organizations
Author-Name: Paul Hoggett
Abstract: This article argues that public organizations are inherently more complex than private ones. Their complexity derives from two sources. The public sphere is the site for the continuous contestation of public purposes and this means that questions regarding values and policies saturate all public organizations, particularly at the point of delivery. Second, because government partly acts as the receptacle for the alienated subjectivity of citizens, public organizations have to contain much of what is disowned by the society in which they are situated. It follows that the fate of the public official, sometimes referred to as the ‘street-level bureaucrat’, is to have to contain the unresolved (and often partially suppressed) value conflicts and moral ambivalence of society. Such a perspective has implications for all of those who, in their different roles, seek to bring about change or development in public organizations. Psychoanalytic approaches to organizational consultation have not adequately understood...

Abstract: The objective of this article is to better understand the developmental history of despotic regimes and the existence of leadership by terror. To gain greater insight into this phenomenon, the unusual relationship between leaders and followers in despotic regimes is explored, and the self-destructive cycle that characterizes such regimes is examined. The price paid in the form of human suffering and the breakdown of the moral fabric of a society is highlighted. In this article, particular attention is paid to highly intrusive totalitarian regimes. The levers used by such regimes to consolidate their power base are discussed in detail. The role of ideology, the enforcement of mind-control, the impact of the media, the inception of the illusion of solidarity, and the search for scapegoats are part of the review. Finally, suggestions are made on how to prevent despotic leaders from gaining a hold on power. Observations are made about the newly founded International Criminal Court, a permanent international j...

Title: The economy of vengeance: Some considerations on the aetiology and meaning of                 the business of revenge
Author-Name: Burkard Sievers
Author-Name: Rose Redding Mersky
Abstract: Throughout the history of mankind, revenge and vengeance have been deeply ingrained in our social fabric and richly portrayed in literature, music, drama, and film. Vengeance can be understood as a defence against annihilation anxieties, stimulated by the reactivation of injuries and losses experienced earlier in the lifetime of a system, fed by an institution's inability to acknowledge guilt and to integrate love and hate, and driven by the desire for ‘repair’ via retaliation. As open and direct acts of both revenge and violence are largely taboo, they are broadly denied in contemporary society at large and in organizations in particular. Despite that denial, the underlying feelings and the desire to persecute remain real. Thus revenge often is wreaked unconsciously by sophisticated and hidden means. This article is guided by the working hypothesisthat vengeance from a socio-analyticperspective is a psychosocial phenomenon and a dynamic of the collective, that is, the community or polis of related people...

Title: Workplace romances in cold and hot organizational climates: The experience of Israel and Taiwan
Author-Name: Rita Mano

Abstract: Workplace romances and their consequences have been frequently seen as undesirable for organizational performance. The goal of this study was to examine how organizations themselves influence the emergence, development and discourses of workplace romances. Using qualitative fieldwork from three organizations in Israel and four in Taiwan, we examine if and how organizational climate – cold, temperate and hot – influences the ways workplace romances are reported and narrated. We argue that these climates reflect the predominance of different types of work arrangements, notably aestheticization, performance and policy. The findings lead to the conclusion that workplace romances are more likely to become embedded in organizational discourses in hot climates where a hedonistic approach to work enhances the aestheticization of the work environment, providing work arrangements that enhance physical contact mostly outside the premises and a policy that does not punish participants. By contrast, in cold climates, ...

Abstract: There remains a conventional wisdom amongst economists that the UK suffers from a seriously under-skilled workforce and that an effective increase in the provision of training is key to economic regeneration. This article, while accepting the link between an underskilled workforce and economic performance, questions the reporting of skill shortages by personnel departments. This is based upon the notion that employees can spend considerable time attempting to influence decision-makers over and above their actual worth. We investigate whether personnel departments use concerns, and the ambiguous nature of, skill shortages to manipulate the reporting of skills at the organizational level.

Title: Quality of life: Obstacles, advice, and employer assistance
Author-Name: Elise Dallimore
Author-Name: Amy Mickel
Abstract: This exploratory study examines obstacles working professionals face in their efforts to enhance quality of life including a discussion of the advice and employer assistance they desire. Based on a discursive formations’ framework, research findings emerged with implications for organizations including the importance of: a) clarifying expectations for employees, b) addressing employees’ desire for various types of advice, c) acknowledging obstacles that are internallybased, and d) understanding employees’ perceptions of work environments. A category of general-life issues (which bridge work and non-work domains) also emerged from the data.

Title: Beyond dependence: An identity approach to social power and domination
Author-Name: Bernd Simon
Author-Name: Penelope Oakes
Abstract: This article outlines a new approach to the social psychology of power. Specifically, it challenges the currently influential conflictoriented dependence analysis, in which power operates as an almost exclusively repressive force. Drawing on relevant work from other social science disciplines, the article presents an identity model of power, in which both consensus and conflict play important roles. The model theorizes power as a productive as well as repressive force, and differentiates between social power toachieve desired outcomes and social power overothers (domination). The implications of the model for two classic issues in the power literature are considered: the relationship between power and status, and challenges to power (resistance and social change). The model's empirical potential is also discussed.

Title: We are family: Congruity between organizational and family functioning constructs
Author-Name: Céleste M. Brotheridge
Author-Name: Raymond T. Lee
Abstract: The common practice of characterizing organizations as having a family environment assumes that organizational and family functioning constructs are conceptually congruent. To date, this assumption has not been examined in a systematic fashion. This study examined the congruence of organizational and family functioning concepts using the Work Environment Scales and the Beavers Self-Report Family Inventory in a sample of 204 government employees. A canonical correlation analysis found a moderate amount of shared variance between these two sets of data, suggesting that there may be an underlying congruence between work and family constructs. Additionally, specific dimensions of work unit climate and group conflict were predictive of equivalent family functioning dimensions. The implications of these findings for managers and organizational development practitioners are discussed.

Title: Rethinking job characteristics in work stress research
Author-Name: Kevin Daniels
Abstract: In work stress research, consistent relationships between job characteristics and strain have not been established across methods for assessing job characteristics. By examining the methods used to assess job characteristics in work stress research, I argue that this is because different methods are assessing interrelated, yet distinct, facets of job characteristics: latent, perceived and enacted facets. The article discusses the implications for work stress research of differentiating these facets of job characteristics.

Title: The role of networks of practice, value sharing, and operational proximity in                 knowledge flows between professional groups
Author-Name: Maria Rita Tagliaventi
Author-Name: Elisa Mattarelli
Abstract: This article investigates the process of knowledge sharing between individuals in different professional groups. Through an ethnographic study in a hospital unit, we examine the individuals’ involvement in networks of practice, their sharing of organizational values, and their operational proximity. Recent attention to networks of practice has led to a view of organizations as crossroads of networks; accordingly, boundary relations between different networks of practice are of core relevance to ensure knowledge diffusion in organizations, but empirical evidence is still lacking. Our grounded theory supports the idea that working side-by-side and having common organizational values are important bases for knowledge transfer between professional groups which belong to different networks of practice. Boundary knowledge transfer evokes new kinds of organizational citizenship behaviours. Professionals who initiate the transfer exhibit extra-role behaviours which, in turn, require the recipient to perform extra...

Title: Leader framing and follower sensemaking
Author-Name: Cynthia J. Bean
Author-Name: Francis E. Hamilton
Abstract: Alternative workplaces are increasingly prevalent, combining flexible work practices, open landscape settings and a variety of acceptable working locations, especially for technology-enabled workers. In this article we examine the sensemaking response of technology-enabled, nomadic workers to the firm’s downsizing event at Telenor, Norway’s premier telecom company, in late 2002. We find two opposite interpretations of the firm’s employee database efforts and project-based structure emerge after the downsizing event. Our findings suggest the lack of geosocial boundaries in the organization influences sensemaking. Nomadic workers adopt frames that drive their interpretations and actions idiosyncratically. We suggest further research is needed to understand the influence of alternative work-places on patterns of behavior and human processes.

Title: Organizational discourse and subjectivity
Author-Name: Ola Bergström
Author-Name: David Knights
Abstract: This article seeks to contribute to the debate on the relationship between organizational discourses and subjectivity, revolving around whether organizational discourses determine individual subjectivity and the extent to which there is room for human agency. It does so by providing empirical illustrations of how organizational discourses constitute subjectivity during processes of recruitment in a large American consultancy firm operating in Sweden. The analysis illustrates how interviewers, by various discursive moves, initiate, support, control and follow up candidates’ decision to join the company, as if it was an independent choice to join. Findings suggest that to the extent that subjectification takes place during the recruitment process it is dependent on the candidate’s use and acceptance of organizational discourses as expressions of their own motives for working at the company. These findings have implications for the understanding of the relationship between organizational discourses and indiv...

Abstract: This article explores and analyses the dynamics of workplace relationships in an organization characterized by a highly ethnically diverse workforce. The specific objectives are: 1) to understand the factors that are contributing to high levels of ethnic diversity; 2) to uncover the ways in which such diversity is manifested in an organizational setting; and 3) to explore the ramifications that this diversity and its manifestations may have for individuals and groups of employees on the one hand and for relations between management and groups of employees on the other. The article concludes by discussing the implications that such ethnic diversity may have for extant research and conceptualization of ethnic minorities in the workplace.

Title: Sixty-six ways to get it wrong
Author-Name: Gail Whiteman
Author-Name: William H. Cooper
Abstract: Gail Whiteman learned to be a beaver trapper by working in the field with a Cree tallyman in Eastern James Bay, Québec. An account of her managerial experiences and some potential lessons for organizations were reported in Whiteman and Cooper (2000). Central to her managerial experience was the sense of being ecologically embedded – literally being grounded in the local ecology. From that experience we suggested that resources are more likely to be cared for if managers have a strong ecological sense of who and where they are. Banerjee and Linstead (2004) have provided an extensive critique of our article. We itemize the sins with which we are charged and provide responses to the more central criticisms. We close by reiterating the purpose of the original article and what we continue to believe are the virtues of the main points.

Title: Social networks and the psychological contract: Structural holes, cohesive                 ties, and beliefs regarding employer obligations
Author-Name: Violet T. Ho
Author-Name: Denise M. Rousseau
Author-Name: Laurie L. Levesque
Abstract: This study examined the relationship between employees' social network positions and their psychological contract beliefs. In particular, it investigated the relationship of employee advice and friendship ties with their employer's relational (long-term, non-monetizable), balanced (performance-related), and transactional (short-term, monetizable) obligations to them. Data obtained from a start-up research firm showed that employees brokering structural holes in the advice network believed the firm had greater balanced and transactional obligations to them. Employees with cohesive ties in the friendship network also believed that the firm owed them more balanced and transactional obligations. Neither structural holes nor cohesion were related to relational obligations. This study develops implications for psychological contracts and social networks research.

Title: A model of political leadership
Author-Name: Kevin Morrell
Author-Name: Jean Hartley
Abstract: In this article we develop a model of political leadership. In doing so, we analyse the challenges facing political leaders in local government in England and Wales. We use this analysis as a basis for broader theorizing: about leadership at other levels of government, and in other countries. The scope for applying extant accounts of leadership in these domains can be enhanced by considering the relational complexities that characterize the environment within which political leaders act; by doing so we offer an agenda for research. We describe the context for political leaders in terms of figurational sociology, where figurations denote interdependent networks of social relations. These take shape in different arenas of action, and are partly influenced by the different roles that political leaders undertake. These figurations are also constituted differently given the diversity inherent in the context for enacting political leadership. We propose a conceptual model that serves both as a heuristic framewo...

Title: Guanxi and supplier search mechanisms in China
Author-Name: Andrew Millington
Author-Name: Markus Eberhardt
Author-Name: Barry Wilkinson
Abstract: Supply localization is an expressed desire among western MNCs with manufacturing subsidiaries in the People's Republic of China (PRC), but poor information coding and diffusion poses problems in identifying suitable local supply firm partners. This article investigates the mechanics of personal connections, and in particular guanxi, in local supplier search and appraisal within a large sample of UK-and US-invested manufacturers in China. The results emphasize the importance of business rather than family and community connections as sources of guanxi, supporting Guthrie's (1999) view that industrialization and modernization has reduced the importance of traditional forms of guanxi. The results also suggest that social networks derived from relational contracting and the expatriate community are important sources of information. On the basis of this analysis we make a number of recommendations for improvement of firms' supplier search capabilities.

Abstract: In this article, we analyze an exercise in a facilitation process by showing that the structuring of this episode can be studied just by highlighting how different forms of agency (human and non-human) articulate with each other. The objective of this study is threefold: first, it aims at demonstrating that structuring effects can indeed be identified through a bottom-up approach without resorting to any form of duality or dualism, as it is common to think in the traditional literature in organizational studies (Conrad & Haynes, 2001); second, through this analysis, it illustrates the analytical power of such an approach by showing how it allows us to identify specific strategies used by the facilitators to do their work, especially in the way they select who or what is acting in a chain of agencies; third, it illustrates how the attribution of agency to artifacts allows human participants to progress throughout the facilitation process by enabling them to objectify what they are supposed to think and wis...

Title: Resisting corporate communications: Insights into folk linguistics
Author-Name: Nick Llewellyn
Author-Name: Alan Harrison
Abstract: Focus group research is used to examine how employees read corporate communications, supplying empirical evidence of an apparently resilient and shared anti-management discourse at the shopfloor level. The main contribution of the article lies in showing how such traditional attitudes are reproduced through employees' cynical readings of corporate communications. The article complements more conventional modes of discourse analysis by exploring how employees analyse text; how they identify discursive controversies and find evidence of ‘conniving’ management. Considering such processes reveals points of interest about how employees' folk linguistic competencies are locally deployed in ways that reproduce class-based logics and sentiments.

Title: Cold War, chilly climate: Exploring the roots of gendered discourse in                 organization and management theory
Author-Name: Mary Runté
Author-Name: Albert J. Mills
Abstract: Prior to the mid-1970s, gender was virtually absent from theories of management and organization (OMT), particularly within the North American context. In recent years, four strands of research have brought gender into management theory - gender and organizations, women in management, work-family conflict, and diversity management - but largely in ways that reinforce the masculinist project. With the exception of the more critical gender and organizations approach, gender continues to be discussed in OMT in ways that privilege masculinity and problematize femininity. This is particularly true of the work-family conflict literature and, to a lesser extent, the women in management literature. In this article, we are interested in the root of the gendered discourse within OMT. Through a feminist hermeneutic excavation of the development of modern OMT in post-war USA, we conclude that the continued masculinist project owes much to Cold War discourses of family and work

Title: The Cold War origin of action research as managerialist cooptation
Author-Name: Bill Cooke
Abstract: Managerial applications of action research (AR) (e.g. in Organization Development) have been critiqued as cooptational. Their participatory focus on means over ends of change, on micro-, intra-organizational issues, and the tacit but questionable claim to rigour, are said to conceal and reinforce existing power relationships, rather than deliver the meaningful empowerment promised. This article shows an empirical connection between the Cold War US and these problematic features of today’s managerialist AR. Drawing on a correspondence between Ronald Lippitt and John Collier, two AR founders, it shows a more profoundly socially engaged version of AR was proposed, but shut down by US Cold War inquisition. It was in response to this alternative version of action research that the problematic, now managerialist, version of AR was first consciously and deliberately articulated. This shows that managerialist AR’s self-detachment from social circumstances is evident not just in its application, but its historiography

Title: Between West and East: A social history of business journalism in Cold War Finland
Author-Name: Antti Ainamo
Author-Name: Janne Tienari
Author-Name: Eero Vaara
Abstract: The Cold War era was characterized by ideological struggles that had a major impact on economic decision-making, and also on management practice. To date, however, these ideological struggles have received little attention from management and organizational scholars. To partially fill this research gap, we focus on the role of the media in these ideological struggles. Our starting point is that the media both reflect more general societal debates but also act as an agency promoting specific kinds of ideas and ideologies. In this sense, the media exercise significant power in society; this influence, however, is often subtle and easily dismissed in historical analyses focusing on political and corporate decision-making. In this article, we focus on the role of business journalism in the ideological struggles of the Cold War era. Our case in point is Finland, which is arguably a particularly interesting example due to its geo-political position between East and West. Our approach is socio-historical: we foc...

Title: Cold War political culture and the return of systems rationality
Author-Name: Ori Landau
Abstract: This study places systems rationalism - the most important phase in managerial systems discourse’s dissemination - within the context of Cold War’s incipience in the United States. Quantitative and qualitative analyses are offered based on primary data collected systematically from the Harvard Business Review and Advanced Management, supplemented by additional macro-data and secondary historiographic sources. The study’s findings indicate that systems rationalism was shaped by a formative event, short but intensive, combining two processes: the eruption of the Cold War political culture and concurrent managerial struggles over hegemony. Managerial discourse appropriated Cold War ideological concepts and national myths and translated them into rational-instrumental terms. The resultant discursive formation hybridizing particularistic-ethnocentrism and universal-rationalism became the birthplace of systems rationalism. Systems rationalism’s possible contributions to the enhancement of managerial power are d...

Author-Name: Peter A. Bamberger
Author-Name: Samuel B. Bacharach
Abstract: We test hypotheses derived from two alternative perspectives regarding the association between supervisory abuse and subordinate problem drinking. Drawing from the employee resistance literature, we examine the degree to which such an association may be sensitive to variation in subordinate personality. Drawing from the stress literature, we examine the degree to which this association may be mediated by somatic stress. Multi-source data from 1473 blue-collar workers employed in 55 work units, indicates that while the main effect of abusive supervision on problem drinking is attenuated under conditions of high subordinate conscientiousness and agreeableness (consistent with a resistance-based explanation), the main effect is not mediated by somatic stress.

Abstract: This article reports on an empirical study of a computer programmer community, focusing on online exchanges in which participants discuss the aesthetics of coding. Naturalistic data were collected during a 12-month period of non-participant observation of the software community in question. The authors estimate that approximately 200 participants are represented in the main dataset. Narrative data are presented under two interpretative rubrics: ‘programmer performatives’ and ‘commercial performativity’. We seek to demonstrate that there is the online equivalent of a great deal of intricate ‘face work’ that programmers do in their narrative exchanges. In expressing and conforming to a ‘hacker ethic’, programmer narratives simultaneously evince technical, ethical and aesthetic motives. There is frequent articulation of resistance and subversive intent expressed toward representatives of employers and employing organizations. Software engineers are acutely aware of the facets of organizational control and de...

Title: Action research: Explaining the diversity
Author-Name: Catherine Cassell
Author-Name: Phil Johnson
Abstract: For nearly 70 years scholars have been discussing the characteristics of action research and it is apparent that there is an increasingly wide range of forms that action research takes in practice. Here we argue that such diversity is not haphazard and that we must be cautious about developing all-embracing standards to differentiate the ‘good’ from the ‘bad’. Rather this diversity is inspired by different philosophical stances, which usually remain tacit in published accounts thereby fuelling ambiguity and controversy about what action research should entail in practice and as to its ‘scientific’ status. The aim of this article is to explain the apparent diversity of action research in the organization studies domain, by clarifying how variable philosophical assumptions systematically lead to the constitution of distinctive forms of action research with their attendant conceptions of social science. This diversity is illustrated, with examples from the relevant literature, in terms of variation in: the a...

Abstract: The group engagement model (Tyler & Blader, 2003) suggests that identification with one's organization is based not only on the individual's evaluation of the status of the organization (i.e. perceived external prestige), but also the individual's evaluation of their own status within the organization (i.e. perceived internal respect). Using data drawn from three different sources (subordinates, supervisors, and company records), results from a sample of healthcare employees (n = 205) provide support for the core relationships proposed in the group engagement model and extend the model by showing that prestige and respect have different antecedents. The perceived status of the organization's employees, the organization's perceived success in achieving its goals, the visibility of the organization, and the status level of the individual employee were all associated with perceived external prestige. The results also indicate that visibility within the organization, perceived opportunities for growth, and pa...

Title: Job referral in China: The advantages of strong ties
Author-Name: Chau-kiu Cheung
Author-Name: Yong Gui
Abstract: There is evidence for the importance of strong ties in job referral among Chinese working people. The principle of reciprocity in exchange theory has been used as an explanation for this. According to the theory, a job seeker who has more resources is more appealing to a matchmaker, who is then more likely to refer the job seeker to a more rewarding job. A strong tie acts to enhance the expectation of reciprocity from the referred person. This study of Chinese working people in Shanghai seeks to identify the effect of strong ties on job referral. The results point to the advantages of having strong ties in job referral, which include not just earnings but also satisfaction from the referred job. Importantly, people with more resources benefit more from job referral through a matchmaker, particularly when the tie with the matchmaker is strong.

Author-Name: Pierre Durand
Abstract: This study examines the role of occupations and work conditions in psychological distress with a model of social action in which psychological distress results from stress created by the constraintsresources of structures of daily life, macrosocial structures, and agent personality. Using longitudinal data from 6611 workers nested in 471 occupations, multilevel regression analyses confirm the model. Occupations account for 1.6 percent of the variation. Social support and job insecurity contribute to distress, but greater decision authority increases distress. Skill utilization follows a J curve. Family structure, social network outside the workplace, and the personality of the agent do not moderate the influence of the workplace, with the sole exception of strained marital relations. The findings support the hypothesis that occupations and certain workplace constraintsresources contribute independently to psychological distress. Researchers in workplace mental health must expand their theoretical perspect...

Title: Alliance management teams and entrainment: Sharing temporal mental models
Author-Name: Rhetta Standifer
Author-Name: Allen Bluedorn
Abstract: Creating and administrating successful strategic alliances poses a significant challenge to interorganizational managerial teams. Using shared mental model theory as a framework, we propose that the effectiveness of these managerial teams can be increased if the team shares a common temporal mental model with regard to the alliance. Specifically, a shared mental model in terms of the elements of entrainment (e.g. cycle, pace, time orientation) will allow team members to actively assess and better manage entrainment issues which we suggest are a crucial component of strategic alliances, although not one that has been studied to a great extent.

Title: Guess who's coming to dinner? Structures and uses of liminality in                 strategic management consultancy
Author-Name: Andrew Sturdy

Author-Name: Andre Spicer
Abstract: Organizational studies have recently drawn our attention to the importance of liminality in our working lives. This transitional timespace is characteristic of precarious or mobile employment such as temporary, project and consulting work especially. It is understood as a fluid and largely unstructured space where normal order is suspended and which is experienced as both unsettling and creative. This article critically explores liminality through a detailed study of the neglected activities of business dinners and back-stage management consultancy. We argue that liminality can in fact be a highly and multi-structured, comfortable and strategic or tactical space. We find that the use of wider norms and routines of eating and socializing as well as of hierarchical patterns of working and of exclusion and inclusion shape the experience and outcomes of liminality. Moreover, we highlight how the context of liminality is sustained by highly structured organizational activities in the production of domestic and...

Title: How symbolic remuneration contributes to the legitimacy of the company: An                 institutional explanation
Author-Name: Mariluz Fernandez-Alles
Author-Name: Gloria Cuevas-Rodríguez
Author-Name: Ramon Valle-Cabrera
Abstract: This research analyzes whether variable compensation is designed as an economically rational incentive to increase organizational performance, or whether it also responds to other factors such as the search for legitimacy. A case study demonstrates how the design of the variable compensation system, at both managerial and lower levels, takes into account the company's adoption of popular management practices that increase its legitimacy but not necessarily its performance.The results show that,in the design of their compensation policies, organizations do not always seek financial objectives, as agency theory maintains, but often have other social objectives such as the search for legitimacy, as institutional theory suggests. The management of incentives not only is used to align the interests of principal and agent, but also has a symbolic character, insofar as it signals that the company belongs to a particular social context.

Title: Between asset and process: Developing competence by implementing a learning                 management system
Author-Name: Erna Håland
Author-Name: Aksel Tjora
Abstract: Competence and competence development are ‘buzz words' widely used in organizations in Norway, as well as in other countries. Competence, as the company's most important and valuable resource, is constantly highlighted. But what does this imply for the organization and for the employees? What are comprised in the concept of competence? In this article we present different understandings of competence among employees in a large Norwegian oil company, Statoil, as well as some of the different views on competence found in the literature. Based on semi-structured interviews in two different stages of a process of implementing a netbased learning system, we find that the focus is more on competence as asset than competence as process. This leaves out important dimensions of competence in the complex society of today and as expressed by several of the employees in Statoil.

Title: Toward the micro and macro-level consequences of interactional justice in                 cross-cultural joint ventures
Author-Name: Yadong Lu
Abstract: Nested within the logic of social exchange, this study addresses the micro and macro-level consequences of interactional justice between boundary-spanning executives in cross-cultural joint ventures. At the micro-level, this study examines how interactional justice affects these executives' decision-making effectiveness and the interpersonal trust between boundary-spanning officers. At the macro-level, the study analyzes how interactional justice affects the levels of conflict and attachment between partner organizations from different nations. This study further analyzes how interactional justice buffers the effects of national cultural differences between partner organizations on the above consequences. Analysis of 152 international joint ventures suggests that interactional justice is positively associated with decision effectiveness, interpersonal trust, and interorganizational attachment, and that interactional justice suppresses the negative influence of national cultural differences between partner...

Title: The ethnonarrative approach
Author-Name: Hans Hansen
Abstract: While much research within narrative theory has focused on discourse in organizations, context should be a central focus because it is material in the production of meaning. In this article, I suggest an ethnonarrative approach that seeks to combine ethnographic methods and narrative methods in conducting hermeneutic analyses of narratives and stories, shifting not only between texts and contexts, but texts within a context of construction. Narrative research relies on analysis of various texts and often ignores context, while ethnographic methods are especially attuned to making observations and interpretations regarding the context in which texts are produced. The ethnonarrative approach highlights the multiple materials at play in narrative construction and attempts to demonstrate contextual influence on meaning making. The ethnonarrative approach is distinguished by a focus on the context of construction, the endosymbiotic relationship between text/context, and the social act as the level of analysis.

Abstract: This study explores cross-sex friendships within the professional workplace and examined the impact of the workplace environment and heightened awareness of sexual harassment on cross-sex friendship formation. Results from interviews with 41 professionals suggest the existence of obstacles to developing cross-sex friendships at work. Specifically, these professionals worried that their cross-sex friends would misinterpret their friendliness as romantic or sexual interest, that their co-workers would misinterpret their friendliness to a cross-sex friend, and that their humor and conversational topics might be perceived by a cross-sex friend as sexual harassment. Barriers to cross-sex friendship at work were labeled the ‘glass partition,’ and the potential impact of this glass partition on women's and men's careers is discussed.

Abstract: We draw on a series of in-depth interviews with senior managers from institutional investors and large listed corporations to explore how different conceptualizations of institutional investors, their role in the corporate governance process, and their interactions with corporate management, are reflected in the accounts of the actors concerned. We find that the conceptualizations in terms of ownership and agency that dominate both academic and popular discourses are marginal to the actors’ accounts. Rather, both fund managers and company managers conceptualize institutional investors primarily as financial traders who happen,as a result of their trading, to control key resources, but whose interests are effectively divorced from those of long-term share owners. Our analysis suggests that far from being mitigated by the large share blocks of institutional investors, as some commentators have suggested, the separation of ownership from control has been compounded in the UK by a separation of accountability...

Title: When good overcomes bad: The impact of volunteers on those they help
Author-Name: Natti Ronel
Abstract: This qualitative study examines the impact of a personal encounter with perceived goodness, as represented by volunteers who are perceived as altruistic by those they help. It focuses on the encounter between at-risk street youths and lay volunteers in a mobile outreach service. The findings reveal that the street youths perceived the volunteers as representing pure altruism, and this stimulated several positive processes. Meeting the volunteers raised their awareness of giving without expecting a reward, which sharply contradicts their view of the world as a battlefield. Consequently, they understood and partially internalized the idea of non-material gratification. In some cases, the example set by the volunteers inspired the young people to consider volunteering themselves. Finally, they were able to generalize the altruistic image to the entire service and overcome their initial objections to a service run by the establishment. The proposed explanation, related to positive psychology, refers to the co...

Title: Joan Woodward Memorial Lecture: Applied social science: Is it just common sense?
Author-Name: Lisl Klein
Abstract: Joan Woodward (1916–71) introduced the teaching of industrial sociology at Imperial College. Her best-known study, comparing organizations on the basis of their production technologies, was followed by research on the behavioural consequences of management control systems. Together they laid a major foundation stone for the contingency approach to organization. Although not explicitly concerned with application, the contingency approach makes possible analysis and some degree of prediction about organization. For applied work, three further conditions are necessary, that come from the arena of dynamics rather than research: internalizing a finding and turning it into use; starting from where the other is; and creating some transitional space. Whether an outcome is regarded as ‘common sense’ has to do with experience of a situation before it is researched, familiarity with findings afterwards, and the kind of language used. The capacity to think institutionally shifts these boundaries: with it, more things...

Title: Managing incidents of work-family conflict: A decision-making perspective
Author-Name: Gary N. Powell
Author-Name: Jeffrey H. Greenhaus
Abstract: The present study proposed a decision process that people follow in incidents of work-family conflict and offered an initial test of factors that may influence their decisions. It distinguished between decisions regarding the mobilization of social support to avoid conflict and decisions regarding participation in a work and/or family activity if the conflict was not avoided. According to analyses of critical incidents provided by managers and professionals employed in full-time jobs, decisions were influenced by internal cues reflecting the individual’s priorities in the conflict situation, role sender cues reflecting the priorities of involved parties in the individual’s work and family roles, and role activity cues reflecting characteristics of the specific activities in conflict. Moreover, our findings suggest that the utilization of these cues often represents an attempt to preserve positive relationships with important role senders in the work and family domains.

Author-Name: Martin M. Greller
Author-Name: Sandra B. Richtermeyer
Abstract: Social factors, particularly age norms, are cited as a major influence on retirement and late career decisions; yet research has focused primarily on one feature of norms: shared beliefs. A sample of finance and accounting professionals between the ages of 22 and 70 is used to examine whether support for career development differs as a function of age. The levels of support for professional development, retirement preparation, and personal growth from five sources (family, co-workers, colleagues in other organizations, supervisor, and friends) are examined. Age is not a major factor in the amount of support reported. Support is associated with career-related intentions and beliefs (maintaining professional contacts, hours spent in training, career insight, expected development, and perceived organization support). Family support influences career development. These effects hold regardless of age. The results suggest emphasizing the informational role of social networks rather than the normative role with ...

Abstract: We studied 284 volunteers, loosely coupled in groups (i.e. low task interdependence, high outcome interdependence), selling memberships in a non-profit organization. Consistent with economic models of altruism, we found individual perceptions of group potency to be negatively related to individual selling behavior (i.e. making telephone calls and customer visits). Furthermore, individual members’ perceptions of group potency were found to interact with two personality traits (conscientiousness and extraversion) to influence individual selling behavior.

Abstract: Participants from two samples (n = 31 human resources staff, n = 36 teachers) rated the extent to which they believed varying levels of a pre-defined stressor influenced positive affect, negative affect, and work performance. Participants then carried personal digital assistants for five working days, and provided data on levels of the pre-defined stressor and on momentary negative and positive affect. For both samples, momentary negative affect was more strongly associated with stressors for those participants who believed stressors caused them to feel greater negative affect. For both samples too, the association between participants’ momentary negative affect and average levels of stressors across the working week was moderated by beliefs concerning stressors’ impact on work performance.

Title: Gender as multiplicity: Desire, displacement, difference and dispersion
Author-Name: Stephen Linstead
Author-Name: Alison Pullen
Abstract: This article argues that although gender is no longer widely considered to be a property of individuals, the alternative of viewing it in terms of performativity, where it is the outcome of linguistic and social performances, unnecessarily limits the possibilities of thinking of gender as a form of multiplicity that is both internally and externally differentiated. Any attempt to move beyond binary thinking in gender relations initiates a consideration of multiplicity, and the way in which multiplicity is conceptualized exerts a critical influence on the possibilities that are opened up. This article interrogates existing understandings of multiplicity and finds three actual or possible types - multiplicities of the same, characteristic of feminist approaches which we critique through a reconceptualization of desire; multiplicities of the third, characterized by anthropological, transgender and queer theory approaches; and multiplicities of difference and dispersion, typified by the rhizomatics and fluid ...

Author-Name: Glen E. Kreiner

Author-Name: Mathew L. Sheep
Abstract: Organizational members are often faced with tremendous demands on their individual identities that affect their performance at work and their well-being as individuals.Previous research has been limited, however, by typically studying identity at either the individual or the organizational level. We therefore introduce a boundary approach that simultaneously examines identities across levels in order to better understand these identity demands. Specifically, we examine boundary dynamics that are negotiated at the interface of individual and organizational identities. We introduce the identity boundary dynamics of identity intrusion, distance and balance as different manifestations of identity boundary (in)congruence, both within and between individuals and organizations. Finally, we outline propositions that suggest boundary dynamics as a source of identity change.

Title: The ambivalence of professional identity: On cynicism and jouissance in audit firms
Author-Name: Katarzyna Kosmala
Author-Name: Olivier Herrbach
Abstract: This article explores how identity is self-managed in professional services firms, illustrated by the Big Four audit firms. We examine both identification and distancing processes with several identity attributes of professionalism, viewed here as outcomes of technologies of the self. We argue that the ambivalence inherent in these attributes enables auditors to more or less cynically distance themselves from the regulatory structures of their environment, forming jouissance with rules and regulation. The study, empirical in nature, contributes to an understanding of the mutual constitution of power and identity in the area of employee resistance to organizational control. As distancing from the organizational culture and the professional ideology appears to be more symbolic of individual agency than truly harmful, we conclude that jouissance may potentially enhance the firms’ performance in the short term. Yet, prolonged cynical attitudes may transform professionals into ‘compliant’ employees, who may no...

Title: Social capital and political bias in knowledge sharing: An exploratory study
Author-Name: Annick Willem
Author-Name: Harry Scarbrough
Abstract: The benefits of social capital for the sharing of knowledge are frequently emphasized in the literature. However, a few authors have also begun to draw our attention towards the drawbacks of social capital for the working of organizations. In particular, instrumental social capital - as opposed to consummatory social capital - is seen as linked to power relations, which can inhibit the sharing of knowledge. To contribute to this debate on the role of social capital, we carried out a qualitative study in two Belgian companies. Our findings reveal that social capital generally tends to enhance the sharing of knowledge but that in its instrumental form it reflects opportunistic and political objectives, and promotes a highly selective form of knowledge sharing.

Abstract: Although the emotional labour required of service providers has received considerable research attention, few studies have examined service workers’ experiences of emotionally charged service encounters. In this article we review literature on emotion management and compassion in the workplace. We then describe a qualitative study which examined the service encounter occurring when bereaved Irish consumers contacted their local newspaper to place In Memoriam notices on the anniversary of a close family member’s death. We suggest that these newspaper employees engaged in philanthropic emotion management when dealing with bereaved customers, and we locate this within the broader context of compassion as interpersonal work and as organizational accomplishment. We also suggest that compassion in organizations is not amenable to managerial systematization and control.

Author-Name: I. M. Jawahar
Abstract: Mood signifies general well-being and a positive mood benefits self, one’s spouse and the family unit. Dual-earner couples are particularly susceptible to spillover and crossover of mood. A lack of studies on the relationship between workload and mood and the repeated calls for more couple-level research served as the primary impetus for this study. Using data from 629 couples, we examined the relationship between objective (i.e. hours of paid work) and subjective (i.e. time pressure) workload on 1) one’s own (positive and negative) mood, 2) spouse’s mood, and 3) mood at the couple level. Results of two-level regression analyses indicated that subjective workload was positively related to negative mood. In contrast, objective workload was related to decreased negative mood and to increased positive mood. In addition to support for spillover effect, results supported one crossover effect, such that wives of husbands who devote more hours to paid work reported higher levels of negative mood, even as the hus...

Abstract: This article presents a study of the degree to which national institutional settings impact on the application of management practices in foreign subsidiaries of multinational companies. Applying the national business systems approach our study centres on the use of calculative human resource management (HRM) practices by subsidiaries of US multinational companies in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Denmark/Norway and Australia, respectively, in comparison with these countries’ indigenous firms.The analysis indicates that while US subsidiaries adapt to the local setting in terms of applying calculative HRM practices, they also diverge from indigenous firm practices.

Abstract: Conceiving institutional effects as occurring within the boundaries of predefined institutional environments, spaces or fields leaves little leeway for understanding transnational phenomena of interaction, competition and overlapping jurisdiction of ideas, norms and regulations of multiple origin. I propose here the metaphor of intersecting institutional streams, which influence social actors due to their different origin, strength and fluidity. Thanks to a new understanding of the interaction between roles, institutionalized identities and the self, I refer to individuals not as cultural and institutional dopes, but as able, in varying degrees, to participate in multiple cultural traditions and to maintain distinctive and inconsistent action frames. I collected quantitative information on 418 Italian middle managers, working for local and international firms in Italy, and qualitative information on 113 of them. The majority in international firms enacted Anglo-Saxon identities, and more so in US and Brit...

Abstract: In this article, we provide a critique and re-specification of international business and institutional literature related to the interactions of multinational corporations (MNCs) and institutions. Drawing from research in economic sociology and political economy, we offer a novel perspective on MNCs’ influence on transnational institution building. We argue that MNCs seek to influence institutional development by creating or participating in policy networks within transnational social and economic systems. We describe different types of policy networks, the relative position that MNCs occupy within them, and the power MNCs yield by virtue of their position and influence within those networks. We provide examples to illustrate how MNCs exploit these network relationships to influence emergent institutions and to advance convergence in institutional policies. The policy network perspective is an effective and useful mode of analysis to understand the range of interactions among MNCs and the institutional f...

Abstract: New institutionalist studies of human resource management in multinational companies argue that subsidiaries are faced with institutional duality-pressures to conform to parent company practices and to the local institutional environment in which they are based. To date, they have concentrated on how subsidiaries respond to parent company pressures. This article considers how subsidiary management responds to both parent company demands and host country pressures in trying to reconcile the challenges of institutional duality. It focuses on how such responses are shaped by the interdependence of subsidiary management with the parent company and the local environment. It does so by comparing case study evidence of collective representation practices in US-owned subsidiaries in Britain and Germany.

Title: The contested space of multinationals: Varieties of institutionalism,                 varieties of capitalism
Author-Name: Glenn Morgan
Author-Name: Peer Hull Kristensen
Abstract: The article argues that institutionalist theory applied to multinationals focuses on the issue of ‘institutional duality’, that is, that within multinationals, actors are pressured to conform to the expectations of their home context whilst also being subjected to the transfer of practices from the home context of the MNC itself. This institutional duality leads to conflicts that can be labelled as forms of ‘micro-politics’. The head office managers transfer practices, people and resources to subsidiaries in order to maintain control and achieve their objectives. Local subsidiaries have differential capacities to resist these transfers or to develop them in their own interests depending on their institutional context. The article distinguishes institutional contexts that produce ‘Boy Scout’ subsidiaries, doing what they are told and consequently allowing locally distinctive capabilities to be undermined and those that produce ‘subversive strategists’ which look to deepen their connection with the local co...

Title: Principals and practice: Rhetoric and the moral character of managers
Author-Name: Robin Holt
Abstract: Milton Friedman argues that moral development is not a proper concern for managers in their public role as agents of principals. For managers the sole criterion of good behaviour is the lawful promotion of the owners' interests; their moral development is presumed an entirely personal affair. From a critical perspective, Alasdair Mac In tyre also argues that moral concerns are antithetical to the technical and instrumental activities that characterize management. In this article, I argue that this separation of morality and management is neither necessary nor desirable. The purpose is to show that the development of a moral character is integral to good managerial practice. I describe this moral character as the more or less successful development of phronesis: a sensitivity to the appropriateness and limits of value convictions set within communities of practically oriented, purposive action. To further expand on this, I discuss the relevance of Aristotle's theory of rhetoric and how rhetorical practice ...

Title: Choice is yours: A psychodynamic exploration of health policymaking and its                 consequences for the English National Health Service
Author-Name: Marianna Fotaki
Abstract: Patient choice is at the forefront of the debate about the future of healthcare provision in many industrialized countries. It is argued that understanding the complexities and the multiple consequences involved in implementing individual patient choice in public health systems calls for an analytic framework extending beyond economic determinism and positivist social science paradigms. This study applies psychoanalytic concepts to illuminate policy dynamics and limitations, using the example of patient choice in the English NHS. It separates declared from unexpressed policy goals theorizing on the role of imaginary institutions and their defensive and less obvious functions in society, and reflects on the implications of policies that are formulated at a distance from operational reality on healthcare organizations. By focusing on the deeper primitive anxieties that are evoked and enacted in patient–doctor interactions, this article examines opportunities and limitations involved in developing individual...

Title: Factors in team effectiveness: Cognitive and demographic similarities of                 software development team members
Author-Name: Hye-Ryun Kang
Author-Name: Hee-Dong Yang

Abstract: The benefits of teams and teamwork are popular and propounded in management discourse. The use of this lexicon is based on beliefs in the resultant mutual gains for both organizations and individuals. Yet, are all teams, irrespective of the characteristics of membership composition, the same in terms of such beneficial outcomes? This study investigates the importance of team member characteristics, particularly cognitive and demographic, on team effectiveness and which characteristics matter more in team activities, especially where labour turnover is high, such as in software development. The Shared Mental Model is outlined and used as the representative construct for cognitive similarities; while age, tenure and gender are the demographic aspects used. From the relevant literature we develop a hypothesis and subject it to a range of tests based on empirical fieldwork using software development teams in South Korea. Our analysis shows that team effectiveness is more influenced by cognitive than demograph...

Title: Understanding the relationship between individualism–collectivism                 and team performance through an integration of social identity theory and the social                 relations model
Author-Name: Michael Gundlach

Author-Name: Jason Stoner
Abstract: In studying the relationship between individualism–collectivism and team performance, empirical research has shown that individualistic team members exert a negative influence on team performance. However, theoretical understanding of why this relationship exists is lacking. Addressing this gap in the literature, this research proposes a theoretical model of the relationship between individualism–collectivism and team performance by integrating two previously distinct theories, social identity theory and the social relations model. Drawing upon these theories, we propose that team identification, meta-perception accuracy, and team identity will mediate the relationship between individualism–collectivism and team performance. Further, we posit that task interdependence will moderate the relationship between individualism–collectivism and team identifi-cation. In developing our work, we formulate testable propositions which are aligned with the specific relationships shown in our model. After presenting our...

Title: The social construction of clients by service agents in reformed welfare administration
Author-Name: Patrice Rosenthal
Author-Name: Riccardo Peccei
Abstract: This article explores categorization and labelling in organizations through a study of the social construction of clients by service agents in reformed British welfare administration. We analyse the content of client typologies and show how these are embedded in the nature of front-line service work and the organizational context as structured by social authorities. We find a pervasive categorization and valorization of clients according to their perceived attitudes to work, on the reported basis of their body language and demeanour in initial service interactions. This is embedded in a more complex system of social construction, encompassing diverse criteria such as capacity for aggression, gratitude and social status and age. We show how the criteria used by staff to make sense of overlapping groups of clients differs between the main sample in post-reform sites and those working in pre-reform benefit offices. We consider the research and practical implications of our study, the latter relating to the e...

Author-Name: Krystelle Shaughnessy
Abstract: Although knowledge transfer (KT) in healthcare organizations is increasingly important, models have typically focused on the transfer of clinical knowledge. Despite numerous reports and studies on worklife issues for healthcare professionals, few recommendations have been implemented, and many of these professionals are unfamiliar with the reports. Using measures of knowledge transfer of quality of worklife information developed from a model of transfer of clinical knowledge, we tested the relationship between individual and organizational knowledge transfer among 769 nurses in hospitals across four provinces in Canada. We also examined a model that integrated these two knowledge transfer measures with burnout/engagement in the workplace. Our data supported a two factor structure for the measure of knowledge transfer involving a) individual perceptions of personal knowledge transfer activities and b) organizations' support for knowledge transfer. Data from structural equation modeling demonstrated the imp...

Title: Struggling over subjectivity: A discursive analysis of strategic development                 in an engineering group
Author-Name: Pikka-Maaria Laine
Author-Name: Eero Vaara
Abstract: We have seen growing interest in discursive perspectives on strategy. This perspective holds great promise for development of an understanding on how strategy discourse and subjectivity are intertwined. We wish to add to this existing research by outlining a discursive struggle approach to subjectivity. To understand the complex subjectification and empowering/disempowering effects of organizational strategy discourse, this approach focuses on organization-specific discourse mobilizations and various ways of resistance. Drawing on an analysis of the discourses and practices of ‘strategic development’ in an engineering and consulting group we provide an empirical illustration of such struggles over subjectivity. In particular, we report three examples of competing ways of making sense of and giving sense to strategic development, with specific subjectification tendencies. First, we show how corporate management can mobilize and appropriate a specific kind of strategy discourse to attempt to gain control of...

Title: Inter-team coordination activities as a source of customer satisfaction
Author-Name: Véronique Ambrosini

Author-Name: Sarah Burton-Taylor
Abstract: This article reports the results of a micro-level study into firm resources. It involved a comparative qualitative study of the activities contributing to service delivery in two similar but differentially performing divisions, one perceived by customers to be a high quality provider, the other a lower quality provider. The results indicate that there were differences in the incidence of inter-team coordination activities and that effective inter-team coordination was a critical factor in delivering increased customer satisfaction. This suggests that these activities, by causing staff to interact across internal boundaries, may constitute a resource advantage. We propose that these activities are critical for both the coordination of service delivery activities and knowledge exchange, and that contextual factors may have an impact on these activities. The study makes a contribution to the resource-based view and strategy as practice literatures and illustrates how a practice-orientated approach can inform...

Title: Strategizing in the multi-business firm: Strategy teams at multiple levels                 and over time
Author-Name: Sotirios Paroutis
Author-Name: Andrew Pettigrew
Abstract: Strategy teams have received little attention in the strategic management literature. The goal of this article is to fill this theoretical and empirical gap by studying the practices of strategy teams. Drawing upon an in-depth longitudinal case study of a FTSE-100 multi-business firm and evidence from 36 interviews, this study points to the importance of both actions and interactions of corporate centre and business unit strategy teams during the strategy process. Our study also shows that acting and knowing of these teams is dynamic, collective and distributed within the multi-business firm across two interrelated levels: within the team and across teams, each involving both recursive and adaptive activities.Our article is divided into three parts. The first outlines the theoretical and methodological issues for studying the practice of strategy teams in multi-business firms. In the second, our empirical findings are reported. Finally, the third part presents our contributions and some implications for f...

Title: Making sense of different responses to corporate change
Author-Name: Inger Stensaker
Author-Name: Joyce Falkenberg
Abstract: Organizations can respond to change in a number of ways such as by transforming the organization, by making symbolic changes, by customizing the change to better fit the context, or by corrupting the change and actually reinforcing status quo. In this article we compare how three business units respond to the same corporate change initiative.We traced organizational responses to change over time and found that responses to change initially varied across business units, but over time most organizational changes were customized to fit the business unit context. We argue that organizational-level responses and how these develop over time can be explained by examining individuals’ interpretative responses. Through inductive analysis we identify five interpretative responses at the individual level: convergent response, divergent response, unresolved sensemaking, creative response, and non-compliance, and show how these shape organizational-level responses.

Title: Strategizing in pluralistic contexts: Rethinking theoretical frames
Author-Name: Jean-Louis Denis
Author-Name: Ann Langley
Author-Name: Linda Rouleau
Abstract: Pluralistic organizations characterized by multiple objectives, diffuse power and knowledge-based work processes present a complex challenge both for strategy theorists and for strategy practitioners because the very nature of strategy as usually understood (an explicit and unified direction for the organization) appears to contradict the natural dynamics of these organizations. Yet pluralism is to some extent always present in organizations and perhaps increasingly so. This article explores the usefulness of three alternate and complementary theoretical frames for understanding and influencing strategy practice in pluralistic contexts: Actor-Network Theory, Conventionalist Theory and the social practice perspective. Each of these frameworks has a predominant focus on one of the fundamental attributes of pluralism: power, values and knowledge. Together, they offer a multi-faceted understanding of the complex practice of strategizing in pluralistic contexts.

Title: Post-processual challenges for the emerging strategy-as-practice perspective:                 Discovering strategy in the logic of practice
Author-Name: Robert Chia
Author-Name: Brad MacKay
Abstract: The recent turn to ‘strategy practice’ offers a genuine opportunity for establishing an alternative perspective that is clearly distinct from the traditional strategy process view. The challenge is to clarify and articulate an alternative set of ontological and epistemological premises for founding this new approach to theorizing strategy.What has been called the ‘practice turn’ in social theory provides this alternative basis for a ‘post-processual’ approach to theorizing strategy-as-practice. This ‘practice turn’ involves a radical reformulation of the intractable problem of agency and structure that enables us to bypass the ‘micro/macro’ distinction so intimately tied to the social sciences in general and to strategy research in particular. Already, there are signs that the discourse of the strategy-as-practice research community reflects this awareness and are thus straining towards some form of ‘trans-individual’ explanation that is not restricted to the mere ‘activities’ of strategy actors nor to th...

Author-Name: Gerard P. Hodgkinson
Author-Name: Ian Clarke
Abstract: The considerable volume of theory and research that has sought to illuminate the nature and significance of cognitive processes in strategy formulation and implementation represents but an important first step in the re-humanization of strategy research. In order to achieve the sorts of fine-grained analyses that will ultimately advance understanding of cognition in action, strategy researchers need to move beyond the static analysis of actors’ cognitive maps to a deeper understanding of what lies behind the actions of strategists as they engage with particular strategy practices in their praxis. To accomplish this key goal, strategy researchers need to become more reflective in their own practices, augmenting the observational and interview techniques advocated by various leading contributors to the strategy-as-practice (s-as-p) perspective with a profiling of the cognitive characteristics of strategists, based on psychometrically robust procedures. To this end, drawing on dual-process theories from cogn...

Abstract: While the strategy-as-practice research agenda has gained considerable momentum over the past five years, many challenges still remain in developing it into a robust field of research. In this editorial, we define the study of strategy from a practice perspective and propose five main questions that the strategy-as-practice agenda seeks to address. We argue that a coherent approach to answering these questions may be facilitated using an overarching conceptual framework of praxis, practices and practitioners. This framework is used to explain the key challenges underlying the strategy-as-practice agenda and how they may be examined empirically. In discussing these challenges, we refer to the contributions made by existing empirical research and highlight under-explored areas that will provide fruitful avenues for future research. The editorial concludes by introducing the articles in the special issue.

Author-Name: Valerie Antcliff
Author-Name: Richard Saundry
Author-Name: Mark Stuart
Abstract: Accounts of the shift to post-industrial modes of employment have tended to present an over-simplified view of networks as an assemblage of contacts used to gain individual advantage in the labour market. Creative industries represent a challenge to this as typically they rely on networks to foster collaboration, trust and co-operation. In this article we explore how a variety of networks are used to promote both individual competition and co-operation in an industry where re-regulation has resulted in the break up of bureaucratic organizations and widespread casualization of the labour market. We argue that there is a need to extend the debate on the role of networks in a casualized labour market to examine how individuals organize themselves via the plethora of networks that result from organizational break up.We use qualitative data from a series of interviews with freelance television production workers in the United Kingdom to suggest that workers use networks as a source of competitive advantage and...

Title: ‘Cultural diversity’ at work: ‘National                 culture’ as a discourse organizing an international project group
Author-Name: Ester Barinaga
Abstract: Research to date concurs in maintaining that performance of nationally homogeneous workgroups differs if compared to heterogeneous ones. Yet, results are mixed on the relationship between cultural diversity and workgroup outcomes. The article argues that cultural differences are given explanatory authority, cultural diversity acquiring a positivist status, and group members being treated as ‘dopes of their culture’. An alternative approach is to conceive ‘cultural diversity’ and ‘national culture’ as discursive resources used by group members in everyday group life. The author followed an international project group for over 17 months,observing how group members discussed and made sense of what went on. Findings suggest that the way members in international project groups use the ‘national/cultural’ discourse plays a crucial role in the organization of the project. More specifically, results demonstrate that group members shaped and developed their international project in important ways by using the disc...

Author-Name: Graeme Currie
Author-Name: Andy Lockett
Abstract: Our study of secondary schools in England illustrates the ineffective implementation of transformational leadership within public service organizations by policy-makers. First, a rather narrow, managerialist variant of transformational leadership is promoted, which is resisted by school teachers and principals. Second, associated with this, policy does not take account of the institutional context within which public services organizations operate. Third, policy-makers, rather than leaders transform the context within which leadership takes place and any leadership discretion is constrained by central government audit. Instead, moral, professional and contingent approaches to leadership are enacted at the local level with individualized, rather than dispersed leadership, as a consequence of regulatory and normative pressures.

Author-Name: Wilson Ng

Abstract: This article explores the nature and process of non-executive director (NED or non-executive) influence in quoted, familycontrolled firms (FCFs) through two company case studies in Singapore. Existing views of the non-executive role in such firms have been derived from theory, with traditional and ‘new’ agency approaches and resource dependence theory each offering differing prescriptions of the role. The article reviews this literature and suggests the potential value of qualitative research for understanding and reconciling competing prescriptions of the NED role. It then presents two case studies which explore the processes whereby independent non-executives seek to influence decision-making during critical incidents in the life of two FCFs. Based on these cases the article critiques the zero-sum view of power and the ‘nuclear’ conception of the family that informs much of the suspicious and hostile perspective of family control held by some agency scholars. In contrast, the article argues for a relati...

Title: `That is my job'
Author-Name: Sharon K. Parker
Abstract: Findings from two field studies support the proposition that the way individuals define their role, or their role orientation, is a powerful influence on their behaviour, resulting in more or less effective job performance. The first study showed that, within a relatively self-managing context, flexible role orientation predicted supervisory assessments of overall job performance, as well as a change in job performance. The second study showed flexible role orientation predicted job performance in high autonomy jobs but not low autonomy jobs. In both studies, role orientation predicted performance more strongly than other work attitudes, including job satisfaction, generalized self-efficacy, locus of control, and job aspiration. Collectively, the findings suggest that the development of a more flexible role orientation represents a relatively unexplored avenue for enhancing employee performance, particularly in self-managing contexts. As such, further research on the process of shaping and promoting emplo...

Abstract: FBI files on Kurt Lewin, founder of this journal, and his close colleague Goodwin Watson, reveal inter alia the investigation of Lewin postmortem by the FBI/CIA, and FBI surveillance of Watson while he was a proponent of corporate T-groups, a precursor to present day team development. Sixty years on from Human Relations' launch, and Lewin's premature death, the files enrich understandings of Lewin's, and Watson's, lives and work. The socio-political structures-in-process they evidence also support the idea of the T-group as a knowing political tactic, apparently emancipatory, yet immunized from (proto-)Cold War inquisition by its very focus on the here-and-now.

Abstract: To examine maternity leave as a gendered conflict management process, we analyzed a sample of interviews (from a larger data set of 102 interviews) with 26 women who reported feeling discouraged (n = 15) or encouraged (n = 11) about their employment status and career opportunities at the times of their leaves. Whereas these two groups of women converged on perceptions of a) incompatible (individual and organizational) goals and b) increased stress, they diverged on perceptions of a) interdependence, and b) use of negotiation strategies. Although this study is exploratory, findings indicate the need for additional research on perspective taking and influence tactics as ways of handling potential gendered conflict interactions for female workers and their bosses.

Title: `Ethics' as a discursive resource for identity work
Author-Name: Martin Kornberger
Author-Name: Andrew D. Brown
Abstract: This article analyses how participants in a not-for-profit service organization (the `Incubator') drew on understandings of 'ethics' in order to make sense of their individual and collective selves. Identities are theorized as being constituted within discursive regimes, and notions of ethics are conceived as discursive resources on which individuals and groups may draw in their attempts to author versions of their self and organizational narratives. We show how conceptions of ethics were a rich vein on which organizational members drew to elaborate narratives that legitimated particular modes of working and which cohered an otherwise quite disparate community of individuals. The research contribution of this article is twofold. First, we discuss how a discourse focused on ethics may be a strategic resource for identity work. Second, we analyse how talk and writing about issues of ethics are implicated in relations of power and ongoing struggles for control over organizations conceived as discursive space...

This study examines how workers used and interpreted the personal digital assistant (PDA) as a boundary management resource. Using a protocol that combined structured, closed-ended questions with open-ended questions, 42 users were interviewed. The data were analyzed to examine individuals' practices in using this technology, the interpretive resources they drew upon, and the ways in which the spirit of the device's design intersected with their practices and interpretations. Results suggest that the spirit of the device is control, and that users interpreted their technological practices as expressions of personal agency, using the PDA to control the work—life boundary through both integration and segmentation of work and personal-life.

Title: Themed article: Doing research on emotion and virtual work: A compass to                 assist orientation
Author-Name: Barbara Sieben
Abstract: The aim of this article is to offer a structuring device for research on emotion and virtual work. I refer to this structuring device as a compass. It embraces the different perspectives organizational researchers may adopt to address emotion and virtuality and illustrates the questions and findings that arise out of these perspectives. As such, the compass is a guide to the possibilities and limits of research on emotion, virtual work, and their interplay, and a tool for developing and combining research questions from multiple perspectives.

Title: Themed article: Emotion online: Experiences of teaching in a virtual learning environment
Author-Name: Sarah Gilmore
Author-Name: Samantha Warren
Abstract: Using qualitative data drawn from one specific instance of workplace virtuality and emotion — the experience of delivering online seminars using `chat-rooms' — we explore how emotion was productively transformed through the use of virtuality in a teaching and learning setting, a workplace environment for thousands of academics. Using social constructivist and psychoanalytical theories of emotion, we discuss three emotional categories grounded in these data: 1) intimacy; 2) play; and 3) pride/shame, which were experienced in response to a range of student behaviours seemingly encouraged by the online seminar setting. We argue that the characteristics of virtuality as a medium of communication — namely the absence of the body, diminution of paralingual cues and removal of physical socio-spatial indicators–force a renegotiation of the 'feeling rules' that govern traditional classroom settings which in turn contributes to a more emotionally suffused teaching experience for online tutors. Given that the emotio...

Title: Themed article: Sexed up intelligence or irresponsible reporting? The                 interplay of virtual communication and emotion in dispute sensemaking
Author-Name: Piers Myers
Abstract: In the context of an exploratory case study of an interorganizational dispute between the BBC and the UK Government, this article develops a conceptual framework through which the interplay of emotion, sensemaking and virtuality in disputes can be better understood. One contribution of the article is reconsideration of the general relationship between emotion and sensemaking. It is suggested that emotions as temporary social roles complement sensemaking itself, enabling plausible accounts to be constructed when there would otherwise be no socially acceptable bridge between beliefs and behaviour. A second contribution is appreciation of the difficulties for virtual communication arising from the capabilities for review and replication of messages which it affords, so that discourse is explicit, irrevocable and potentially public. When, particularly across the lines of a dispute, communications are contentious this can lead to sensemaking through behavioural commitment and the evocation of justifying belief...

Title: Correspondence: Corporate communications and its receptions
Author-Name: Lars Thøger Christensen
Author-Name: Joep Cornelissen
Author-Name: Mette Morsing
Abstract: This article critiques the conceptualization of corporate communications in a recent study by Llewellyn and Harrison. We argue that their analysis of the reception of corporate messages is one-sided and partial and fails to advance a comprehensive understanding of corporate communications and its role in contemporary organizations. Llewellyn and Harrison suggest that blue-collar employees share a class-based anti-management attitude which together with their `folk' linguistic competences leads them to read corporate communications texts in a strictly cynical way that reinforces a class distinction between `managers' and (blue-collar) `employees'. In the hope of advancing a more sophisticated view on corporate communications, we challenge Llewellyn and Harrison's position by questioning the methods and arguments brought forth in their analysis.

Title: Organizational cynicism: Extending the exit, voice, loyalty, and neglect model of employees' responses to adverse conditions in the workplace
Author-Name: Fons Naus

Author-Name: Robert Roe
Abstract: We propose to extend the Exit, Voice, Loyalty, and Neglect (EVLN) model of employees' responses to adverse organizational circumstances with the construct of Organizational Cynicism. Structural equation modeling was used to fit the data provided by 159 office employees of a large Dutch trade union, who were involved in a restructuring program at the time of the research, to the postulated five-factor model. Results indicated that the model showed an acceptable fit, providing suppor t for including organizational cynicism as a distinct response in the model. Multiple regression analysis was used for the differential prediction of the five responses, using two situational variables (role conflict and autonomy), two personality variables (asser tiveness and rigidity), and selected interactions. The best predictions are obtained for exit, cynicism and loyalty. Loyalty is predicted by low role conflict and high autonomy, whereas cynicism and exit are about equally predicted by high role conflict, low autonomy,...

Title: Restructuring time: Implications of work-hours reductions for the working class
Author-Name: Brenda A. Lautsch
Author-Name: Maureen A. Scully
Abstract: This article examines the implications for working-class employees of reducing work hours, specifically when over time is cur tailed in hourly jobs. Much of the literature on work/life balance recommends a reduction in hours for professional employees. We find that the income from over time hours solves a host of work/family problems for working-class employees, ranging from the basic need to `make ends meet' to the more hidden strains of caring for extended families and dealing with divorce, illness, and addiction. Effor ts to reduce hours will be met with resistance not relief. Our depiction of working-class concerns helps the work/family literature to move beyond a focus on professionals and to tackle tough trade-offs regarding livelihood and quality of life.

Abstract: In this article, we address the question of how organizational practices are diffused within networks of practice. We do so by drawing on the results of an ethnographic study of the diffusion of a complex mental health care treatment modality — the Democratic Therapeutic Community — that involved the attempted spread of novel work practices within a professional network of psychiatrists and their associated multi-disciplinar y teams at two new clinical sites. We orientate the study within the networks of practice (NOP) literature on the diffusion of new work practices, considering in par ticular the issue of organizational power, which has been neglected hitherto. After presenting our ethnographic material, we draw attention to the role of clinical ideology, derived from founders and upheld by new, local clinical leaders in the appropriation process. By bringing in a concern for organizational power, we add to the existing literature through stressing the impor tance of ideological power, in supplying col...

Abstract: This study explains the effects of medical institutionalization on the framing of doctor—patient interviews. We draw on Weberian, Habermasian, and Foucaultian perspectives to explain the ways that occupational rationalities are embodied in doctor—patient encounters, and how these rationalities structure and are structured by occupational conceptions of medical clients. We use the results of par ticipant-obser ver methods to demonstrate specific instances of the ways in which organization—client interactions are simulated in a standardized patient training programme. Finally, we discuss findings with respect to our theoretical perspectives, showing how each perspective contributes unique insights into understandings of organizations and the communities they serve.

Title: Complexity in practice
Author-Name: Colin Campbell-Hunt
Abstract: Theories of social practice point to a wide domain of largely tacit social accommodations as the source from which the dynamic structures of social practices are sedimented. The strategy-as-practice initiative seeks to use these insights to widen our appreciation of the origins and evolution of strategy in organizations. This ar ticle suggests that this domain, and its components, can be substantively and literally represented as a complex adaptive system. Complexity gives access to a considerable body of theor y on the emergent orders that may arise from social practice, and on the evolution of social order over time. These carry impor tant implications for the scope of practitioners' agency in leading strategic change, for the locus of strategy in organizations, and for the design of research strategies to investigate these complex phenomena.

Title: Efficiency as a mediator in turnover—organizational performance relations
Author-Name: Paula Morrow
Author-Name: James McElroy
Abstract: This study adds to scientific understanding of how employee turnover affects organizational performance in a multi-unit commercial bank setting operating in the United States. Theoretically, expected relationships among turnover, efficiency and performance are outlined. Empirically, two indicators of organizational efficiency are examined and one, cost-per-loan efficiency, is found to fully mediate relations between voluntary employee turnover and two organizational performance outcomes, profitability and customer satisfaction, in both synchronous and longitudinal analyses These results replicate recent findings in disparate industries, suggesting that efficiency may explain why higher levels of turnover are typically associated with lower levels of organizational performance. The need to distinguish among conceptualizations of efficiency is discussed, along with the need to consider temporal effects associated with turnover and efficiency.

Title: Hired professional to hired gun: An identity theory approach to understanding the ethical behaviour of professionals in non-professional organizations
Author-Name: Hugh Gunz
Author-Name: Sally Gunz
Abstract: Most recent major financial scandals have come about with the assistance, tacit or active, of highly trained professionals whose ethical responsibilities were thereby violated. This article addresses the question of why this might happen. It argues that the problem may lie in the adoption of a common prescription, namely that to be effective, in-house lawyers need to be part of the corporation's strategic decision-making process. But, paradoxically, in so doing, the lawyers' identities might become modified such that the approach they take to handling ethical dilemmas becomes more like that of their non-lawyer colleagues, thus losing some of the benefits of their professionalism. The results of a postal survey of Canadian corporate counsel provide supporting evidence for this conclusion.

Title: Stretching out and expanding work practices in time and space: The case of telemedicine
Author-Name: Davide Nicolini
Abstract: The article utilizes the imagery of stretching out and expanding for exploring what happens when medical practices and health working arrangements are temporally and spatially reconfigured. Based on the tenets of contemporary practice theory, and on the back of a three years' longitudinal study of telemedicine in northern Italy, the article investigates some of the practical issues raised by the subversion of the proximity principles that still underscore most current medical practices. The study argues that in order to cope with the expansion of their activity practitioners had to face three main practical problems: they had to redistribute their work and tasks among human and non-human elements, they had to reframe the ways in which the activity was made accountable, and they had to reconfigure the relationships between all those involved. The stretching out and expanding of medical practices in space and time implies thus much more than a simple redistribution of what was already there and it triggers ...

Title: Committees as strategic practice: The role of strategic conversation in a public administration
Author-Name: Christina Hoon
Abstract: This longitudinal qualitative study examined the role of committees as strategic practice during the implementation of personnel development in a public administration. The results show that the interaction between the management levels is not only organized in formal committees where the middle managers undertake strategic initiatives and the strategic context is set by the senior managers. Rather, the middle managers and the senior managers organize the discussion on strategic issues in informal interactions around committees. These close informal interactions can be understood as a strategic conversation that entails the micro-mechanisms of generating an understanding, aligning towards an issue and making prearrangements which give support for the flow of discussion. The findings show that the strategic conversations are beneficial within shaping strategy as they frame the committee as strategic practice and enable the strategic context to be reshaped and redefined.

Author-Name: Lizabeth A. Barclay
Author-Name: Karen S. Markel
Abstract: In this article, we examine how genetic testing may be the basis of a new form of exclusion in organizations. Testing reveals the genetic composition of an individual and can identify genetically linked conditions. Discrimination, related to genetic composition, may occur through either the stigmatization or categorization of individuals or groups based on genetic test results. The potential impact of genetic testing and the associated discriminatory processes on both employees and organizations is outlined. This research discusses individual (stigmatization, perceived discrimination, and symptom timing and visibility), organizational (actual discrimination, genetic testing use and accommodation) and environmental (regulatory agencies, genetic testing laboratories, insurance providers and genetic advocacy groups) factors that impact genetic testing. Lastly, we propose research questions linked to these factors to guide future organizational study.

Abstract: This is a study of human resource development practices (as perceived by employees) and their association with their attitudes in the context of new career theories. It uses two heterogeneous UK samples of employees from six companies in different industries. Both regression models (from the 1997 and 2000 cohorts) support the mediating role of satisfaction with development on the relationship between perceived significance of development practices and organizational commitment. There are trends in attitudes about the significance of various development factors between cohorts of employees (with respondents in 2000 more inclined to state that self-motivation has been a significant factor in improving their Job performance, and with lateral development also reported as more significant in 2000). A shift in development practices can be observed as a progression from knowledge acquisition via formalized training courses, towards development as a participation model based on challenging work and coaching by an...

Abstract: This article examines the May 1996 Everest disaster through the lens of limits and liminality to provide an alternative interpretation of the significance of the event as a counterpoint to existing accounts. The Everest disaster is an example of management under the most extreme conditions and also an example of a common managerial mindset that is prevalent in the literature on leadership and strategy that anything can be achieved by organizations with appropriate strategic intent and leadership. Rather than focusing upon how disaster could have been avoided by better management, we trace the roots of the disaster to the impact of liminality in extreme conditions and we consider the implications for organizations with liminal team members, a condition that is becoming more prevalent in contemporary organizations.

Abstract: This article illustrates how distributed change agency can implement complex organizational changes in the absence of formal management plans, roles, and structures. Distributed change agency typically involves small teams and senior groups. In this qualitative study of service improvements in the treatment of prostate cancer at an acute hospital, Grange, change roles were distributed more widely, with responsibilities `migrating' among a large informal cast supporting four central characters. This distribution appears to have been triggered by the change goals and substance, and by the network organization through which services were delivered. Cross-case comparisons with other hospitals, Henley and Norwood, suggest that a combination of factors contributed to the development of a distributed approach. Analytical generalization invites speculation concerning the transferability of this model, with `nobody in charge', to other settings. One policy implication concerns the provision of development in chang...

Abstract: This article examines the role of internet-based labour market intermediaries in coordinating job seeker/employer interactions. A twofold analysis examines on the one hand the matchmaking tools determining applicants' access to job ads, and on the other, the content of ads posted on the Web. Observations reveal that the information available to applicants is subject to a high degree of filtering achieved through the use of pre-defined lists, keywords or more frequently, input fields. A comparative analysis of job offers posted on the internet with those posted in newspapers shows that search engine toolkits have a considerable impact on ad content which is generally more standardized and quantified in the former than in the latter. Furthermore, a comparison between French and British ads demonstrates that the institutional context influences the actions taken by job boards. In contrast to Great Britain, France more frequently uses matching markers aimed at selecting applicants than those providing detaile...

Author-Name: Linn Van Dyne
Author-Name: Ellen Kossek
Author-Name: Sharon Lobel
Abstract: Flexible work arrangements that give employees more control over when and where they work (such as part-time, flextime, and flexplace) have resulted in growing workplace trends of reduced face time, namely less visible physical time at the workplace. Most previous writings highlight negative effects on work group processes and effectiveness. In contrast, we develop a cross-level model specifying facilitating work practices that enhance group processes and effectiveness. These work practices: collaborative time management, re-definition of work contributions, proactive availability, and strategic self-presentation enhance overall awareness of others' needs in the group and overall caring about group goals, reduce process losses, and enhance group-level organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Our model presents testable propositions to guide empirical research on potentially positive effects of individual reduced face time on group outcomes.

Author-Name: Stefan Thau

Author-Name: Sabine Sczesny
Abstract: Three studies tested hypotheses derived from an integrative social exchange — attachment model suggesting that employees' trust in an organization or its authorities predicts antisocial work behaviors, which should be mediated by the extent to which employees feel attached to the organization and/or its members. Study 1 showed that perceptions of workgroup cohesion mediate the relationship between trust in senior management and antisocial work behaviors. Study 2 suggested that intentions to stay with the organization mediate the relationship between trust in supervisor and antisocial work behaviors. Study 3 found that the relationship between trust in organization and antisocial work behaviors was partially mediated by perceptions of workgroup cohesion. In sum, results provide converging evidence that trust relates to antisocial behaviors indirectly, through feelings of attachment to the organization and its members.

Abstract: Organizational-level stress management interventions are usually evaluated using quasi-experimental methods. In order to test intervention effectiveness, such methods examine the outcomes of between-group differences in intervention exposure: participants are rarely asked about their experiences of the intervention. However, this approach has been criticized because it provides little or no information about why interventions succeed or fail. The aim of this study was to examine whether an analysis of participants' narratives of what had happened during an organizational-level intervention might prove useful during evaluation. Nurses working in a UK hospital (n = 26) who had received an intervention to help them balance their administrative and clinical workloads, provided information about their experiences of it, and how these experiences were related to the effectiveness of the intervention. Template analysis of the data in their narratives identified codes relating to: i) intervention contexts (both p...

Title: Making career choice: A study of Chinese managers
Author-Name: Amy Lai Yu Wong
Abstract: Compared with the extensive research on managerial careers in the West, little has emerged from China and South-East Asia. This exploratory study used Schein's concept of Career Anchors to investigate how 117 Taiwanese managers made their initial career choice and the values which shaped their subsequent careers. The findings indicate how cultural specificity and political dynamics impacted on the managers' career experience. The Taiwanese subjects valued independence, a balanced lifestyle and entrepreneurial opportunities. The findings further indicate how career pathways can be of an individual's own making, embracing life in its broadest aspects and not exclusively forged within organizations. The study sheds light on the field of vocational choice and adjustment within the Chinese context.

Title: Lived experiences of offshoring: An examination of UK and Indian financial                 service employees' accounts of themselves and one another
Author-Name: Laurie Cohen
Author-Name: Amal El-Sawad
Abstract: This article is about employees' lived experiences of offshoring. Focusing on the accounts of individuals in a financial services company operating in the UK and in Mumbai, India, it examines the ways in which respondents constructed and positioned themselves in relation to one another in the stories they told. We argue that in their accounts our respondents mobilized discourses of culture and cultural difference to describe and justify this positioning, with particular reference to `the language barrier', work ethics and notions of competence. We draw three broad conclusions. The first is empirical and concerns the benefits of in-depth case study research for developing understandings of this emerging sector. The second conclusion relates to respondents' use of cultural ascriptions to justify certain existing patterns of behaviour, and to foreclose discussion of alternatives. The third conclusion highlights the deep sense of ambivalence that permeates our dataset, proposing that within this ambivalence l...

Title: The consequences of assistant roles in the public services: Degradation or empowerment?
Author-Name: Stephen Bach
Author-Name: Ian Kessler
Author-Name: Paul Heron
Abstract: This article considers whether and how shifts in the division of labour in the context of organizational change lead to the empowerment or degradation of workplace roles. It focuses on the emergence of assistants in the British public services and, in particular, whether this leads to the degradation or empowerment of those who fill the role and the professionals they work with. Concentrating upon assistant roles in education and social care, case study findings suggest that as these roles develop, the assistants themselves and their co-professionals are empowered to some degree both in terms of their work and employment conditions. However, it notes that these consequences are not unambiguously positive for the stakeholders and vary by sub-sector. The article lends support to those who have argued that changes in the division of labour result in blended and potentially contradictory outcomes for the workers involved. It also contributes to a literature which suggests that outcomes are contingent upon con...

Title: The transferability of management practices: Examining cross-national differences in reward preferences
Author-Name: Flora F.T. Chiang
Author-Name: Thomas Birtch
Abstract: This study examines the multi-dimensional nature of reward preferences (i.e. types, systems, and criteria) in the cross-border context, an area not sufficiently addressed by prior research. We found empirical evidence to suggest both similarities and differences in employee reward preferences. Although culture may impinge on reward preferences, this study suggests that its influence may be diminishing or giving way to a range of other contextual forces. Directions for future research are also presented.

Title: Resistance leadership: The overlooked potential in critical organization and leadership studies
Author-Name: Heather M. Zoller
Author-Name: Gail T. Fairhurst
Abstract: This article examines the role of leadership in mobilizing collective resistance in the workplace. Given the scarcity of dialogue between critical scholars and leadership studies, relatively little consideration is given to the role of leadership in resisting and potentially transforming structures of domination. The article describes some of the reasons why these areas of research have produced so little mutual work. We then make the argument that theories of leadership can be useful to the study of resistance by providing a grounded approach to theorizing agency, highlighting the role of mobilization and influence in change, and emphasizing participant attributions. In doing so, leadership studies gain important insights about the influence of deep structure power issues on perceptions of leaders, as well as material and symbolic limits on mobilization. The article adopts a dialectical perspective as a way of understanding issues of resistance leadership, and then discusses how existing literatures, rea...

Title: Playing tick-box games: Interrelating defences in professional appraisal
Author-Name: Gerry McGivern
Author-Name: Ewan Ferlie
Abstract: We here examine the introduction of appraisal for senior medical professionals. Our recent qualitative field research found four main experiences of appraisal (developmental, disappointed reflection, defensive assessment and cynical dismissal of appraisal as a waste of time), which we developed into a typology. We argue many professionals `play tick-box games' to give the impression of auditable practice while continuing to practise in a traditional way. We develop existing theory on the `audit society', social defences and `mock bureaucracy' to explain interrelating defences which occur in appraisal as a reaction to the risks and conflict experienced in professional regulation.

Title: Oedipus Rex at Enron: Leadership, Oedipal struggles, and organizational collapse
Author-Name: Mark Stein
Abstract: This article is intended to contribute to our understanding of the December 2001 collapse of Enron. The existing literature on Enron's demise falls largely into two broad areas, involving either `micro' psychological explanations or `macro' accounts that emphasize the workplace and its environment; this article is an exploratory study that focuses on a new interpretation which links the two areas more closely together. It is proposed that Enron's culture was influenced by both `micro' and `macro' factors: an experience of unsuccessful paternal authority figures within the family history of Enron's leaders, coupled with an experience of problematic government and regulatory regimes associated with the gas industry. Drawing on concepts from psychoanalysis and its application to organizational dynamics, it is argued that these `micro' and `macro' factors helped to generate an Oedipal mindset in Enron's leaders according to which external authority was seen to be weak and not worthy of respect, and that this ...

Title: Organization theory and the post-socialist transformation: Contributions to                 organizational knowledge
Author-Name: Anna Soulsby

Abstract: In unison with the authors of this special issue, we argue that organizational research in European post-socialist contexts over the last 17 years has made a significant and enduring contribution to organization theory. This proposition provides the rationale for the special issue, which focuses on the formative relationship between the body of organizational knowledge forged largely within stable western market-economies and the findings of organizational research conducted within institutionally unstable and ambiguous post-socialist environments. We develop our argument through three phases. First, we seek to clarify the reasons why the context and process of post-socialism have posed special challenges to the conventional wisdom of `western' organization theory. Second, we review post-socialist organizational research and consider how it has augmented our understanding of organizational structures and processes. Third, we place the five articles that comprise this special issue within this wider contex...

Title: Property rules: State fragmentation, industry heterogeneity and property                 rights in the Russian oil industry, 1992—2006
Author-Name: Olga Suhomlinova
Abstract: The study examines the interdependence between the state and organizations and develops a proposition that the fragmentation of state structure and industry heterogeneity (defined as the number of organizations and organizational forms) are mutually conducive. The investigation focuses on property rights as an important arena of state—organization interaction and explores how, through the development of rules regarding obJect, subJect, use, enforcement and transfer of property, the state and the industry shape each other. Case study analysis of the Russian oil industry in 1992—2006 shows how the property rights relations between the state and the oil industry affected the U-shaped traJectories of change both in the state structure (from increasing to decreasing fragmentation on spatial and functional dimensions) and in the industry structure (from increasing to decreasing heterogeneity).

Title: Persistent unemployment and passive policies: Politics and institutional                 change in post-communist Poland
Author-Name: Dana L. Brown
Abstract: This article explains Poland's approach to unemployment in the postcommunist era as a case of path dependency, driven by institutionalized practices and cultures in key domestic policy-making organizations. The roots of Poland's passive and benefits-based unemployment policy are traced to the period immediately following regime change, which is defined as a critical juncture in social and economic policy-making. Policy choices in this period reflected the predominant reliance on market mechanisms to improve welfare. These choices have been reproduced over time despite widespread agreement that unemployment policies in Poland are failing both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: We use a cross-case analysis of four Russian oil majors to develop a framework explaining the relationship between exploitation and exploration learning, and the development of organizational capabilities in transition economies. Our research explains how the changing top management style influences organizational learning over time. In the first stage of organizational transformation an authoritarian management style initiates a break with the administrative heritage of the organization to facilitate exploitation learning and the development of operational capabilities. These are required for survival in the new conditions of a market economy. In the second stage a more participatory management style fosters exploration learning and the development of strategic flexibility, required for sustainable competitive advantage. We demonstrate that exploitation and exploration learning do not coexist in the initial stages of transformation but are sequential. We found that the western-derived constructs of organ...

Title: Overlapping effects: Path dependence and path generation in management and                 organization in Russia
Author-Name: Gregory Schwartz
Author-Name: Leo McCann
Abstract: An important contribution to our understanding of management transformation in post-socialist societies has been made by new institutionalism. The strength of this approach derives from its critique of normative models based on neo-classical economics, which has tended towards institutional and management voluntarism. It has been able to grasp complexity in societies undergoing structural change, stressing that path dependence in property, political and social structures helps to define business organization. The limitation of new institutionalism lies in its tendency to overstate institutional stasis, failing to treat (national) institutions as contradictory and transient (localized) expressions of global processes. Based on extensive qualitative data, our article extends the understanding of path-dependence. Rather than dispensing with key insights of new institutionalism, we bridge the notion of path dependence with the contradictory processes of institutional reshaping and adaptation. Using an adapted...

Title: Transition and organizational dissonance in Serbia
Author-Name: Graham Hollinshead
Author-Name: Mairi Maclean
Abstract: This study reveals and analyses contradictory narrative voices within a local enterprise in the troubled Balkan region, recently acquired by a multinational enterprise. We employ case study research methods informed by semi-structured interviews with management and worker representatives to expose underlying and conflicting rationalities relating to the upgrading of technological and work systems, as a management-led response to growing market pressures. Recognition of the post-socialist enterprise as a site of political contestation and social fragmentation serves to frustrate broader aspirations of policy-makers towards early transitional closure, and limits the potential applicability of linear western conceptions of organizational change to transitional realities. The Serbian case presents an extreme variant of other, post-socialist contexts, institutionally volatile and politically charged. In an increasingly unbounded, indeterministic world, however, it emerges as potentially archetypal, thus enhanc...

Title: From prophets to profits: The occupational rhetoric of management consultants
Author-Name: Jim Kitay
Author-Name: Christopher Wright
Abstract: In this article we explore the construction of occupational identity amongst a new and significant occupation: management consultants. Extending a conceptual framework developed by Fine (1996), we argue that occupational identity is not a consistent whole, but constructed from imagery to interpret and manage situations commonly experienced by occupational members. We argue that consultants, as an occupation, face three key structural constraints as features of their work, which we term, legitimacy, efficiency and vulnerability. On the basis of our interview data, we identify five social roles around which occupational `rhetorics' are constructed — professional, prophet, partner, business person, and service worker. We explore how consultants use these rhetorics to respond to issues of legitimacy, efficiency and vulnerability, and also highlight how different imagery is used based on its situational salience.

Title: Co-workers who telework and the impact on those in the office: Understanding the implications of virtual work for co-worker satisfaction and turnover intentions
Author-Name: Timothy Golden
Abstract: Telework and other forms of virtual work have experienced dramatic growth over the last decade. While research is beginning to understand its impacts on teleworkers themselves, studies to date have not looked at its effect on those who remain in the office. This study therefore shifts the focus to non-teleworkers in offices where telework is present, to investigate if the prevalence of teleworkers in an office impacts the work outcomes of non-teleworkers. Using a sample of 240 professional employees, results suggest teleworker prevalence is negatively associated with co-worker satisfaction, and that this relationship is influenced by the amount of time co-workers telework, the extent of face-to-face interactions, and job autonomy. Moreover, a non-teleworker's satisfaction with co-workers was also found to be negatively associated with turnover intentions. Together, results suggest the need to consider the full range of telework's impacts including the potential adverse consequences for non-teleworkers.

Title: Lacanian theory's contribution to the study of workplace envy
Author-Name: Bénédicte Vidaillet
Abstract: In this article, we wish to develop further the reflection undertaken by the few authors who have started using Lacan's theories in their research on organizations. We suggest that using a framework based on Lacanian theory can help us better understand workplace envy, which is such a complex emotion, and better integrate the existing studies on organizational envy. Our analysis is based on a clinical case study. Whereas Kleinian theory sees envy as involving two subjects, Lacanian theory approaches envy as a triangular relationship between an envied subject and a quasi similar envious person, watched (approvingly/disapprovingly) by a `big Other'. This theory helps understand that envy and narcissism are related and that they originate at the stage in psychic development that Lacan calls the `mirror stage'. Whereas the Kleinian approach highlights the differences between the Envious and the Envied and the position of dependence of one on the other, Lacanian theory outlines the role of the `double', the sy...

Title: 'Othering' older worker identity in recruitment
Author-Name: Kathleen Riach
Abstract: Current research into organizational age discrimination has placed a focus on the consequences of ageism and economic pressures of an ageing workforce, rather than endeavouring to understand the social processes that create and reproduce ageist ideologies within an organizational context. This article departs from mainstream approaches within age and employment studies in order to explore older worker identity as a discursive phenomenon. Analysis shows how the social construction of the `older worker' may in itself serve to marginalize and contribute towards age inequalities through three discursive strategies: contextualizing the problem, essentializing older worker characteristics and ventriloquizing the older worker. The conclusions seek to situate these findings within larger political and practitioner debates concerning the older worker agenda and how distancing the older worker from chronological or biological determinism may serve to further our understanding of organizational age inequality as a s...

Abstract: The present study tested por tions of an expanded Ferris and Judge (1991) framework regarding influence processes in human resources decisions and actions.

Online questionnaires were used to collect data from full-time, non-faculty employees of a large south-eastern US public university. To avoid problems associated with common method variance resulting from same source data, supervisors rated subordinates on outcome measures and subordinates supplied data on predictors. The final sample was comprised of a matched dyadic data set of 291 subordinates and their supervisors. Results indicated support for the hypotheses. Specifically, political skill was found to directly relate to the use of rationality and moderate the positive relationship between rationality and two supervisory perceptions known to affec...

Abstract: Small firms account for a substantial proportion of employment in advanced economies; yet understanding of the quality of jobs in them remains poor. Studies using national-level data find that indicators such as autonomy are high but find it hard to say why. Analyses within small firms stress the structuring of jobs and not size as such. Data from 384 employees in small firms from three contrasting sectors are used to test three hypotheses. 1) There is a pure size effect; such an effect was found in such areas as good relations with managers, and explained in terms of the informality of small firms. 2) Size is in fact a proxy for other influences; there was little evidence of this. 3) Factors not associated with size are more important; features such as autonomy and work pressure reflected sectoral differences and not size. Overall, qualified size effects were found, suggesting the continuation of traditional small-firm relationships.

Abstract: Understanding innovation in the biomedical field requires an appreciation of its highly interactive nature and of the many professional and organizational boundaries that create barriers to interaction and the sharing of knowledge. Yet, research to date has directed much less attention to understanding the intricacies of interactive biomedical innovation in practice, than it has to exploring the factors influencing innovation at an institutional level. Drawing upon empirical research and taking an approach informed by symbolic interactionism and a practice-based perspective on knowledge and learning, this article offers insights into the processes involved in supporting knowledge sharing by focusing on `objects' and the varying roles they play (instrumental and symbolic) in enabling (or potentially disabling) interaction amongst groups and organizations involved in biomedical innovation projects.

Abstract: We analyse the corpus of CEO letters to stockholders that were signed by a widely revered business leader, Jack Welch, during his tenure as CEO of the General Electric Company [GE], 1981—2000. Our discussion is located within theory pertaining to transformational leadership. We examine Welch's language from the standpoint of how transformational leadership can be conceived as a rhetorical artefact of one-sided dialogue emanating from a powerful leader. We give particular attention to the saturation of Welch's discourse with metaphors, and argue that metaphors illuminate how transformational leadership and the accompanying construct of charisma manifest themselves in practice. Five root metaphors that heightened Welch's persuasive and rhetorical impact on his audience are identified and discussed: Welch as pedagogue , physician, architect, commander and saint . We advocate greater awareness of the rhetorical techniques employed by transformational leaders in attempts to broker compliance with their views.

Title: The development of a process model of collective turnover
Author-Name: Jean M. Bartunek
Author-Name:  Zhi Huang
Author-Name: Ian J. Walsh
Abstract: Based on three case studies, we constructed an inductive process model of collective turnover, those instances in organizational life when two or more people choose to leave their organization in close temporal proximity based on shared social processes. The model highlights three phases through which an escalating interaction process that culminates in collective turnover unfolds. First, two or more members of an organizational group experience unresolved dissatisfaction with some aspect of their organization. Second, individual negative experiences are transformed into shared group perceptions through group sensemaking and emotional contagion that occurs in cohesive groups that view themselves as superior to others. Third, when group members feel no hope of improvement but have other opportunities available and few constraints on leaving, they collectively decide to leave their organization, begin searching for placements, and, turn over. We propose theoretical and practical implications of this model.

Abstract: The extensive criticism of the integrative `shared values' view of culture has prompted many researchers to argue that one way of advancing culture research is by examining the ways different subcultures interact in organizational settings. However, existing studies in this area generally explore the nature of subcultures and the differences between them. The findings from a study of two large healthcare organizations suggest that greater insights can be generated into organizational subcultures by studying doctors, nurses and non-clinical managers through multiple analytical lenses. Such analyses help to uncover the wide variation in subcultural values, norms and assumptions, revealing those that are shared, those that differ and those that are characterized by ambiguity both within and across subcultures. It is argued that this approach reveals interesting insights into the dynamics of subcultures and the ways in which different subcultures interpret and respond to management initiated changes designed ...

Title: The volunteer stages and transitions model: Organizational socialization of volunteers

Abstract: In the last two decades knowledge on volunteering has significantly expanded, but a thorough understanding of the organizational socialization of volunteers is still lacking: the process through which one learns the job, internalizes organizational values and goals, and becomes an effective and involved volunteer. By performing an ethnographic study with Israeli volunteers working for at-risk youth, the organizational process was portrayed. The Volunteering Stages and Transitions Model (VSTM) presented in this article indicates five different phases in volunteers' socialization (nominee, newcomer, emotional involvement, established volunteering and retiring). The importance of the model lies in the way it explains transitions between the phases and details the process, experiences, and emotions involved in each phase. The transformation is reflected in different aspects related to volunteer work: activity and training; emotions and perceptions; attitudes and behavior; perceived benefits and costs; and rel...

Title: The language of teamwork: Reproducing professional divisions in the operating theatre
Author-Name: Rachael Finn
Abstract: Bringing together arguments from organizational studies and medical sociology, this study views teamwork as a discursive resource through which the social world is constituted in particular ways. Drawing upon an ethnographic case study of the operating theatre department, the nature and effects of these constitutive practices are examined. Significantly, this article argues that rather than unifying the professions, teamwork produces unintended divisive effects. Teamwork is used to promote unity, whilst at the same time pursuing divergent professional interests around the nature of collectivity. Employing distinct interpretive repertoires, professions construct different versions of team work and make competing legitimacy claims. These discursive practices both reflect and reproduce structural inequality between the professions. Ultimately, the privileged position of surgeons and anaesthetists over nurses and operating department practitioners is legitimated and maintained. This discursive action has far-...

Title: Post-socialist segmented capitalism: The case of Hungary. Developing business systems theory
Author-Name: Roderick Martin
Abstract: The article uses business systems theory to analyse post-socialist Central and Eastern Europe, focusing on Hungary. The article briefly reviews five models of post-socialist capitalism — liberal market, coordinated market, heterarchy, neo-colonial and comparative business systems. The article identifies four critical features of postsocialist transformation: asset ownership, capital accumulation, access to local, national and international production systems and the degree of differentiation between state and economy. Four groups — state, privatized, de novo and international — are identified in Hungary, whose business system is segmented, exhibiting a low level of integration. This segmentation is linked to the legacies of socialism, the political history of the transition, including the international context, and uneven post-socialist economic development. The article closes with a plea for `more history and less systems' in the comparative analysis of capitalisms.

Title: Examining contemporary careers: A call for interdisciplinary inquiry
Author-Name: Michael B. Arthur
Abstract: This article describes an urgent need for interdisciplinary careers research in the emerging global knowledge economy. It begins by identifying a range of traditions in careers research, including both occupational and organizational research traditions from professional schools of education and management. It proceeds by offering a view on contemporary careers, and examining three directions for contemporary careers research — reflecting what organizational careers scholars see, what other organizational scholars see, and what is suggested by evidence on the knowledge economy — while leaving the door open for others to join the conversation by suggesting further research directions. The article then turns to propose three topics for future interdisciplinary research collaboration: a more accessible definition of career, application of contrasting methodologies and adoption of wider research agendas. The overall message is for careers scholars to become both more collaborative and more `imaginative' in th...

Abstract: Using identity theory and the gender role framework, this study examined the interactive effects of family identity salience, family-interference-with-work (FIW), and gender on two outcome variables: job satisfaction and job distress. Results from a sample of 163 employees support the proposed buffering hypothesis for job distress and job satisfaction, such that individuals who experienced a high level of FIW reported more job distress and less job satisfaction only when they were low in family identity salience. Additionally, we found support for a three-way interaction, such that the two-way interactive effects of family identity salience and FIW on job satisfaction were stronger for women than for men. Theoretical and practical implications of the results, as well as directions for future research, are discussed.

Abstract: The May 1996 `disaster' on Mount Everest in which eight mountaineers died and its subsequent media exposure is re-examined from the perspective of discourse, myth, and spectacle. We draw from Foucault to talk about the disciplinary aspects of the discourse of `disaster and tragedy', and how Jon Krakauer's Into thin air, as the leading text in this episode, has perpetuated explanations of disaster that are rooted primarily in notions of failed leadership and decision-making, dysfunctional group dynamics, flawed personality, and the absence of appropriate planning and control. We also discuss how, in part through this discourse, the May 1996 episode has evolved into myth and spectacle that have spawned even more fantastic spectacles while being devoid of contextual influences and the voices of other silent members (Sherpas and participants on the climb). By considering other contextual variables and listening to other voices, we try to unpack the dominant narrative and show how it has both entertained and s...

Title: Institutionalizing change in a high-technology optronics company: The role of information and communication technologies
Author-Name: Niall Hayes
Abstract: This study examines how the introduction of a collaborative technology was utilized by some institutional groups to assert their dominance over other groups during boundary crossing encounters. To do this we detail an in-depth case study of the introduction of a collaborative workflow technology in a high-technology optronics company. The workflow technology sought to establish accountabilities and responsibilities, and engender quicker lines of communication between functions. Conceptually we draw on social constructivist literature on institutional theory and argue that in addition to looking to the broad socio-economic context, institutional change needs to be understood by attending to the fine-grained practices that are undertaken by staff in organizations. Specifically we will add to the limited accounts that have considered the ways in which ICTs are inextricably interlinked with institutionalization processes.

Title: David against Goliath? Group size and bystander effects in virtual knowledge sharing
Author-Name: Sven C. Voelpel
Author-Name: Robert A. Eckhoff
Author-Name: Jens Förster
Abstract: Knowledge management has been identified as a key factor for sustaining a competitive advantage in today's corporate world. A fundamental aspect of knowledge management in a global economy is the sharing of information in online groups. Most researchers and practitioners have so far assumed that a large knowledge sharing group increases response rates, velocity of receiving a response and quality. However, psychological research under the umbrella of the so-called bystander effect suggests counter-intuitively that, with an increase in group size, the likelihood of helping decreases. This study provides empirical support for the fact that a) the bystander effect is also present in virtual (knowledge sharing) environments, b) that group size influences response quality and c) that the negative impact of social inhibition might decrease again in very large groups. The practical trade-offs that managers have to take into account when designing knowledge sharing forums are discussed.

Abstract: In this article we theorize the early moments of non-isomorphic institutional change. In avoiding the `hero imagery' of the individual institutional entrepreneur we emphasize the role of different actors and broader historical processes in explaining the substantive changes and developments in the superyacht industry between the late 1960s and early 1980s. Particular attention is given to explaining the significance of entrepreneurialism, opposition, opportunity creation and change consumption during the early moments of de- and pre-institutionalization. Broader processes of consumption, authentication, regulation and technological development are also key. In summary, the article demonstrates the value of a relational approach for understanding institutionalization.

Author-Name: Michael Humphreys
Abstract: In this article we examine accounts of emotional experiences in one organization. Drawing upon data from interviews across a range of employees, we analyse aspects of emotion, identity and power. Adopting a constructionist perspective we use a method of discourse analysis to analyse how participants constructed emotions according to tacitly understood rules regarding appropriate emotional displays. These rules were made visible through an examination of the participants' positioning strategies as they described emotional experiences. Our findings suggest that, rather than an institutionally held level of appropriate articulations of emotionality, there was a role-related, socially located rule system linked to separate categories of teachers, managers and administrative employees. The contribution of the article is threefold. First, we use in-depth case data from 44 semi-structured interviews to analyse how teachers and managers/administrators in a UK-based further education (FE) college constructed emoti...

Title: Negative emotions in supervisory relationships: The role of relational models
Author-Name: Annilee M. Game
Abstract: The reasons why supervisory/line management relationships are one of the most frequently cited causes of workplace negative emotions are poorly understood. Existing research on emotions at work provides some clues but largely omits the role of relational context. Drawing on attachment theory, the present research develops a model suggesting that employees hold differing relational models of their supervisory relationship in conjunction with global relational models that they bring with them to the workplace. Together, these relational models are associated with different interpretations of supervisor behaviour, which in turn are associated with differences in emotional reactions. The model was tested with a survey of 174 nurses employed in a UK NHS Trust. Some support was found for the propositions. The research highlights that in order to understand why negative emotions occur in supervisory relationships it is important to examine affective events within the historical relational context in which they o...

Abstract: Despite the importance of groups in the workplace and the demand from workers for a fun work environment, there is no model that explains how successful organizational humor can impact work groups. The purpose of this article is to present a model, based on Hackman's framework of group effectiveness, that can be used to understand the relationship between successful organizational humor and group effectiveness. We explore the ability of successful organizational humor to influence groups through its positive impact on group productivity, viability and learning. Based on the literature from several disciplines, we propose that successful organizational humor can have a positive impact on a variety of group processes (e.g. effective communication, development of group goals, management of emotion, etc.) and outcomes (e.g. group productivity, group viability, and development of group members), which contribute to overall group effectiveness. The model has the potential to both advance theory on organizationa...

Title: The ambivalent dynamics of loyalty in mentorship
Author-Name: Bonnie D. Oglensky
Abstract: This investigation shows that mentorship loyalty is an ambivalent source of tension in the relationship. Data from in-depth interviews show that the mentoring attachment that is rooted in a protective, devoted, affectionate side of loyalty can also compel conformity, suppress dissent, and curb professional growth. The ambivalence stirred up by loyalty issues manifests itself in the nuts and bolts of ordinary interaction. Consideration about what each party `does' for the other, what they are willing to give up or sacrifice for the other, and what each party comes to expect from the other in return evoke conflicts between strategic, emotional, and normative strivings. Ritualized expressions of loyalty — involving material and emotional work — reflect the asymmetry in the mentor—protégé authority relationship. Implications for mentoring theory and practice are discussed.

Title: The later Foucault in organization and management studies
Author-Name: Edward Barratt
Abstract: This article reviews the use of the later Foucault in organization and management studies. Offering an evaluation of readings of the later writing, we comment on arguments for re-focusing on genealogical criticism, for an alternative Foucauldian politics of the workplace and a form of practical criticism sometimes derived from the later writing. A key aim is to attempt to open up new directions for critical inquiry drawing on other ways of reading Foucault. If genealogy is to be installed as a vital resource for critique, there appears to be a need for renewal. On the question of political alternatives, we comment on the ambiguities and silences — especially the historical silences — of the later Foucault's interpreters. A style of practical criticism inferred from readings of the later writing should not, we suggest, be accepted without qualification.

Title: Investors in People and training in the British SME sector
Author-Name: Kim Hoque
Author-Name: Nicolas Bacon
Abstract: Successive UK governments have encouraged small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to pursue Investors in People (IiP) recognition in order to increase levels of employer-provided training in the sector. Using data from the 1998 and 2004 Workplace Employment Relations Surveys, this article reports the extent of change in the proportion of workplaces in small, medium and large firms with IiP recognition and assesses the relationship between IiP and training activity. The analysis reveals an increase in the proportion of workplaces in medium-sized firms with recognition but no increase in the proportion of workplaces in small or large firms with recognition. With regard to the relationship between IiP and training activity, a positive association is found in large firms where both managers/ professionals and non-managers are concerned. In medium-sized firms, however, IiP is only associated with higher levels of non-management training, and in small firms, it is only associated with higher levels of managem...

Abstract: Our study responds to a call for research to integrate institutional, organizational and individual levels of analysis in examining the implications for work and employment relations of new organizational forms. We empirically examine the implementation of network forms of genetics healthcare delivery that cross organizational and professional boundaries. We highlight that less powerful professional groups may find difficulty in enacting boundary-spanning roles associated with new organizational forms. This is due, first, to inconsistency of government policy, which fragments organizations. Second, professional institutions sustain professional hierarchy and power differentials.

Title: Strategy-as-practice and dynamic capabilities: Steps towards a dynamic view of strategy
Author-Name: Patrick Regnér
Abstract: This article identifies an essential research area where a strategy-as-practice approach can make important contributions to the strategic management field: the dynamic process through which organizational assets are developed. It compares strategy-as-practice and dynamic capabilities perspectives and demonstrates how the former may complement the latter in analyzing activities that underpin and may create and modify organizational assets. Several distinct features of the practice approach are identified as fertile ground for examining the micro-foundations of strategy dynamics. It is demonstrated how activity configurations, socio-cultural embeddedness, co-evolution, social interactions, the inclusion of multiple strategists and an awareness of the importance of imagination can complement the dynamic capabilities perspective and may provide suggestions for a dynamic view more generally.

Title: Managerialism, the therapeutic habitus and the self in contemporary organizing
Author-Name: Bogdan Costea
Author-Name: Norman Crump
Author-Name: Kostas Amiridis
Abstract: Over the last two decades, managerialism (Enteman, 1993) has become consolidated on multiple fronts. As a formula of governance, it has elaborated various vocabularies: the `audit society' (Power, 1997, 2007) has become entrenched in all types of organizations; surveillance methods (Lyon, 2001) have become increasingly dispersed and insidious; and — alongside —`new' concepts of subjectivity and the`self' are used to frame more intense regimes of self-discipline or what Tipton (1984) called `self-work'. These moves have been captured by Heelas (2002), Thrift (1997) and others in the term `soft capitalism'. In this article, we reflect upon this phenomenon by analysing some examples: `culture', `performativity', `knowledge' and `wellness'. Although they belong to a group often described as `fads' and `fashions' and dismissed as managerial `mumbo-jumbo', we suggest that their proliferation indicates a more stable cultural tendency of management discourses to capture subjectivity in its general agenda. We atte...

Abstract: Comment on the organizational consequences of the new information and communications technologies (ICTs) is pervaded by the idea that `virtual' forms of production are synonymous with disaggregation and the `end' of bureaucracy. This article takes issue with this view, drawing on case study analysis of the British Library (BL) to show the ways in which bureaucratic modes of governance are shaping scholarly access to information resources. This research produces two main findings, each of which has a strong bearing on virtualization and the theme of `governance in transition'. First, radically decentralized `virtual' forms of service delivery are dependent on heavily`managed' forms of capacity-building and information aggregation. Second, the digitization initiatives explored in the case study are embedded in an inherently contested and contradictory context of institutional change. Current developments in the management and control of digital rights are consistent with the commodification of the public sp...

Abstract: How are markets developed and governed? The article reviews four perspectives on the formation and development of markets and market governance — the political perspective (Fligstein), the network perspective (White), the framing perspective (Callon) and the soft law/expert power perspective (Slaughter). It then utilizes these perspectives in order to understand the development of the market for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. It finds that this market was stabilized and governed through the operation of all of these features — power, networks, framing and expert power. The International Swaps and Dealers Association (ISDA) to which all market participants belong has played a central role in this process. It has created a Master Agreement that is the common basis to all OTC derivative contracts across the world and seeks to overcome potentially problematic areas such as netting and collateral. It brings together all market participants and uses their expertise within its committees to develop new rule...

Author-Name: Jonathan Morris
Author-Name: John Hassard
Author-Name: Leo McCann
Abstract: This article identifies two, nation-wide, forms of governance or organizing capital,`shareholder' capitalism and `managerial' capitalism, epitomized by the USA and Japan respectively. Furthermore, it identifies the implications for managers in these systems. The article argues that both varieties of capitalism have been forced to modify, due to pressures from globalization. Shareholder capitalism in the USA has been intensified with an even greater emphasis on `shareholder value'. In Japan, meanwhile, poor national economic performance has led to pressures upon managerial capitalism to take on features more akin to the shareholder variety. Such pressures have been transmitted to managers with a more intensified work regime. However, many of the HRM features of the Japanese model remain, despite these pressures.

Title: Executive pay and the search for legitimacy: An investigation into how UK                 Remuneration Committees use corporate performance comparisons in long-term incentive                 pay decisions
Author-Name: Stuart Ogden
Author-Name: Robert Watson
Abstract: This article draws on case studies from five of the UK privatized water plcs in order to examine how Remuneration Committees operationalized and justified their executive long-term incentive pay (LTIP) schemes. The article uses these as `revelatory' examples to illuminate how problematic decisions about executive pay can be. The water plc Remuneration Committees, concerned about potential stakeholder criticism, devoted considerable time and resources to ensure that their choice of LTIP comparators and performance metrics would be regarded as legitimate. The difficulties they encountered in pursuing this illustrate the underlying indeterminacy and incoherence of normative guidelines for implementing good governance in these substantive areas of executive remuneration. The article analyses this in terms of institutional incompleteness and argues that the resulting uncertainty creates theoretical as well as practical issues for resolving debates about what constitutes good governance.

Title: Leadership: A categorical mistake?
Author-Name: Simon Kelly
Abstract: As growing numbers of scholars become disaffected by the research traditions laid down by leadership psychology, there is a steady turn towards treating leadership as a discursive phenomenon. In response, leadership researchers are increasingly adopting interpretive and observational methods in the search for the practices of leadership in everyday life. This article suggests that while there are many advantages to an interest in discourse and action, there are also many subtle difficulties in making leadership observable and knowable in the field. Taking Louis Pondy's notion of leadership as a language-game as its starting point, this article argues that leadership studies as a discipline suffers from a persistent category mistake; a category mistake that some recent interpretive studies of leadership reveal, but inadvertently reproduce in the search for leadership's essential character. Instead, this article takes Pondy's thesis to its logical conclusion and outlines a programme of research that confron...

Author-Name: D. Brian McNatt
Author-Name: Timothy A. Judge
Abstract: Based on self-efficacy theory, this field experiment provides a test of the effectiveness of a non-fictitious self-efficacy intervention on bolstering professionals' job attitudes (i.e. job satisfaction, commitment, and intention to quit) and reducing turnover. Seventy-one newcomer and recent insider financial accounting auditors were randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. Results showed that the self-efficacy intervention consisting of an interview and subsequent written communications from firm management augmented auditors' self-efficacy and raised the job attitudes of insiders, and reduced insiders' turnover five months later. Organizations and organizational research often focus on newcomers; however, the results of our experiment suggest that recent insiders may be a high-potential and yet underutilized target for job attitude and retention interventions.

Title: How are management fashions institutionalized? The role of institutional work
Author-Name: Markus Perkmann
Author-Name: André Spicer
Abstract: We explore how transitory management fashions become institutionalized. Based on the concepts of institutional entrepreneurship and institutional work, we postulate that fashionable management practices acquire permanence when they are anchored within fieldwide institutions. The building of such institutions requires various types of institutional work, including political work, technical work and cultural work. Based on a review of the empirical literature on various management fashions, we identify the actors engaging in these different types of works, and their skills. Our results suggest that the institutionalization effect is stronger if more types of institutional work are deployed and if the skill sets of the involved actors vary. We also argue that institutional construction in the case of management fashions is likely to take the form of decentralized `partaking' rather than being led by a single dominant institutional entrepreneur. We conclude with implications for the study of management fashio...

Title: A transmutation theory of inter-organizational exchange relations and networks: Applying critical realism to analysis of collective agency
Author-Name: Steve Vincent
Abstract: This article outlines a critical realist approach to inter-organizational relations and networks. It reviews existing criticisms of the main theoretical contributions within this substantive topic area and argues that most have explained outcomes by referring to the structural antecedents that condition the different contexts which actors behave within. This downplays the impact of social processes and how these are shaped by the behavioural orientations of actors within these structures. Critical realism can be used to address this limitation. It provides a perspective on agency and social process that facilitates sophisticated analyses of the behavioural orientations of actors and how these combine to condition processes and outcomes. A three-step approach to analysing inter-organizational relations and networks is outlined and case study data are used in the effort to demonstrate that this approach is less susceptible to the existing criticisms of the field.

Title: Coping processes linking the demands-control-support model, affect and risky                 decisions at work
Author-Name: Kevin Daniels
Author-Name: Nick Beesley

Author-Name: Varuni Wimalasiri
Abstract: As a model of job design, the demands-control-support model (DCSM) indicates that dynamic processes involving individual agency underpin the effects of job characteristics. Specifically, the DCSM indicates that control and social support facilitate effective coping with work demands. To examine such processes in detail, 32 nuclear design engineers participated in an experience sampling study (number of observations = 456). Findings indicate that enacting problem-focused coping by control and support across situations may be beneficial for affect. Problem-focused coping enacted by control was also related to fewer decisions that bear risks to design safety. Although higher levels of risky decisions were related to consistent use of emotional-approach enacted by control coping across situations, this form of coping used in specific demanding episodes was related to less cognitive error and fewer risky decisions two hours later. Emotional-approach enacted through support in specific episodes had a mixed patt...

Title: Every bite you take . . . food and the struggles of embodied subjectivity in organizations
Author-Name: Michaela Driver
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to offer new insights on subjectivity in organizations by examining discourses of food and their implications for how the self is constructed and embodied at work. To this end, empirical material, consisting of 35 narratives about food in organizations, is explored from different vantage points including hermeneutic, critical, postmodern and psychoanalytic perspectives. Themes examined include discourses in which food practices are associated with social activities and organizational care but also with controlling the self and others and as embodied performances of conflicting ethics of production and consumption. The implications of the various perspectives are discussed highlighting the role of food discourse for more creative embodiments of subjectivity in organizations.

Title: Manna from heaven: The exuberance of food as a topic for research in management and organization
Author-Name: Miguel Pina e Cunha

Author-Name: Stewart Clegg
Abstract: Organizations have, in the past, often been discussed as if they were Cartesian mentalities, planning agendas, learning from doing, processing information, reducing equivocality, mimicking and copying, floating disembodiedly apart from the actors who work in these organizations. We are offered representations of organizations as organically grounded metaphors that minimize the biological facticity of employees: namely, their need for food. While the inputs to organizations conceived as if they were quasi-systems are well explored, and the emotional and `irrational' side of organizations is increasingly discussed, the necessity of inputs to the biological systems that staff them is not. Nonetheless, despite the lack of explicit scholarly attention to food at work, its importance guarantees its hidden presence in the organizational literature, often in the context of more `serious' themes. We identify four approaches to the relationship between food, work and organization. For dessert, we propose a research...

Title: The regulation of smoking at work
Author-Name: Joanna Brewis
Author-Name: Christopher Grey
Abstract: Smoking was for most of the 20th century a normal part of everyday life in western society, including work organizations. Within a very short space of time it has become much less acceptable in the workplace and, in many countries, banned altogether. Why has this happened? This article seeks to answer this question. Although the main legislative basis of these bans is the health and safety of employees, we argue that the issues at stake are in fact more complex. Smoking, we contend, should be understood as a practice with diverse cultural meanings, and its regulation located within the context of a longstanding and dynamic moral discourse, of which scientific and medical discourse is only one aspect. In so doing we seek to open up a significant gap in the social scientific and organization studies literature for future analysis.

Title: Eating with the Mafia: Belonging and violence
Author-Name: Martin Parker
Abstract: This article presents a reading of the place of food in a variety of texts which concern the Mafia. In many organizations, food often seems to be symbolically deployed as a representation of community through commensality. However, in the Mafia, unlike many contemporary organizations, food preparation and consumption appears not to be relegated to liminal times and spaces, but to be a central part of being a Mafiosi. The article explores this idea in terms of the connections between metaphors of community and family in the Mafia and in legal business organizations, and then the tensions between community and violence in the Mafia and in legal business organizations. After a consideration of the partial dislocation of women and food in the Mafia, the article concludes with some reflections on organizations and belonging.

Abstract: Although organizational researchers have gained in terms of different perspectives of thought and reflexivity regarding the subject of organizational culture, they have neglected studying the embodied dimension of organizational culture. The purpose of this article is to use embodiment perspective to enlighten understanding of organizational culture. We do that by giving special attention to: a) a pioneering empirical anthropological study that deals with the culture—embodiment relationship and b) an organizational ethnography in which work colleagues engage in the after-work beer drinking ritual. This double emphasis suggests that organizational life become first meaningful in the experiential immediacy of employees and organization. In this very moment organizational culture signification is not yet representational, but perceptual. Thus, the main contribution of this research is to show that organizational culture is more than a cognitive-representational abstraction: it is also a perceptual-embodied e...

Title: Making sense of sensemaking narratives
Author-Name: Andrew D. Brown
Author-Name: Patrick Stacey
Author-Name: Joe Nandhakumar
Abstract: This article analyses the agreed and discrepant sensemaking of members of a project team. Embedded in a narratological approach to sensemaking research, we argue that before scholars may be able to understand in detail how agreements are reached and action becomes coordinated, we need first to take seriously the proposition that sensemaking occurs in the context of individuals' idiosyncratic efforts at identity construction. This, we suggest, means attending to the narratives that actors tell about their work and self both for others and their selves. The key research contribution that we make is to demonstrate how work on `impression management' and `attributional egotism' may be employed in order to account for discrepant sensemaking. This is important in the context of a literature that has left relatively unexplored the reasons why people interpret differently experiences they have in common.

Title: Reinventing human resource management: Business partners, internal consultants and the limits to professionalization
Author-Name: Christopher Wright
Abstract: The status of human resource management (HRM) and its standing as a managerial profession has been a recurring concern for practitioners over time. In recent years, a normative discourse has developed which asserts that the path to improved status for HR `professionals' involves reinvention of their role as `business partners' and `internal consultants' promoting enterprise competitiveness. This article examines how HR managers interpret this new role and whether the internalization of this model results in an increase in professional identity. The findings suggest that while many gain greater self-esteem and organizational status from the identity and role of business partner/internal consultant, this does not equate to a broader identity as a member of an HR `profession'. Two developments are central here. First, the focus on the business partner/ internal consultancy role has served to undermine any pretence to a unitary and cohesive occupational identity, as the bifurcation between routine transaction...

Title: Elucidating the bonds of workplace humor: A relational process model
Author-Name: Cecily Cooper
Abstract: A number of studies have demonstrated that humor can impact both horizontal and vertical relationships in organizations, but little is known about the interpersonal processes underlying this link. By integrating theory and research from the fields of philosophy, social psychology, communications, and leadership, it is possible to illuminate a combination of processes which, considered collectively, explain humor's ability to create, maintain, impede, or destroy relationships at work. I first review the classical theories of humor, which explain what motivates individuals to express humor and what determines humor enjoyment. However, since these frameworks focus on humor at the individual-level of analysis, they cannot speak to the social processes involved in a humor exchange. Research in the fields of social psychology, communications, and leadership provides insight regarding the remaining social mechanisms. In sum, it appears that interpersonal humor operates through four related but distinct processes...

Title: The politics of gossip and denial in interorganizational relations
Author-Name: Ad van Iterson
Author-Name: Stewart R. Clegg
Abstract: Organizational gossip has largely been discussed in terms of effects at the individual level. In this article we turn our attention to the organization level. The article makes a research contribution that addresses gossip that spreads fact-based rumours about organizations in terms of their shifting role in circuits of power. The research question asks what happens when organizations officially formulate themselves as doing one thing while other organizational actors that are influential in significant organizational arenas (in which these formulations circulate) counter that these formulations are patently false. Theoretically, we draw on the literature on organizational gossip and rumour as well as on the politics of non-decision-making. Our argument is advanced by reference to a case study of the Australian Wheat Board and UN Resolution 661. Basically, organizational gossip plays a key role in the production of interorganizational power dynamics, an insight previously neglected.

Abstract: This study examines the response rates for surveys used in organizational research. We analysed 1607 studies published in the years 2000 and 2005 in 17 refereed academic journals, and we identified 490 different studies that utilized surveys. We examined the response rates in these studies, which covered more than 100,000 organizations and 400,000 individual respondents. The average response rate for studies that utilized data collected from individuals was 52.7 percent with a standard deviation of 20.4, while the average response rate for studies that utilized data collected from organizations was 35.7 percent with a standard deviation of 18.8. Key insights from further analysis include relative stability in response rates in the past decade and higher response rates for journals published in the USA. The use of incentives was not found to be related to response rates and, for studies of organizations, the use of reminders was associated with lower response rates. Also, electronic data collection efforts...

Title: Gender, risk and employment insecurity: The masculine breadwinner subtext
Author-Name: Elisabeth Kelan
Abstract: The decline of the male breadwinner model goes hand in hand with an increased perception of insecurity and risk in the new economy. This article explores how the perception of and responses to risk and insecurity are influenced by gender. The article is based on interviews with male and female information communication technology (ICT) workers, and it identifies four main discourses through which they conceptualize risk. First, they draw on a discourse which normalizes risk as part of their jobs. A second discourse implicitly suggests that women are less likely to be made redundant. A third discourse is based on the assumption that becoming a breadwinner influences one's perception of risk. The topic of the final discourse is the importance of continually improving one's skills in order to remain employable and maintain one's position as a breadwinner. The discourses all assume the ideal of a neoliberal self-entrepreneurial subject. The article then discusses ageing as a factor that changes perceptions of...

Title: Passing the buck: Labor flexibility practices that transfer risk onto hourly workers
Author-Name: Susan J. Lambert
Abstract: The goal of this article is to increase knowledge about the ways that front-line managers use scheduling practices to implement labor flexibility in low-skill, hourly jobs. Data come from a comparative study of 88 non-production jobs in 22 work sites in four industries (hospitality, retail, transportation, and financial services). The focus is on scheduling practices in part-time and full-time standard jobs that allow front-line managers to vary the number of hours employees work each week, the distribution of employees' hours across a week, and the number of employees scheduled for any hours week-to-week. The findings provide insight into the daily accountability requirements that press front-line managers to make quick adjustments to work schedules and the specific scheduling practices that enable them to do so. The discussion considers the extent to which these scheduling practices, like other labor flexibility practices, are implemented in ways that protect some workers from instability at the expense...

Title: The inequality of security: Winners and losers in the risk society
Author-Name: Marianne Cooper
Abstract: Current analyses of the changing nature of risk provide a`top-down' perspective that fails to consider variation among the individuals that these changes act upon. Drawing on a qualitative study of 89 workers who are members of 50 socioeconomically diverse families in Silicon Valley, California, this article explores the variability among workers by examining how an individual's social class background influences both their level of exposure to risk and their ability to navigate through the `risk society'. By employing Bourdieu's framework, the study finds that the attributes now expected of the ideal risk society subject are in actuality reflective of economic, social and cultural capitals most commonly held by the highly educated, middle and upper-middle classes. Consequently, in the current political environment where individuals are viewed as enterprising consumers responsible for their own welfare, those who possess the `right' capitals are advantaged, while those who do not are disadvantaged.

Title: Rethinking risk in the new economy: Age and cohort effects on unemployment and re-employment
Author-Name: Stephen Lippmann
Abstract: One of the major risks associated with flexible employment in the new economy is that of sudden and involuntary unemployment. The risk of involuntary unemployment, or displacement, has become widespread in the new economy, threatening workers across firms, occupations and industries. While most workers now face the risk of displacement, some appear better able to negotiate and navigate the flexible labor market that characterizes the `new' economy. Using pooled cross-sectional data covering over 20 years, I examine how workers' abilities to recover from displacement have changed over the past two decades. Specifically, I examine how older workers — typically thought to experience greater risk of displacement and disadvantage in the flexible labor market — fare in the new economy. My results indicate that birth cohort is a better predictor than chronological age of post-displacement employment outcomes, including the duration of unemployment and the likelihood of switching occupations upon re-employment.

Abstract: In this article we analyse two French restructuring cases, using Walton and McKersie's theoretical framework, and provide evidence of the potential of integrative bargaining in restructuring. We argue that any restructuring situation, even in an unfavourable context such as the French, displays an integrative potential, in that employers' and employees' risks are closely interrelated and these risks can be successfully addressed in a cooperative way. The two cases are from widely contrasting contexts: a medium-sized firm in the declining textile industry, and a large insurance company with no short-term economic threat. We show to what extent the underlying bargaining processes are illustrative of an integrative approach as defined by Walton and McKersie and that such an approach may prevail in different kinds of situation, decline-related as well as competition-enhancing restructurings. Moreover, in reference with the four sub-processes developed in the Walton and MacKersie's model, we analyse how and un...

Abstract: We investigated the extent to which three socio-demographic variables, employee gender, age, and tenure, moderated the meta-correlations of role conflict and role ambiguity with job performance. To test these moderating effects, we quantitatively synthesized 30 independent studies (total N = 7700). No moderating effects were found for gender and tenure. Controlling for employee tenure and gender, we found that employee mean age had a moderating effect on the role ambiguity-performance correlation, with negative correlations tending to decrease with increasing age. Moreover, two significant two-way interactions were found between the moderators. As the percentage of women in the studies and the respondents' mean age simultaneously increased, and as the mean sample tenure and age of the respondents in the studies simultaneously increased, there was a reduction in the negative relationship between role ambiguity and performance. The implications of these results for future research are discussed.

Author-Name: Nicolas Bacon

Abstract: Regulatory authorities, politicians and trade unions across Europe have recently accused private equity institutions of improving the performance of buy-outs merely by reducing employment costs with negative implications for jobs, working conditions and training investments. These claims are assessed by analysing high commitment management practices and changes in these practices in private-equity backed and non-private equity backed buy-outs in the UK and the Netherlands using a large-scale representative sample that combines both questionnaire and archival data. We find that both private equity backed buy-outs compared to non-private equity backed buy-outs, and Dutch buy-outs compared to UK buy-outs, are less likely to report introducing new high commitment management practices but do not on average reduce high commitment management practices. The findings suggest private equity backed buy-outs represent only a limited adaptation of the European social model.

Abstract: Research on diversity in teams and organizations has revealed ambiguous results regarding the effects of group composition on workgroup performance. The categorization—elaboration model (van Knippenberg et al., 2004) accounts for this variety and proposes two different underlying processes. On the one hand diversity may bring about intergroup bias which leads to less group identification, which in turn is followed by more conflict and decreased workgroup performance. On the other hand, the information processing approach proposes positive effects of diversity because of a more elaborate processing of information brought about by a wider pool and variety of perspectives in more diverse groups. We propose that the former process is contingent on individual team members' beliefs that diversity is good or bad for achieving the team's aims. We predict that the relationship between subjective diversity and identification is more positive in ethnically diverse project teams when group members hold beliefs that a...

Title: The importance of being `Indian': Identity centrality and work outcomes in an off-shored call center in India
Author-Name: Diya Das

Author-Name: Pamela Brandes
Abstract: Existing studies of identity dynamics have shown that employees embody multiple social identities, and have multiple foci of identifications at work that shape their attitudes and behaviors. However, limited research has examined these frameworks in the new, emerging contexts of global workplaces. In this article, we focus on one such significant example of contemporary globalization: transnational service work in the international call center industry in India. Our findings indicate that national identity centrality is indeed negatively associated with employee performance and positively associated with intention to leave. Furthermore, national identity centrality also moderates the relationship of organizational identification with performance and burnout. While we reinforce the importance of organizational identity and occupational identity centrality, we highlight the hitherto ignored consequences of national identity centrality in our study context.

Title: Should I stay or should I go? The role of risk in employee turnover decisions
Author-Name: James M. Vardaman
Author-Name: David G. Allen
Author-Name: Robert W. Renn
Author-Name: Karen R. Moffitt
Abstract: The decision to leave a job has long been infused with risk for the worker deciding whether or not to leave the organization. However, the role of risk in employee turnover decisions has been largely unexplored in the turnover literature. This article integrates concepts from the turnover and risk literatures to better understand the decision processes of workers contemplating the decision to leave a job. The article offers two studies that investigate the impact of risk perceptions and turnover risk propensity on that decision. Study 1, a field study based on a sample of 155 US service workers in the gaming industry, shows that risk perceptions and propensity for risk moderate the relationship between turnover intentions and turnover behavior. Study 2, a laboratory experiment based on a sample of 222 working students, explores the role of framing and social influences on perceptions of risk and individual tendencies for risk-taking in a turnover context. Findings from Study 2 suggest that positive framin...

Title: Judgments about knowledge importance: The roles of social referents and network structure
Author-Name: Sze-Sze Wong
Abstract: As division of labor in a group can often lead to differences in perceptions about the importance of different knowledge bases to a group task, these differences can hinder the integration of different knowledge to solve task problems in a group. This study examines the social referents that group members turn to for judgments about knowledge importance, and the extent to which the relative influence of each referent depends on the group-level social network structure. The findings indicate that group members are more likely to have shared judgments with their cohesive and structurally equivalent referents within their advice network, and the strength of social influence from their cohesive and structurally equivalent referents is likely to depend on the advice network density at the group-level. However, there was no significant association in judgment similarity between group members and their central referents within the advice network. Overall, this study suggests that while social influence (in its m...

Title: The role of transformational leadership in enhancing team reflexivity
Author-Name: Michaéla C. Schippers

Author-Name: Daan van Knippenberg
Abstract: Team reflexivity, or the extent to which teams reflect upon and modify their functioning, has been identified as a key factor in the effectiveness of work teams. As yet, however, little is known about the factors that play a role in enhancing team reflexivity, and it is thus important to develop theorizing around the determinants of reflexivity. From an applied perspective, leadership is a very relevant factor. The current study is a first step in the development of such a model, and addresses this important gap in our understanding of team reflexivity by focusing on the role of leader behavior. We examined the extent to which transformational leadership influences team reflexivity, and in turn, team performance, in a field study conducted among 32 intact work teams from nine organizations. Team members rated reflexivity and leadership, while external managers rated team performance. We hypothesized and tested a mediational model proposing that transformational leadership is related to the adoption of a s...

Title: Variability as a source of stability: Studying routines in the elderly home care setting
Author-Name: Anna Essén
Abstract: While it is agreed that there can be a difference between the routine as inscribed in artefacts, the ostensive aspect of the routine and its performative aspect, little is known about the relationship between these parts of the routine. Further, while authors acknowledge that there is variability in routines as performed, the contemporary literature says less about the sources of this variability. Using empirical data from the Swedish community care setting, the present article explores the workings of and relationship between the different aspects of `the home-help delivery routine'. The article also explores the sources of variability in workers' execution of this routine in situ. The article provides rich illustrations of the differences between the routine as inscribed in artefacts, as `articulated patterns' and the workers' performance of the routine in specific situations. In contrast to the argument that alignment between these aspects contributes to stability in the routine, this article claims th...

Title: Mentoring and network ties

Abstract: Using questionnaire data obtained from a sample of state government managers, our study examines social capital foci (network ties) of mentoring relations. Others have shown that network ties are relevant to career development and advance. We begin with the assumption that enhanced network ties are generally beneficial. We investigate variation in mentorships, which enhance network ties within the focal organization and within organizations external to the focal organization. We examine a number of factors hypothesized as shaping the relationship between mentoring and the development of network ties, including attributes of the protégé and of the mentoring relationship. Our results show that the sex of the protégé and of the mentor does not affect the quantity of network ties conveyed. However, relationships in which protégé and mentor sex is matched provide more network ties. Counter to our expectations, there is no significant difference in the amount and focus of network ties accruing from formal, orga...

Title: The effect of bias on the advancement of working mothers: Disentangling legitimate concerns from inaccurate stereotypes as predictors of advancement in academe
Author-Name: Eden B. King
Abstract: Drawing from social role theory, it is theorized that stereotypes about working mothers will drive biased perceptions about their attitudes toward work and family that will partially account for the `maternal wall'. Survey responses from a sample of 166 junior faculty members with children and 93 of their senior colleagues suggested that parent gender influences superiors' ratings of junior faculty's work involvement, commitment, and flexibility. Moreover, after accounting for self-reports of these attitudes, senior colleagues' ratings partially explained the relationship between parent gender and advancement. Thus, this research provides evidence of maternal bias by demonstrating gender differences in perceptions of work—family attitudes that influence success.

Results provided support for the shared mental model theory and the directional nature of interpersonal trust.

Title: Similarity, familiarity and access to elite work in Hollywood: Employer and employee characteristics in breakthrough employment
Author-Name: Paul F. Skilton
Abstract: This study develops and tests hypotheses concerning factors that influence employers' decisions to create breakthrough opportunities for workers on elite Hollywood projects. A breakthrough is defined as employment in a new career area in which the employee has no experience. Similarity and familiarity are proposed as constructs that describe relationships between employees and employers. Similarity and familiarity play a major role in breakthroughs because, by definition, the employee's experience is insufficient to gauge his or her ability for the new area. The hypotheses are tested using archival data on employment in Hollywood motion picture production, with the breakthrough to directing an elite motion picture as the focal opportunity. The results show that while similarity and familiarity make breakthroughs more likely, the prospect's experience matters little. Breakthrough opportunities are created by employers with less experience in elite work and lower status.

Title: The social meaning and function of food rituals in healthcare practice: An ethnography
Author-Name: Di Thomson
Author-Name: Anne-Marie Hassenkamp
Abstract: This ethnographic study was undertaken to build a picture of physiotherapy practice through prolonged observation. Several building blocks of the therapists' culture were created one of which was the negotiation and meaning of food rituals in the practice of a team of physiotherapists in a UK National Health Service hospital. Interviews were carried out following the observations to gain the therapists' perspectives in an open critical exploration of assumptions and ideas. The analysis was iterative and followed a systematic recognized ethnographic approach. The findings revealed explicit and implicit meanings of the food rituals. Explicitly they were instrumental in sustaining continuity and a strong sense of harmony. They were seen as a morale-booster, a key ingredient to mark departures and a powerful component of the therapists' break time. They underpinned a need for cohesion within an environment of constant change. Implicitly, they were a vehicle to expose tensions and a catalyst for isolation. Foo...

Title: Religious dimensions and work obligation: A country institutional profile model

Abstract: The influence of religion as an important element of national contexts has been largely neglected in international management research, even though all major religions promote particular values that believers express at work. In this article, we apply the country institutional profile (Kostova, 1999) to specify cognitive, normative, and regulative elements of national religious contexts and relate them to individuals' work obligation norms. Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) on data from 62,128 individuals in 45 countries, we find support for our hypotheses regarding positive relationships with one cognitive component (importance of God) and one normative component (behavioral aspect of religion). Our hypothesis for the negative relationship between the regulative component (state religion) and work obligation is also supported. We also propose that religious pluralism will weaken the relationships between the cognitive and normative aspects of religion and work obligations. Results provide varying ...

Title: `We're not banks': Exploring self-discipline, subjectivity and co-operative work
Author-Name: Anita Mangan
Abstract: In studies of the workplace, the enterprising employee is theorized as autonomous, self-actualizing and calculating; self-discipline is linked to self-interest. This article explores the question of self-discipline by drawing on empirical material from a longitudinal study of the Irish credit union movement. As financial co-operatives, credit unions have a tradition of helping local communities under the aegis of mutuality and co-operative credit. The article theorizes two interrelated, yet antagonistic discourses within the credit union movement; an older community service discourse and an emerging enterprise discourse. In tracing the question of what it means to be a credit union volunteer, the article explores some of the tensions and contradictions between the two discourses, as experienced by volunteers who struggle with the question of how to balance the movement's traditional self-help ethos with the growing pressures to become more entrepreneurial.

Title: Preserving masculinity in service work: An exploration of the underreporting of customer anti-social behaviour
Author-Name: Victoria Bishop

Author-Name: Helge Hoel
Abstract: This article explores bus drivers' underreporting of passengers' anti-social behaviour within the UK bus industry. Anti-social behaviour is a widespread phenomenon affecting a large proportion of the working population across many sectors and occupations. Although internal reporting systems can provide organizations with necessary information to tackle this problem, where employees regularly fail to report anti-social behaviour and where such underreporting is endemic, any effort to address the problem is likely to fail. Given this importance of reporting, an understanding of the factors affecting widespread underreporting is essential. Taking an interpretive, ethnographic approach, we explore bus drivers' accounts of the reasons for underreporting, as well as why bus drivers construct their interpretations in this way. In attempting to answer this question we found that underpinning participants' reasons for underreporting, was a dominant culture of masculinity. Introducing gender to the underreporting l...

Abstract: This article integrates self-efficacy theory with decision latitude theory to generate a typology of workload management strategies used by knowledge workers working under conditions of high job demands. We then propose that physical and emotional fatigue should differentially influence usage of these workload management strategies based on anticipated differences in their effects on selfefficacy. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of our model with regards to knowledge workers who often face ongoing challenging job demands.

Abstract: Using affective events theory as a framework, this study examined the role of emotions in mediating the effects of perceived politics on adverse employee outcomes. The authors proposed that frustration translates employees' perceptions of politics into lower levels of performance and increased organizational withdrawal (i.e. turnover intentions) through a mediational path that involves job satisfaction. The proposed model received support with empirical results from 134 subordinate—supervisor dyads sampled across a single government agency. In particular, there was evidence that frustration and job satisfaction mediated the effects of politics perceptions on employee behavioral outcomes.

Abstract: Divergent theoretical approaches to the construct of framing have resulted in conceptual confusion in conflict research. We disentangle these approaches by analyzing their assumptions about 1) the nature of frames — that is, cognitive representations or interactional co-constructions, and 2) what is getting framed — that is, issues, identities and relationships, or interaction process. Using a meta-paradigmatic perspective, we delineate the ontological, theoretical and methodological assumptions among six approaches to framing to reduce conceptual confusion and identify research opportunities within and across these approaches.

Abstract: This article explores whether leisure is an effective coping resource in response to the demands of one's job and in reducing depression. Karasek's job demand-control-support (JDCS) model of psychological strain serves as a framework for empirically examining the importance of leisure in reducing depression and buffering the detrimental effects of excessive job demands. This article relies on data from a sample of 887 law firm lawyers who are renowned for working in highly stressful work settings. We find that participating in active and social leisure activities or taking a vacation are important in reducing lawyers' depression, whereas participating in passive leisure is not. None of the leisure variables buffer the harmful effects of job demands on depression. We discuss the implications of these findings.

Abstract: The relationship between personal identity and experience of individual career change and flexible working was investigated. Cluster analyses with survey data from 596 employees in 14 companies with varying levels of flexibility indicated the existence of four types of personal identity: the critical-flexible, self-determined, continuous, and job-centred type. The types were explicated further on the basis of narrative interviews with 59 individuals with either a continuous or discontinuous work biography. The types differed significantly in the identity dimensions biographical continuity, ecological consistency, and locus of control as well as in career-related self-esteem and satisfaction with their employment situation, especially their psychological contract. The continuous type expressed the highest and the critical-flexible type the least satisfaction. Consequences for career management and identity research are discussed.

Title: `It's a guesthouse not a brothel': Policing sex in the home-workplace
Author-Name: MariaLaura Di Domenico
Author-Name: Peter Fleming
Abstract: This article aims to explain why guesthouse or `Bed & Breakfast' proprietors in the UK attempt to police sex among guests. Unlike interactive service situations that take place in more neutral locations, guesthouse proprietors open their homes to customers. We propose that they attempt to regulate sexual conduct (as well as other behaviours) in an attempt to delineate their homes as a traditional sphere of family values and purity. Sex is `useful' in this regard for defining what their home is not — a `seedy' hotel or even a brothel. The article presents evidence of the specific regulatory mechanisms deployed by proprietors and the rationale behind them. The research contributes to the interactive service work literature by illustrating the unique tensions experienced by this subset of home-workers, and the organizational sexuality literature, by exploring its importance in settings where the putative private/public dichotomy is overtly undermined.

Abstract: Our first objective in this qualitative study was to validate the conceptualization of vigor as comprising physical strength, emotional energy and cognitive liveliness. Our second objective was to explore vigor's work-related antecedents. We applied theme analysis to the contents of interviews held with 38 randomly selected employees. The results clearly supported the three-component conceptualization of vigor as most employees (77%) related to vigor as a multifaceted variable. The most frequent work-related antecedents of vigor that emerged from the interviews were meaningful interactions with others, coping with challenging situations, and achieving success on a project. By superimposing the Job Characteristics Model on these qualitative findings, we inferred from the items describing vigor's antecedents that job significance, supervisory feedback, and job identity were the most frequently mentioned antecedents of vigor at work. Additionally, we found indications of a spillover effect of vigor from the ...

Abstract: In this article, we analyse the principal antagonistic discourses on which managers in a large UK-based engineering company drew in their efforts to construct versions of their selves. Predicated on an understanding that subjectively construed discursive identities are available to individuals as in-progress narratives that are contingent and fragile, the research contribution we make is threefold. First, we argue that managers may draw on mutually antagonistic discursive resources in authoring conceptions of their selves. Second, we contend that rather than being relatively coherent or completely fluid and fragmented managers' identity narratives may incorporate contrasting positions or antagonisms. Third, we show that managers' identity work constituted a continuing quest to (re)-author their selves as moral beings. Antagonisms in managers' identities, we suggest, may appropriately be analysed as the complex and ambiguous effects of organizationally based disciplinary practices and individuals' discursi...

Title: Beyond dis-identification: A discursive approach to self-alienation in contemporary organizations
Author-Name: Jana Costas
Author-Name: Peter Fleming
Abstract: Dis-identification is now an important research area in organization studies investigating how employees subjectively distance themselves from managerial domination by constructing identities considered more `authentic'. But how should we understand situations where actors become aware that their putative`real' selves are paradoxically unreal and foreign? We draw inspiration from the concept of self-alienation to explain experiences beyond dis-identification, where actors perceive the truth of themselves (`who I really am') as alien. An empirical study of a global management consultancy firm demonstrates how a discursive and non-essentialist understanding of self-alienation might usefully capture this experience of identity. Three causes of self-alienation are proposed and we discuss their significance in relation to identity and authenticity in contemporary organizations.

Abstract: This article discusses how female entrepreneurs of Moroccan and Turkish origin in the Netherlands construct their ethnic, gender and entrepreneurial identities in relation to their Muslim identity. We contribute to theory development on the interrelationship of work identities with gender, ethnicity and religion through an intersectional analysis of these women's gender and ethnic identities within their entrepreneurial contexts and in relation to their Muslim identity. We draw on four narratives to illustrate how the women interviewed perform creative boundary work at these hitherto under-researched intersections. Islam is employed as a boundary to let religious norms and values prevail over cultural ones and to make space for individualism, honour and entrepreneurship. Moreover, different individual religious identities are crafted to stretch the boundaries of what is allowed for female entrepreneurs in order to resist traditional, dogmatic interpretations of Islam. Our study contributes to studies on e...

Title: Between narration and interaction: Situating first-line supervisor identity work
Author-Name: Simon Down
Author-Name: James Reveley
Abstract: This article examines how frontline managers establish managerial identities. It combines narrational and Goffmanesque conceptions of managerial identity work in a longitudinal study of one first-line supervisor at a restructured Australian industrial plant. We argue that, singly, neither self-narration nor dramaturgical performance accounts for the practical discursive work that constructs managerial `identity'. We demonstrate that frontline manager identity work is an iterative process in which self-narration and dramaturgical performance are almost seamlessly interwoven. The supervisor uses these different identity work stratagems simultaneously, and they are processually co-dependent. We conclude, therefore, that organizational scholars who study how persons construct managerial identities should take Goffman's dramaturgical perspective more seriously. It is an indispensible complement to the analysis of identity narratives, because successful performances undergird managers' attempts to craft stable ...

Title: Narrative, life story and manager identity: A case study in autobiographical identity work
Author-Name: Tony J. Watson
Abstract: To study and better understand people's working lives and organizational involvement in the context of their whole lives and in the context of the societal culture in which they have grown up and now live, it is helpful to bring together three key concepts of narrative, identity work and the social construction of reality. Such a move can be connected to the abandonment of widely used but limiting concepts, such as that of`managerial identity'. The essentially sociological nature of this move also provides an antidote to the equally limiting tendency towards the `narrative imperialism' which is associated with the idea of the `narrative self'. The value of the suggested theoretical framing and its linking of narrative, identity work and social construction is demonstrated by the close analysis of a large private autobiography of a former manager. This individual's identity work simultaneously uses discursively available narratives and creates new narratives (many small stories being embedded in one large ...

Author-Name: Ida Sabelis
Abstract: One symptom of individualism in liquid modernity is the search for `identity'. Using the five theoretically discrete articles in this special issue as both a `rich' discursive resource and a point of departure, we develop a supplementary reading of the narratives which appear to inform identity research. We suggest that, while social agents in pursuit of `identity' draw on a cacophony of discursive sources, it is the varieties of `self—other' talk which emerge as the critical ingredient in processes of identity formation. The dualities that all such self—other talk articulate can be seen as discursive reflections of the more fundamental relationship between the individual and sociality. In turn, this is seen to refract one of the persistent problems of organizational analysis: the agency—structure issue. In addition, while we argue that deploying a discursive perspective to analyze identity work offers distinctive insights, such an approach carries with it an epistemological consequence. For what the arti...

Title: Developing international organizational change theory using cases from China
Author-Name: Paul S. Hempel
Author-Name: Maris G. Martinsons
Abstract: This article contributes to international theory development by examining organizational change (OC) in mainland China. Eight case studies of a single type of OC, business process re-engineering (BPR), reveal that Chinese organizations diverged consistently from initially planned changes. Change context is found to influence not only the process of change, but also the content and even the objectives of change. Since specific practices carry implicit values, the congruence with existing values influences OC implementation significantly. Multinational organizations must recognize that a specific practice or policy can represent very different changes in different contexts.

Title: Constrained choices in alliance formations: Cupids and organizational marriages
Author-Name: Kimberlie J. Stephens
Author-Name: Janet Fulk
Author-Name: Peter R. Monge
Abstract: This article develops a constrained choice model of strategic decision-making for `cupid' alliances. Unlike voluntary alliances, cupid alliances are forged between `target' organizations at the behest of a third `cupid' organization that stands to benefit from creation of the alliance. Three key alliance decisions — whether to partner, with whom, and governance — are substantially curtailed by the cupid's requirements, producing a severely constrained set of strategic decisions. The conceptual model is supplemented with a case study which relies on qualitative interviews, observations and communication network data collected from principals negotiating a cupid alliance. A finding which may be unique to cupid alliances was the decline in trust over the course of the negotiation between those representatives whose organizations had no past alliance relationships. This finding is especially interesting given the fact that despite the decreased propensity for representatives to trust, an agreement was still r...

Title: Critical performativity: The unfinished business of critical management studies
Author-Name: André Spicer

Author-Name: Dan Kärreman
Abstract: We argue that critical management studies (CMS) should be conceptualized as a profoundly performative project. The central task of CMS should be to actively and pragmatically intervene in specific debates about management and encourage progressive forms of management. This involves CMS becoming affirmative, caring, pragmatic, potential focused, and normative. To do this, we suggest a range of tactics including affirming ambiguity, working with mysteries, applied communicative action, exploring heterotopias and engaging micro-emancipations.

Title: Managing difference in feminized work: Men, otherness and social practice
Author-Name: Alison Pullen
Author-Name: Ruth Simpson
Abstract: This article presents a qualitative study of men who do traditionally female dominated and feminized work (specifically nursing and primary school teaching). Men are often seen as not only a minority to women in these contexts, but also their Other. The article explores the processes of doing gender as a social and discursive practice, highlighting the necessity to manage difference and the processual, emergent, dynamic, partial and fragmented nature of gendered identities. We show some of the complex ways in which men manage difference and how they transcend Otherness by doing masculinity and appropriating femininity so that masculinity is partially subverted and partly maintained. This analysis not only relies on the doing of gender through the doing of difference but also surfaces the undoing of gender and difference to disrupt gender norms and practices in work organizations.

Title: Organizational commitment and the well-being of temporary agency workers: A longitudinal study
Author-Name: Nathalie Galais

Abstract: Previous research found that organizational commitment is positively related to employee well-being. However, in the current age of contingent work, transitions, and `protean careers', the advisability of commitment is questionable. Therefore, we analyzed the role of organizational commitment in one paradigmatic area of contingent work arrangements: temporary agency work. In contrast to standard workers, temporary agency workers have to deal with two organizations: the temporary agency and client organization. Results revealed an ambivalent role of organizational commitment for temporary workers. Cross-sectional commitment towards the client organization had positive effects on workers' well-being, whereas commitment towards the agency had no effects. However, longitudinal analyses revealed that commitment to the client was detrimental to workers' well-being when they experienced reassignment to another client. In sum, we found beneficial and dysfunctional effects of organizational commitment on well-bein...

Title: Life-quality decisions: Tension-management strategies used by individuals when making tradeoffs
Author-Name: Amy E. Mickel
Author-Name: Elise J. Dallimore
Abstract: An investigation of perceived tradeoffs associated with significant life-quality decisions yielded five tension-management strategies which include: a) adopting a guiding philosophy, b) engaging in an ongoing practice, c) perceiving tradeoffs as `nothing given up of value/importance', d) applying a present orientation, and e) applying a future orientation. These strategies emerge as ways working professionals in the United States manage tension. Findings suggest that the use of one or more of these strategies is related to perceptions of more gains than losses associated with decisions. Further, examining the use of these strategies adds insight regarding why some respondents making similar decisions perceive tradeoffs differently. In dealing with work—life issues, the authors promote the use of tension-management strategies which are enacted by individuals alone or in conjunction with organizationally enacted strategies.

Title: Psychological climate: A comparison of organizational and individual level referents

Abstract: Psychological climate is defined as individual employee perceptions of their work environment. This study advances our understanding of the psychological climate construct by addressing a generally ignored issue of frame of reference through measuring psychological climate with an organizational referent (PCo) and an individual referent (PCi). PCo reflects employee perceptions of their organizational environment in general; whereas, PCi reflects employee perceptions of their own experiences within an organization. This study found that a) there are mean level differences between the two types of psychological climate, b) the two types of psychological climate uniquely predict job satisfaction, and c) a discrepancy between the two types of psychological climate is found to relate to job satisfaction.

Abstract: Despite substantial evidence for a relationship between human resource management (HRM) and the performance of individuals, relatively few studies have examined the role of employee expectations. This article reports on a study involving six National Health Service (NHS) organizations across England. Healthcare employees expected their employers to provide: infrastructure, HR practices and support, which they linked to improved performance especially in relation to patient care and service innovations. Counterintuitively, effort was maintained towards immediate patient care when expectations were unmet, seemingly, because of public service values. The findings indicate that public service values may be a strong determinant of performance as it relates to patients, moderating potential short-term adverse effects of unmet expectations. In contrast, longer term effects on patient care and service development were less readily moderated by these values. This study offers differential accounts illustrating eff...

Title: The `boundaryless' career and career boundaries: Applying an institutionalist perspective to ICT workers in the context of Nigeria
Author-Name: Afam Ituma

Abstract: Drawing from institutional theory, this article explores `boundaryless' careers and the nature of career boundaries in the information and communication technology (ICT) industry in Nigeria. The specific objectives are to explore: 1) whether career mobility in Nigeria reproduces or challenges contemporary projections of the `boundaryless' career (i.e. as characterized by increased inter-firm mobility) and 2) the structural boundaries (barriers) that constrain individuals' ability to enact the boundaryless career in this context. Findings of the interviews with 50 technical professionals in the Nigerian ICT industry challenge contemporary projections of `boundaryless' careers by providing evidence to support the continuing existence of career boundaries and traditional career patterns (i.e. as characterized by hierarchical and progressive movement within a single organization). Findings also suggest that ethnic allegiance, personal connections, gender discrimination, perceptions of educational qualificatio...

Title: Gay men at work: (Re)constructing the self as professional
Author-Name: Nick Rumens
Author-Name: Deborah Kerfoot
Abstract: This article is a study of professional identity work, using in-depth interview material from research conducted into the work lives of 10 gay men employed in a UK National Health Service Trust. Using the men's portraits of professional life, we examine the different ways they understand what it means to be a `professional'. The article suggests that while gay men appear to be empowered by forms of agency to self-identify as professionals in `gay-friendly' work contexts, they are by no means unaffected by dominant professional norms and discourses of heteronormativity that treat sexuality and professionalism as polar opposites. Thus how straightforward it might be for the interviewees to self-identify as `professional' and openly gay within an organization that is perceived to be `gay-friendly' is scrutinized in terms of the professional identity dilemmas experienced by the study participants. We conclude that, even within `gayfriendly' organizational settings, fashioning a professional identity is a proc...

Title: Supervisory approaches and paradoxes in managing telecommuting implementation
Author-Name: Brenda A. Lautsch
Author-Name: Ellen Ernst Kossek
Author-Name: Susan C. Eaton
Abstract: Voluntary telecommuting is an increasingly prevalent flexible work practice, typically offered to assist employees with managing work— family demands. Most organizations with telecommuting policies rely on supervisor discretion regarding policy access and implementation in their department. Although supervisors' approaches have implications for telecommuters and their non-telecommuting co-workers, few studies integrate these stakeholder perspectives. Drawing on surveys and interviews with 90 dyads of supervisors and subordinates, some of whom were telecommuters and some of whom were not, we examine effective managerial approaches regarding telecommuting implementation. First, supervisors should stay in close contact with telecommuters, but this contact should emphasize sharing information rather than close monitoring of work schedules. Telecommuters supervised with an information-sharing approach were more likely to report lower work—family conflict, increased performance, and were more likely to help co-...

Title: Struggling to organize across national borders: The case of global resource management in professional service firms
Author-Name: Mehdi Boussebaa
Abstract: A growing body of research has challenged the commonly accepted view that multinationals have evolved into globally integrated networks, demonstrating instead that such organizations are sites of conflict between competing rationalities emerging from distinctive national institutional contexts. However, this research has neglected professional service firms (PSFs) in spite of them often being held as exemplars of the integrated network model. This article redresses this imbalance by focusing, in particular, on how PSFs seek to coordinate the horizontal flow of their human resources as a mechanism of inter-unit knowledge sharing. Drawing upon interviews in four PSFs, I show that these organizations have developed resource management systems that cannot simply be reduced to national institutional contexts. However, I also demonstrate that the process of resource management is subject to inter-unit conflicts that undermine its raison d'être. I argue that these tensions are symptomatic of both the Anglo-Ameri...

Title: The silent community: Organizing zones in the digital divide
Author-Name: Shiv Ganesh
Author-Name: Kirsty F. Barber
Abstract: This article is a critical interrogation of scholarship on digital divides as it pertains to development in the so-called `Third World'. The article proceeds by identifying three problematic assumptions of extant research on digital divides in the context of development: the discursive binarization between `haves' and `have-nots'; the normatization of the digital divide; and the unproblematic representation of local community interests. The article then uses a longitudinal case study of one particular Non-Government Organization (NGO) that attempted to develop a system of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) over a 10-year period. Three phases of ICT development are identified: an initial phase, a growth phase, and a consolidation phase. The historical development of ICT in the NGO is used to interrogate the three assumptions of digital divide literature, highlighting its role in organizing digital zones. Implications for understanding digital divide and development issues are discussed.

Title: The symbolic violence of leadership: A critical hermeneutic study of leadership and succession in a British organization in the post-Soviet context
Author-Name: Sarah K. Robinson

Abstract: Charismatic leadership has often been associated with positive organizational change. Although some of the literature acknowledges the less positive aspects there is a lack of critical approaches to leadership. Empirical case studies demonstrating the more negative aspects of charismatic leadership and theoretical concepts that can be used to understand transformational and/or charismatic leadership as potentially destructive phenomena. This article therefore presents, from a critical perspective, an empirical study of leadership within a British international organization, drawing out the conditions that allowed an episode of charismatic leadership to be established. It also presents a theoretical study in which, by introducing Bourdieu's concept `symbolic violence', we are able to explore the legitimation of power in relation to this episode of leadership. We conclude that the use of symbolic violence, by foregrounding power, is helpful in unmasking the potential human cost and possible long-term damage...

Title: Dialectics in a global software team: Negotiating tensions across time, space, and culture
Author-Name: Jennifer Gibbs
Abstract: This study examines dialectical tensions in global virtual teams, and the ways in which tensions are negotiated through communicative practices of team members. Drawing on ethnographic data from a global software team, the analysis revealed three main tensions in global team interaction: autonomy—connectedness, inclusion— exclusion, and empowerment—disempowerment. These tensions were composed of layers of subdialectics, which were either productive or detrimental depending on how they were managed. Team members engaged in selection, transcendence, and withdrawal strategies to negotiate these dialectics. Managers were more likely to treat tensions productively as complementary dialectics which enabled them to transcend oppositions, whereas lower-level foreign assignees were less able to cope with tensions, experiencing them as simple contradictions or paradoxes which constrained and disempowered them. This research contributes a tension-centered model of global team interaction that challenges dominant ass...

Title: Mind over body: Physical and psychotherapeutic discourses and the regulation of the older worker
Author-Name: Susan Ainsworth
Author-Name: Cynthia Hardy
Abstract: We examine how physical and psychotherapeutic discourses regulate the identity work of older workers. We show that they have separate effects: physical discourse inferred that the loss of work for older workers would be permanent whereas psychotherapeutic discourse suggested that the solution to unemployment lay in the mind of older workers themselves. They also have combined effects through the notion of grief: older workers are expected to progress through the normative stages of grief to arrive at acceptance of job loss and continued exclusion from the labour market. Despite moments of resistance in the identity work of older workers, these individuals were subjected to these regulatory effects through three key processes: participation by individual older workers in these discourses through their own identity work; collaboration from a range of diverse actors in contributing to this identity work; and translation of the meaning as initial narratives are retold by other actors.

Title: Overcoming dysfunctional momentum: Organizational safety as a social achievement

Abstract: Research on organizational safety and reliability largely has emphasized system-level structures and processes neglecting the more micro-level, social processes necessary to enact organizational safety. In this qualitative study we remedy this gap by exploring these processes in the context of wildland fire management. In particular, using interview data gathered from 28 individuals involved in wildland firefighting, we explore the validity of the idea that a deterrent to organizational safety is an inability to redirect ongoing actions once they are underway. The findings suggest four major themes. First, individuals and groups redirect ongoing action as a result of re-evaluating that action. Second, noticing early warning signs, while necessary, is not sufficient to drive change. Third, two social processes — giving voice to concerns and actively seeking alternative perspectives — appear to be key drivers of re-evaluation. Fourth, the process of redirecting action is moderated by two social factors: ins...

Abstract: From a constructionist perspective, we examine how non-managerial employees make sense of the part played by other people in shaping their careers. Taking as our starting point the methodological limitations of existing research into career shapers and arguing for a perspective that starts with actors’ situated understandings, we use a life story method to develop a new typology of career shapers. Grounded in our data, we distinguish and contrast the shaper categories of adviser, informant, witness, gatekeeper and intermediary in terms of their perceived impact on individuals, including their career aspirations, career enactment, and their career world-view and career self-concept. At the level of practice, locating themselves within this framework will enable line managers, human resources staff and professional careers advisers to be explicit about the career support they can offer, and to identify other potentially valuable career shapers.

Title: How to sell your soul and still get into Heaven: Steven Covey's epiphany-inducing technology of effective selfhood
Author-Name: John G. Cullen
Abstract: Steven Covey's The 7 habits of highly effective people, one of the most influential and popular contemporary self-help texts, has resulted in the development a large multinational consulting business, several spin-off texts, and much imitation since its publication in 1989. An examination of the text, informed by Critical Discourse Analysis, is conducted with a view to unearthing the textual, discursive and socio-cultural practices that have enabled the work and its message to become so popular. 7 habits is an epiphanogenic (or epiphany-inducing) technology emerging from an `effectiveness' discipline supported by three socio-cultural trends: the postmodern, saturated self; the coming of neo-liberal society and the financialization of the self; and the subjective turn. Covey's discipline of effectiveness aims to produce a self that is simultaneously de-saturated, financialized and expressivist, but supportive of conservative, universalist and late-capitalist modes of being.

Abstract: Information and communication technologies play a key role in contemporary organizations. Supported by a longitudinal study of changes in purchasing practices, owing to the implementation of an e-business system at a large, global corporation, this article shows the interplay between the technology and the role of the users. We argue that the introduction of the e-business system increased the hierarchy and bureaucracy but also that the purchasers' professional identities and established work procedures were threatened by the technology being used. The results indicate how a technological artifact is by no means detached from the broader reformulating of managerial procedures and practices, instead reflecting and embodying some of the managerial virtues of predictability and hierarchy. Since technology is playing an increasingly key role in most industries and domains, it is also suggested that the intersection between technology and professions be examined in more detail.

Abstract: Consent, obedience and resistance can be seen as key concerns in management and organization. Why people comply is a crucial issue in the field. We address the theme within a specific area: management consultants in a big firm that places quite a lot of pressure on its personnel to be hardworking and predictable and to subordinate themselves to hierarchy, standards and tight production schedules. By studying how the discourses of Ambition and Autonomy clash and interact in a consultancy firm, we add and develop the concept of counter-resistance to expand our understanding of the dynamics of resistance. The idea is to show how the impulse to resist becomes countered and neutralized. The study offers insights into the deeper mechanisms and dynamics behind consent and shows the multidimensional character of resistance.

Author-Name: Edward H. Powley
Abstract: When external events disrupt the normal flow of organizational and relational routines and practices, an organization’s latent capacity to rebound activates to enable positive adaptation and bounce back. This article examines an unexpected organizational crisis (a shooting and standoff in a business school) and presents a model for how resilience becomes activated in such situations. Three social mechanisms describe resilience activation. Liminal suspension describes how crisis temporarily undoes and alters formal relational structures and opens a temporal space for organization members to form and renew relationships. Compassionate witnessing describes how organization members’ interpersonal connections and opportunities for engagement respond to individuals’ needs. And relational redundancy describes how organization members’ social capital and connections across organizational and functional boundaries activate relational networks that enable resilience. Narrative accounts from the incident support the...

Abstract: We examined the relationship between job search and distress using the daily diary method that involved 100 unemployed job seekers in China. Three models were tested: a direct relationship model (examining the effect of job search on distress), a reversed relationship model (assessing the impact of distress on job search), and a third variable model (testing the extent to which daily financial strain accounts for the relationship between job search and distress). Results offered support for both direct and reversed models. The third variable model was not supported. Negative job search experience mediated the direct effect of job search on distress. Using a within-individual approach, our study provides an in-depth examination on the nature and directionality of the relationship between job search and distress and illuminates the dynamic nature of this relationship.

Title: Identity affirmation through `signature style': A study of toy car designers
Author-Name: Kimberly D. Elsbach
Abstract: I describe findings from a qualitative study of toy car designers that shows how creative workers may develop and express `signature styles' through their work. The display of these signature styles — that were not advertised, stamped on products, or even recognized in official corporate marketing communications — allowed designers to affirm their creative, professional identities while designing commodity products within the practical constraints of a corporate context. Findings further revealed that creative workers used signature styles, primarily, to affirm the identity categorizations of `idealistic' and `independent'. I discuss how these findings extend our understanding of `identity work' among creative workers, and may improve our ability to effectively manage these workers in corporate settings.

Title: Impact of dual executive leadership dynamics in creative organizations
Author-Name: Wendy Reid
Author-Name: Rekha Karambayya
Abstract: The paradoxical co-existence of business and artistic objectives in creative organizations provides a useful background to explore the conflict dynamics of dual executive leadership. Using a social psychological lens, eight case studies of non-profit performing arts companies in Canada generated two sets of findings that highlight 1) types of conflict dissemination beyond the duo and 2) their co-occurrence with conflict types impacting on the organization's ability to function well. The study also re-confirmed types of conflict as found in the leadership duo.

Title: The organization of creativity in Japanese advertising production
Author-Name: Brian Moeran
Abstract: This article makes use of the results of ethnographic participant observation to analyze how creativity is organized in the production of Japanese advertising. An ad campaign, like many other creative products, is produced by `motley crews' of personnel from both within an agency contracted to conceptualize the campaign on behalf of its client (an account team) and freelance professionals hired to realize the account team's creative concept (a production team). The concepts of frame analysis and art worlds are used to analyze the symbolic space of the studio and the transformations that occur there, while that of field enables a comparative analysis of advertising's `space of possibles' in which different actors position themselves and their clients' products. Creativity is used to establish relations of power among advertising personnel, as well as over consumers, by means of the constant (re)positioning of advertisers' products. This is the function of advertising's motley crew.

Title: Managing in the creative industries: Managing the motley crew
Author-Name: Barbara Townley

Author-Name: Alan McKinlay
Abstract: This article introduces its subject with a brief overview of some of the contention concerning the creative industries, in terms of their purview, their significance within political economy, and the extent to which, and how, they may differ from other sectors. Arguing that the `motley crew' is a very broad church, and management must not confine itself solely to the management of production but should also consider the role of consumption, the authors suggest that research into the creative industries may be considered in relation to the capitals that inform its domain: intellectual capital (creative ideas), social capital (networks), and cultural capital (recognized authority or expertise). Considering research in these terms allows us to identify a matrix that might provide the basis for conversations between a range of discrete research areas, while also guiding future research into the creative industries.

Title: If human errors are assumed as crimes in a safety culture: A lifeworld analysis of a rail crash
Author-Name: Nobuyuki Chikudate
Abstract: This study reanalyses the commuter train incident that involved the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). The incident, which occurred on 25 April 2005, claimed 107 lives (passengers and the train driver) and injured 562 passengers. The delay in using the brake and the train driver’s inattention generated confusion and serious errors. The train driver’s inattentiveness may be attributed to his grave concern over reporting personal mistakes to company authorities as it is mandatory for erring JR West crew members to go through ‘learning practices’. The phenomenological analyses showed how the unintended consequences of such learning practices played a key role in the train incident. This study also draws on Foucault’s concepts on discipline to analyse the learning practices in JR West, and employs the concept of collective myopia to account for the reasoning of JR West managers.

Title: Latent organizations in the film industry: Contracts, rewards and resources
Author-Name: Joris J. Ebbers
Author-Name: Nachoem M. Wijnberg
Abstract: The main aim of this article is to study the extent to which the project-based organization (PBO) and the latent organization determine the actual behavior of actors in a project-based industry and how this is mediated by the types of contracts and rewarding practices these organizational forms allow. Labor contracts connected to the PBO are mostly transactional in nature, while the members of the latent organization are linked by relational contracts. Interviews with Dutch film producers show that the transactional contracts connected to the PBO are less important than the relational contracts connected to the latent organization in governing the actual behavior of the involved actors. Relational contracts that structure relationships in the latent organization allow flexible rewarding practices, just as in `normal' organizations. In turn, employees prove willing to assist the organization in handling environmental uncertainty by making resources available without insisting on immediate compensation.

Title: The elephant in the room? Class and creative careers in British advertising agencies
Author-Name: Charlotte McLeod
Author-Name: Stephanie O'Donohoe
Author-Name: Barbara Townley
Abstract: Advertising in Britain has traditionally been the preserve of a middle-class, public school and Oxbridge-educated workforce. Although this narrow recruitment base is recognized as problematic, the influence of social class on advertising careers remains largely unexplored. This article explores the career trajectories of British advertising creatives from different social class backgrounds and the forms of capital at their disposal. Drawing on life history interviews with creatives, we explore how they got started, got in and got on in advertising careers. In particular, we highlight how the `working-class' creatives struggled to overcome the economic, social and cultural barriers they face in entering the industry. We suggest, however, that once `in', the influence of their social class background was more subtle and less detrimental, due to the social capital they accumulated en route and the value of their distinctive brand of cultural capital.

Title: Institutional explanations for managers’ attitudes towards telehomeworking
Author-Name: Pascale Peters
Author-Name: Stefan Heusinkveld
Abstract: Building on recent research that stresses the important role of managers in the adoption process of telehomeworking, or telecommuting, this study examines the influence of the institutional context on managers’ attitude formation. Drawing on large-scale survey data from 96 CEOs and 380 HR managers in Dutch organizations, we show that normative and mimetic pressures affect managers’ beliefs, which are reflected in their perceptions of the relative (dis)advantage of telehomeworking. We also find that the perceived improvements of work outcomes and perceived social costs/benefits vary among managers from different ‘occupational communities’. CEOs’ beliefs are more susceptible to mimetic pressures, while HR managers’ attitudes towards telehomeworking are positively fed by pressures from their occupational community. These findings support the view that current debates on work—life initiatives’ diffusion and organizational changes in relation to these initiatives should pay much more attention to the importanc...

Title: New human resource management practices in knowledge-intensive business services firms: The case of outsourcing with staff transfer
Author-Name: Damian Grimshaw
Author-Name: Marcela Miozzo
Abstract: This article investigates the human resource management practices that underpin a specific model of organizing knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS). Drawing on data from four countries, it examines HR practices in two global IT services firms — EDS and IBM. The market for IT services depends very much on outsourcing and the transfer of IT workers from the client to the IT firm. This has theoretical and empirical implications for how IT firms manage recruitment, skill development and job security. The evidence supports an alternative framework for understanding four key influences on HRM in large specialist KIBS firms: i) inter-organizational relations (tight inter-linkages with client organizations); ii) contract performance conditions (outsourcing contracts); iii) knowledge flows (inter-organizational transfers of highly skilled IT workers); and iv) the economic and institutional context (industrial relations institutions). The article demonstrates that these internal and external conditions gene...

Title: Enterprise contested: Betwixt and between the discourses of career and enterprise in a UK bank
Author-Name: Darren McCabe
Abstract: This article analyses the ‘enterprise’ discourse (Miller & Rose, 1990; Rose, 1989) that endeavours to reinvent employees as responsible, autonomous, self-regulating, customer-focused, team players. In this study of a major UK bank, the staff both endorsed and turned the enterprise discourse back on management and so the boundaries between dissent and consent are blurred. The case study highlights that enterprise does not arrive fully formed and can be a weapon of employees rather than simply a tool of those who seek to exercise power. It is argued that whilst enterprise is a contemporary discourse, it reproduces aspects of a much older ‘career’ (McKinlay, 2002; Tempest et al., 2004) discourse in UK financial services. The continuity and discontinuity between the two discourses fuelled resistance, whilst oiling and obscuring, the reproduction of enduring inequalities, that straddle both discourses.

Title: Is work—family balance more than conflict and enrichment?

Abstract: This study deepens our theoretical and practical understanding of work—family balance, defined as the ‘accomplishment of role-related expectations that are negotiated and shared between an individual and his/her role-related partners in the work and family domains’ (Grzywacz & Carlson, 2007: 458). We develop a new measure of work—family balance and establish discriminant validity between it, work—family conflict, and work—family enrichment. Further, we examine the relationship of work—family balance with six key work and family outcomes. Results suggest that balance explains variance beyond that explained by traditional measures of conflict and enrichment for five of six outcomes tested: job satisfaction, organizational commitment, family satisfaction, family performance, and family functioning. We conclude with a discussion of the applications of our work.

Abstract: This article analyses how multiple organizational identities are constructed through rhetoric to maintain and enhance the legitimacy claims made by organizations. Our theorizing is founded on an investigation of the 43 geographically based English and Welsh constabularies. The research contribution of our study is threefold. First, we show that officially sanctioned web-based organizational identity claims are multiple and discuss their implications for identity theory. Second, we consider how these multiple identity claims are constituted using particular rhetorical strategies. Third, we argue that the multiple identity claims constituted aspects of constabularies’ selfpresentation strategies by which they attempted to exert control over stakeholders’ perceptions and establish pragmatic, cognitive and moral claims to legitimacy. This is contrary to some previous research that has suggested that organizations seek to reconcile or redefine multiple claims, and that has ignored them as a resource for satisf...

Title: The impact of structural empowerment on individual well-being and performance: Taking agent preferences, self-efficacy and operational constraints into account
Author-Name: Michal Biron

Abstract: We integrate psychological and socio-structural perspectives on empowerment by examining: a) the impact of actual structural empowerment initiatives (as opposed to perceptions of such empowering acts) aimed at enhancing employee influence over which tasks to perform (as opposed to how to perform them) on employee well-being and performance, b) the degree to which self-efficacy mediates these effects, and c) the extent to which, by applying such initiatives more selectively, performance-related empowerment effects may be amplified. Results of a simulation-based experiment indicate that while granting decision latitude over which tasks to perform has beneficial effects on both individual performance and well-being, self-efficacy partially mediates the effects only on the latter. Results also indicate that the direct performance-related effects of such interventions may be further increased without any significant decline in employee well-being to the extent that such structural empowerment is applied more s...

Title: Strategic ambiguity as a rhetorical resource for enabling multiple interests
Author-Name: Paula Jarzabkowski
Author-Name: John AA Sillince

Abstract: The literature on ambiguity reflects contradictory views on its value as a resource or a problem for organizational action. In this longitudinal empirical study of ambiguity about a strategic goal, we examined how strategic ambiguity is used as a discursive resource by different organizational constituents and how that is associated with collective action around the strategic goal. We found four rhetorical positions, each of which drew upon strategic ambiguity to construct the strategic goal differently according to whether the various constituents were asserting their own interests or accommodating wider organizational interests. However, we also found that the different constituents maintained these four rhetorical positions simultaneously over time, enabling them to shift between their own and other’s interests rather than converging upon a common interest. These findings are used to develop a conceptual framework that explains how strategic ambiguity might serve as a resource for different organizatio...

Title: Bringing avoidance and anxiety to the job: Attachment style and instrumental helping behavior among co-workers
Author-Name: Dvora Geller
Author-Name: Peter Bamberger
Abstract: While social psychologists have widely explored the link between adult attachment styles and interpersonal relating behaviors such as caregiving in intimate relationships, organizational researchers have yet to examine the generalizability of such findings to employee interrelating behaviors at work. Addressing this gap in the research, we extend attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969) to the work context in order to generate and test hypotheses regarding the way in which helping behavior may be explained on the basis of the help provider’s level of attachment anxiety and avoidance. Data collected from 320 call center employees of a large Israeli telecommunications company suggest that while attachment anxiety is inversely associated with instrumental helping, it also attenuates the inverse effects of attachment avoidance on such helping. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

Author-Name: Melanie Bryant

Abstract: This article provides an alternative lens for examining organizational deviance within the specific context of change, by drawing upon an interactionist approach. We focus specifically on labelling theory and argue that definitions of deviance can be constructed through social interaction regardless of the behaviour in which individuals engage. This study differs from current literature by shifting emphasis away from acts of norm-breaking and on to the social circumstances in which individuals might define others, or come to be defined, as deviant. The application of labelling theory can advance understanding of how individuals, within the context of organizational change, might come to be defined as deviant without changing their behaviour or engaging in specific norm violations. This approach also enables researchers to contribute to discussions surrounding the construction of organizational norms and explore whether these are developed and enforced by those in powerful positions on the basis of their o...

Abstract: This study aims to examine the effects of person-career (PC) fit on employee outcomes. It is based on a sample of 1128 research and development (R&D) professionals and 222 project managers in 15 South Korean organizations. The results revealed that a managerial PC fit has a curvilinear relationship with job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and a technical PC fit has a curvilinear relationship with job satisfaction. For example, job satisfaction increased as career orientation increased toward career development opportunities, then decreased when career development opportunities exceeded career orientation. In addition, as expected, job satisfaction and organizational commitment are higher when career orientation and career development opportunities are both high rather than low. For work performance, contributions to organizations increased as managerial career orientations increased toward managerial career opportunities, then decreased when managerial career opportunities exceeded managerial ...

Title: Analyzing the gender pay gap in transition economies: How much does personality matter?
Author-Name: Anastasia Semykina
Author-Name: Susan J Linz
Abstract: We estimate the personality-earnings relation in Russia, Armenia and Kazakhstan and examine how much of the gender pay gap can be explained by locus of control (LOC). We use data from an employee survey conducted in 2005 and employ Oaxaca-Blinder-Neumark decomposition. Among Russian and Armenian survey participants, men are more likely to exhibit an internal LOC (attribute success to own actions), and individuals with an internal LOC tend to earn more than individuals who attribute success to fate or other external forces (exhibit an external LOC). In Kazakhstan, gender differences in LOC and the estimated effects of LOC on earnings are small and statistically insignificant. Gender differences in LOC explain 5.5 percent of the gender pay gap in Armenia, 7 percent in Russia, and 2.7 percent in Kazakhstan. Our findings suggest that personality plays an important role in explaining the pay gap.

Abstract: The role of national institutional context is often overlooked in analyses of learning behaviour in multinational organizations. Drawing on arguments from institutional theory and learning theory we consider the organizational contingencies, and the institutional context in which these are embedded, in explaining the use of structures to support learning across national borders. It is hypothesized that country of origin effects on subsidiary learning structures are mediated by two organizational contingencies, namely transnational human resource management governance structures and subsidiary global research and development expertise. To test this, structural equation modelling is used on a dataset of 292 foreign (including Japanese, US, French, German, Nordic) and home-owned subsidiaries operating in the UK. The results confirmed the hypothesized institutional effects. The evidence suggests that understanding the interaction between institutional and firm-level context is important in providing a fuller ...

Title: Telemedicine: A practice-based approach to technology
Author-Name: Silvia Gherardi
Abstract: Telecardiological consultancy, enabling distant consultation between cardiologist and the general practitioner in the presence of the patient and relying on a technological infrastructure, is a new medical working practice. This article proposes a practice-based approach in order to study it as an object emerging from a local ecology of human and non-human. An analytical framework proposes three interpretative lines: a reading of practice ‘from outside’ (as a patterned set of activities), a reading ‘from inside’ (as knowing-in-practice) and a reading as a social practice (as a ‘doing’ of society).The article analyses the discursive practices involved in a month of telecardiological consultancies in order to understand the effects of this new practice in a Western health care context. One of these meanings is that, as telecardiology comes into use, it is inscribed more in the social practice of reassurance than in the medical one of preventing and dealing with emergencies.

Abstract: Many of us increasingly experience our personal and working lives through a range of categories and classifications that have come to be strongly associated with the formal management of organizations, the effect of which has been explained as a subtle colonization of our minds and imaginations. This article presents insights from an organizational ethnography based in a UK hospital’s medical records library where participants rarely used management discourses, the only managerial terms they used at all being teams and teamwork, and then mostly by way of parody, while strongly preferring an alternative collective identity, the girls. This article therefore illustrates and analyses how these workers shunned, if not entirely avoided, management language’s colonizing incursions.

Title: Normal Accident Theory versus High Reliability Theory: A resolution and call for an open systems view of accidents
Author-Name: Samir Shrivastava
Author-Name: Karan Sonpar
Author-Name: Federica Pazzaglia
Abstract: We resolve the longstanding debate between Normal Accident Theory (NAT) and High-Reliability Theory (HRT) by introducing a temporal dimension. Specifically, we explain that the two theories appear to diverge because they look at the accident phenomenon at different points of time. We, however, note that the debate’s resolution does not address the non-falsifiability problem that both NAT and HRT suffer from. Applying insights from the open systems perspective, we reframe NAT in a manner that helps the theory to address its non-falsifiability problem and factor in the role of humans in accidents. Finally, arguing that open systems theory can account for the conclusions reached by NAT and HRT, we proceed to offer pointers for future research to theoretically and empirically develop an open systems view of accidents.

Title: Reconciliation can lead to better application: A rejoinder to Perrow (2009)
Author-Name: Samir Shrivastava
Author-Name: Karan Sonpar
Author-Name: Federica Pazzaglia
Abstract: In his brief commentary, Perrow raises four issues. First, he alludes to how the misuse of bureaucratic power could explain some accidents. Second, he reiterates that normal accidents occur owing to the characteristics inherent in a system, and such accidents, irrespective of whether high reliability practices are followed or not, are inevitable. Third, Perrow asserts that complexity and coupling are independent of time of operation. The time dimension’s irrelevance, he claims, ought to be apparent from his analysis of normal accidents in systems such as the air transport and chemical industry (see Perrow, 1984). Fourth, Perrow implies that High Reliability Theory (HRT) cannot explain the sub-class of accidents that Normal Accident Theory (NAT) concerns itself with. He thus makes a case for retaining NAT alongside other theories and finds little value in our reconciliation. In fact, he finds the reconciliation inappropriate because we supposedly err in implicating time. We respond to the four issues in turn.

Abstract: This study advances our understanding of why and how the performance of standardized safety routines varies. Based on six months of field research and interviews in a molecular biology laboratory, this study examines the divergence of safety regulations and actual routine performance. It identifies distinct routine components that address different aspects of safety. While safety regulations and training aim at preventing adverse effects of hazardous substances on the scientists, the scientists are concerned about potential contamination of their experiments. This study investigates the relationship between organizational and scientific objectives. It argues that organizational objectives fall behind scientific objectives in safety routine performance to the extent that their pursuit requires a set of actions separate from those actions that suffice to meet the scientists’ professional concern.

Theoretically, our study represents an investigation into the disciplining of professional architects’ discourse about their selves, their organization, and their work. This article adds to debates on creative industries, demonstrating that creativity is deeply embedded in organizationally based relations of power.

Title: Socially constructing safety
Author-Name: Nick Turner
Author-Name: Garry C. Gray
Abstract: Social scientific perspectives on occupational safety largely characterize it as a disembodied, tangible, and easily quantifiable phenomenon. Recent research efforts have focused on exploring organizational conditions that predict occupational safety outcomes, resulting in top-down, often de-contextualized prescriptions about how to control safety in the workplace (e.g. ‘management should promote a culture of safety’). There is growing interest in how social processes of organizing, wider socio-cultural considerations, and the situated production of safety can contribute to the appreciation of the ‘lived experience’ of life and death at work. This Special Issue focuses on the socially constructed nature of occupational safety and the insight it provides in understanding broader social and organizational processes. In this article, we first describe how various social scientific disciplines share an interest in occupational safety and organizational behavior, yet rarely speak to another. We provide an over...

Title: Top management credibility and employee cynicism: A comprehensive model

Author-Name: Lynne M. Andersson
Abstract: By combining quantitative and qualitative methods of study, we develop a comprehensive model of top management behaviors, perceived management credibility, and employee cynicism and outcomes. Specifically, we identify managerial behaviors that affect employees’ perceptions of two components of top management’s credibility — trustworthiness and competence — and examine how each of those components relates to employee cynicism. Top management competence and trustworthiness relate to different components of employee cynicism (cognitive, affective, and behavioral cynicism), and these dimensions of cynicism differentially relate to organizational commitment and self-assessed job performance. Content analysis of critical incidents revealed that different sets of managerial behaviors generate attributions of competence, incompetence, trustworthiness, and non-trustworthiness. This study and the resulting model open the door to more finely distilled research on management credibility and employee cynicism.

Title: The strategic formation of project networks: A relational practice perspective
Author-Name: Stephan Manning
Abstract: This article develops a relational practice perspective on the strategic formation of project networks as organizational forms, based on structuration theory and an in-depth case study of a European researcher and his project network. Project networks are defined as strategically coordinated sets of longer-term, project-based relationships. As project entrepreneurs advance in their careers from project partners to coordinators, they learn to apply and combine certain practices through which they gradually transform part of their emerging professional networks into project networks with increased coordination capacity. These practices include: making and renewing project-based contacts, pooling potential project partners, and maintaining core project partnerships. This study advances our understanding of the institutional embeddedness of network agency and the micro-foundations of networks as organizational forms in project businesses and beyond.

Title: Contributions of work—life and resilience initiatives to the individual/organization relationship
Author-Name: Ariane Ollier-Malaterre
Abstract: Despite much research, it remains unclear whether and how organizational work—life and resilience initiatives (WLRI) enhance employee commitment. To open this black box, this theory-building research analyses 73 in-depth interviews in a multinational pharmaceutical company. WLRI foster desirable outcomes for almost two-thirds of the sample (loyalty, pride, calculated appreciation and use as management tools), yet may have negative outcomes (disappointment, obligation to stay) or no outcome (indifference). To understand the processes implied, this research analyses employees’ awareness, need, access and judgment of the initiatives. A decision tree was built. Key success conditions lie in three layers of context: personal, work environment and national. This article argues for a new theoretical foundation of work—life research, combining classic individual-centred perspectives with relational theories, which remain under-investigated in work—life research.

Abstract: The conventional wisdom from studies in both advanced Western economies and emerging economies indicate that managerial networking relationships matter. This article examines the circumstances under which managerial networking relationships matter by focusing on how the effect of managerial networking relationships on organizational performance is contingent upon certain organizational and environmental characteristics.The development and utilization of managerial networking relationships with external entities is broadened to include those with top managers of other firms, political leaders, government bureaucratic officials, and community leaders. Using data from 106 organizations in Ghana over two time periods, the findings show that only managerial social networking relationships with top managers of other firms, government bureaucratic officials, and community leaders enhance organizational performance. Moreover, the effect of networking relationships on performance is contingent on organizational as...

Title: Managing creatives: Paradoxical approaches to identity regulation
Author-Name: Manto Gotsi

Author-Name: Amy E Ingram
Abstract: Creative workers often experience identity tensions. On the one hand, ‘creatives’ desire to see themselves as distinctive in their artistry, passion, and self-expression, nurturing an identity that energizes their innovative efforts. Yet daily pressures to meet budgets, deadlines and market demands encourage a more business-like identity that supports firm performance. Through a comparative case study of New Product Design (NPD) consultancies, we explicate the potential management of such identity tensions. Case evidence illustrates overarching, paradoxical approaches to identity regulation as the firms emphasized both differentiation and integration strategies. Differentiation practices promoted disparate identities by segregating related roles in time and space, while integration efforts encouraged a more synergistic meta-identity as ‘practical artists’. Leveraging paradox literature, we discuss how these strategies may accommodate creative workers’ needs to cope with multiple identities, as well as the...

Title: Differing effects of coping strategies on mental health during prolonged unemployment: A longitudinal analysis
Author-Name:  Xiaowan Lin
Author-Name: Kwok Leung
Abstract: A three-wave longitudinal design was used to examine the causal effects of two coping strategies in the context of prolonged unemployment, namely job search and distancing (i.e. emotional detachment from unemployment), on mental health and the duration of these effects. Two situational appraisals, namely economic hardship and unemployment negativity (i.e. perceived negativity of unemployment life) were found to influence both coping strategies and mental health. We confirmed that the negative effect of job search on mental health was primarily owing to the two situational appraisals, especially unemployment negativity. In contrast, the positive effect of distancing on mental health was significant, even after the situational appraisals were taken into account. In addition, the positive effect of distancing on mental health lasted longer than the negative effect of job search.

Title: Organizational social capital, structure and performance
Author-Name: Rhys Andrews
Abstract: Organization theorists suggest that the social capital within organizations is a potentially powerful resource for improving organizational performance. In addition, organizational structures may strengthen or weaken the effects of social capital, by furnishing greater or fewer opportunities for its growth. This article explores the independent and combined effects of organizational social capital and structure on the performance of over 100 organizations between 2002 and 2005, using panel data. The statistical results suggest that cognitive and relational dimensions of social capital are positively related to performance, but that the structural dimension of social capital is unrelated to service outcomes. Further analysis revealed that organizational structure has complex and contradictory effects on the impact of each dimension of social capital.

Title: Employee reactions to office redesign: A naturally occurring quasi-field experiment in a multi-generational setting
Author-Name: James C McElroy
Author-Name: Paula C Morrow
Abstract: Outcomes associated with an office redesign aimed at decreasing workspace while enhancing perceptions of organizational culture and work-related attitudes are examined within a financial services organization. Findings show that employees assigned to the redesigned office environment report less workspace and more distractions than those who remained in a cubicle environment, but that this finding was moderated by age generation. Employees moved to the newly redesigned space reported more favorable perceptions of culture and work-related attitudes, with no age moderating effects. Taken together, results provide support for the theory that office redesign is an effective strategy for implementing organizational change.

Abstract: Assessment centres (ACs) are increasingly used to recruit highly qualified staff, yet there are few attempts to appraise their introduction from a diversity perspective. This article addresses this gap by exploring the introduction of ACs as a means of increasing the diversity of the judiciary in the UK. It analyses the underpinning politics guiding the processes and subjective experiences of ACs using Weber’s identification of types of rationality and argues that substantive rationalities drive the formal rationality of the AC. The study demonstrates the theoretical value of incorporating diversity into the rationality framework and shows that the design, management and implementation of ACs are shaped by the competing rationalities that surround and imbue judicial work. While ACs may be introduced to demonstrate fair selection practices and challenge the reproduction of unfair discriminatory practices, such formal interventions are inevitably partial and bound by the distinctive institutional context an...

Title: Context, strategy and financial participation: A comparative analysis
Author-Name: Richard Croucher

Abstract: This article investigates where financial participation is most likely to be encountered, and explores its compatibility with collective forms of employee voice. It is based on the findings of a major international survey of human resource management (HRM) practices. We found that financial participation was not affected by collective employee voice, but that national context and associated HRM strategies had significant effects on its nature and extent. As financial participation is likely to make for greater variation in wage rates, it tends to weaken industry-level bargaining. By re-casting the fundamental determinants of wages, it is also likely to facilitate greater wage dispersion within the firm. Hence, it was found that financial participation is more commonly encountered in liberal market contexts, and in firms practising calculative HRM, where countervailing employee power is weak, whether or not collective bargaining is formally present.

Title: Beyond ourselves: Passion and the dark side of identification in an ethical organization
Author-Name: Kate M Kenny
Abstract: How are organizational discourses enacted by people at work? In this article, instead of treating subjects as somewhat distinct from such discourses, I argue that the two are inescapably intertwined. The concept of ‘ek-stasis’ helps us to understand this. Ekstasis invokes an idea of the ‘self ’ that, through processes of identification, is always located outside of itself, embedded in a wider sociality. I explore this dynamic through an in-depth study of the powerful discourse of ‘ethical living’, and its enactment in one contemporary development sector organization, EWH. This ek-static enactment was somewhat ambivalent: involving mutual recognition between colleagues, but also processes of exclusion and policing. I highlight how attention to feeling and passion was important in understanding the relation between workplace discourse and identification processes, in this setting. This study shows that a view of workplace selves as ek-static is useful for understanding the enactment of discourse at work, an...

Abstract: The aim of this article is to introduce a social exchange perspective to the study of workplace bullying. Much of the existing research on bullying has had a strong empirical focus, leaving the concept relatively under-theoretized. By applying the social exchange theory based concepts of justice, psychological contract breach, and perceived organizational support, we aim to shed light on a number of aspects of bullying that to date have remained poorly understood. First, drawing on the concepts of justice and contract breach, we highlight the perceptual and subjective element in workplace bullying. Second, the concepts of justice and contract breach allow us to provide insights into how bullying is experienced and the mechanisms through which bullying leads to negative outcomes for both targets and bystanders. Third, the concept of perceived organizational support highlights the importance of appropriate and timely responses to workplace bullying. Finally, we discuss implications for both research and pra...

Author-Name: Ethlyn A. Williams

Author-Name: Mark Gavin
Abstract: Team-level career mentoring by supervisors is conceptualized as mentoring that provides career support for all team members. A new model of mentoring and individual team-source learning is presented. Data from 192 individuals in 37 intact work groups in the banking industry were used to examine how intra-group processes might influence the team mentoring process. Team-level leader-member exchange, peer mentoring, and proactive member behavior were examined for their influence on team-level career mentoring by supervisors. Our results suggest that aspects of the team context (represented by mean leader-member exchange and mean peer mentoring) influenced team-level career mentoring. Team-level career mentoring (TCM) had a positive effect on individual team-source learning and had mediating effects on the relationships between the team contextual factors and individual team-source learning. The implications of this research for studying supervisory team-level career mentoring are discussed.

Abstract: Today’s leaders face unprecedented challenges in attempting to manage interactions between social identity group members with a history of tension in society at large. Research on faultlines suggests that social identity groups often polarize in response to events that make social identity salient, resulting in negative work outcomes. The current research extends the faultlines literature by examining precipitating events (triggers) that activate a faultline. Qualitative interview data were collected from two samples of employees working in multiple countries to identify events that had resulted in social identity conflicts. In the first study (35 events), an exploratory approach yielded a typology of five types of triggers: differential treatment, different values, assimilation, insult or humiliating action, and simple contact. A second qualitative study (99 events) involved a more geographically varied sample. Research findings are discussed in terms of implications for the faultlines literature and for...

Abstract: Following recent interest in contextual factors and how they might influence the effects of transformational leadership, we consider the social distance between leaders and followers as a cross-level moderator of the relationships between senior level managers’ transformational leadership and individual-level outcomes. Our sample comprised 268 individuals in 50 leader-follower groups. Results revealed that high social distance reduced or neutralized transformational leadership’s association with followers’ emulation of leader behavior. In contrast, high levels of social distance between leaders and followers enhanced the effects of transformational leadership on individuals’ perceptions of their units’ positive emotional climate and individuals’ sense of collective efficacy. Results not only highlight the importance of social distance as a contextual variable affecting leader-follower relations but also suggest that the same contextual variable may have differential effects, enhancing some relationships a...

Title: The institutionalization of distributed leadership: A ‘Catch-22’ in English public services
Author-Name: Graeme Currie
Author-Name: Andy Lockett
Author-Name: Olga Suhomlinova
Abstract: Distributed leadership is promoted as being well suited to public service organizations because of their multiple goals, less pronounced managerial authority and presence of powerful professional groups. Drawing on qualitative evidence we analyse the complex process of the institutionalization of distributed leadership in English schools. Our analysis suggests that competing institutional forces simultaneously foster and stymie the adoption of distributed leadership. Consequently, the school principals find themselves in a classic Catch-22 situation, which they resolve by enacting a weak form of distributed leadership. Ironically, the implementation of distributed leadership is the most difficult in the schools located in socially deprived areas, that is, the very context where policy-makers expect distributed leadership to make the most impact. Moving beyond our specific case, we argue that distributed leadership, and leadership more generally, cannot be divorced from its institutional context and that t...

Title: Considering context in discursive leadership research
Author-Name: Gail T. Fairhurst
Abstract: In addition to leadership psychology, there is another journey to understand the context of leadership that takes as its starting point the linguistic turn in the social and the organizational sciences. Those impacted by the linguistic turn are broadly social constructionist, discursive, and more qualitative than mainstream leadership scholars. In varying degrees, these scholars view context as multi-layered, co-created, contestable, and locally achieved. This article explores a constellation of perspectives united by these themes, introduces the qualitative special issue articles, and suggests directions for future research on the context of leadership.

Title: Towards a theory of being-centered leadership: Multiple levels of being as context for effective leadership
Author-Name: Louis Fry
Author-Name: Mark Kriger
Abstract: This article proposes and develops a theory of leadership that utilizes five levels of being as context for effective leadership: 1) the physical world; 2) the world of images and imagination; 3) the level of the soul; 4) the level of the Spirit; and 5) the non-dual level. We first explore how each of the five levels of being provides a means for advancing both the theory and the practice of leadership. Second, we utilize these five levels to create the foundation for a theory of leadership based on being that goes beyond current theory which emphasizes having and doing — either having appropriate traits and competencies or doing appropriate actions depending on the situation. We present propositions for future research as we discuss each of the five levels of being. Finally, we discuss implications for leadership development and future research that arise from such a being-centered leadership theory.

Abstract: Relational demography research has its roots in social identity theory. However, prior research has not directly tested the effects of the two primary motives of social identification; uncertainty reduction and status enhancement. In this study, we examined the moderating effects of these motives on the relationship between demographic similarity and individuals’ affective reactions toward their work group. Uncertainty reduction, which we operationalized as self-continuity, moderated the relationship between race similarity and cohesiveness. In addition, status enhancement moderated both race and gender similarity effects on the group outcomes. We discuss implications of our findings for theory and research.

Title: Negative reciprocity and the association between perceived organizational ethical values and organizational deviance
Author-Name: Michal Biron
Abstract: Perceived organizational ethical values refer to employees’ beliefs concerning what practices are acceptable or appropriate in their organization (Trevino, 1990). Previous work suggests that these perceptions can be a significant factor in employee behavior, with normative influence often assumed to be the underlying mechanism (Peterson, 2002). The current article incorporates another theoretical lens, namely social exchange theory (Blau, 1964), and, in particular, negative reciprocity, to suggest that mistreatment at work — in the form of abusive supervision and lack of organizational support — may undermine the normative influence of perceived ethical values. The results indicate a negative association between perceived organizational ethical values and organizational deviance. This generally negative association was countered by abusive supervision and strengthened by organizational support, with both moderators suggesting an overt effect of negative reciprocity on employee behavior, especially when th...

Abstract: Drawing on exit, voice, loyalty and neglect (EVLN) literature, this study examines direct and interactive associations between organizational-level commitment and team-level commitment and the use of EVLN by managers in India. The study is based on a survey of 200 managers and supervisors from seven Indian firms. The findings on the use of voice are consistent with the past research in Western countries, but challenge the prevailing assumption about the use of voice in high power distance societies. The results also indicate that team-level commitment moderates the association between organizational-level commitment and the use of EVLN.

Abstract: We map changes in the pattern of information disclosure by management to employees over 14 years in the UK, using the Workplace Employment Relations Survey (WERS) panels for 1990—8 and 1998—2004. We use time-lagged probit regression to explore antecedents and outcomes of disclosure over the two periods, focusing on the effects of voice mechanisms on disclosure and on the impact of disclosure on performance.The results show a significant increase in disclosure over the first period but a levelling off in the second. Neither union recognition nor direct participation had a significant impact on disclosure in either period. Joint consultation did, however, have a significant positive effect on disclosure, but more so in the first than in the second period. In addition, prior disclosure had a positive effect on subsequent disclosure. An explanation of trends in terms of lock-in and institutional decoupling is developed. Disclosure has a positive effect on financial performance.

Abstract: This study investigates the willingness of workers in a unionized environment to participate in a joint consultation committee (JCC). It focuses on the differences between union members and non-members. We derived hypotheses from a consumer services theoretical approach to participation in collective activities. Using hierarchical regression, we analysed the survey responses of 1456 employees in a large Australian public sector organization. Members were more willing to participate in the JCC the more they expected instrumental outcomes and the more they valued discussion of issues that lay outside collective bargaining. They were less willing to participate the more they valued discussions about issues normally dealt with in union-based negotiations. Non-members were more willing to participate, the more they expected the JCC to result in democratic representation.

Abstract: Employee voice has been an enduring theme within the employment relations literature.This article profiles the incidence of a range of direct and indirect employee voice mechanisms within multinational companies (MNCs) and, using an analytical framework, identifies a number of different approaches to employee voice. Drawing from a highly representative sample of MNCs in Ireland, we point to quite a significant level of engagement with all types of employee voice, both direct and indirect. Using the analytical framework, we find that the most common approach to employee voice was an indirect voice approach (i.e. the use of trade unions and/or non-union structures of collective employee representation). The regression analysis identifies factors such as country of origin, sector, the European Union Directive on Information and Consultation and date of establishment as having varying impacts on the approaches adopted by MNCs to employee voice.

Title: Employee voice and organizational performance: Team versus representative influence
Author-Name: Jaewon Kim
Author-Name: John Paul MacDuffie
Author-Name: Frits K Pil
Abstract: This article explores the effects of team voice and worker representative voice, as well as their interaction, on labor productivity. We examine team voice in terms of team influence on key work-related issues and representative voice via the degree of worker representatives’ influence on multiple collective voice issues. We thus build on the European tradition of examining both direct and indirect voice and their implications for valued organizational outcomes. We find that neither type of voice bears a significant relationship to labor productivity when examined solely but that team voice significantly contributes to enhanced worker efficiency when considered in conjunction with representative voice. In examining the interaction of the two types of voice, we find that a combination of low team and low representative voice leads to inferior labor efficiency compared to other conditions. We also find a negative interaction between team voice and worker representative voice, supporting an interpretation th...

Title: If you build a remedial voice mechanism, will they come? Determinants of voicing interpersonal mistreatment at work
Author-Name: Karen Harlos
Abstract: This study examined person-centered (gender, work self-esteem) and situational (hierarchical power relations, mistreatment severity, intentionality) variables that determine employee voice to remedy interpersonal mistreatment. Data were collected from graduate business students who responded to a scenario describing exposure to mistreatment by a work colleague. Results suggested that gender, work self-esteem, and relative hierarchical power were most predictive of remedial voice to an internal mediator. Power relations played an important moderating role such that lower power positions seemed to inhibit voice. That is, women would be more likely than men to voice but only when a co-worker (versus supervisor) was the offender. Individuals with low work self-esteem would be less likely to voice than individuals with high work self-esteem when mistreated by a supervisor (versus co-worker). The results support using a social-psychological perspective for identifying determinants of remedial voicing (or hesita...

Title: New approaches to employee voice and participation in organizations
Author-Name: John W Budd
Author-Name: Paul J Gollan
Author-Name: Adrian Wilkinson
Abstract: While the history of employee voice and participation is longstanding, there has been a sharp increase in interest in these topics among academics, practitioners, and policy-makers in recent years. The research on employee voice and participation has therefore significantly broadened, expanding from an earlier institutional focus to also include significant behavioural and strategic streams. This article introduces a symposium that extends our knowledge of employee voice and participation in terms of new organizational forms, practices and processes that affect the nature, structure and conditions of work and organizations by showcasing the breadth of contemporary research on voice and participation.

Title: Representations of work—life balance support
Author-Name: Samula Mescher
Author-Name: Yvonne Benschop
Author-Name: Hans Doorewaard
Abstract: This article explores how employers portray themselves as supporters of work—life balance (WLB) in texts found on 24 websites of 10 different companies. With a theoretical framework based on a critical reflection on strategic HRM, feminist studies of organizational culture and hegemonic power processes, we examine implicit and explicit messages of work, life, and WLB support. We study the cultural norms that can be distilled from these articulations, including the concepts of the ideal worker and the ideal parent and discuss the possible (unintended) effects of the implicit and explicit messages. Our analysis shows the ambiguity of the different messages conveyed on WLB support. In contrast to the explicit supportive messages, implicit messages present WLB-arrangements as a privilege. The majority of websites reproduce traditional cultural norms regarding ideal workers and parents and the power of hegemony is not broken. Apparently, WLB support does not always signify support.

Title: Moderators of the curvilinear relation between extent of telecommuting and job and life satisfaction: The role of performance outcome orientation and worker type
Author-Name: Meghna Virick

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to determine factors that are related to employee satisfaction with telecommuting. Recent research supports the notion of a curvilinear relation between extent of telecommuting and job satisfaction. Drawing on control theory, we find that performance outcome orientation (degree to which objective criteria are used in employee evaluation) moderates the curvilinear relation between extent of telecommuting and job satisfaction. We also find support for a curvilinear (inverted U) relation between extent of telecommuting and life satisfaction, with worker type (defined by work drive and work enjoyment) moderating that relation.

Title: Doing more with less? Flexible working practices and the intensification of                work
Author-Name: Clare Kelliher
Author-Name: Deirdre Anderson
Abstract: This article examines an unanticipated consequence of adopting flexible working practices — that of work intensification. Based on a study of professional workers and in line with other studies, we present evidence showing that flexible workers record higher levels of job satisfaction and organizational commitment than their non-flexible counterparts. However, we also report evidence of work intensification being experienced by both those who work reduced hours and those who work remotely. We identify three means by which this intensification occurs — imposed intensification, enabled intensification and intensification as an act of reciprocation or exchange. We argue that the apparent paradox of high job satisfaction and organizational commitment, alongside work intensification can be explained by employees trading flexibility for effort. Using social exchange theory we propose that employees respond to the ability to work flexibly by exerting additional effort, in order to return benefit to their employer.

Title: Review article: Low-wage work in high-income countries: Labor-market institutions and business strategy in the US and Europe
Author-Name: Eileen Appelbaum
Author-Name: John Schmitt
Abstract: This article provides an overview of low-wage occupations in five industries (nursing assistants and cleaners in hospitals, cashiers and stock/sales clerks in food and electronics retail trade, process operatives in meat processing and confectionary, housekeepers in hotels, and in-coming sales/service operators in call centers) in six countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and the United States), based on a large-scale, multi-year research project funded and coordinated by the Russell Sage Foundation in New York. Low-wage work varies substantially both across and within countries, with large increases in the 1980s and 1990s in the Netherlands and the UK and, since the mid-1990s, in Germany. The US has the highest incidence of low-wage work, with Germany close behind. Denmark and France have much less low-wage work. Institutions (and their deterioration) play a large role in explaining these and other differences.

Title: The battered apple: An application of stressor-emotion-control/support theory to teachers’ experience of violence and bullying
Author-Name: Suzy Fox
Author-Name: Lamont E Stallworth
Abstract: This study looked at factors that moderate responses to violence, bullying, and other stressors among public school teachers in the US. Grounded in stressor-emotion-control/ support (SEC/S) theory, the study emphasized the relevance of specific forms of control and support to specific stressors in analyzing moderation effects. A total of 779 teachers completed an online survey of their perceptions of their work environments. Pervasive bullying and violent acts were associated with strains in zero-order correlations, but when regressed, pervasive bullying rather than violence was associated with strains. Relations between violent acts and strains were moderated by satisfaction with the administrations’ handling of violent acts.This has important implications for the development of public and educational policy. Finally, co-worker social support interacted with supervisory/principal bullying, but, contrary to expectations, showed a reverse buffering effect.

Title: Private equity and human resource management: ‘Barbarians at the gate!’ HR’s wake-up call?
Author-Name: Paul Boselie
Author-Name: Bas Koene
Abstract: A private equity buyout (PEB) constitutes an important organizational event that usually heralds major organizational transformations. As such, the announcement of a possible PEB can be expected to impact the organization and require careful management of the pre-PEB process. This article investigates the role and contribution of human resource management (HRM) during a two-year process of negotiations preceding a PEB. It shows the vulnerability of HR-based change contributions to uncertainty about the future, as uncertainty accentuates the ambiguity inherent in HRM based change. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of the role of top-management and the possibilities for HRM during the period leading up to a PEB.

Title: The joint effects of personality and job scope on in-role performance, citizenship behaviors, and creativity
Author-Name: Usman Raja
Author-Name: Gary Johns
Abstract: This study examined the relation between personality and three dimensions of job performance (in-role performance, creativity, and citizenship behavior) under differing levels of job scope. The basic premise was that higher job scope would facilitate performance for those who were dispositionally inclined toward a particular dimension of performance and damage the performance of those who were dispositionally disinclined. Among 383 work-unit dyads in 11 organizations, some support was found for the predicted interactions between Big Five personality traits and job scope in predicting various aspects of performance.

Title: Evasion of boredom: An unexpected spur to leadership?
Author-Name: Brigid J Carroll
Author-Name: Polly Parker
Author-Name: Kerr Inkson
Abstract: Boredom has been largely omitted from the leadership literature, or dismissed as a problem, incongruent with effective leadership. Our research showed that the boredom discourse of senior managers engaged in a leadership development programme contrasted with their construction of challenge in leadership. In a second study, managers considered boredom to be a characteristic of followers not leaders, antithetical to leadership, and a problem to be solved through leader-initiated change. These managers therefore accepted a prevalent negative discourse on boredom and sought to respond to it not by reflecting on it but by initiating change. The experience and consideration of boredom may provide the impetus for creativity, risk-taking, curiosity and challenge-seeking, and may foster sustained and embedded individual and organizational learning. Attending to a more holistic range of phenomena and living with leadership ‘troughs’ as well as ‘peaks’ may ultimately create a more reflexive, resilient and agile lead...

Title: The right tools for the job: Constructing gender meanings and identities in the male-dominated building trades
Author-Name: Amy M Denissen
Abstract: For women in male-dominated occupations, the gender beliefs and expectations of men co-workers create dilemmas for constructing and managing an occupational identity. Women often find themselves in a double bind where they are held accountable to contradictory expectations for a feminine presentation of self and a masculine performance of work. While previous research demonstrates the strength of gender double binds in constraining women’s actions and reproducing the dominant gender system, I argue that these conditions also create possibilities for resistance and change. Based on data from in-depth interviews with women who work in the building trades, this study examines the relationship between structural constraints and women’s agency in their response to normative constructions of gender. Rather than being forced into choosing between a stereotypically ‘masculine’ or ‘feminine’ role, tradeswomen manipulate gender rules by engaging in reflexive gender displays that emphasize the most advantageous iden...

Title: Assessing the impact of private equity on industrial relations in Europe

Abstract: Private equity firms are accused by trade unions of changing industrial relations in buyouts by demonstrating an unwillingness to recognize and work with trade unions, and by downgrading information and consultation. To explore these important policy issues, this article reports the first representative pan-European survey of managers’ perceptions of the impact of private equity on industrial relations. Managers report that private equity investment does not result in changes to union recognition, membership density or changes in management attitudes to trade union membership. Furthermore, managers in firms recognizing unions after private equity buyouts do not report reductions in the terms and conditions subject to joint regulation. Under private equity ownership more firms report consultative committees, managers regard these as more influential on their decisions, and indicate increased consultation over firm performance and future plans. Comparing industrial relations changes in different social mode...

Title: Self-doubters, strugglers, storytellers, surfers and others: Images of self-identities in organization studies
Author-Name: Mats Alvesson
Abstract: This article provides an overview of the key images of identity in organizations found in the research literature. Image refers to the overall idea or conceptualization, capturing how researchers relate to — and shape — a phenomenon. Seven images are suggested: self-doubters, strugglers, surfers, storytellers, strategists, stencils and soldiers. These refer to how the individual is metaphorically understood in terms of identity, that is, how the researcher (research text) captures the individual producing a sense of self. The article aims to facilitate orientation — or encourage productive confusion — within the field, encourage reflexivity and sharpen analytic choices through awareness of options for how to conceptualize self-identity constructions.

Title: Technology-assisted supplemental work and work-to-family conflict: The role of instrumentality beliefs, organizational expectations and time management

Abstract: People engage in technology-assisted supplemental work (TASW) when they perform role-prescribed tasks at home after regular work hours with the aid of technological tools such as laptops, cell phones, BlackBerries®, and PDAs. Drawing from the technology acceptance model, we hypothesized and found that instrumentality beliefs (perceived usefulness) and organizational expectations (psychological climate) were positively related to TASW. In addition, we hypothesized and found that TASW was positively related to work-to-family conflict. However, time management (setting goals and priorities) moderated the relationship such that people who apply certain time management strategies may reduce the negative influence of TASW on their lives at home.

Author-Name: Ellen Ernst Kossek

Author-Name: Leslie B Hammer
Abstract: This article examines perspectives on employer work—life initiatives as potential organizational change phenomena. Work—life initiatives address two main organizational challenges: structural (flexible job design, human resource policies) and cultural (supportive supervisors, climate) factors. While work—life initiatives serve a purpose in highlighting the need for organizational adaptation to changing relationships between work, family, and personal life, we argue they usually are marginalized rather than mainstreamed into organizational systems. We note mixed consequences of work—life initiatives for individuals and organizations. While they may enable employees to manage work and caregiving, they can increase work intensification and perpetuate stereotypes of ideal workers. In order to advance the field, organizations and scholars need to frame both structural and cultural work—life changes as part of the core employment systems to enhance organizational effectiveness and not just as strategies to supp...

Abstract: This study explores how individuals across six family life stages (before children, transition to parenthood, youngest child preschool-age, youngest child school-age, youngest child adolescent, and empty nest) differ in their experience of the work—family interface. Data come from a global IBM work and life issues survey (N = 41,769). Structural equation modeling was used to compare employees from six family life stages on work role factors (job hours, job responsibility, job flexibility) and family role factors (household work hours, marital status), and their relationships to work—family conflict, family—work conflict, work—family fit and four personal success measures. Meaningful differences in the means and size of the relationships among variables across family life stages provided empirical evidence of a ‘life course’ for the work—family interface influenced by differential exposure and differential effects of work and family role demands.

Title: How passive ‘face time’ affects perceptions of employees: Evidence of spontaneous trait inference
Author-Name: Kimberly D Elsbach
Author-Name: Dan M Cable
Author-Name: Jeffrey W Sherman
Abstract: We examine how passive ‘face time’ (i.e. the amount of time one is passively observed, without interaction) affects how one is perceived at work. Findings from a qualitative study of professional office workers suggest that passive face time exists in two forms: 1) being seen at work during normal business hours — or expected face time, and 2) being seen at work outside of normal business hours — or extracurricular face time. These two forms of passive face time appear to lead observers to make trait inferences (i.e. they lead observers to perceive employees as either ‘dependable’ or ‘committed’, depending on the form of passive face time). Findings from an experimental study confirm our qualitative findings and suggest that trait inferences are made spontaneously (i.e. without intent or knowledge of doing so).We discuss the implications of our findings for theories of person perception and the practice of performance appraisal.

Title: Private equity, the minimalist organization and the quality of employment relations
Author-Name: Suzana B Rodrigues
Author-Name: John Child
Abstract: This article develops a firm-level analysis of how the quality of employment relations following acquisition by private equity firms (PEFs) is contingent upon the strategic intent of those firms and the post-acquisition organizational choices they make. The efficiency gains that PEFs seek in acquired companies are expected to encourage restructuring towards a minimalist organization. However, the form such an organization takes is seen to depend on whether PEF strategy is oriented primarily towards extracting short-term value from acquired assets rather than towards renewing and developing those assets. Contrasts in the process of restructuring and in organizational form associated with these two strategies will have different implications for the quality of employment relations. The way in which PEFs restructure the companies or units they acquire is the key intervening factor between the strategic intent of PEFs and impact they have on the quality of employment relations.

Abstract: In this article we define and explain private equity, with particular emphasis on the heterogeneity of the phenomenon. We consider different theoretical perspectives of relevance to the study of private equity buyouts. In particular, we distinguish between approaches that take a zero-sum perspective (rational choice and financialization perspectives) and those with a more nuanced, complementary viewpoint (heterodox institutional and theories of action and structure perspectives). We discuss private equity in historical perspective. We then summarize the articles in this special section. Finally, we identify an agenda for further research that focuses upon employee relations and human resource aspects of private equity buyouts.

Title: Review article: Enhancing employability: Human, cultural, and social capital in an era of turbulent unpredictability
Author-Name: Vicki Smith
Abstract: Turbulence and unpredictability in 21st-century labor markets arguably magnify the importance of maintaining employability. Drawing on recent research, I discuss three mechanisms for enhancing employability in this context: identity work, training and networking, and laboring in unpaid and marginal paid positions. Few of these activities are counted as ‘work’ because they are mostly unpaid and they often take place outside formal job structures. By specifying how a range of employment-related activities are essential to and even constitute work, this article contributes to debates about the scope and boundaries of employment and shows how everyday actions build and reinforce new economic structures — how individual actions make the new economy possible. It also provides greater specification of the concept of employability.

Abstract: Materialism is a defining aspect of many societal cultures. Unfortunately, a large body of research has documented a negative relationship between materialism and indicators of non-work personal well-being. This study extends the materialism research into the organizational domain, investigating whether materialistic values are related to work-related indicators of personal well-being. Our field study results indicate that materialistic values are negatively associated with a range of indicators of work-related personal well-being, including intrinsic and extrinsic reward satisfaction, job satisfaction, and career satisfaction. Further analyses suggest that the relationship between materialism and work-related personal well-being is driven by the happiness and centrality dimensions of materialism, and not by the success dimension. Implications for future research and practice are presented.

Title: When whistle-blowing works: The Norwegian case
Author-Name: Marit Skivenes
Author-Name: Sissel C Trygstad
Abstract: Research on whistle-blowing in the Norwegian public sector shows remarkable findings compared with international research. A very high proportion of employees blow the whistle when they experience misconduct, and the majority of these people receive positive reactions. Furthermore, a majority of the whistle-blowers report that the conduct that led them to blow the whistle improved. These positive findings are different from those reported in international research displaying that whistle-blowing is difficult, often results in retaliation and is rarely effective. This article seeks to shed light on the positive Norwegian experiences, first by exploring how power resources can help us understand the extent and types of whistle-blowing, the consequences for the whistle-blower and the effectiveness of the practice. Second, the article asks whether a Norwegian model of labour relations promotes a communicative ‘culture’ where employees can freely voice their opinions and critical remarks, and report misconduct...

Title: How satisfied are they and why? A study of job satisfaction, job rewards, gender and temporary agency workers in Australia
Author-Name: Lydia Aletraris
Abstract: The temporary agency industry has experienced substantial growth in the past two decades. Although there is research on the quality of Australian agency work, most studies have emphasized economic disparities in outcomes for workers. Representative quantitative research using large-scale Australian data on non-economic outcomes, such as job satisfaction, has been scant. Using a nationally representative sample of Australian workers, I examine the extent to which temporary agency workers are satisfied with their jobs and the differences in the satisfaction of agency and permanent workers. I find that agency workers report lower levels of job satisfaction and that job security, control over the duration of work and autonomy are important mediating mechanisms. They are also less satisfied with the work itself, hours worked and their job security. I also find that women are more satisfied with temporary work than men and explore why. I end with implications for organizations and future research.

Title: Transformational leadership and follower creativity: The moderating effects of identification with leader and organizational climate
Author-Name:  Peng Wang
Author-Name: Joseph C Rode
Abstract: We examined relationships among transformational leadership, employee identification with leader, innovative climate, and employee creativity in a diverse sample of 212 employees and their immediate supervisors from 71 workgroups representing 55 organizations. Results from multi-level linear modeling analyses indicated that transformational leadership was not significantly related with employee creativity, nor were the two way interactions of transformational leadership × identification with leader and transformation leadership × innovative climate. However, the three-way interaction of transformational leadership, employee identification with leader, and innovative climate was associated with employee creativity. We discuss the implications of these findings for practice and theory.

Title: Have careers become boundaryless?
Author-Name: Ricardo A Rodrigues
Author-Name: David Guest
Abstract: The idea the boundaryless career has recently permeated the careers literature. However, critics have claimed that the concept is fuzzy and difficult to operationalize. Moreover, one of the core assumptions, namely the collapse of traditional organizational careers allied to increasing mobility across organizational boundaries, has rarely been seriously analysed in the careers literature. This article aims to take forward the analysis of the boundaryless career concept in two ways. First, we discuss its conceptual and operational problems. We argue that the current debate, focused on the permeability of organizational boundaries, fails fully to address the complexity of contemporary careers. Second, we integrate contributions from labour economics on job stability to argue that the assumption of the collapse of the traditional career model is not supported by the evidence. In our conclusions, we draw on boundary theory to outline the potential of a different approach to the conceptualization of career bou...

Title: From virtual teams to virtuality in teams
Author-Name: Keith R Dixon
Author-Name: Niki Panteli
Abstract: In this article we propose to go beyond the dichotomy of virtual vs collocated teams to look instead at virtuality in teams. In so doing, we argue that technology-mediated interactions do not substitute but rather complement face-to-face interactions.We adopt a definition of virtuality in teams based on discontinuities and pursue an understanding of their dynamics in an in-depth case study of an inter-organizational virtual centre of excellence.The findings present evidence suggesting the formation of ‘virtual continuities’ that mitigate the effects that create discontinuities. This, we argue, enriches our understanding of the complex dynamics of virtuality. The theoretical implications are discussed.

Title: Elasticity in the ‘rules’ of the game: Exploring organizational expedience
Author-Name: Judi McLean Parks

Abstract: The primary objectives of this article are twofold. Our first objective is to introduce the construct of ‘organizational expedience’. We differentiate organizational expedience from a wide range of related constructs in the literature, such as counterproductive work behavior, deviance, pro-social rule-breaking, organizational retaliation behavior, and propensity to withhold effort. Our second goal is to provide a conceptual framework that proposes that role stressors (i.e. ambiguity, conflict, and overload) are antecedents of organizational expedience, which in turn predicts other worker behaviors such as voice, creativity, and cynicism. Details of the mechanisms underlying these relationships are presented as mediators including tension, task conflict, and emotional exhaustion. In addition, behavioral integrity and psychological ownership are discussed as potential moderators of the specified relationships. Based upon our conceptual framework, a series of propositions are provided as a platform for futur...

Title: Boundary object use in cross-cultural software development teams
Author-Name: Michael Barrett
Author-Name: Eivor Oborn
Abstract: This article examines the evolving use of boundary objects in cross-cultural software teams. Our field study of a Jamaican-Indian team examines the use of software specifications and project management tools as boundary objects in facilitating sharing across knowledge boundaries. We examine how and why the role and use of boundary objects may facilitate collaboration across knowledge boundaries at one time and contribute to conflict at other times. We unpack the interacting elements that both facilitate and constrain knowledge sharing, and trigger conflicts at different stages of the software team development. Specifically, we found that the use of boundary objects at transitions involving definitional control and the subsequent redistribution of power/authority may inhibit knowledge sharing. The subsequent reifying of cultural boundaries along with negative stereotyping led to relational conflict, through a process we call culturizing , as cross-cultural differences emerged as problematic for team dynamics.

Abstract: This article examines the language of numbers as it is used in talk within a contemporary organization to provide a better understanding of the ways speech acts, performed during the construction of accounts, contribute to the process of organizing. Based on an in-depth case study of the site budgetary control process in a French construction firm, it shows that the business of doing calculations through talk generates respective obligations and, in turn, plays a central role in the constitution of the organization. Hence, this article shows how accounting, in all of its manifestations, produces the organization and does not simply occur within it.

Title: The impact of organizational change on steelworkers in craft and production occupational groups
Author-Name: Nick Bacon

Author-Name: Ali Dastmalchian
Abstract: This article examines the impact of organizational change on different occupational groups in the steel industry. In difficult financial circumstances and resulting pressure to downsize, a move to new forms of team-based working, in combination with staffing reductions, led to differential effects on craft and production occupational groups. Job satisfaction declined as a result of these changes with production workers reporting work intensification, while craft workers joining production teams reported skills under-utilization and reduced commitment to the organization. The existing occupational distribution of knowledge, skills and abilities led to the creation of multi-skilled production teams rather than developing teams of multi-skilled workers.The results clearly demonstrate the importance of understanding the limits imposed on new work arrangements such as teamworking by financial pressures and the occupational structure of the traditional labour process. In particular, the article highlights the s...

Title: Secrets of the beehive: Performance management in university research organizations
Author-Name: Célio AA Sousa

Abstract: This article explores how universities have implemented research performance systems. It considers how researchers working as managers assume the responsibility for research groups, and how they deal with managerial pressures from higher levels of management and outside forces. Drawing on in-depth interviews with research managers, we discuss how this particular responsibility is shaping up in their practices and perceptions. This article shows how role ambivalence enables research managers to view stricter performance requirements as being both problematic and challenging. These managers engage in alternative ways of moulding and legitimizing their activity by negotiating its terms and conditions with the universities and researchers alike. The notion of resilient compliance is put forward to convey the idea that research managers’ ambivalence regarding prevalent pressures is subsequently reconciled by introducing new organizing elements into the workplace. We argue that because a focus on agency appears...

Title: The moderating role of optimism on politics-outcomes relationships: A test of competing perspectives
Author-Name: Wayne A Hochwarter
Author-Name: Kenneth R Thompson
Abstract: Research to date has assumed that politics perceptions lead to uniformly negative outcomes. Recent studies, however, advocate examining theoretically relevant dispositional factors capable of differentially predicting politics perceptions—work outcome relationships. One individual difference factor possessing considerable scholarly merit in this regard is optimism. Building on recent research, the politics perceptions—optimism relationship was examined in a series of three studies. In particular, our objective was to determine whether optimism intensified or neutralized the potentially negative effects of perceived politics on job satisfaction and tension. Across samples, findings confirmed a moderating effect; notably, politics triggered increased stress and lower satisfaction for individuals with higher levels of optimism. In contrast, stress and satisfaction remained largely unaffected for less optimistic individuals reporting elevated levels of politics. These findings, which suggest that optimism may...

Title: The moderating effects of polychronicity and achievement striving on the relationship between task variety and organization-based self-esteem of mid-level managers in China
Author-Name:  Chun Hui
Author-Name: Cynthia Lee
Author-Name:  Xiongying Niu
Abstract: Employees’ organization-based self-esteem (OBSE), defined as ‘the degree to which an individual believes him/herself to be capable, significant, and worthy as an organizational member’ (Pierce and Gardner, 2004: 593), can be increased by giving them tasks that fit their dispositions. The primary purpose of our study is to examine combinations, instead of individual dispositions separately, on OBSE. Specifically, to increase OBSE, we propose that giving employees who prefer to handle multiple tasks simultaneously (people who are polychronic) more task variety. This effect will be stronger for employees with high motivation to achieve (achievement striving). The hypotheses were tested using data collected from 260 middle managers and their immediate supervisors in three Chinese organizations. We found that offering more task variety to polychronic employees with high levels of achievement striving resulted in the highest levels of OBSE.

Title: ‘I feel like a foreign agent’: NGOs and corporate social responsibility interventions into Third World child labor
Author-Name:  Farzad Rafi Khan
Author-Name: Robert Westwood
Author-Name: David M Boje
Abstract: A field study focused on a Western-led Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) intervention into Pakistan’s soccer ball industry is used to explore the dynamics surrounding local Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) staff charged with implementation. Those dynamics include the post-colonial conditions pervasive in Third World contexts that frame the perception, interpretation, and reaction to Western interventions. NGO staff must navigate these conditions, which impel them into multiple subject positions and contradictory rationalities resulting in unsatisfactory experiences. Like many Western-led interventions resting on universalistic, paternalistic, de-contextualizing, and atomistic assumptions, this one brought negative unintended consequences. This leads to a suggested reconfiguration of CSR from a post-colonial perspective insistent on an inclusive ‘bottom-up’, ‘reversed engineered’ approach, wherein CSR problems are traced back to Western multinational corporations’ policies and practices.

Author-Name: Linn Van Dyne
Abstract: This article tests an integrative conceptual model of organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) that combines two dominant distinctions in types of OCB (individual versus organizational target and promotive versus protective orientation). Challenging past research that has viewed OCB as unidimensional, we propose conceptually meaningful differences in the ways that employees perceive roles and rewards in relation to different dimensions of OCB. Results from four non-overlapping samples representing over 1550 employees support systematic similarities and differences between four specific types of OCB: helping, taking charge, compliance, and sportsmanship. We discuss theoretical and practical implications, emphasizing the value of future research that focuses on specific types of OCB.

Title: High performance work systems and performance: The role of adaptive capability

Author-Name: Chung-Ming Lau
Abstract: High performance work systems (HPWS) represent a systematic and integrated approach of managing human resources toward the alignment of HR functions and the achievement of firm strategy. The relationship of HPWS with firm performance has been extensively examined, though the mechanism underlying HPWS—performance relationship is not well researched, especially at the organizational level. Based on the dynamic capabilities perspective, this study examines a model with adaptive capability as the mediator in the relationship between HPWS and firm performance, aiming to understand how HPWS is positively associated with organizational outcomes. Institutional environment as a contextual factor that influences the relationship between adaptive capability and performance is also examined. Empirical results from a sample of Chinese firms indicated that HPWS—firm performance linkage was partially mediated by adaptive capability. In addition, the effect of HPWS on adaptive capability was stronger for firms in an inst...

Abstract: Challenging the heteronormative bias in the current literature on men’s workplace friendships, this article uses qualitative interview data to explore how gay men understand and experience workplace friendships involving other gay and heterosexual men. Developing a Foucauldian approach, this study suggests that gay men’s experiences and perspectives on workplace friendships can supplant negative stereotypes of men’s friendships, by understanding them as relational sites for developing empowering organizational gay sexualities and genders. From a Foucauldian theoretical orientation, we can examine how gay men can(not) avoid falling into the trap of treating gender and sexuality in dichotomous and heterosexist terms, allowing them and their male work friends to explore new possibilities for workplace friendships that are more gender and sexually complex than is currently assumed. This article advocates future research on this matter as it could potentially enrich extant critical scholarship that has often b...

Title: Dyadic ties among employees: Empirical analysis of creative performance and efficiency
Author-Name: Alexander Fliaster
Author-Name: Florian Schloderer
Abstract: Our article makes three contributions to the literature. First, while previous research on creativity and innovation has focused on individuals and teams, we investigate creative dyads. Second, we consider not only benefits that knowledge workers gain from resourceful partners but also tie-related costs that both partners incur. As a result we develop a research framework in which a dyad’s creative performance is explained by the amount of knowledge that the tie partners exchange, the level of responsiveness among them, and the efficiency of knowledge-related collaboration. We test empirically hypotheses drawn from this framework, collecting data on 1128 possible non-directed ties among employees directly involved in the new product development of a medium-sized German aerospace company and analyzing these data using the Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure (MRQAP). In the final sections we discuss managerial consequences, limitations of our study, and directions of future research.

Abstract: This article evaluates the human capital consequences of several mergers of local exchange companies that took place between 1988 and 2001 in the telecommunications industry of the United States. Most firms in the sector underwent one merger event while other firms underwent two events. The levels of jobs and average wages in the firms are assessed after the merger events and analysis reveals that, while the first merger events experienced by firms led to growth in employment and compensation, second merger events, which included several mega-mergers of the late 1990s and early 2000s, have led to stagnation and decline in employment levels and to negative human capital outcomes with declines in wage levels.

Abstract: Outsourcing partners have the potential to learn from each other by discussing effective practices and to use these discussions to improve their business performance. However, there are significant barriers to trusting, open, and integrative communication. Results from 95 largely domestic outsourcing partnerships in China support the hypotheses that cooperative, but not competitive or independent, goals are a foundation upon which partners share their effective practices openly and directly with each other and that this kind of discussion promotes improved business results. Specifically, the structural equation analysis supported the reasoning that cooperative goals foster open discussion of effective practices that, in turn, results in business development. Findings were interpreted as providing support that cooperative interdependence is a foundation for effective interaction and learning between outsourcing partners in China and perhaps in other countries as well.

Abstract: Organizations create policies in an effort to reduce injustice, as well as address the needs and interests of organizational members. We argue that individuals can make fairness judgments related to organizational policies, which are independent from other dimensions of fairness (i.e. distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational justice). Results of a field study with 164 union members found that (a) individuals make judgments about the fairness of policies that are distinct from other forms of justice, (b) perceptions of policy justice predict variance in behaviors beyond other forms of justice, and (c) perceptions of policy justice interact with distributive and procedural justice to predict behaviors. More specifically, results show that policy justice interacts with distributive justice to predict turnover intentions and citizenship behaviors towards the union. Policy justice also interacts with procedural justice to predict turnover intentions. However, this interaction was in the oppos...

This study investigates two behavioral outcomes of entitlement — political behavior and co-worker abuse — and the mediating role of job-related frustration. We also examine the impact of supervisor communication (i.e. evaluative and informative communication) on the relationship between psychological entitlement and frustration. Results of a study of 223 employees suggested that entitlement was positively associated with both political behavior and co-worker abuse, and that frustration partially or fully mediated both relationships. Additionally, results suggested that relatively high levels of supervisor communication reduced job frustration for less-entitled employees but exacerbated the frustration reported by those with stronger entitlement perceptions.

Title: The role of justice and social exchange relationships in workplace deviance: Test of a mediated model
Author-Name: Assâad El Akremi

Author-Name: Julie Camerman
Abstract: Using data collected on two occasions spaced apart by three months (N = 602), we examined the relationships between a) distributive, procedural, informational, and interpersonal justice (measured at Time 1) and b) perceived organizational support (POS), leader—member exchange (LMX), and organization- and supervisor-directed deviance (measured at Time 2). We found that POS fully mediated the relationship of procedural justice but not distributive justice to organization-directed deviance. In addition, LMX fully mediated the relationships of informational justice and interpersonal justice to both supervisor-directed deviance and organization-directed deviance. The implications of these findings for the study of justice and social exchange relationships as predictors of workplace deviance are discussed.

Title: Does training managers enhance the effects of implementing team-working? A longitudinal, mixed methods field study
Author-Name: Karina Nielsen
Author-Name: Raymond Randall
Author-Name: Karl Bang Christensen
Abstract: The introduction of team-working often has positive effects on team members but places significant new demands on managers. Unfortunately, little research has examined whether the impact of the intervention may be enhanced by providing managers with training during the change process. To test this possibility we carried out a longitudinal intervention study (with a ‘no training’ comparison group) in a part of the Danish elderly care sector that was implementing teamwork. Kirkpatrick’s (1998) training evaluation model was used to examine the effects of training team managers in issues such as teamwork, transformational leadership and change management on the outcomes of team implementation. We used a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods to isolate the impact of manager training on the success of the teamwork intervention. The results identified some significant, but modest, incremental positive effects that could be attributed to the manager training. The results also showed that si...

Title: A multiple climates approach to understanding business unit effectiveness
Author-Name: Judith S MacCormick
Author-Name: Sharon K Parker
Abstract: We propose four theoretically competing climates that are important for business-unit performance: climates for external control, internal control, internal flexibility, and external flexibility. Using a sub-sample of 620 business units from multiple companies across different industries and countries, we identified mechanisms by which climates influence business performance, accounting for different stakeholder interests. Climate for external control related directly to perceived business performance; climates for external flexibility and internal control both related to customer loyalty, which in turn predicted perceived business performance. Importantly, we show the moderating role of context whereby climate for internal flexibility was positively associated with perceived business performance, but only when market volatility was high. Drawing on the notion of ambidexterity, business units with higher effectiveness measures for all stakeholders also had high levels of all four climates, concurrently. T...

Title: The ‘work group’: Redressing the balance in Bion’s Experiences in Groups
Author-Name: Robert B French
Author-Name: Peter Simpson
Abstract: The intention of this article is to explore and develop Wilfred Bion’s theory of groups, and to contribute to its wider application across the social sciences. Bion suggested that groups operate simultaneously in two strictly contrasting ways, based on distinctive mental states, which he called ‘basic-assumption mentality’ and ‘work-group mentality’. He believed that these mentalities determine a group’s capacity to achieve its purposes. However, the development of these ideas has tended to focus on the regressive tendency in group functioning — on basic-assumption mentality. This article attempts to redress the balance by ascribing equal importance to the notion of work-group mentality. First, it extends Bion’s framework, developing the concept of the ‘work group’ in parallel with the ‘basic assumptions’; second, it considers the dynamic relationship between these two mentalities, in order, finally, to explore the application of Bion’s ideas via a case example.

Title: Differential effects of empowering leadership on in-role and extra-role employee behaviors: Exploring the role of psychological empowerment and power values
Author-Name: Steffen Raub
Author-Name: Christopher Robert
Abstract: In this research we examined the impact of empowering leadership behaviors (ELBs), psychological empowerment, and individual-level power values on a broad range of employee behaviors. Drawing on self-determination theory (Gagné and Deci, 2005), we hypothesized that ELBs would have direct effects on in-role and affiliative extra-role behaviors, but that the impact of ELBs on challenging extra-role behaviors would be mediated by psychological empowerment. Further, we hypothesized that individual-level power values (Schwartz, 1992) would moderate the mediated effect of ELBs on challenging behaviors. Responses to questionnaires from 541 employees and their supervisors were obtained from 16 hotel properties located in 11 Middle Eastern and Asian countries. Results supported our hypotheses of direct and mediated effects of ELBs on employee behaviors, and supported moderated mediation involving psychological empowerment and power values such that psychological empowerment was more strongly related to challenging...

Abstract: This article presents an exploratory account of how medical professionals understand the relationship between new technology and their professional identities. Drawing on interview data with senior surgeons from a variety of surgical disciplines, the article draws attention to how new technologies provide occasions for the evaluation of existing intra- and inter-professional relationships, and professional identity as a whole. In particular, the role of changing insider/outsider dynamics is emphasized, as is the importance of recognizing professional identity as in constant flux at micro-, meta- and macro-levels. The implications for existing theory are discussed, and further research questions identified.

Title: An analysis of bias in supervisor narrative comments in performance appraisal
Author-Name: Kathlyn Y Wilson
Abstract: This study explored supervisors’ explanations for performance ratings assigned to subordinates. It was suggested that supervisors may emphasize a different set of factors across groups in arriving at an overall evaluation that would reflect different implicit theories of performance for different ethnic groups. Operationally, these differences were predicted to be reflected as differences across groups in the factors cited by supervisors in justifying their performance ratings of subordinates. The study also examined the consistency between these assigned ratings and the written justifications. Using a sample of bank staff, supervisors’ written summaries of subordinate performance were content analyzed to identify the types of comments made across groups and the match or mismatch with overall ratings. Hypotheses received partial support.The results are interpreted in light of the literature on group differences in performance ratings, and implications for future research and practice are discussed.

Abstract: This research examined the association between gender composition of the work context and perceived reward and social outcomes for women and men. A nationally representative sample of 594 male and 430 female Swedish medical doctors responded to a survey asking them to report the gender composition of their medical unit, the gender of their immediate supervisors, and the gender of the head of their work organizations. Participants also responded to previously validated measures of perceived fairness, discrimination, organizational support, exclusion, and gender harassment. Findings indicated that: 1) women who worked in medical units with a larger percentage of men reported more gender harassment; 2) women who had a male supervisor reported less organizational support; and 3) women who worked in an organization with a male head reported more gender discrimination. For men, gender composition was unrelated to any of the outcome measures.

Title: Liminality and the practices of identity reconstruction
Author-Name: Nic Beech
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to contribute a conceptualization of liminality, a state of in-between-ness and ambiguity, as it applies to identity reconstruction of people in organizations. Liminality is discussed in anthropological and organizational literatures and a composite understanding is developed here. This incorporates a dialogical perspective and defines liminal practices along with varying orientations of dialogue between the self and others. Application of this conceptualization is illustrated by analysis of two cases and a broader application of the concept to the identity work literature is discussed.

Title: Personality and inter-role conflict and enrichment: Investigating the mediating role of support
Author-Name: Alyssa Friede Westring
Author-Name: Ann Marie Ryan
Abstract: Although researchers have discussed the relationships between personality and inter-role conflict and enrichment, little research explores why these relationships exist. This study examines the role of perceptions of support as one such mechanism. We expect that individuals with more positive core self-evaluations will perceive greater levels of support, which will enable them to avoid inter-role conflict and take advantage of opportunities for inter-role enrichment. In the current study, the inter-role conflict and enrichment faced by student-parents managing the demands of school and their parenting responsibilities are examined. Student-parents with more positive core self-evaluations were found to perceive and seek out greater levels of support, which related to more effective management of multiple life roles. Based on our findings, we argue that future research should continue to investigate the mechanisms by which personality affects the management of multiple life roles. Suggestions as to how prac...

Title: Knowledge and practice in multidisciplinary teams: Struggle, accommodation and privilege
Author-Name: Eivor Oborn
Author-Name: Sandra Dawson
Abstract: The importance of translating knowledge across occupational boundaries is frequently identified as a means of generating innovation and improving performance. The creation of the multidisciplinary team is an institutional response to enable such translation and synergy, yet few studies examine the processes of knowledge generation and translation in such teams. This article offers a case study that analyses these processes in decisions about the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Polanyi’s concept of tacit integration is used to reveal how meaning is developed and manifest in team decisions and to examine how the discursive resources embedded in tacit knowledge shape clinical practice. We highlight the foundations and dynamics that privilege the knowledge of some team members to be reconstituted as multidisciplinary group practice. Privileged knowledge then becomes embedded in the practices of the group. We conclude that the creation of a multidisciplinary structure may support rather than challenge exi...

Title: ‘Being yourself ’ in the electronic sweatshop: New forms of normative control
Author-Name: Peter Fleming
Author-Name: Andrew Sturdy
Abstract: This article extends research about high-commitment management practices in tightly controlled work environments typified by the call centre. One promising research avenue suggests that normative management systems in such contexts, involving ‘fun’ exercises and culture programmes, etc., are more about distracting employee attention away from other, more taxing controls. This article develops such an approach by exploring the specific nature and conditions of such distraction. An empirical study of a call centre in which employees were encouraged to ‘just be themselves’ (in relation to lifestyle differences, sexuality, diverse identities, etc.) reveals how the distractions are partly informed by the dysfunctions of existing technical, bureaucratic and conventional cultural controls, all of which homogenize workers. Furthermore, the new regime not only serves to distract employees, but proves instrumental in capturing their sociality, energy and ‘authentic’ or ‘non-work’ personalities as emotional labour. ...

Title: The trouble with sanctions: Organizational responses to deviant anger displays at work
Author-Name: Deanna Geddes
Author-Name: Lisa T Stickney
Abstract: This article examines management and coworker reactions to employee anger expressions that violate salient emotion display norms, for example, deviant anger, and explores whether these reactions can promote subsequent positive change at work. Full-time US employees volunteered information about workplace anger expressions they personally witnessed and felt ‘went too far’. Using open-ended survey questions, we identified three categories of deviant anger (physical acts, intense verbal displays, and inappropriate communication), as well as various formal and informal sanctioning and supportive responses initiated by organizational observers. Additional data collection and generalized linear modeling analysis revealed that when coworkers and management responded supportively to the angry employee (rather than with sanctions or doing nothing), favorable change occurred, improving the problematic situation. Implications for future research, management practices, and employee socialization are discussed.

Title: Discursive positioning and planned change in organizations
Author-Name: Ryan S Bisel
Author-Name: J Kevin Barge
Abstract: This study uses discursive positioning theory to explore how planned change messages influence organizational members’ identity and the way they experienced organizational change. Based on an in-depth case study of a home healthcare and hospice organization that engaged in a multiyear planned change process, our analysis suggests that workers experienced salient change messages as constituting unfavorable identities, which were associated with the experiences of violation, recitation, habituation, or reservation. Our study also explores the way discursive and material contexts enabled and constrained the governing board’s change messages as they responded to external and internal audiences. We highlight the importance of viewing messaging as a process of information transfer as well as discursive construction, which has important implications for the way change agents approach issues of sense making, emotionality, resistance, and materiality during planned change processes.

Title: The role of social identity, appraisal, and emotion in determining responses to diversity management
Author-Name: Veronique Tran
Author-Name: Patricia Garcia-Prieto
Author-Name: Susan C Schneider
Abstract: In this article, we address the question of why employees may resist or support any aspect of diversity management. More specifically, we propose a dynamic model that explains how and why specific social identities triggered by diversity management influence employees appraisals of diversity management, in turn eliciting specific emotions and specific behavioral responses such as resistance or support to various implementations of diversity management policies and practices. We rely on Intergroup Emotion Theory (IET) as the overarching theoretical framework, which draws from Social Identity Theory (SIT) and appraisal theories of emotion. The contribution of our model is to provide an additional lens to the diversity literature, moving from emotive reactions to diversity to emotional yet rational responses, which may be further understood via the iterative nature of the model. We discuss implications for future research.

Abstract: Whereas most research has focused on the negative aspects of touch in the workplace (i.e. sexual harassment), this study focuses upon the positive use of touch. In an effort to explain individual differences in the use of workplace touch, three sequential studies are used to introduce the concepts of workplace touch self-efficacy and workplace touch initiation anxiety. In Study 1 we develop scales to assess the constructs. Study 2 provides an initial examination of the construct validity of the measures developed in Study 1. Results of Study 3 indicate that supervisor reports of touch self-efficacy and physiological touch anxiety are related to subordinate reports of supervisor touch. Additionally, results show that supervisor use of touch is related to several indicators of supervisor social effectiveness. Finally, sex of the supervisor appears to play a role in workplace touch as female supervisors report less touch anxiety, greater touch self-efficacy and more use of touch than male supervisors.

Title: The antecedents of a ‘chilly climate’ for women faculty in higher education
Author-Name: Cheryl L Maranto
Author-Name: Andrea EC Griffin
Abstract: The literature on women’s under-representation in academia asserts that faculty women face a ‘chilly climate’, but there are few theoretically based studies examining this proposition. Relational demography, organizational justice, and social network theories all identify possible antecedents of ‘chilly climate’. Using survey data of faculty at a private Midwestern US university, we test whether the perception of exclusion (chilly climate) is influenced by demographic dissimilarity, and perceptions of fairness and gender equity. We find that faculty women perceive more exclusion from academic departments with a low representation of women, consistent with relational demography. Perceptions of procedural fairness and gender equity are powerful factors that foster inclusion and warm the climate for both men and women. The ‘chilly climate’ for women faculty is a complex phenomenon with multiple causes. Policies that fail to address these multiple causes are unlikely to be effective.

Abstract: This article provides an assessment of the impact of Union Learning Representatives (ULRs) on both employer-funded and non-employer funded training in Britain. The findings, based upon the largest and most comprehensive national survey of ULRs conducted to date, suggest that while a significant proportion of ULRs have influenced training levels positively, a further 26 percent have had no positive impact on either employer-funded or non-employer funded training, and a further 13 percent have had a very limited impact. The article also develops an ‘Activity-Support-Characteristics’ (ASC) framework, and uses this framework to identify the factors that are associated with the ability of ULRs to influence training levels. The analysis shows ULRs are more likely to have had a positive impact on training where: they spend five hours a week or more on the role; they are supported by a workplace Learning Centre or a Union Learning Fund project; managers value their ULR activities; consultation or negotiation over...

Title: Emotional politics in cleaning work: The case of Israel
Author-Name: Orly Benjamin

Author-Name: Pnina Motzafi-Haller
Abstract: Emotional politics instil insecurity and doubt in working-class individuals. Researchers examining social degradation through (bad) employment or other stigma have demonstrated the exclusionary impact of this process. Some suggest that individuals respond to such emotional politics and other types of exclusion by identity-management strategies aiming at a sense of worth, whereas others have found self-isolation to dominate. Here we analyse the emotional politics emerging from women’s responses to exclusion in the socially degraded field of cleaning in three ethno-national contexts in Israel. The sample was composed of Mizrahi women in the southern periphery, immigrants from the Former Soviet Union and Israeli-Palestinian women from Arab settlements in the north. By analysing cleaning employees’ talk, we characterize these women’s struggle to derive a sense of worth from their breadwinning experience within a specific ethno-national context in terms of family, community and workplace. We discuss the simila...

Author-Name: Astrid C Homan
Abstract: Faultline theory suggests that negative effects of team diversity are better understood by considering the influence of different dimensions of diversity in conjunction, rather than for each dimension separately. We develop and extend the social categorization analysis that lies at the heart of faultline theory to identify a factor that attenuates the negative influence of faultlines: the extent to which the team has shared objectives. The hypothesized moderating role of shared objectives received support in a study of faultlines formed by differences in gender, tenure, and functional background in 42 top management teams. The focus on top management teams has the additional benefit of providing the first test of the relationship between diversity faultlines and objective indicators of organizational performance. We discuss how these findings, and the innovative way in which we operationalized faultlines, extend faultline theory and research as well as offer guidelines to manage diversity faultlines.

Title: Enabling selves to conduct themselves safely: Safety committee discourse as governmentality in practice
Author-Name: Joel Rasmussen
Abstract: A developing body of literature argues that workplace safety is increasingly becoming the responsibility of employees who are the potential victims of hazards. Although interaction is an integral part of enacting and justifying these responsibilization processes, previous research has not provided detailed analysis of organizational talk in this regard. Following Brownlie’s (2004) ‘analytic bridging’ of Foucault and close discourse analysis, this study centres on a safety committee meeting, and demonstrates how governmentality is exercised as senior managers seek the consent of other employees for behavioural-safety implementation. Three discursive strategies are analysed in detail, examining the construction and invocation of: 1) an equal partnership through collaborative and vague talk; 2) hierarchy through directives and declaratives; 3) competitiveness by the establishment of a factory-versus-factory contest. In sum, these discursive strategies forcefully combine constructions of reciprocal relations ...

Abstract: There is considerable evidence to suggest how positive and negative leader emotions influence a variety of positive and negative follower outcomes. However, little empirical evidence exists to suggest under what circumstances the enactment of negative emotions can yield desirable outcomes for individuals operating in a given organizational context. Drawing upon a series of semi-structured interviews with construction project managers (n = 19) from the UK, this study offers valuable insights into how anger is frequently enacted to help individuals ensure the progress of the project, be it in negotiations with other parties or affairs on site with operatives.

Author-Name: Kerr Inkson

Abstract: In this article we extend consideration of differences of interest in employment relationships to career issues. Two sets of interests — those of employing organizations and of individual workers — often make careers ‘contested terrain’ in which organizations pursue strategic advantages and individuals personal advantages. The contestation is contextualized by current trends to individualized employment relations and a focus on managerial, professional and technical work. The two interest sets mirror a disjuncture between two disciplinary bases, the ‘vocational’ base underpinned by psychology and the ‘strategic human resource management’ (SHRM) base, underpinned by economics. We develop a ‘psychological contract’ model, in which both individuals and organizations invest knowledge capital in the other with a view to obtaining long-term returns. We consider the implications of our analysis and model for career management by both individuals and organizations, for future research on careers, and for the inte...

Title: Professional identity construction: Using narrative to understand the negotiation of professional and stigmatized cultural identities
Author-Name: Holly S Slay
Author-Name: Delmonize A Smith
Abstract: While there is growing interest in professional identity construction (e.g. Clarke et al., 2009), little is known about how stigma may influence the development of professional identity. Professional identity is defined as one’s professional self-concept based on attributes, beliefs, values, motives, and experiences (Ibarra, 1999; Schein, 1978). Professional identity construction under conditions of stigmatized cultural identity presents an interesting puzzle. Professional roles are defined as prestigious and provide the role holder with autonomy (Benveniste, 1987) and, often, a degree of privilege. However, stigmatized persons are often accorded little prestige and/or privilege because their identities are tainted. Thus, the purpose of our research is to build and enrich theory around professional identity construction by investigating the development of professional identity under conditions of stigmatized cultural identity.

Title: In search of the blue flower? Grand social theories and career research: The case of Bourdieu’s theory of practice
Author-Name: Katharina Chudzikowski
Author-Name: Wolfgang Mayrhofer
Abstract: Responding to the various calls for more interdisciplinarity in career research over the last few decades, we identify five touchstones for theoretical concepts to advance the interdisciplinary dialogue on careers. Drawing on Bourdieu’s theory of practice, we outline its contributions to such a dialogue in the light of these touchstones. In spite of some potential pitfalls, the theory of practice not only invites interdisciplinary dialogue, but also provides a unifying framework for generating new questions in career research and systematically integrating concepts from other disciplines. Overall, this is but one example of how grand social theories can stimulate interdisciplinarity in career research.

Title: Responsible careers: Systemic reflexivity in shifting landscapes
Author-Name: Svenja Tams
Author-Name: Judi Marshall
Abstract: This article examines responsible careers, in which people seek to have an impact on societal challenges such as environmental sustainability and social justice. We propose a dynamic model of responsible careers based on studying 32 individuals in the emerging organizational fields of corporate responsibility, social entrepreneurship, sustainability, and social investing. We describe six career practices — expressing self, connecting to others, constructing contribution, institutionalizing, field shaping, and engaging systemically. Observations suggest that development of these practices is influenced by four learning dynamics: people’s perceptions of ‘shifting landscapes’ in which they seek to orient themselves, exploration and both biographical and systemic reflexivity. Our interdisciplinary and empirically grounded approach, integrating psychological intentions and institutional context, strengthens theorizing about responsible careers. The proposed model depicts responsible careers as continually evol...

Title: Careers, social context and interdisciplinary thinking
Author-Name: Barbara S Lawrence
Abstract: Scholars have engaged in studies of careers, individuals’ work experiences over time, since the early 20th century. Although much has been written about the need for interdisciplinary research, limited work exists. This article presents a comparative technique that facilitates interdisciplinary thinking. Using data from a large organization, three stories are applied to the associations between social context and career outcomes: a different disciplines story, a multiple disciplines story and an interdisciplinary story. The results suggest that the best career satisfaction outcome results from the multiple disciplines story, whereas the best performance and salary outcomes result from the interdisciplinary story.

Title: Interdisciplinary approaches to contemporary career studies
Author-Name: Svetlana N Khapova
Author-Name: Michael B Arthur
Abstract: This is the opening article in a Human Relations special issue on ‘Interdisciplinary approaches to contemporary career studies’. After introducing a story of an ‘exceptional — but real’ career, we argue for an urgent shift toward greater interdisciplinary inquiry. We reflect on the story to describe differences in the way each of psychology, sociology, social psychology, and economics views the concept of career. We turn to explore what career researchers, representing each of the above social sciences, might not see on their own. In contrast, we highlight how social scientists can move toward a) appreciating the limitations of our separate approaches, b) introducing more appropriate research methods, c) maintaining a wider cross-disciplinary conversation, and d) better serving the client — the person — in our future research. We continue with a preview of the remaining five articles in this special issue, and propose that these can serve as stimuli for a wider conversation.

Title: Beyond righting the wrong: Supervisor-subordinate reconciliation after an injustice
Author-Name: Meena Andiappan
Author-Name: Linda K Treviño
Abstract: We propose a future-oriented model that focuses on the reconciliation of the supervisor—subordinate relationship after a workplace injustice. First, we propose factors associated with the victim’s sensemaking process that influence the need for relationship reconciliation efforts: the seriousness of the violation, blame attribution, and equity sensitivity. We address the moderating effects of relationship characteristics, such as the existing trust reservoir and level of interdependence. Next, we propose that relationship outcomes will be influenced by characteristics of the relationship repair effort. Lastly, we examine the outcomes of successful reconciliation: forgiveness and restored trust and the moderating effects of victim characteristics.

Title: Cross-cultural perception and power dynamics across changing organizational and national contexts: Curaçao and the Netherlands
Author-Name: Coen Heijes
Abstract: In this article we study the role of power and power differences in cross-cultural perception. We do so by way of exploratory case studies in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the police in the Netherlands and Curaçao. We demonstrate how cross-cultural perception between two specific ethnic groups, European Dutch and African Curaçaoans, changes depending on the amount of power imbalance in the various organizational and national contexts. With this article, we follow the call for research on the impact of power dynamics on cross-cultural perception, an approach that goes beyond the traditional, dimensional approach that is prevalent in organization literature.

Title: The language of interests: The contribution of discursive psychology

Abstract: In this article we outline the contribution of the field of Discursive Psychology (DP) for the understanding of interests in organization studies. We discuss the limitations of viewing interests and motives as cognitive states, essential drivers of action and explanatory variables. Following DP, we propose to view interests and motives as a key component of meaningful social practice, making interests and motives a topic for analysis rather than resource for explanation. DP offers a distinct approach to analyzing the accounts that people make about their interests in a particular state of affairs, their stake in a particular situation, or their motive in pursuing a particular course of action. To illustrate our argument, we analyze two data extracts from a qualitative study of a UK public-private partnership. By illustrating the way in which interests are dealt with in different interactional situations, we seek to contribute by outlining a more sophisticated and insightful way of understanding interests ...

Title: Connecting religion and work: Patterns and influences of work-faith integration

Abstract: Religiosity can significantly impact human behavior yet little is known about how religious belief and practice integrate with work. Using the Faith at Work Scale, we surveyed Christian workers in the United States (n = 374) and found that work-faith integration was positively associated with faith maturity, church attendance, age and denominational strictness, and negatively associated with organizational size. Denominational groups varied in their degree of integration but displayed similar patterns across dimensions of integration. Work-faith integration was manifest most strongly in integration related to the self, and somewhat less so in areas related to others and in transcendent aspects of work. Respondents attributed spiritual disciplines and workplace mentors as salient influences of work-faith integration. Implications for workplace spirituality scholarship and management are explored.

Title: ‘One mirror in another’: Managing diversity and the discourse of fashion
Author-Name: Anshuman Prasad
Author-Name: Pushkala Prasad
Author-Name: Raza Mir
Abstract: In this article, we report on a multi-sited ethnographic study that investigates how the discourse of fashion influenced the design and implementation of workplace diversity management programs in six organizations. These organizations, from the Canadian petroleum and insurance industries, were manipulated by an institutional field of consultants and experts into adopting relatively superficial initiatives that lacked local relevance, and produced a high level of organizational cynicism regarding diversity. In our analysis, we particularly explore one adverse effect of this discourse of fashion; that it may trigger a form of meaningless imitation by organizations adopting diversity management initiatives, resulting in superficiality and organizational cynicism. At the same time, the discourse of fashion may also hold the key to enable meaningful change, for it has a powerful influence on organizational practitioners. Our article suggests that organizations need to be aware of the institutional field, and ...

Title: Pit sense: Appropriation of practice-based knowledge in a UK coalmine
Author-Name: Ken Kamoche
Author-Name: Kevin Maguire
Abstract: Pit sense is a form of knowledge constituted by tunnellers as a way to navigate and assess risk. We discuss how this form of tacit knowledge that was situated in everyday practices came under threat when management introduced more bureaucratic procedures rationalized on the basis of commercial outcomes and health and safety. Yet, while managers were prone to vilify pit sense even though they had grown up with it earlier in their career, they were prepared to turn a blind eye to it as long as it delivered ‘yardage’. We examine the implications of this managerial ambivalence towards pit sense, and demonstrate how, rather than seeking to codify tacit knowledge in order to ensure its diffusion as the literature proposes, the bureaucratization of procedures and work practices not only challenged the legitimacy of pit sense, but also cast pit sense and formalized procedures into an uneasy alliance.

Title: The struggle to professionalize: An ethnographic account of the occupational position of Advanced Nurse Practitioners
Author-Name: Robert McMurray
Abstract: This article considers what happens when subordinate occupations challenge established roles and hierarchically organized professional divisions. Charting the struggles of a group of Advanced Nurse Practitioners to be recognized as a profession, the article considers the ways in which claims to licence, place and mandate are employed to negotiate new occupational spaces. Such spaces are shown to emerge as a consequence of the interplay of individual demands and favourable supply side conditions, the latter being required to support the development of new models of working in marginal positions. In a departure from accounts that place managerialism and entrepreneurialism in opposition to professionalism, the article shows how the executive authority that comes with entrepreneurial ownership can bolster professionalizing claims, disrupting and reversing hierarchically organized professional divisions. Identified as a context specific form of ordinal switching, the article considers whether such reversals he...

Title: It may not be what you think: Gender differences in predicting emotional and social competence
Author-Name: Scott N Taylor

Abstract: Women and men leaders have been noted to be similar in terms of emotional and social competence in the workforce. We analyzed gender differences in self-ratings, others’ ratings, and predicted ratings of men and women leaders on a multi-source feedback assessment of emotional and social competence. Findings revealed that there were significant differences between how leaders were rated on emotional and social competence versus how they predicted they would be rated. Furthermore, results indicated that when asked to predict how they were rated by their managers, direct reports, and peers, women were significantly poorer at predicting others’ ratings compared with men. However, women self-rated their demonstration of emotional and social competence similar to men. Age was investigated, but not found to have an effect on men and women’s predictions of others’ ratings. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings and areas for future research.

Title: Not sharing but trading: Applying a Maussian exchange framework to knowledge management
Author-Name: Efrosyni Konstantinou
Author-Name: Robin Fincham
Abstract: Knowledge sharing is widely regarded as the process underpinning knowledge management in organizations. The dissemination of knowledge so that all benefit from shared know-how is seen to greatly enhance working capability. Nevertheless, we suggest the sharing perspective can mean a somewhat restricted view of how knowledge workers relate to and use knowledge and that focusing on knowledge exchange affords a better understanding of the processes that prefigure sharing. In particular, we revisit a classic social exchange theory in the framework of gift relations that Mauss developed. Applying ideas of gift-giving to knowledge transfer invokes a complex economy of reciprocation and obligation taking account of a wide range of knowledge categories. Through a study of knowledge work in multinational settings, we demonstrate specific propositions consistent with a Maussian approach: knowledge reciprocity, interplay between sharing and withholding knowledge and knowledge use.

Title: Understanding unethical behavior by unraveling ethical culture
Author-Name: Muel Kaptein
Abstract: Unethical behavior in the workplace is a widespread phenomenon. In this article a model for the ethical culture of organizations that consists of eight dimensions is employed to explain unethical behavior. The sample was composed of 341 triads consisting of a manager and two direct reports. The results show that six dimensions of ethical culture were negatively related to observed unethical behavior: ethical role modeling of management, ethical role modeling of supervisors, capability to behave ethically, commitment to behave ethically, openness to discuss ethical issues, and reinforcement of ethical behavior. Two of the eight dimensions, clarity of ethical standards and visibility of (un)ethical behavior, were not significantly related to unethical behavior. This study demonstrates that multiple dimensions of ethical culture have to be taken into account to reduce unethical behavior. The study opens up avenues for future research about the significance of each dimension in specific settings, the dynamic ...

Title: The emerging regime of civil regulation in work and employment relations
Author-Name: Steve Williams
Author-Name: Edmund Heery
Author-Name: Brian Abbott
Abstract: This article examines the role of civil society organizations in generating civil regulation; that is, non-statutory norms, codes and standards of good practice that are intended to govern human resource management. It uses case study evidence of four charitable organizations in the United Kingdom to explore why they engage in civil regulation, the methods they use to secure business compliance and the forms of regulation they generate. There is an expanding literature on civil regulation, much of which focuses on the creation of voluntary codes that govern international business activity. Regulation of this type is often designated ‘private regulation’ and is understood as a functional alternative to regulation by the state. This article presents an opposing view, that civil regulation often develops within the nation-state and that it is not a form of private regulation but is bound up inextricably with the juridification of the employment relationship.

Title: Leadership and charisma: A desire that cannot speak its name?
Author-Name: Nancy Harding

Author-Name: Mark Learmonth
Abstract: Leadership has proved impossible to define, despite decades of research and a huge number of publications. This article explores managers’ accounts of leadership, and shows that they find it difficult to talk about the topic, offering brief definitions but very little narrative. That which was said/sayable provides insights into what was unsaid/ unsayable. Queer theory facilitates exploration of that which is difficult to talk about, and applying it to the managers’ talk allows articulation of their lay theory of leadership. This is that leaders evoke a homoerotic desire in followers such that followers are seduced into achieving organizational goals. The leader’s body, however, is absent from the scene of seduction, so organizational heteronormativity remains unchallenged. The article concludes by arguing that queer and critical leadership theorists together could turn leadership into a reverse discourse and towards a politics of pleasure at work.

Abstract: Is ‘switching off’ from work and home more or less necessary for individuals depending on role salience? The present study focuses on this question by assessing the importance of trait role salience for the relationship between daily detachment from work and home on the one hand, and several outcomes on the other hand. Forty-nine employees from different organizations in Spain filled out a general questionnaire and a daily questionnaire three times a day, during five consecutive working days. Results show that detaching from home particularly helps individuals with low work role salience to perform better at work and reduce home—work interference. Contrary to our expectations, detaching from work is especially important for individuals with high home role salience, increasing evening cognitive liveliness and reducing work—home interference. Our findings indicate that differences in trait role salience may affect the beneficial impact of detachment from work and non-work domains.

Abstract: Despite serious criticism, the boundaryless view of careers still heavily influences research. This article aims to do more than just challenge the claim that careers are becoming more boundaryless: our goal is to make clear that careers need to be thought of in alternative terms. To this end, we build on an analysis of academic careers to explain why regarding careers as either bounded or boundaryless is too simple and why more attention should be paid to the scripts that influence career choices. We draw from an empirical study carried out in two French universities that shows that promotion scripts operate under three conditions — credibility, legibility, and legitimacy of promotion models. We conclude that scripts are potentially very useful in understanding a wide range of careers.

Abstract: This article argues that international human resource management has failed to examine adequately the relations between multinational corporations (MNCs) and the geographies they operate in at sub-national levels. In particular, it needs to go much further in integrating insights from literatures on changing levels of governance, the role of sub-national sites of regulation in the creation and transmission of knowledge, and the geographical and organizational fragmentation of production. In reviewing these literatures alongside relevant contributions within international human resource management, it develops a research agenda by which the degree and nature of sub-national embeddedness of MNCs, and their effects on sub-national business and employment systems, can be analysed.

Abstract: International Framework Agreements (IFAs) represent a still small but growing and particularly interesting contribution to the global regulation of employment relations. IFAs enable global union federations (GUFs) to become actively involved in co-designing employment relations within transnational corporations (TNCs) and their global production networks. Based upon theoretical insights into the challenges of transferring practices in and across organizations, we present and discuss a model of practice transfer for global production networks based on empirical data from a content analysis of IFAs and from interviews with representatives of TNCs, GUFs, and other experts. Our study contributes to an organizational theory of practice transfer. But more importantly, it aims at a better integration of IHRM and international industrial relations by looking more closely at the particular role of GUFs as external actors.

Abstract: We pursue a comparative analysis of employers’ age management practices in Britain and Germany, asking how valid ‘convergence’ and ‘Varieties of Capitalism’ theories are. After rejecting the convergence verdict, we proceed to ask how far ‘path dependence’ helps explain inter-country differences. Through 19 interviews with British and German experts, we find that firms have reacted in different ways to promptings from the EU and the two states. Change has been modest and a rhetoric-reality gap exists in firms as they seek to hedge. We point to continuities in German institutional methods of developing new initiatives, and the emerging role of British NGOs in helping firms and the state develop new options. We argue that ‘path dependence’ offers insight into the national comparison, but also advance the idea of national modes of firm option-exploration as an important way of conceptualizing the processes involved.

Title: Policy transfer from advanced to less-advanced institutional environments: Labour market orientations of US MNEs in Turkey
Author-Name: Kadire Zeynep Sayım
Abstract: The extant research on policy transfer insufficiently addresses two issues. First, transfer to less-advanced countries. Second, micro-institutional pressures on subsidiaries, particularly the role of local partners in joint ventures (JVs). This study investigates the transfer of labour market orientations by American multinational enterprises to their Turkish subsidiaries by focusing on the influences of macro- and micro-institutional factors when the ‘transferor’ is an advanced and ‘transferee’ is a less-advanced economy, ‘dominance effects’, and the role of local JV partners. Case study findings provide evidence for ‘smooth’ transfer of the policy. This uncommon finding is discussed as a result of ‘ideal combination’ of ‘encouraging pressures’ at the macro- and micro-institutional levels, including role of local JV partners and the nature of the policy transferred.

Abstract: Over the last two decades in Europe and North America, many more employers have been requiring Sunday work. The current study examines attitudes towards days worked in a North American retail sample where most employees had to work on Sunday. We use Exchange Theory to develop hypotheses examining how factors related to working Sundays, such as organizational tenure, pay premiums, scheduling control, and scheduling flexibility, are associated with attitudes towards days worked. To test the hypotheses, employees were categorized into groups based on whether they worked Sundays and the premiums they received for working Sundays. Organizational tenure, higher premiums for Sunday work, and greater scheduling control were related to more positive attitudes towards days worked. In addition, employees more willing to work Sundays for scheduling control and flexibility had more negative attitudes towards their days worked. We discuss the practical implications in relation to work schedule management.

Using a multifarious theoretical backdrop steeped in a combinatorial analytical approach sustained by post-structural constructs, queer theory and relational perspectives, this study locates homophobic practices at work in terms of their variegated determinants, instantiations and possibilities for transformation. Open-ended, unstructured, probing interviews support the exploratory effort in gaining an authentic sense of meaning as evidenced by personal experience, and conditioned by contextual detail in the working lives of 20 lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals. This allows for the emergence of an account of how sexual orientation discrimination is diffused through a plethora of work environments in Turkey and at what particular ideational levels of signification emergent processes may combat such disc...

Abstract: We elaborate a theory of the foundations of a collective capability for compassion through a detailed analysis of everyday practices in an organizational unit. Our induced theory of compassion capability draws on the findings of an interview study to illustrate and explain how a specific set of everyday practices creates two relational conditions — high quality connections and a norm of dynamic boundary permeability — that enable employees of a collective unit to notice, feel and respond to members’ suffering. By articulating the mechanisms that connect everyday practices and a work unit’s compassion capability, we provide insight into the relational micro-foundations of a capability grounded in individual action and interaction.

Title: Beyond the enterprise: Broadening the horizons of International HRM
Author-Name: Rick Delbridge
Author-Name: Marco Hauptmeier
Author-Name: Sukanya Sengupta
Abstract: In this article we argue that International HRM research will benefit from an extended research agenda that moves: i) beyond the enterprise, ii) beyond managerialism, and iii) beyond universalism. This will require both a wider range of theoretical resources to be brought to bear and a greater attentiveness to the interpenetrating levels of the empirical worlds that are subject to evaluation and explanation. The article reflects on the opportunities for drawing on theoretical frameworks from proximate research areas and advances a multi-level approach in order to achieve a more holistic and situated understanding of HRM in its international and comparative contexts.

Title: Helping and harming others in the workplace: The roles of personal values and abusive supervision
Author-Name:  Ping Shao
Author-Name: Christian J Resick
Author-Name: Michael B Hargis
Abstract: Drawing on models of competing values and self-verification theory, this article proposes that social dominance orientation (SDO) and psychological collectivism (PC) represent contrasting values that motivate opposing workplace interpersonal behaviors. SDO values are hypothesized to motivate interpersonal deviance and the avoidance of interpersonal citizenship as these behaviors verify social dominance as a guiding self-principle. PC values are hypothesized to motivate behaviors that verify collectivism as a guiding self-principle, including interpersonal citizenship and the avoidance of interpersonal deviance. Further, drawing on the values activation literature, abusive supervision is hypothesized to moderate the values-to-behavior relationships. In a cross-organizational sample of 490 working adults, SDO was positively related to interpersonal deviance and negatively related to interpersonal citizenship. Highly abusive supervision strengthened, whereas minimally abusive supervision weakened relationshi...

Title: Social face concerns and conflict avoidance of Chinese employees with their Western or Chinese managers
Author-Name: Ann Chunyan Peng
Author-Name: Dean Tjosvold
Abstract: This study explores behavioral strategies in conflict avoidance and how they are related to social face concerns. One hundred and thirty-two Chinese employees recalled an incident where they avoided a conflict with their supervisors. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the categorization of yielding, outflanking, delay, and passive aggression as alternative approaches to avoiding conflict. Overall, other-face was positively associated with yielding and delay, whereas self-face was positively associated with passive aggression. The associations of social face concerns and avoidance were stronger among employees who interacted with Chinese managers compared with those working for Western managers. In conjunction with recent studies, findings challenge the traditional theorizing that the Chinese value of social face leads to passive avoidance.

Title: The Hughes Award: Who is they? Inquiries into how individuals construe social context
Author-Name: Barbara S Lawrence
Abstract: When people are asked about their career decisions, they often invoke the influence of they. They may include family or teachers, but it repeatedly includes some amorphous group of generalized others. This article describes my inquiries into the question: Who is they? Initial studies examined individuals’ perceptions of career timetables within organizations. The results suggested that individuals experience their social context as an intricate territory informed by self-perceptions, shared perceptions, and actual distributions. However, these studies assumed they equalled the employee population. Later work showed that in large organizations this assumption is unwarranted. Each individual acquires his or her own non-random version of social context: an organizational reference group. These individual-level reference groups and the neighborhoods in which they cluster are distinctive because they include distant associations defined only by awareness. Both concepts offer opportunities for exploring the soc...

Title: Embracing or embattled by converged mobile devices? Users’ experiences with a contemporary connectivity technology
Author-Name: Sharon F Matusik
Author-Name: Amy E Mickel
Abstract: In this qualitative study, we examine how converged mobile devices (e.g. BlackBerries, Treos, and iPhones) are experienced by users of this contemporary connectivity technology. Perhaps not surprisingly, users experience similar pressures to be accessible and responsive; however, the sources of these expectations extend beyond those internal to organizations to include sources external to organizations (e.g. family, friends, industry, CMD-user community, and society in general). Users’ reactions to responsiveness-accessibility pressures differ in this study, clustering into three different categories — ‘enthusiastic,’ ‘balanced,’ and ‘trade-offs.’ Further analyses reveal three emergent factors influencing users’ reactions: the number of expectation sources; specificity of the sources; and adoption motives. Our research builds on technology and work studies to include factors that are related to heterogeneity in interpretations and enactments. Moreover, findings suggest that in the context of this connecti...

Title: Is the merger necessary? The interactive effect of perceived necessity and sense of continuity on post-merger identification
Author-Name: Steffen R Giessner
Abstract: The changes experienced during a merger often reduce post-merger organizational identification among the workforce, thereby undermining the strategic goals of the merger. While previous research has shown that employees’ post-merger identification suffers less when they experience a sense of continuity, the current article explores methods of preserving post-merger identification even when employees experience a sense of discontinuity. It is hypothesized that for these employees, the perceived necessity of the merger strongly influences post-merger identification, because a sense of necessity can reduce the uncertainty that typically inhibits post-merger identification. A field study is presented (N = 144) to support this hypothesis. Finally, implications for the organizational pre-merger communication process are discussed.

Abstract: This article reflects on some of the definitions and practices that fall under the heading ‘discourse studies’. The springboard for my reflections is Mats Alvesson’s and Dan Kärreman’s retrospective piece, ‘Decolonializing discourse’, published in this issue. In responding to their piece, I’ll address some of the ‘big’ issues they raise: discourse as conceptual frame; discourse as language; the agency of discourse, and discourse as opposed to non-discourse.

Abstract: This piece seeks to extend a conversation that Alvesson and Kärreman started in 2000 from the pages of Human Relations and are continuing in their 2011 article; a conversation that is of great interest well beyond management and organization studies. Through a linguistics perspective that is attentive to the peculiarities of the discourse vocabulary but also seeks to probe aspects of its conceptual import, I will explore the significance of understandings of discourse circulating within the social sciences. I will continue with reflections on select difficulties raised by ‘social construction-unlimited’ before highlighting some of the benefits of a social semiotic approach to ethnographic research centred on the concept of indexicality. I will conclude with an invitation to ‘bring the researcher back’, in an embodied engagement with the field that can help put discourse in ‘its right place’.

Title: What’s cooking in organizational discourse studies? A response to Alvesson and Kärreman
Author-Name: Dennis K Mumby
Abstract: While Alvesson and Kärreman’s (2000) ‘Varieties of Discourse’ essay was an important and oft-cited marker in the field of organizational discourse studies, I argue in this response that their rather gloomy, even curmudgeonly, updated reading of the field is not only misplaced but also rooted in their own reductionist conception of discourse — a charge that they themselves level against contemporary organizational discourse research. As a communication scholar who makes his interdisciplinary home in the area of organizational communication/organization studies, I argue that much of Alvesson and Kärreman’s critique has its origin in a rather anemic, even wrongheaded, reading of the ‘linguistic turn’ — a reading that limits the generative and analytic possibilities of post-linguistic turn organizational discourse studies.

Title: Decolonializing discourse: Critical reflections on organizational discourse analysis
Author-Name: Mats Alvesson
Author-Name: Dan Kärreman
Abstract: Organizational discourse has emerged as a large research field and references to discourse are numerous. As with all dominating approaches problematizations of assumptions are important. This article, partly a follow up of the authors’ frequently cited 2000 Human Relations article, provides a critical and perhaps provocative overview of some of the more recent work and tendencies within the field. It is argued that discourse continues to be used in vague and all-embracing ways, where the constitutive effects of discourse are taken for granted rather than problematized and explored. The article identifies three particular problems prevalent in the current organizational discourse literature: reductionism, overpacking, and colonization and suggests three analytical strategies to overcome these problems: counter-balancing concepts — aiming to avoid seeing ‘everything’ as discourse — relativizing muscularity — being more open about discourse’s constitutive effects — and disconnecting discourse and Discourse t...

Title: Ethnic minority professionals’ experiences with subtle discrimination in the workplace
Author-Name: Koen Van Laer
Author-Name: Maddy Janssens
Abstract: This qualitative study aims to explore the processes underlying subtle discrimination in the workplace. Based on 26 in-depth interviews with minority professionals of Turkish or Maghrebi descent in Flanders, we argue that subtle discrimination in the workplace is characterized by three important elements. First, subtle discrimination is ambiguous, and often involves disempowerment through apparent empowering behavior. Second, subtle discrimination is based on processes of power — normalization, legitimization of only the individual, legitimization as the Other and naturalization — which subtly, through everyday incidents, disempower minority individuals. Third, subtle discrimination in the workplace is linked to societal structures and discourses, which permeate the workplace through, and are reproduced by, workplace encounters.

Title: Team design and stress: A multilevel analysis
Author-Name: Kevin S Cruz
Author-Name: Frits K Pil
Abstract: Using a sample of 1708 team members in 292 team-based establishments, we examine the relationship between team member stress, and team autonomy in the form of team decision making, team leader appointment, and team responsibility. We also examine the relationship between stress, and intrateam interdependence in the form of team member interdependency and team-based job rotation. We further examine whether the relationships between team design and stress are mediated by team member job demands and job control. We find that an increase in job demands indirectly mediates the positive relationships between team decision making and team responsibility, and stress. We also find that a decrease in job demands indirectly mediates the negative relationship between team-based job rotation and stress. Our results suggest that the optimal design of a team, with respect to stress, is a team that has a low degree of autonomy and a high degree of intrateam interdependence.

Title: Mapping out the field of equality and diversity: Rise of individualism and voluntarism
Author-Name: Mustafa Özbilgin

Abstract: Drawing on 66 interviews with key actors in the equality and diversity field in the UK, we operationalize Bourdieu’s conception of the field, across the axes of individualism versus collectivism and regulation versus voluntarism, and map out the location of the key actors in this field. The contribution of this article is three-fold. First, we advance the understanding of the equality and diversity field at national level by analysing the accounts of the influential actors, whose interests and actions shape the field. Second, the article illustrates how the multi-actor and contested nature of the equality and diversity field manifests in these accounts, and presents evidence in support of policy and strategic thinking that goes beyond a single-actor focus. Finally, we contribute to the theoretical maturity and expansion of the equality and diversity scholarship through the use of Bourdieuan sociology.

Title: Gender, embodiment and place: The gendering of skills shortages in the Australian mining and food and beverage processing industries
Author-Name: Lia Bryant
Author-Name: Katrina Jaworski
Abstract: This article examines skills shortages in the context of the Australian mining and food and beverage processing industries. Drawing on Acker’s concept of inequality regimes, we examine gendered and classed bodies in relation to place. We argue that organizations are situated in place, and here, Australian rural places. We also argue that while specific industries are important to the rural economies, these economies are influenced by the gendered politics of place that occur at the site where the enterprise is located. Guided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ quantitative analyses of workforce profiles, and predominantly drawing on qualitative interviews with Human Resource (HR) personnel, we analyse the gendering of work, place and organizations across three themes: a) women, work and reproducing bodies; b) male embodiment, organization and place; and c) absent bodies: women and apprenticeships. The purpose is to show that assumptions about gender, embodiment and place influence how organizations u...

Title: The emotional labour process: An essay on the economy of feelings
Author-Name: Steve Vincent
Abstract: This article evaluates conceptual resources for exploring the economy of feelings. It reviews existing contributions, discovering tensions surrounding the material status of emotional displays and normative commitments at work, as well as significant gaps within the conceptual resources used to classify the emotions we experience and evoke while working. In an effort to develop more robust categories for this broad area, labour process theory is combined with other conceptual tools to reframe and refresh debates. Specifically, the concept emotional misbehaviour is posited as a useful addition to the debate concerning the material status of emotion at work and various novel conceptual resources are explored from a labour process perspective. In particular, emotional intelligence, techno-normative control, symbolic violence and cultural capital are introduced to the debate and considered for their potential usefulness in filling the conceptual gaps identified.

Title: Beneath the glass ceiling: Explaining gendered role segmentation in call centres
Author-Name: Dora Scholarios
Author-Name: Phil Taylor
Abstract: Although the call centre is much researched, the literature on gender remains surprisingly undeveloped given the importance of this setting for women’s employment. This study of role segmentation in four call centres demonstrates women’s disproportionate representation in more routinized mass production roles, as opposed to higher status or managerial grades. It also analyses three explanations – human capital, domestic status and supervisor career support. The evidence shows that women face a ‘glass ceiling’, first, on entry to the call centre in terms of human capital disadvantage and levels of domestic constraint and, second, within the call centre in their ability to secure supervisor support for career opportunities. We argue that even for women with similar career aspiration and human capital to men, domestic responsibilities create obstacles before they reach the glass ceiling, especially for managerial roles, and contribute thereafter to reinforcing their concentration in more intensive, lower sta...

Abstract: This study investigates the role of professional identity threat and team identity as moderators of the relationship between diverse composition and the performance of interprofessional teams. Survey data from 47 interprofessional teams in a tertiary referral hospital in New South Wales, Australia demonstrates the value of social identity in understanding the performance of such teams. The first finding, that team identity moderates the relationship between diversity and team effectiveness, indicates that commitment and attraction to their team enhances members’ ability to work together cooperatively. The second finding, that threat to professional identity plays a deleterious role by moderating an inverse relationship between diversity and effectiveness, suggests that professional dissent may increase the negative effects of diversity. Finally, support for the role of interprofessional motivation in strengthening team identity and reducing identity threat provides both an additional theoretical contribut...

Abstract: This study explores how individual level and team level social capital characteristics manifest their joint influence on knowledge transfer, considering team social capital as a moderator between individual social capital and knowledge transfer. Situated in a post-training context, a survey of 390 individuals from 30 teams in a Chinese bank was conducted. Our results revealed that team social capital interacted with individual social capital in influencing knowledge transfer. At the individual level, distance and structural equivalence between the knowledge seeker and the knowledge source influenced how much knowledge was transferred between them. Furthermore, team network density mitigated the negative effect of distance on knowledge transfer, and team learning culture reduced the positive effect of structural equivalence on knowledge transfer. Theoretical implications based on the findings are drawn.

Title: Does it matter where your manager works? Comparing managerial work mode (traditional, telework, virtual) across subordinate work experiences and outcomes
Author-Name: Timothy D Golden
Author-Name: Allan Fromen
Abstract: Although research has begun to examine impacts from employee work modes such as teleworking, studies to date have overlooked the impact that managers who work away from the office might have on subordinates. Using a large dataset (N = 11,059), this study therefore compares three managerial work modes (traditional, telework, virtual work), to investigate differences in subordinate work experiences and outcomes. Results suggest that in comparison to subordinates with managers in a traditional work mode, work experiences and outcomes are generally less positive for subordinates with teleworking managers who spend a portion of the week away from the office, and they are lower as well for subordinates with virtual managers who are away from the office full time. These results differ based on the subordinate’s own work mode and are modest in magnitude. This study suggests a need for further investigation into the effects of managerial work modes on subordinate experiences and outcomes.

Title: Relational leadership
Author-Name: Ann L Cunliffe
Author-Name: Matthew Eriksen
Abstract: This article aims to extend contemporary work on relational leadership theory by conceptualizing leadership as embedded in the everyday relationally-responsive dialogical practices of leaders. Relational leadership requires a way of engaging with the world in which the leader holds herself/himself as always in relation with, and therefore morally accountable to others; recognizes the inherently polyphonic and heteroglossic nature of life; and engages in relational dialogue. This way of theorizing leadership also has practical implications in helping sensitize leaders to the importance of their relationships and to features of conversations and everyday mundane occurrences that can reveal new possibilities for morally-responsible leadership. We develop and illustrate the notion of relational leadership by drawing on the work of Bakhtin and Ricoeur, and on an empirical study of Federal Security Directors.

Title: Tainted love: From dirty work to abject labour in Soho’s sex shops
Author-Name: Melissa Tyler
Abstract: This article is based on ethnographic research carried out in sex shops – retail premises selling sex toys, clothing and accessories, as well as sexually explicit books and films – located in London’s Soho. Drawing on the concept of ‘dirty work’, it explores not only the ways in which the various taints associated with dirty work – physical, social and moral – are lived and experienced, but also the allure of this particular type of work for those who perform it, and particularly of Soho as a work place. In doing so, the article extends the study of dirty work by drawing attention to two related themes that emerged from the research – first, the performance of what might be termed ‘abject labour’; that is, work that invokes a simultaneous attraction and repulsion for those who undertake it, and second, the significance of location and place in understanding the lived experience of work and the meanings with which particular types of work are imbued. The discussion concludes by arguing that teasing out the...

Title: Emotions in uniform: How nurses regulate emotion at work via emotional boundaries
Author-Name: Renae Maree Hayward
Author-Name: Michelle Rae Tuckey
Abstract: The management of emotions at work has been conceptualized in terms of its association with emotional inauthenticity and dissonance. In contrast, we integrate the idea of emotion regulation at work with basic strategic and adaptive functions of emotion, offering a new way of understanding how emotions can be harnessed for task achievement and personal development. Through a content analysis of interview data we examined how and why emotion regulation is carried out by employees, focusing on the in situ experiences of nurses. The manipulation of emotional boundaries, to create an emotional distance or connection with patients and their families, emerged as a nascent strategy to manage anticipated, evolving, and felt emotions. The emotional boundary perspective offers possibilities for knowledge development that are not rooted in assumptions about the authenticity of emotion or the professional self but that instead account for the dynamic, complex, multi-layered, and adaptive characteristics of emotion man...

Title: Bankers in the dock: Moral storytelling in action
Author-Name: Andrea Whittle
Author-Name: Frank Mueller
Abstract: This article draws on insights from a variety of fields, including discursive psychology, ethnomethodology, dramatism, rhetoric, ante-narrative analysis and conversation analysis, to examine the discursive devices employed in the storytelling surrounding the recent financial crisis. Discursive devices refer to the linguistic styles, phrases, tropes and figures of speech that, we propose, are central to the development of a compelling story. We focus our analysis on the moral stories constructed during a public hearing involving senior banking executives in the UK. The analysis suggests that two competing storylines were used by the bankers and their questioners to emplot the events preceding the financial crisis. We propose that a discursive devices approach contributes to the understanding of storytelling by highlighting the power of micro-linguistic tools in laying out the moral landscape of the story. We argue that the stories surrounding the financial crisis are important because they shaped how the c...

Title: Having to be: The possessive constitution of organization
Author-Name: Nicolas Bencherki
Author-Name: François Cooren
Abstract: How does an organization act? Can it be considered an actor on its own or does it need organizational members who act on its behalf? We would like to suggest our own take on the issue by suggesting a genuinely communicative approach to the issue of organizational action. Using the narratology of AJ Greimas to make apparent in talk some of process philosophy’s tenets, we show how organizations act by being attributed actions. The detailed study of meetings from a community organization serves as our empirical grounding. We suggest that through the imbrication of mandates and programs of action in a logic of appropriation/attribution, the organization can effectively act while always relying on others to do so. Far from ‘just talk,’ we contend that in doing so, participants reconfigure their organization and make it do things. There is no need to resort to an essentialist ontology of organization to state that it acts ‘itself.’ We therefore reconcile the two most common views of organizational action – that...

Title: Organizational commitment, organization-based self-esteem, emotional exhaustion and turnover: A conservation of resources perspective
Author-Name: Émilie Lapointe
Author-Name: Christian Vandenberghe
Author-Name: Alexandra Panaccio
Abstract: We examined the relationship of four commitment dimensions (affective, normative, continuance-perceived sacrifices and continuance-lack of alternatives) to emotional exhaustion over time under the lens of conservation of resources theory. Using data from 260 employees, Time 1 lack of alternatives and normative commitment contributed positively to Time 2 emotional exhaustion, controlling for Time 1 emotional exhaustion. Organization-based self-esteem (OBSE) moderated the relationship of lack of alternatives commitment to emotional exhaustion such that the relationship was stronger when OBSE was high. We further theorized that the resource drain engendered by emotional exhaustion would cause the latter to be positively related to turnover, controlling for commitment dimensions. Results supported this prediction. The implications of these findings for future research on commitment, emotional exhaustion and turnover are discussed.

Title: Organized sensemaking: A commentary on processes of interpretive work
Author-Name: Karl E Weick
Abstract: The contributions to this special issue focus on links among sensemaking, organizing, and storytelling. They are re-examined in terms of to what the authors pay attention, with what, and for what. In pursuit of linkages, authors attend to accounts of consulting failure, hearings about the recent financial crisis, life history storytelling by elite actors, conflict in a rugby team on tour in Australia, and recurring stories told by jazz musicians. With analyses of dominant stories, discursive devices, life stories, documentaries, and oral tradition, these authors aim for a deeper understanding of order, constraint, conflict, legitimation, embodiment, and distributed improvisation. An assessment of these efforts shows how they deepen, extend, and consolidate our understanding of interpretive work.

Title: Sensemaking and sensegiving stories of jazz leadership
Author-Name: Michael Humphreys
Author-Name: Deniz Ucbasaran
Author-Name: Andy Lockett
Abstract: Drawing on contemporary interviews and archival data, we explore how stories can be used as templates to guide jazz musicians’ sensemaking about the leadership of teams, what it means to be a jazz musician and what jazz is (or is not). By going beyond the metaphorical notion of jazz as improvisation, we contribute to theories of leadership by showing how informal storytelling can act as a powerful sensemaking and sensegiving mechanism for leadership and organizing. We also explore the contested nature of stories drawing on the notion of ‘antenarrative’. Our analysis contributes to the body of work on leader sensegiving and storytelling by examining the conditions under which a story’s sensegiving power may be restricted. Our research suggests that the sensegiving power of an ante-narrative and associated stories depends on whether or not they attempt to counter a dominant discourse.

Title: From hero to villain to hero: Making experience sensible through embodied narrative sensemaking
Author-Name: Ann Cunliffe
Author-Name: Chris Coupland
Abstract: This article aims to make a contribution to the literature by addressing an undertheorized aspect of sensemaking: its embodied narrative nature. We do so by integrating a hermeneutic phenomenological perspective of narrative and storytelling with a documentary case taken from a filmed tour of a sports team to illustrate the process of sensemaking around a specific event. We argue that we make our lives, ourselves and our experience ‘sensible’ in embodied interpretations and interactions with others. We suggest this occurs within contested, embedded, narrative performances in which we try to construct sensible and plausible accounts that are responsive to the moment and to retrospective and anticipatory narratives.

Title: The appropriated language: Dominant stories as a source of organizational inertia
Author-Name: Lovisa Näslund
Author-Name: Frida Pemer
Abstract: This article suggests that by regarding the semantics of storytelling, we are able to explore how dominant stories influence and may contribute to organizational inertia. Using data from two change projects in large Scandinavian companies, it is shown that in the negotiation of meaning those stories that display semantic fit with the dominant story are perceived as more convincing, while those stories that lack this attribute appear oxymoronic and fail to have an impact. As a result, the organization is only able to change in a manner congruent with the dominant story and becomes inert in other respects. We suggest that a dominant story fixes not only the meaning of events, but also the meaning of the labels available for sensemaking. By this appropriation of language, the dominant story circumscribes sensemaking and storytelling possibilities, and thereby restricts organizational flux.

Title: Does gender bias against female leaders persist? Quantitative and qualitative data from a large-scale survey
Author-Name: Kim M Elsesser
Author-Name: Janet Lever
Abstract: The present study of 60,470 women and men examined evaluations of participants’ current managers as well as their preferences for male and female managers, in general. A cross-sex bias emerged in the ratings of one’s current boss, where men judged their female bosses more favorably and women judged male bosses more favorably. The quality of relationships between subordinates and managers were the same for competent male and female managers. A small majority (54%) of participants claimed to have no preference for the gender of their boss, but the remaining participants reported preferring male over female bosses by more than a 2:1 ratio. Qualitative analysis of the participants’ justifications for this preference are presented, and results are discussed within the framework of role congruity theory.

Abstract: The goal of this study is to develop a theoretical framework to illuminate the process of careers unfolding over time in an overall life context. We draw on data from a qualitative field study of the career paths of 81 professionals who pursued working on a reduced-load basis as a strategy for sustaining commitment to both their careers and family lives. Using multiple methods to analyze what happened between two interviews approximately six years apart, we identify five distinct career narratives and present a model of the evolution of careers. The model suggests that individuals construct careers over time through their own sensemaking of constantly shifting entangled strands of their personal, family, work, and community lives and three key dynamics that are ongoing: external events, gradual developments, and individual actions.

Abstract: This article examines elite business careers through the dual lens of sensemaking and storytelling as recounted in life-history interviews with business leaders. It explores how they make sense of, narrativize and legitimate their experiences of building their careers within and beyond large organizations. The research contribution is twofold. First, we explicate the sensemaking processes embedded within the multifarious stories recorded in life-history interviews, identified as locating, meaning-making and becoming. Second, we contribute to the literature on legitimacy by examining how business leaders use their storytelling as a vehicle for self-legitimization, (re)framing their accounts of their own success and justifying their position to themselves and others. In a world where reputations are hard won but easily lost, business leaders must nurture a life-history narrative which is socially desirable if their careers are to remain on track. This may serve them well through the creative evolution of th...

Title: Simplexity: Sensemaking, organizing and storytelling for our time
Author-Name: Ian Colville
Author-Name: Andrew D Brown
Author-Name: Annie Pye
Abstract: Simplexity is advanced as an umbrella term reflecting sensemaking, organizing and storytelling for our time. People in and out of organizations increasingly find themselves facing novel circumstances that are suffused with dynamic complexity. To make sense through processes of organizing, and to find a plausible answer to the question ‘what is the story?’, requires a fusion of sufficient complexity of thought with simplicity of action, which we call simplexity. This captures the notion that while sensemaking is a balance between thinking and acting, in a new world that owes less to yesterday’s stories and frames, keeping up with the times changes the balance point to clarifying through action. This allows us to see sense (making) more clearly.

Abstract: Past research has shown a close connection between organizational culture and effectiveness, but nearly all of this research has examined the direct effects of culture on performance outcomes. In contrast, this article examines the idea that the effects of cultural consistency on organizational performance may differ depending on the levels of other culture traits. Data from 88,879 individuals in 137 public companies using the Denison Organizational Culture Survey were paired with three objective measures of organizational performance and used to examine the interaction effects of consistency with mission, adaptability, and involvement. Consistency shows a significant positive interaction with all three traits in predicting market-to-book ratios and sales growth. Firms that are both consistent and adaptable, for example, are high performers. In contrast, the results show a significant negative interaction when predicting return on assets. The implications of these results are discussed with respect to fut...

Title: Context and the social representation of absenteeism: Absence in the popular press and in academic research
Author-Name: Eric Patton
Author-Name: Gary Johns
Abstract: This study explores contextual issues surrounding absenteeism through a content analysis of 2847 articles from the New York Times that have featured absence from work. Our analysis focuses on two issues related to context. First, how does the representation of absence from work compare between the contextual domains of academic research and of the popular press? Second, how can event-specific news stories in the press deepen our understanding of how absence is shaped by contextual factors? Our results highlight both similarities and differences between the press and academic research, suggest several ideas from news stories that could lead to interesting future research, and underline management implications from this source commonly read by business leaders.

Title: Working under intensive surveillance: When does ‘measuring everything that moves’ become intolerable?
Author-Name: Graham Sewell
Author-Name: James R Barker
Author-Name: Daniel Nyberg
Abstract: We examine how call-center employees draw on opposed discourses to understand the purpose and consequences of performance measurement as workplace surveillance. Sometimes the workers saw performance measurement as a legitimate and impartial managerial tool serving the interests of everyone in the organization (e.g. by exposing free-riding, etc.). Other times, they saw performance measurement as intrusive and oppressive; imposed on them by managers who, as agents of employers, used it to serve a narrow set of interests (e.g. by intensifying work, etc.). Our analysis depicts how employees used an ironical process of predicate logic to develop flexible meaning-making strategies to cope with the apparent conflicts in meaning that arose from the two opposed discourses. We conclude by developing a three step method for the practical analysis of such ironical situations of competing discourses that facilitates our ability to reconsider and reconfigure meaning in more useful ways.

Author-Name: Margunn Aanestad
Abstract: This article contributes to our understanding of practices in innovating organizations. Previous studies have demonstrated how breakthroughs in knowledge may fail to be translated into practices if they are not aligned with existing practices, or if they cut across established boundaries and power structures. By drawing upon an ethnographic study of a medical R&D department that has been highly successful in developing new medical practices, this article investigates how such challenges can be overcome. To date, much of the literature has focused on coordination across single, well-defined boundaries. We here extend this focus and introduce the notion of ‘boundary organizing’ to analyse highly political and contingent processes of innovation and change within and across different practices. We add to existing literature by highlighting how the handling of multiple boundaries, the indirect effects of boundary work, the negotiation of mutual benefits and interests, and mutual adaptation are key aspects of b...

Author-Name: Else Ouweneel

Author-Name: Corine I van Wijhe
Abstract: The objective of this diary study was to look at the potential positive within-person relationships between positive emotions, work-related hope, and the three dimensions of work engagement on a daily level (i.e. vigor, dedication, and absorption). Following Broaden-and-Build theory and Affective Events Theory, it was expected that the experience of positive emotions would cause hope, which in turn would lead to a state of vigor, dedication, and absorption. The study was conducted among 59 employees of a Dutch university, who filled in a diary questionnaire for five consecutive working days, twice a day. As expected, the experience of positive emotions had an indirect effect on the level of vigor, dedication, and absorption through hope across days. So, it seems that an individual and daily perspective on work engagement is particularly worthwhile and provides valuable insights to enhance employee engagement in practice.

Title: Power, institutions and the cross-national transfer of employment practices in multinationals
Author-Name: Anthony Ferner
Author-Name: Tony Edwards

Abstract: This article argues for the systematic incorporation of power and interests into analysis of the cross-border transfer of practices within multinational companies (MNCs). Using a broadly Lukesian perspective on power it is argued that the transfer of practices involves different kinds of power capabilities through which MNC actors influence their institutional environment both at the ‘macro-level’ of host institutions and the ‘micro-level’ of the MNC itself. The incorporation of an explicit account of the way power interacts with institutions at different levels, it is suggested, underpins a more convincing account of transfer than is provided by the dominant neoinstitutionalist perspective in international business, and leads to a heuristic model capable of generating proposed patterns of transfer outcomes that may be tested empirically in future research.

Author-Name: Xu Huang
Abstract: This study investigated how the controllability attributional style of an employee influences the effect of participative leadership on psychological empowerment and work performance. The controllability attributional style refers to the extent to which employees habitually attribute their negative organizational experiences such as failures and setbacks to controllable or uncontrollable causes. The results of two studies consistently showed that participative leadership had a weaker impact on employees’ psychological empowerment for those who had a low rather than high controllability attributional style. In Study 2, psychological empowerment was found to fully mediate the joint effect of participative leadership and the controllability attributional style on the objective work performance of employees measured a month later.

Abstract: This article draws upon the emotion at work literature to explore how workers manage their feelings in dealing with death as a routine part of their working lives. It focuses on a specific group of workers, healthcare assistants (HCAs) in a hospital setting, who in delivering direct patient care have a particularly intimate relationship with dying and death. Based upon interview data from HCAs in four English acute hospital trusts, the article argues that the emotional outcomes of patient deaths can be explained by the nature of death as an event – its structure, context and actor circumstances – and by how HCAs appraise that event through the use of cognitive change and attentional deployment.

Abstract: Addressing both practical and scholarly considerations, we investigated the interactive effects of perceived supervisor narcissism and individual enactment behavior on four relevant self-report work outcomes (i.e. frustration, tension, resource availability, and job performance). We hypothesized that employees with limited enactment behavior would be adversely affected in high supervisor narcissism settings. Conversely, we expected that perceived narcissistic supervision would have little effect on those with active enactment strategies. Across three samples, hypotheses were strongly supported as work frustration (Studies 1 and 3) and tension increased (Studies 1 and 2), and resource availability (Studies 1–3) and job performance (Studies 1–3) decreased for low enactment behavior–high perceived supervisor narcissism employees. Conversely, perceived supervisor narcissism had no significant effect for high enactment employees on any outcome across samples. These findings, when viewed in their entirety, conf...

Title: Critical leadership studies: The case for critical performativity
Author-Name: Mats Alvesson
Author-Name: André Spicer
Abstract: Existing accounts of leadership are underpinned by two dominant approaches: functionalist studies, which have tried to identify correlations between variables associated with leadership; and interpretive studies, which have tried to trace out the meaning-making process associated with leadership. Eschewing these approaches, we turn to an emerging strand of literature that develops a critical approach to leadership. This literature draws our attention to the dialectics of control and resistance and the ideological aspect of leadership. However, it largely posits a negative critique of leadership. We think this is legitimate and important, but extend this agenda. We posit a performative critique of leadership that emphasizes tactics of circumspect care, progressive pragmatism and searching for present potentialities. We use these tactics to sketch out a practice of deliberated leadership that involves collective reflection on when, what kind and if leadership is appropriate.

Abstract: We offer a complex adaptive systems (CAS) lens as a potentially fruitful cross-disciplinary perspective for mentoring. Understanding mentoring relationships as CAS will invigorate the field and assist it to be responsive and relevant given our increasingly complex and turbulent environment. We begin by exploring the key properties of CAS. We then review the current mentoring literature’s connection to the systems and complexity theories that underpin CAS, demonstrating CAS’s relevance. We further examine four specific benefits that such a lens could bring, including attention to process, the reconceptualization of context, the adoption of new methodologies, and the fostering of interdisciplinary conversation. Research questions the CAS lens might stimulate for mentoring are then considered and difficulties with the CAS approach explored. We conclude by suggesting how CAS-informed research might shape mentoring knowledge and practice.

Abstract: We examined whether and how work centrality and family centrality interact to moderate the relationships between family-to-work conflict and family and job satisfaction. In a field sample from Sweden, we found a three-way interaction between work centrality, family centrality, and family-to-work conflict on job and family satisfaction. Specifically, when work centrality was high, family-to-work conflict was related to job and family satisfaction regardless of the level of family centrality. However, when work centrality was low, the relationships between family-to-work conflict and job and family satisfaction were moderated by family centrality. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.

Title: Kafka’s mythology: Organization, bureaucracy and the limits of sensemaking
Author-Name: Iain Munro
Author-Name: Christian Huber
Abstract: Franz Kafka merits special consideration among the writers of the 20th century for his portrayal of organizational life and the ambivalent character of the social institutions that ostensibly exist to help us. In this article we will draw on his works to enrich our understanding of organizations in three key respects: i) in terms of his creation of a mythology of organization; ii) by developing the concept of ‘counter-mythology’ to extend existing theory on narrative approaches to organization studies; and iii) drawing on these counter-mythologies to expose the limits of sensemaking in organizations. Using Kafka’s counter-mythologies as a framework, this analysis reveals a bias towards plausibility in the existing sensemaking literature, in contrast to which we suggest the development of more counterinductive approaches to the study of organization.

Title: Innovator resilience potential: A process perspective of individual resilience as influenced by innovation project termination
Author-Name: Gisa Moenkemeyer

Author-Name: Matthias Weiss
Abstract: Innovation projects fail at an astonishing rate. Yet, the negative effects of innovation project failures on the team members of these projects have been largely neglected in research streams that deal with innovation project failures. After such setbacks, it is vital to maintain or even strengthen project members’ innovative capabilities for subsequent innovation projects. For this, the concept of resilience, i.e. project members’ potential to positively adjust (or even grow) after a setback such as an innovation project failure, is fundamental. We develop the second-order construct of innovator resilience potential, which consists of six components – self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, optimism, hope, self-esteem, and risk propensity – that are important for project members’ potential of innovative functioning in innovation projects subsequent to a failure. We illustrate our theoretical findings by means of a qualitative study of a terminated large-scale innovation project, and derive implications for re...

Abstract: In this study we explore the gap between preferred and actual work situations for mothers of young children. We further examine the effects of not meeting desired work situation preferences on mothers’ depression and parenting stress over time. Using data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development’s Study of Early Child Care (1141 families) our findings indicate up to 71 percent of mothers in this sample did not achieve their preference. After controlling for marital status, ethnicity, education, income-to-needs, perceived costs of employment, and social support, both intra-individual and inter-individual assessments of the gap between a mother’s ideal and actual employment significantly predicted depression across the first three years of parenthood. Mothers’ employment hours and preferences for employment predicted parenting stress, but social support buffered this effect. We tested preliminary distinctions between maternal under-employment and over-employment and discuss implicat...

Title: An addictive environment: New Zealand film production workers’ subjective experiences of project-based labour
Author-Name: Lorraine Rowlands
Author-Name: Jocelyn Handy
Abstract: This article uses the theoretical framework provided by social models of addiction to interpret freelance film production workers’ subjective experiences of project-based labour. The article suggests that the structural conditions of project-based labour within the film industry create a subjective experience in which the financial, creative, social and emotional rewards of employment are interspersed with the anxieties of repeated unemployment. The stark contrast between highly gratifying periods in work and highly aversive periods in between work produces an addictive psycho-social dynamic that repeatedly draws freelance production workers back into the industry. This process can only be fully understood by considering the relationship between employment conditions and subjective experiences as an integrated whole. The development of freelance film production workers’ addictive relationships with the film industry is illustrated using qualitative data from in-depth interviews with 11 male and 10 female ...

Title: Understanding the antecedents, the outcomes and the mediating role of social capital: An employee perspective
Author-Name: Marjo-Riitta Parzefall
Author-Name: Volker G Kuppelwieser
Abstract: This study examines 1) how job security, expected organizational change and workload influence employees’ perceptions of organizational social capital, and 2) how organizational social capital influences affective commitment through both direct and mediated routes. Results from an employee survey (n = 1977) demonstrate that workload and organizational change negatively influence employees’ social capital perceptions, and that job security has a positive relationship with perceived social capital. In addition, we confirm that perceived social capital has a positive relationship with affective commitment, partially mediating the negative relationships between workload, expected organizational change and affective commitment, and similarly mediating the positive relationship between job security and affective commitment.

Title: Beyond analytical dichotomies
Author-Name: Ajnesh Prasad
Abstract: Management researchers habitually invoke analytical categories of difference – whether they be based on gender, race, or sexual identity – in responding to issues of systemic inequalities in organizational life. Poststructuralists and other critically orientated scholars have cited the myriad of trajectories through which analytical categories of difference reinscribe dichotomous modes of thinking and, therein, ignore the idiosyncrasies in human identification and human behavior. Extending from a poststructuralist standpoint, this article uses the question of sexual identity to advocate for the astute mobilization of ‘strategic essentialism’. Strategic essentialism serves as a means by which management scholars can tentatively engage with the research and the discourse that is reliant upon identity binaries, yet without reifying ideologically bifurcated identity classes.

Author-Name: Stephen Wood
Author-Name: Marc Van Veldhoven
Author-Name: Marcel Croon
Author-Name: Lilian M de Menezes
Abstract: The relationship between organizational performance and two dimensions of the ‘high performance work system’ – enriched job design and high involvement management (HIM) – is widely assumed to be mediated by worker well-being. We outline the basis for three models: mutual-gains, in which employee involvement increases well-being and this mediates its positive relationship with performance; conflicting outcomes, which associates involvement with increased stress for workers, accounting for its positive performance effects; and counteracting effects, which associates involvement with increased stress and dissatisfaction, reducing its positive performance effects. These are tested using the UK’s Workplace Employment Relations Survey 2004. Job satisfaction mediates the relationship between enriched job design and four performance indicators, supporting the mutual gains model; but HIM is negatively related to job satisfaction and this depresses a positive relationship between HIM and the economic performance me...

Title: The Wheel Model of humor: Humor events and affect in organizations
Author-Name: Christopher Robert
Author-Name: James E Wilbanks
Abstract: In this article we develop the Wheel Model of humor, which addresses the theme of this special issue by casting humor events as an important driver of employee happiness and well-being through their influence on positive affect. Drawing on theories of humor and emotion, the Wheel Model suggests that humor-induced positive affect results in transmission of emotion to social groups, which in turn creates a climate that supports humor use and subsequent humor events. This model is depicted in a circular pattern to highlight the cumulative and escalatory process through which individual humor events can impact individuals and groups over repeated cycles of the wheel. We also describe individual and environmental variables that are likely to have an impact on relationships within the Wheel Model. Finally, we discuss specific research contexts to which the Wheel Model can be applied (mentoring, leadership, groups/teams), as well as other future research directions.

Abstract: Using signature strengths at work has been shown to influence workers’ optimal functioning and well-being. However, little is known about the processes through which signature strengths lead to positive outcomes. The present research thus aimed at exploring the role of having a harmonious passion in the relation between using signature strengths and well-being. For this purpose, an intervention was developed where participants (n = 186) completed three activities aiming at developing their knowledge and use of their signature strengths at work. The results showed (1) that the intervention successfully increased participants’ use of their signature strengths, (2) that participants from the experimental group reported a higher use of their signature strengths at the end of the study than participants from the control group, and (3) that increases in the use of signature strengths reported by participants from the experimental group were related to increases in harmonious passion, which in turn led to higher...

Title: Enhancing team leaders’ well-being states and challenge experiences during organizational change: A randomized, controlled study
Author-Name: Karina Nielsen
Author-Name: Kevin Daniels
Abstract: When implementing teams, first-line leaders are often responsible for such implementation and their leadership role changes. This change may result in a perceived mismatch between the demands of the function and the leader’s resources. In a multi-method, controlled intervention study, we examined whether training leaders in team management changes their appraisals of the job and preserves their well-being. Data were collected with the Experience Sampling Method from 29 team leaders and survey data were collected from their followers (N = 233). Multi-level analyses revealed that training increased trained leaders’ challenge experiences and well-being states only where team members reported openness to change. In situations when both trained and non-trained leaders found themselves challenged above their average levels of challenge, they reported better well-being.

Title: Considering the temporary leader in temporary work arrangements: Sensemaking processes of internal interim leaders
Author-Name: Blair W Browning
Author-Name: Lacy G McNamee
Abstract: Though temporary work arrangements have garnered increased attention among scholars and practitioners, there has been little research into internal interim leaders (i.e. interims hired from within the organization) as a distinct case of temporary worker and leader. Internal interims are a fixture in organizational leadership and often serve during critical periods of change. As such, it is important to examine these leaders’ actions and the social, organizational, and individual dynamics that inform them. Toward this end, the present study examines the sensemaking processes of 24 internal interims using a qualitative approach. We describe five distinct sensemaking processes (dutiful, traditional, aspiring, reluctant, and self-conscious) shared by the 24 participants and discuss how several social dynamics (message valence and consistency) and individual factors (prior leadership and future aspirations) influenced these divergent processes. Further, we contend that internal interims adopt more passive (car...

Title: International and European policy on work and retirement: Reinventing critical perspectives on active ageing and mature subjectivity
Author-Name: Thibauld Moulaert
Author-Name: Simon Biggs
Abstract: In this article, the authors critically examine themes that have become associated with work and retirement in the context of demographic change. Two discourses are looked at in detail, those of ‘active’ and ‘productive’ ageing, with a focus upon International and European social policy. Drawing on the work of Foucault and others, the emergence of a dominant discourse and its effects on policy-based understandings of ageing are examined. A new orthodoxy of ageing subjectivity is identified, restricting the social contribution of older adults to work and work-like activities. A subtext refers to the co-option of liberal gerontological priorities into new and socially rigid forms of identity that legitimize particular ways of growing old. The authors conclude that a radical re-positioning, inspired by mature identity, is required to rely less upon economically determined roles and more upon alternative grounding in existential life tasks and experience to give space for a ‘mature subjectivity’ and a desirab...

Author-Name: Cynthia Hardy
Author-Name: David Grant
Abstract: In their recent Human Relations article and subsequent rejoinder to three commentators, Alvesson and Kärreman make a number of assertions concerning the development of organizational discourse analysis and the current state of research in this area. We believe their emphasis on provocation results in an unsatisfactory problematization of discourse-based work with the result that there are significant problems with both their analysis of the literature and their solutions to the shortcomings that they believe exist. We discuss a number of reasons why we believe that readers should be wary of what they read about organizational discourse analysis in Alvesson and Kärreman’s work. Drawing on our critique of their article and rejoinder, we propose some ideas that we believe will be more useful in developing studies of organizational discourse than those put forward by these authors.

Title: Workforce disengagement stressors and retiree alcohol misuse: The mediating effects of sleep problems and the moderating effects of gender
Author-Name: Elena Belogolovsky
Author-Name: Peter A Bamberger
Author-Name: Samuel B Bacharach
Abstract: We generate and test a moderated mediation model of the effects of two retirement-related stressors (namely, financial and marital) on the severity of alcohol misuse among retirees. We posit that in addition to using alcohol to cope with stressors in retirement, alcohol may also be used to self-medicate the secondary, sleep-related effects of such stressors, and that gender serves as a key boundary condition, moderating the impact of such stressors on sleep-related problems, and of sleep-related problems on alcohol misuse. Using longitudinal data collected from a sample of 292 retirees, our findings generally support this model, suggesting that both stressors are associated with the severity of alcohol misuse among male retirees. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that – for male retirees – the effect of both stressors on the severity of alcohol misuse is to a large extent secondary to the stressors themselves, mediated by the sleep-related problems they may generate.

Abstract: Dirty work involves tasks that are stigmatized owing to characteristics that the public finds disgusting, degrading, or objectionable. Conservation of resources theory suggests such experiences should induce strain and decreased work satisfaction; social identity theory suggests such work should lead to strong psychological investment in the work, among other outcomes. Integrating these two perspectives, this study hypothesizes and presents quantitative evidence from 499 animal-shelter workers, demonstrating how dirty-work engagement relates to higher levels of strain, job involvement, and reluctance to discuss work while negatively influencing work satisfaction. Additionally, this study takes a unique perspective on dirty work by focusing on dirty tasks within a dirty-work occupation. The data suggest meaningful differences between the outcomes of dirty-task frequency and dirty-task psychological salience, providing additional insight into the complexity of stigmatized occupations and ways in which futur...

Title: Formal organizations and identity groups in social movements
Author-Name: Kyoung-Hee Yu
Abstract: Formal organizations advancing the goals of identity-based social movements and identity groups have become increasingly interdependent. The former often lacks legitimacy in the eyes of stakeholders and the latter typically possesses insufficient organizational capacity. In principle, the transfer of ideas and resources between formal organizations in social movements and social identity groups can result in organizational innovation that revives the formal organization while at the same time enhancing the status of the identity group. But in practice, collaborations between formal organizations and identity groups often result in identity groups being overpowered by formal organizations. This article compares outcomes for identity groups in two cases of trade unions adopting the causes of identity-based social movements to examine the role of organizational processes in explaining outcomes for identity group members. The findings from the comparative cases analyzed here suggest that identity group member...

Title: How to win friendship and trust by influencing people’s feelings: An investigation of interpersonal affect regulation and the quality of relationships

Author-Name: Peter Totterdell
Abstract: Research suggests that people deliberately try to improve others’ feelings in a variety of social contexts. However, little is known about whether and how interpersonal affect regulation influences the quality of people’s relationships. Two applied social network studies investigated the relational effects of interpersonal affect regulation. In Study 1 attempts to improve others’ affect among grocery store employees were associated with both regulatory targets’ and agents’ perceptions of friendship and trust. In Study 2 we replicated this finding among staff and prisoners in a high-security prison. Additionally, we showed that these associations were mediated by positive changes to regulatory targets’ and agents’ affect. The results provide insights into the social consequences of interpersonal affect regulation and help to elucidate the factors influencing the formation and maintenance of high-quality relationships.

Abstract: Although work engagement has been shown to be associated with positive job attitudes and behaviors, no research has investigated its relationship with work-family issues. To address this, the current longitudinal, experience-sampling study aimed to determine the relationship between daily work engagement and work-to-family facilitation. A total of 52 extension agents responded to two daily surveys for two weeks. Results indicate that both work engagement and work-to-family facilitation vary considerably from day to day. Daily work engagement had a positive effect on family life. The effect of daily engagement in facilitating work-family relations was partially mediated by positive mood, and the relationship between work engagement and facilitation of work-family relations was moderated by work-family capitalization, or the sharing of positive work experiences at home. Implications and future research directions are discussed.

Abstract: We examined how work-family conflict (WFC) mediated the relationship between social support (supervisor and family) and burnout, and how sex moderated this relationship (N = 343 Spanish workers). The results sustained hypotheses in accordance with a biosocial model of sex differences. There were full mediation effects of work interference with family (WIF) in the association of work support with burnout for men, and of family support with burnout for women. This suggests that sex moderated these mediation processes. The findings are discussed in terms of a shift in the differential assignment of family roles to men and women, despite the fact that women might be the main contributors to domestic work and related tasks.

Title: Narratives in society, organizations and individual identities: An ethnographic study of pubs, identity work and the pursuit of ‘the real’
Author-Name: Tony James Watson
Author-Name: Diane Heather Watson
Abstract: Narratives play a very significant role in human social life. An ethnographic study within and ‘around’ a contemporary ‘real-ale’-based pubs organization shows narratives playing a part in the construction of reality at a societal level, in the negotiation of order at an organizational and family level and in the shaping of self identities at the level of the human individual. It is shown that narrative resources at these three levels of social reality come together in particular individual and social circumstances. In the process of doing this an ethnographic narrative about the ‘fall and rise’ of ‘real beer’ and ‘real pubs’ is produced. This offers significant anthropological insights into a culturally interesting aspect of recent and contemporary British life. In addition, insights are offered about processes of ethnographic enquiry and the potential for an ‘everyday ethnography’ style of research that ‘grounds’ theoretical work, without resorting to a notion of ‘grounded theory’.

Abstract: Interpreting organizational change initiatives as controllable can mean the difference between achieving positive or negative outcomes. However, little is known about the factors that underpin such interpretations. This study examines how interpretations of controllability are influenced by individual centrality in social networks and change-related self-efficacy. Drawing on a sample of 148 US public school teachers facing a significant organizational transformation, our analysis reveals that change-related self-efficacy fully mediates relationships between centrality within instrumental and expressive organizational social networks and individual interpretations of change controllability. Network centrality, and the associated access to information and social support that accompany it, are theorized to provide the confidence necessary to interpret change as within one’s control. Drawing upon social network theory, we provide insights into how change is interpreted as controllable, and how the nature of c...

Title: Queering cross-sex friendships: An analysis of gay and bisexual men’s workplace friendships with heterosexual women
Author-Name: Nick Rumens
Abstract: Organizational research on cross-sex friendships frequently normalizes heterosexuality by excluding lesbian, gay and bisexual people. Challenging this heteronormative bias, this article mobilizes queer theories to examine how UK gay and bisexual men reproduce and contest heterosexist norms in the construction of workplace friendships with heterosexual women. For bisexual study participants, interview data reveal how their friendship experiences can be rendered epistemologically invisible, especially within work environments where bi-negativity is anticipated. In contrast, gay study participants appear to adopt discursive strategies in order to create friendships with women that are normatively accepted. This article develops a concept of ‘queer friendship’ as it relates to the opportunities that arise within workplace friendships for transcending heterosexist norms. It is argued that sustaining the queer aspects of workplace relationships can be challenging but worthwhile, with implications for disrupting...

Abstract: In this article we test whether reasons to quit volunteering can be structured as the commonly used six functional motives to volunteer of Clary et al. (1998). We conjecture that owing to volunteer involvement in an organization, additional contextual factors influence the choice to stop volunteering for that organization. Based on a literature review and a qualitative exploratory analysis, we present items respectively measuring motives to volunteer among active volunteers and reasons to quit among former volunteers in the context of the Scouts and Guides Organization in Flanders (Belgium). We test content-wise symmetry based on expert-rater agreement, while structural symmetry is tested based on factor analyses. Results show that no symmetry can be found. However, additional contextual factors clearly determine the decision to leave an organization. We theorize on how these individual, interpersonal and organizational factors are continuously traded off by volunteers during their involvement in a partic...

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the simultaneous impact of, and interaction between, being the direct target of bullying and working in an environment characterized by bullying upon employees’ turnover intentions. Hierarchical linear modeling analysis of a sample of 41 hospital units and 357 nurses demonstrates that working in an environment characterized by bullying increases individual employees’ turnover intentions. Importantly, employees report similarly high turnover intentions when they are either the direct target of bullying or when they work in work units characterized by high bullying. Results also suggest that the impact of unit-level bullying is stronger on those who are not often directly bullied themselves.

Title: Older professional workers and continuous learning in new capitalism
Author-Name: Tara Fenwick
Abstract: Amidst projected shortages of skilled workers, policy measures to retain older workers in employment include increasing their participation in learning. However, the few studies produced to date examining older workers’ learning suggest complexities not recognized in human capital conceptions of skill development and assumptions of declining seniors’ participation. To build on these studies, particularly in older professionals’ learning, which has received little attention despite concerns regarding professional transitions in a knowledge economy, this article examines older professionals’ approaches to and conceptions of learning. The study involved 816 accountants’ survey responses and 60 interviews with older (50+) Certified Management Accountants in Canada. Far from withdrawing from learning, these older professionals are particularly focused in what, when and how they engage. Their enactments are complex, and demonstrate ambivalences related to discourses of both age and learning. More fundamentally,...

Abstract: Both self-ratings and non-self-report measures of employee creativity (supervisor ratings, peer ratings, and objective measures of creativity) have been used frequently in the literature, but there have been no attempts to compare research results using different types of creativity measures. In the present meta-analysis, we examined the relationships of a wide array of personal characteristics and contextual factors with both types of creativity measures. The results suggest that, in a majority of cases, effect sizes are larger when self-ratings of employee creativity are used. The article concludes with a discussion of the circumstances when inflation of observed correlations is most likely to occur, some steps for reducing inflated observed correlations, and other issues germane to empirical creativity research.

Title: Trends and correlates of post-retirement employment, 1977–2009
Author-Name: Robin Pleau
Author-Name: Kimberlee Shauman
Abstract: The stereotypical retirement experience – the abrupt ceasing of all paid work and commencement of a life of leisure – is the experience of only half of all workers. Yet, despite the prevalence of combining work and retirement in the US and the implications this work-retirement behavior may have for organizations and individual workers, post-retirement employment behavior is understudied. In this article, we add to the growing literature on retirement and late-life employment processes by examining the trends and correlates of post-retirement employment in the US from 1977 to 2009. We find a modest curvilinear trend in post-retirement employment for both males and females over the last 33 years. However, the modest upward trends in post-retirement employment obscure the countervailing influences of significant changes in behavior and in the macro-level demographic and economic forces that are significant determinants of post-retirement employment.

Title: Predicting employee reactions to perceived organizational wrongdoing: Demoralization, justice, proactive personality, and whistle-blowing
Author-Name: Marcia P Miceli

Author-Name: James R Van Scotter
Abstract: News reports of organizational wrongdoing often pique interest in the question of how to encourage employees to report it. We used data from a survey of more than 3000 organizational members in the US to test a model of whistle-blowing. As predicted, observation of wrongdoing generally was associated with lower perceived organizational support and lower perceived justice of reporting channels (both procedural justice and distributive justice), suggesting that tolerating wrongdoing has negative effects for the organization itself, but there was also evidence that correcting wrongdoing may be nearly as positive as preventing it. Three previously untested variables – proactive personality, less co-worker invalidation, and leverage in the specific situation – predicted whistle-blowing, as did strength of evidence, a variable for which prior findings were inconsistent. Gender also was related to whistle-blowing. Finally, the predictors of blowing the whistle exclusively to one’s supervisor were similar to thos...

Title: ‘Suddenly I get into the zone’: Examining discontinuities and nonlinear changes in flow experiences at work
Author-Name: Lucia Ceja
Author-Name: Jose Navarro
Abstract: Work-related flow is defined as a sudden and enjoyable merging of action and awareness that represents a peak experience in the daily lives of workers. Employees’ perceptions of challenge and skill and their subjective experiences in terms of enjoyment, interest and absorption were measured using the experience sampling method, yielding a total of 6981 observations from a sample of 60 employees. Linear and nonlinear approaches were applied in order to model both continuous and sudden changes. According to the R2, AICc and BIC indexes, the nonlinear dynamical systems model (i.e. cusp catastrophe model) fit the data better than the linear and logistic regression models. Likewise, the cusp catastrophe model appears to be especially powerful for modelling those cases of high levels of flow. Overall, flow represents a nonequilibrium condition that combines continuous and abrupt changes across time. Research and intervention efforts concerned with this process should focus on the variable of challenge, which, a...

Title: Emotional labour in service work: Psychological flexibility and emotion regulation
Author-Name: Michal Biron
Author-Name: Marc van Veldhoven
Abstract: Drawing from job demands–resources theory (Demerouti et al., 2001), this article investigates the effect of psychological flexibility, relative to surface and deep acting, in the relationship between day-level emotional demands and exhaustion. A total of 170 not-for-profit service workers first filled in a questionnaire and then completed a diary survey over three consecutive workdays. The results of multilevel analyses suggest that person-level psychological flexibility was associated with lower levels of daily emotional exhaustion (measured at bedtime). Moreover, person-level psychological flexibility was found to attenuate, whereas person-level surface acting was found to strengthen, the association between day-level emotional demands and day-level exhaustion. Person-level deep acting had no significant effect on daily exhaustion. These findings extend previous research by demonstrating the role of psychological flexibility in encouraging employees to handle their emotions primarily by accepting them r...

Title: ‘Lift as you rise’: Union women’s leadership talk
Author-Name: Gill Kirton
Author-Name: Geraldine Healy
Abstract: There is now an abundant and rich literature on gender and leadership in the corporate context, where concepts of masculine and feminine leadership are widely debated. This article provides a bridge between this literature and the women and unions literature, where women’s leadership is under-researched but where feminist strategies are widely discussed. The article uses the relatively novel lens of masculine, feminine and feminist leadership for interpreting the leadership talk of an ethnically diverse group of American and British union women. We argue that when women lead in heavily masculinized settings, their leadership discourses and orientations are almost bound to reflect the dominant culture. The study reveals that while there is a discursive space within unions for alternative (feminine and feminist) visions of leadership, in practice women union leaders also engage in different combinations (often simultaneously) of (masculine) status quo and (feminine and feminist) transformative leadership talk.

Title: Autonomous work groups and the challenge of inter-group coordination
Author-Name: Jonas A Ingvaldsen
Author-Name: Monica Rolfsen
Abstract: In work systems based on autonomous work groups, the effort of different autonomous groups needs to be coordinated to produce desirable system-wide effects. The existing literature on organizational structures for inter-group coordination is limited. In this article, the authors explore two different structures for inter-group coordination, which are alternatives to traditional hierarchical control. These structures are rotating group spokespersons and shared leadership. The main conclusion of this article is that inter-group coordination becomes a major challenge when groups enjoy high levels of autonomy. Our argument builds on a case study of a manufacturing company, analysed through the lens of modern socio-technical theory. The difficulties associated with inter-group coordination have implications for debates on organizational performance and may help explain why autonomous work groups are not widely used in industry.

Title: Ethics, alterity and the rationality of leadership justice
Author-Name: Carl Rhodes
Abstract: This article provides a critical review and re-evaluation of dominant approaches to leadership justice, arguing that they appropriate justice as a rational means to achieve organizational effectiveness. It is shown that in contemporary management thinking justice is a formal rationality rather than a substantive one. This rationalization of justice belies its masculinization and as a result human values such as love and care are sidelined. The ethical theories of Emmanuel Levinas are drawn on to consider how pre-rational affective relations between people form the basis of ethically informed justice. It is proposed that justice is not a particular variety of leadership behaviour but rather that leadership is the practice of justice. Justice is not here regarded as something to be achieved through particular leadership practices, but is an ongoing condition – an unanswerable question whose response defines the ethical quality of leadership.

Title: Review Article: The past, present and future of organization development: Taking the long view
Author-Name: Bernard Burnes
Author-Name: Bill Cooke
Abstract: Organization development has been, and arguably still is, the major approach to organizational change across the Western world, and increasingly globally. Despite this, there appears to be a great deal of confusion as to its origins, nature, purpose and durability. This article reviews the ‘long’ history of organization development from its origins in the work of Kurt Lewin in the late 1930s to its current state and future prospects. It chronicles and analyses the major stages, disjunctures and controversies in its history and allows these to be seen in a wider context. The article closes by arguing that, although organization development remains the dominant approach to organizational change, there are significant issues that it must address if it is to achieve the ambitious and progressive social and organizational aims of its founders.

Title: Capturing sociality in the movement between frames: An illustration from leadership development
Author-Name: Brigid Carroll
Author-Name: Barbara Simpson
Abstract: In this article we offer a dynamic relational perspective in which frames and framing work together in the practice of leadership development. Mead’s (1932) notion of sociality is introduced as a way of engaging with movements within and between frames, where it is these framing movements that we argue hold the potentiality of emergent practice. The article responds to a growing interest in the delineation, conceptualization and practice of leadership as opposed to leader development, where we understand leadership development in terms of the creation of social capital, relational capacity and collaboration. However, there is little, if any, research into how these dimensions may be developed intentionally in practice. Using online forum data from an 18-month-long leadership development programme, we demonstrate three different sociality movements, which we have labelled kindling, stretching and spanning. Our analysis positions sociality at the core of leadership development interventions, and practice mo...

Title: Business partners and working the pumps: Human resource managers in the recession
Author-Name: William K Roche
Author-Name: Paul Teague
Abstract: This article examines the work and roles of HR managers in the Irish recession. It tests the validity of three competing views about the future of HR: that the profession needs to become a business partner; that it is knee-deep in a legitimacy crisis; and that it is fragmenting by being unable to cope with the complexity of modern organizational life. Three key findings emerge from the research. First, HR managers have gained greater influence in business decision-making, but much of this influence arises from short-run retrenchment measures. Second, many HR managers remain committed to long established professional values and ideas of good practice. Third, modern HR managers are developing a professional identity that allows them to perform multiple, competing roles. These findings challenge existing arguments about the effects of the current recession. They also speak to ongoing debates about changing HR roles by showing how HR managers remain adept at making pragmatic adaptations to secure their role i...

Title: Everyday working life: Explaining within-person fluctuations in employee well-being
Author-Name: Despoina Xanthopoulou
Author-Name: Arnold B Bakker
Author-Name: Remus Ilies
Abstract: Even workers who are generally happy at work can suffer short-term losses of enthusiasm and fulfilment. Short-term fluctuations matter because they can better explain work-related well-being (e.g. work engagement, flow, positive affect or passion), employees’ relations with other people at work (e.g. co-workers, clients), life outside work, and ultimately productivity. This article reviews what we know about short-term variations in employee well-being and highlights new theoretical assumptions and results from the seven articles in this special issue. The articles identify key psychological mechanisms involved in explaining within-person changes in well-being, including the ways in which people appraise events at work, the importance of humour, the sense of hope, and the balance between skills and challenges. Interventions that offer leadership training and cultivate signature strengths at work can also be effective in enhancing employee well-being. Boosting short-term well-being can make a big differenc...

Title: The problem-solving service worker: Appraisal mechanisms and positive affective experiences during customer interactions
Author-Name: Sandra Kiffin-Petersen
Author-Name: Steven A Murphy
Author-Name: Geoffrey Soutar
Abstract: Affective Events Theory suggests customer interactions elicit event appraisals that, in turn, prompt affective reactions in employees. A qualitative diary study was used to examine the daily events and cognitive appraisals that elicit positive emotions during customer service interactions. Thematic analysis of the diary contents of 276 sales employees from a variety of industries (874 positive events) showed helping customers solve their problem was the event most likely to trigger positive emotions. The data and resulting model revealed that particular configurations of employees’ appraisals predicted particular emotion(s). Within-person differences in cognitive appraisals also helped explain why some initially negative events may ultimately become a positive experience. Emotional contagion was found, where the positive emotions of the sales employees, or those of the customer, influenced the emotion of the other. The implications of the study for employees’ happiness and well-being, and for enhanced cus...

Title: Rethinking the Hawthorne Studies: The Western Electric research in its social, political and historical context
Author-Name: John S Hassard
Abstract: In primary accounts of the Hawthorne Studies (1924–32), the host organization, Western Electric, is treated as a largely anonymous actor. Through case-based historical research we find such treatment masks the distinctive profile of the company in the years preceding and encompassing the Hawthorne investigations. Besides its significant industrial standing, when Western’s reputation for welfare capitalism is considered alongside a tragedy that galvanizes its Hawthorne workforce, the company emerges as an iconic manufacturer with a singular cultural inheritance. Unlike previous retrospective studies, this research explains a range of social and political factors that shaped the Hawthorne Works at this time. In particular, it describes how an ostensibly ‘human relations’ philosophy had been espoused at Western prior to Elton Mayo’s arrival in 1928, but that this outwardly ‘progressive’ ethos was underpinned by hard-edged paternalism and tough-minded anti-unionism. Later, during the 1930s, an increasingly ch...

Title: Proactive personality and job performance: The role of job crafting and work engagement
Author-Name: Arnold B Bakker

Author-Name: Daantje Derks
Abstract: The article examines the role of proactive personality in predicting work engagement and job performance. On the basis of the literature on proactive personality and the job demands–resources model, we hypothesized that employees with a proactive personality would be most likely to craft their own jobs, in order to stay engaged and perform well. Data were collected among 95 dyads of employees (N = 190), who were working in various organizations. The results of structural equation modeling analyses offered strong support for the proposed model. Employees who were characterized by a proactive personality were most likely to craft their jobs (increase their structural and social job resources, and increase their job challenges); job crafting, in turn, was predictive of work engagement (vigor, dedication, and absorption) and colleague-ratings of in-role performance. These findings suggest that, to the extent that employees proactively adjust their work environment, they manage to stay engaged and perform well.

Abstract: This article examines the three-way interaction effect of breaches of past promises, current job alternatives, and promises of future idiosyncratic deals on affective organizational commitment. Specifically, we posit that the negative relationship between breaches of past promises and affective organizational commitment is strongest when employees are promised idiosyncratic deals in the future and when they perceive that few job alternatives are currently available elsewhere. Data collected from 196 managers at two points in time over a one-year period support the proposed three-way interaction effect. This article highlights the importance of differentiating fulfillment of past contract obligations from promises of future idiosyncratic deals in further research on psychological contract breaches.

Author-Name: Yan Zhang

Abstract: The authors examine cross-cultural differences in the effects of gender diversity on group identification and performance using workgroups from American and Chinese firms. Nationality is found to moderate the relationship between gender diversity and group identification in that gender diversity associates more positively with group identification in Chinese workgroups than in American workgroups. Nationality does not moderate the gender diversity–group performance relationship: although the Chinese sample shows a positive association between gender diversity and group performance, the American sample shows no association. A second longitudinal study explores the mechanisms of relationship conflict and task conflict by which gender diversity benefits group performance in China. Results show that gender-diverse groups perform better than homogeneous groups by decreasing relationship conflict and task conflict. Future research directions and practical implications are discussed.

Author-Name: Gerdien Regts

Abstract: Given that few studies have examined relational bases for voluntary employee turnover, the purpose of the article is to examine whether work relationships explain employee turnover intention. Adopting a social relational perspective on employee turnover, we investigated the effect of receiving interpersonal citizenship behavior (ICB) from coworkers on the recipient’s turnover intention. We hypothesized that the association between receiving ICB from coworkers and turnover intention would be mediated by job satisfaction and moderated by employees’ communion-striving motivation and task interdependence. We tested our hypotheses regarding moderated mediation in a sample of 149 hospital nurses. The results show that there is an indirect (through job satisfaction) and negative effect of receiving ICB on turnover intention provided communion-striving motivation and task interdependence were high, but not when these were low. This study has implications for research and offers managers insights into task situati...

Title: How top management team behavioural integration can impact employee work outcomes: Theory development and first empirical tests
Author-Name: Anneloes ML Raes

Author-Name: Simon B De Jong
Abstract: This article explores whether a top management team’s (TMT) behavioural integration relates to the work outcomes of employees. We first discuss likely theoretical mechanisms for such a relationship by integrating the literature on top management team behavioural integration with the literature on organizational climate, productive energy and employee work outcomes. Subsequently, we test our hypotheses in a dataset containing the responses of 191 top management team members and 5048 employees from 63 organizations by using structural equation modelling. The results show that top management team behavioural integration is related positively to an organization’s productive energy, which in turn is related to employees’ increased job satisfaction and decreased turnover intentions. By providing first insights into the consequences of top management team behavioural integration for employees, this article opens a new avenue for scientific inquiry on the organizational impact of top management team behaviour.

Title: The expatriate-creativity hypothesis: A longitudinal field test
Author-Name: Anthony Fee
Author-Name: Sidney J Gray
Abstract: While prior research suggests that the cognitive changes triggered by cross-cultural experiences can enhance an individual’s creative-thinking abilities, this is yet to be verified through empirical field research. We draw on schema theory, and the principle of psychological dissonance experienced during cultural adaptation, to argue that expatriates undergo wholesale cognitive changes that can lead to enhanced creative-thinking abilities. We test this hypothesis by measuring changes in the creative-thinking abilities of a sample of expatriates over the first 12 months of their placement. When compared with a control group of non-expatriates, the expatriates showed significant increases in overall creative-thinking abilities and cognitive flexibility, although not originality, elaboration, or ideational fluency.

Title: The domestic and gendered context for retirement
Author-Name: Wendy Loretto
Author-Name: Sarah Vickerstaff
Abstract: Against a global backdrop of population and workforce ageing, successive UK governments have encouraged people to work longer and delay retirement. Debates focus mainly on factors affecting individuals’ decisions on when and how to retire. We argue that a fuller understanding of retirement can be achieved by recognizing the ways in which individuals’ expectations and behaviours reflect a complicated, dynamic set of interactions between domestic environments and gender roles, often established over a long time period, and more temporally proximate factors. Using a qualitative data set, we explore how the timing, nature and meaning of retirement and retirement planning are played out in specific domestic contexts. We conclude that future research and policies surrounding retirement need to: focus on the household, not the individual; consider retirement as an often messy and disrupted process and not a discrete event; and understand that retirement may mean very different things for women and for men.

Title: Differentiation and discrimination: Understanding social class and social exclusion in leading law firms
Author-Name: Louise Ashley
Author-Name: Laura Empson
Abstract: For leading law firms in the City of London, diversity and inclusion has become an important human resources strategy over the past 15 years. A recent focus on social class within the sector has been encouraged by increasing governmental concerns relating to social mobility, which acknowledge that elite professions, particularly the law, have become more socially exclusive over the past 30 years. Based on a detailed qualitative study of six leading law firms conducted between 2006 and 2010, this article asks: why do leading law firms discriminate on the basis of social class? It argues that discrimination is a response to conflicting commercial imperatives: the first to attract talent and the second to reduce risk and enhance image. The article describes these dynamics, emphasizing the role played by the ambiguity of knowledge. It argues that until these conflicting demands are reconciled, organizational and state-sponsored initiatives centred on the ‘business case’ for diversity may achieve only limited ...

Title: Job types and job quality in Europe
Author-Name: David Holman
Abstract: This article shows how an analysis of job types can deepen our understanding of job quality and how job quality varies across 27 European countries. First, using the European Working Conditions Survey 2005, a taxonomy of six job types is developed and their quality established. This taxonomy suggests that there are different types of high- and low-quality jobs. Second, institutional theory is drawn on to examine why job quality varies cross-nationally. The results of a multilevel analysis indicate that national differences in institutional regimes (social democratic, continental, liberal, southern European, transitional) result in cross-national variation in both the level of job quality (i.e. the overall proportions of high- and low-quality jobs) and the nature of job quality (i.e. the particular types of high- and low-quality jobs found). It is concluded that institutional theory is able to explain the level but not the nature of cross-national variation in job quality.

Abstract: This article assesses the extent to which the foreign-controlled subsidiaries of multinational firms have the discretion to establish their employment relations policies. Drawing on a survey of the activities of foreign-controlled multinational companies in Canada, it considers three lines of analysis: the parent company’s country of origin, the subsidiary’s specific organizational capabilities and its position in global value chains. While our results confirm that US-controlled subsidiaries have lower discretion than those from continental Europe and Asia, they also highlight the need to go beyond country-of-origin analysis. Organizational capabilities and the subsidiary’s role in global value chains are also important predictors of subsidiary discretion on employment relations policy.

Title: Crafting a balance between work and home
Author-Name: Jane Sturges
Abstract: This article reports the findings of a qualitative study that explored the unofficial techniques and activities that individuals use to shape their own work–life balance. It theorizes that this behaviour may be usefully conceptualized as physical, relational and cognitive work–life balance crafting. It identifies the physical, relational and cognitive techniques that young professionals employ to manage their work–life balance and shows that distinct approaches to work–life balance crafting exist, each of which features a specific range of techniques.

Title: Working with passion: Emotionology, corporate environmentalism and climate change
Author-Name: Christopher Wright
Author-Name: Daniel Nyberg
Abstract: In responding to climate change, organizations navigate in an increasingly volatile emotional milieu in which feelings of fear, anxiety, hostility and anger shape public debate. In this article, we explore how corporations have responded to the broader ‘emotionology’ surrounding climate change. Our focus is on the role of corporate sustainability specialists as intermediaries, or ‘emotionology workers’, acting between broader social debates and local organizational contexts. Through analysis of interview and documentary data from major Australian corporations we explore both the activities of these individuals in translating and shaping climate change emotionology within their organizations, and how they manage their own emotionality in this work. We find that sustainability professionals are key agents in the design and implementation of a positive emotionology of climate change as a challenge and opportunity for corporate action. However, these activities result in tensions and contradictions for these ...

Title: Witnesses on the periphery: Young lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer employees witnessing homophobic exchanges in Australian workplaces
Author-Name: Paul Willis
Abstract: Social divisions on the basis of sexuality are continually reinforced and contested in organizational environments. Previous studies have focused on the workplace as a problematic environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer-identifying (LGBQ) workers. In this article, I examine young workers’ experiences of witnessing the exchange of homophobic expressions, commentary and humour at work. Qualitative findings are presented from an exploratory study of young LGBQ people’s experiences in Australian organizations. Three core themes are discussed: (i) young workers’ location as periphery witnesses to homophobic exchanges, discussions and humour; (ii) the constraints experienced by young LGBQ workers in having to ‘manage’ their sexuality at work; and (iii) young workers’ attempts to refute and reject homophobic discourse in work relationships. Based on these findings, I conclude that witnessing the exchange of homophobic commentary can constrain how young workers express their sexuality at work while also ...

Abstract: The legal profession in England and Wales is becoming more diverse. However, while white women and black and minority ethnic (BME) individuals now enter the profession in larger numbers, inequalities remain. This article explores the career strategies of 68 white women and BME legal professionals to understand more about their experiences in the profession. Archer’s work on structure and agency informs the analysis, as does Emirbayer and Mische’s (1998) ‘temporally embedded’ conceptualization of agency as having past, current and future elements. We identify six career strategies, which relate to different career points. They are assimilation, compromise, playing the game, reforming the system, location/relocation and withdrawal. We find that five of the six strategies tend to reproduce rather than transform opportunity structures in the legal profession. The overall picture is one of structural reproduction (rather than transformation) of traditional organizational structure and practice. The theoretical...

Title: Employment status congruence and job quality
Author-Name: Catherine Loughlin
Author-Name: Robert Murray
Abstract: While recognizing the daunting task of defining universal indicators of job quality we may overlook something more fundamental: in North America about a third of people may not want to be employed in their current job status. Job status congruence (i.e. the extent to which people are working full-time, contract, or part-time by choice) may now be an integral part of high quality work. We test this proposition using a process-oriented theoretical model reflecting established relationships in the work design literature. Findings suggest that a socio-economic predictor (job status congruence) may rival established psychological predictors of job quality (e.g. intrinsic job characteristics and role stressors) in predicting aspects of workers’ personal and organizational functioning. Our findings also suggest that different mediators may be operating for each outcome. The model is tested on 171 full-time workers; a revised model is then supported on a holdout sample of 172 full-timers, and replicated on 132 co...

Abstract: This article reports on a study investigating the cross-level relationships of organizational ethical climate on employee silence. Using a sample of 408 full-time employees from 24 high-technology firms in Taiwan, the study conducted multilevel analyses to examine its hypotheses. The results showed that instrumental climate – one type of organizational ethical climate – had a positive association with acquiescent silence, but not with defensive silence. Another two types of organizational ethical climate – caring climate and independence climate – had a negative association with both acquiescent silence and defensive silence. Rules climate and the law and code climate, the remaining types of organizational ethical climate, were not associated with either the acquiescent silence or the defensive silence. The results also showed that the associations of the instrumental climate, caring climate, and independence climate with acquiescent silence and defensive silence are mediated by the perceived organization...

Title: Fantasies about work as limitless potential – how managers and employees seduce each other through dynamics of mutual recognition
Author-Name: Susanne Ekman
Abstract: This article draws on combinations of discourse theory and Lacanian theory to study the role of fantasies in creative knowledge work. It attempts to nuance a number of critical Lacanian studies that emphasize how management and HRM practices exploit the seductive, yet disciplining, effects of fantasies to increase worker commitment. In contrast, empirical data from fieldwork in two creative industries are used to show how employees also ensnare and discipline their managers based on the same fantasmatic dynamics. The article argues that both managers and employees avoid concrete definitions of responsibility in favor of intense mutual recognition. This allows them to pursue a shared fantasy about limitless potential (financial and existential) realized via work. This dynamic of recognition renders both parties more vulnerable towards each other and makes both parties resist attempts at moderation. The question of power and exploitation thus becomes highly muddled.

Title: Getting on board: Organizational socialization and the contribution of social capital
Author-Name: Russell Korte
Author-Name: Shumin Lin
Abstract: When starting a new job, newcomers strive to learn the tasks and expectations of their work, decipher the unwritten rules or norms of the culture, and achieve membership in the organization. The literature on the socialization of newcomers in organizations typically links success to the ability of the newcomer to learn to fit in. Yet recent empirical studies identified coworkers and managers as sharing the responsibility for successful socialization. The purpose of this study was to investigate the orientation and socialization processes (also known as onboarding) from the broader perspective of social capital. The concept of social capital generally describes the value and resources of social relations and network ties afforded to members of social networks or groups. Through a set of in-depth interviews with newly hired engineers in a large manufacturing organization, newcomers reported how they learned about and integrated into the social networks that made up their workplace. Overall, it was the quali...

Abstract: We propose and test a comprehensive model of burnout, as influenced by justice and support, and as it impacts the turnover process. Deriving our conceptual model from conservation of resources theory, augmented by several domain-specific theories, we investigate three forms of justice (distributive, procedural, and interactional justice) and two sources of support (from organizations and supervisors) as they influence the development of three dimensions of burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and diminished accomplishment) and subsequent forms of attitudinal withdrawal (organizational commitment and turnover intentions) and behavioral withdrawal (turnover). In a study of 343 social workers, our theoretical path model was well-supported, providing increased understanding of the distinct roles of each form of justice and support in the development of burnout and the subsequent turnover process. Theoretical contributions and implications in the areas of justice, burnout, and turnover are discussed.

Title: It’s all in the mix: Determinants and consequences of workforce blending in call centres
Author-Name: Hyunji Kwon
Author-Name: Danielle van Jaarsveld
Abstract: Supplementing the full-time permanent workforce with part-time staff is a widespread practice among firms. To better understand this dynamic, we evaluate how work organization choices influence the degree of part-time use by analysing North American survey data from call centre establishments. We also evaluate the effect of part-time use on the voluntary turnover behaviour of the full-time permanent workforce. For example, firms with greater reliance on a high involvement approach to work organization relied less on part-time use than those pursuing a low involvement approach. For firms that choose to rely heavily on part-time use, we find that this decision has consequences for their full-time permanent workforce, namely higher voluntary turnover among their full-time permanent staff. Interestingly, greater reliance on a high involvement approach appears to weaken the positive relationship between part-time use and voluntary turnover among the full-time employees.

Title: Increases in salience of ethnic identity at work: The roles of ethnic assignation and ethnic identification
Author-Name: Etlyn J Kenny
Author-Name: Rob B Briner
Abstract: To better understand how ethnicity is actually experienced within organizations, we examined reported increases in ethnic identity salience at work and responses to such increases. Thirty British black Caribbean graduate employees were interviewed about how and when they experienced their ethnic identity at work. The findings demonstrated that increased salience in ethnic identity was experienced in two key ways: through ‘ethnic assignation’ (a ‘push’ towards ethnic identity) and ‘ethnic identification’ (a ‘pull’ towards ethnic identity). We explore how and when ethnic assignation and ethnic identification occur at work, and their relevance to how workplaces are experienced by this group of minority ethnic employees. The findings suggest the need for further research attention to the dynamic and episodic nature of social identity – including ethnic identity – within organizations, and to the impact of such increases in salience of social identities on behaviour at work.

Abstract: Organizational communities of practice (OCoPs) are used increasingly to capitalize on valuable distributed knowledge and to fully engage the innovation potential of employees. OCoPs have become increasingly global in their reach, relying of necessity on virtual forms of interaction to engage the participation and expertise of a global workforce. An unanswered question is whether the performance of such global OCoPs may be predicted to benefit or suffer owing to their nationality diversity. Using data from over 200 members of 30 global OCoPs in a Fortune 100 US-based multinational mining and minerals processing firm, we found that nationality diversity was curvilinearly (U-shaped) related to community performance. We also found that the curvilinear relationship was moderated by psychological safety and the extent of rich communication media use. Specifically, the arc relating nationality diversity and performance became more positive at the higher end, and less negative at the lower end, to the extent that...

Title: Trade union responses to ageing workforces in the UK and Germany
Author-Name: Matthew Flynn

Abstract: Ageing workforces are placing conflicting pressures on European trade unions in order to, on the one hand, protect pensions and early retirement routes, and, on the other, promote human resource management (HRM) policies geared towards enabling their older members to extend working life. Using interviews from German and United Kingdom (UK) trade unions, we discuss how unions are both constrained and enabled by pre-existing institutional structures in advocating approaches to age management. In Germany, some unions use their strong institutional role to affect public policy and industrial change at national and sectoral levels. UK unions have taken a more defensive approach, focused on protecting pension rights. The contrasting varieties of capitalism, welfare systems and trade unions’ own orientations are creating different pressures and mechanisms to which unions need to respond. While the German inclusive system is providing unions with mechanisms for negotiating collectively at the national level, UK u...

Author-Name: Isik U Zeytinoglu
Abstract: This article explores the relationship between job and work quality and argues that while it is important to examine job quality, to understand workers’ experiences fully, the focus should be on the broader concept of work quality, which places the job against its wider socio-economic context. Based on the experiences of 88 rural workers gathered via interviews in Newfoundland and Ireland, it appears that the same or similar jobs can be regarded very differently depending upon the context in which they are embedded, as people at different locations and/or stages of life have an individual set of aspirations, expectations and life experiences. The study found that the factors that affect work quality are moulded by broader aspects of life – family, friends, community, lifestyle and past experiences – that shape an individual.

Title: Shades of grey: Understanding job quality in emerging graduate occupations
Author-Name: Belgin Okay-Somerville
Author-Name: Dora Scholarios
Abstract: This article examines job quality for university graduates employed in intermediately skilled (emerging) and traditional graduate occupations. Skills policies largely assume that increasing the supply of skilled labour generates sufficient demand in terms of appropriate jobs, but job quality in emerging occupations and the effects on graduates’ attitudes and well-being have yet to be established. The role of job quality (defined in terms of skills use, job content, job security and pay) was examined in a sample drawn from the 2006 UK Skills Survey. Graduates in emerging occupations reported lower use of ‘graduateness’ skills, job control, opportunities for skill use and pay. In turn, job quality explained lower job satisfaction and organizational commitment. The defining features of a ‘good’ graduate job related to intrinsic job content. The findings highlight the importance of employer practices and skills policies that better utilize and develop the highly skilled workforce.

Author-Name: Dana Unger
Abstract: This article reports a study that examined the crossover of job-related self-efficacy within working couples, its underlying mechanisms, and its work-related consequences. We proposed that the job-related self-efficacy of one partner (the ‘actor’) can be transmitted to the other partner (the ‘partner’). By building on self-efficacy research (Bandura, 1997), we hypothesized vicarious experience and verbal persuasion to be the mediators underlying this crossover process. We expected that the crossover of job-related self-efficacy would in turn result in the partner’s altered engagement at work. Using a sample of 102 professionals with an academic degree and their working partners, we conducted multilevel analyses using the actor–partner interdependence model. Our analyses offered support for our hypotheses. The actor’s job-related self-efficacy related positively to the partner’s job-related self-efficacy. This relation was mediated by the partner’s perceived vicarious experience and verbal persuasion. Addi...

Title: Positive employee attitudes: How much human resource management do you need?
Author-Name: Michael White
Author-Name: Alex Bryson
Abstract: We propose a selective view of human resource management (HRM) that is guided by work motivation theory, arguing that one of the means by which firms achieve higher performance is by investing in certain forms of HRM practice that help fulfil intrinsic work values and thereby influence employees’ attitudes to their jobs and to the firm in a positive direction. Additionally, an accumulation of complementary practices has important communicative functions that intensify positive employee attitudes. Using nationally representative linked employer–employee data for Britain, we investigate the strength and form of the association between the array of practices deployed by the workplace on one hand, and organizational commitment (OC) and intrinsic job satisfaction (IJS) on the other – two types of job attitude that research has shown to be related to a range of performance measures. We find strong evidence that the relationship between employee job attitudes and our measure of HRM is non-linear, rising chiefly ...

Title: A comparison of clinical psychoanalysis and research interviews
Author-Name: Joshua Holmes
Abstract: The increasing interest in psychosocial methods justifies a comparison of elements of clinical psychoanalysis and research interviews. The article outlines the pressures for a paradigm shift in psychoanalysis and research which has led to an overlap between disciplines. While psychoanalysis is under pressure to justify itself with an evidence base, this runs against its constructivist positioning. In contrast, some researchers are becoming dissatisfied with distance and with impersonal and superficial methods. It is argued that motivation for entering each situation is similar if viewed in terms of a search for deeper understanding of the relational self. The research question is compared to the fundamental rule of psychoanalysis, and the notion of free association in the research setting is critiqued. Interpretation in the research setting is problematized. Suggestions are put forward for an integrated and reflexive means of engagement based on the researcher’s ‘reverie’ responses with participants.

Author-Name: Magnus Larsson
Author-Name: Susanne E Lundholm
Abstract: Leadership is generally seen not only as an inspiring and motivating force but also as having important organizing properties. Despite this common assumption, the organizing properties of leadership have not yet been clarified sufficiently or demonstrated empirically. In this study, such organizing properties are revealed through a detailed analysis of one single work episode, drawn from an ethnographic study of leadership in a bank. Using conversation analysis, the study shows that leadership, understood as an interpersonal influence process, enables and facilitates organizing processes. As expected, this involves establishment of episodic closures, but also resistance to such. Further, the study shows important influence and organizing functions of situated collective identities-in-interaction, which render the involved individuals interdependent.

Title: Commentary: The future of work and retirement
Author-Name: Chris Phillipson
Abstract: Changing patterns of work and retirement raise major questions for social policy in the 21st century. A key issue concerns how to handle the legacy of the 20th century – namely the institutionalization of retirement as a major part of the life course. The acceptance of early retirement in the 1970s and 1980s accelerated the growth of post-work lifestyles, consolidated by the cohort of ‘first wave’ baby boomers (those born in the 1940s and early 1950s). Both aspects are now in collision with the drive to delay retirement and put in place later pension ages. The various articles discussed in this Special Issue explore a number of questions affecting the future of work and retirement, including developments in the policy arena, factors influencing career decisions in middle and late life, and changing transitions from work to retirement. The discussion concludes with an assessment of the new research agendas emerging from debates about extending working life and the future of retirement.

Author-Name: dt ogilvie
Abstract: In western economies with aging populations, organizations are increasingly challenged to understand and manage employees’ retirement expectations. At the same time, employees’ relationships to retirement decisions and the age at which they expect to retire are likely to change as their careers unfold. This article seeks to inform the careers and management literatures on factors contributing to retirement intentions at different career stages. Using a sample of mid- and late career professionals with MBAs, we find that mid-career professionals expect to retire three years earlier than those in late career (age 62 versus age 65.) Work centrality is associated with intentions to retire later, while positive retirement attitudes and higher income are associated with intentions to retire earlier. Furthermore, the expected retirement age is more sensitive to income at mid-career (than at late career) and is more sensitive to work centrality at late career (than at mid-career). We discuss implications for care...

We identify the dramatic broad-based changes that recently have shaken this established construct to its core. We describe the main organizational responses to these changes, and how they have been associated with shifting, multiple meanings of retirement. Finally, we present a model that frames two general forms of reinvention of retirement. The first involves continuation of the idea of a distinct and well-defined period of life occurring at the end of a career trajectory, but with changes in the timing, the kinds of post-retirement activities pursued, and meanings associated with this period of life. The second represents a more fundamental reinvention in which the overal...

Title: Discourses of ambition, gender and part-time work

Author-Name: Joke Leenders
Abstract: The aim of this article is to unravel the gendered practices in ambition and challenge the hegemonic masculinity within it. Our findings are based on a qualitative study using focus groups in which Dutch men and women, full-timers and part-timers, constructed different meanings of ambition. The men and women in our study used three manifest discourses of ambition in the workplace, regarding individual development, mastery of the task, and upward career mobility. A critical analysis of these three discourses indicates how cultural and organizational norms on gender and working hours affect these constructions of ambition. We argue that a fourth discourse, ‘ambition as a resource’, is a major driving force of inequality. ‘Ambition as a resource’ is the dominant hegemonic discourse in organizations, and its power effects mitigate the impact of other discourses on ambition, revealing the potential for change when different discourses of ambition are valued.

Title: The tragedy of the uncommons: Reframing workforce diversity
Author-Name: Karsten Jonsen

Author-Name: Myrtle P Bell
Abstract: This article presents a reframing of workforce diversity as a social tragedy. We draw on Hardin’s concept of ‘tragedy of the commons’, which explored the conflicts between individual and collective good. We identify two dilemmas that underscore the social tragedy of diversity and explain why they prevent workforce diversity from progressing: (1) voluntarism and (2) individualism. We critique the simplistic models of managing diversity and suggest an alternative conceptualization as a way forward. We advocate an approach that captures the potential contradictions between individual and social good and accounts for the role of multiple actors in tackling the tragedy of the uncommons. A reframing of organizational self-interest and collective interests in the context of diversity is presented and solutions to social tragedy of diversity are proposed.

Title: Taylorizing business school research: On the ‘one best way’ performative effects of journal ranking lists
Author-Name: John Mingers
Author-Name: Hugh Willmott
Abstract: The article critically examines how work is shaped by performance measures. Its specific focus is upon the use of journal lists, rather than the detail of their construction, in conditioning the research activity of academics. It is argued that an effect of the ‘one size fits all’ logic of journal lists is to endorse and cultivate a research monoculture in which particular criteria, favoured by a given list, assume the status of a universal benchmark of performance (‘research quality’). The article demonstrates, with reference to the Association of Business Schools (ABS) ‘Journal Guide’, how use of a journal list can come to dominate and define the focus and trajectory of a field of research, with detrimental consequences for the development of scholarship.

Title: Maternal body work: How women managers and professionals negotiate pregnancy and new motherhood at work
Author-Name: Caroline J Gatrell
Abstract: This article builds on the theorizing of body work through introducing a new concept: ‘maternal body work’. In so doing, it shows how progress towards a feminist politics of motherhood within organizations remains limited. Despite decades of feminist scholarship, dissonances remain between the private worlds of reproduction and public worlds of organization. With regard to this limited progress, the article reveals how, among a sample of 27 mothers (all professionally and managerially employed in the UK), 22 felt marginalized and undervalued at work, experiencing the borders between maternity and organization as unmalleable. By contrast, five women treated borders between reproduction and organization as more fluid than anticipated. Setting a high value on their skills, they developed strategies for parrying unfavourable revisions of their status. The article concludes by considering the potential development of resources for enhancing maternal coping strategies.

Title: Organizing to counter terrorism: Sensemaking amidst dynamic complexity
Author-Name: Ian Colville

Abstract: Organizations increasingly find themselves contending with circumstances that are suffused with dynamic complexity. So how do they make sense of and contend with this? Using a sensemaking approach, our empirical case analysis of the shooting of Mr Jean Charles de Menezes shows how sensemaking is tested under such conditions. Through elaborating the relationship between the concepts of frames and cues, we find that the introduction of a new organizational routine to anticipate action in changing circumstances leads to discrepant sensemaking. This reveals how novel routines do not necessarily replace extant ones but, instead, overlay each other and give rise to novel, dissonant identities which in turn can lead to an increase rather than a reduction in equivocality. This has important implications for sensemaking and organizing amidst unprecedented circumstances.

Abstract: This study addresses discrimination that individuals who wear religious attire encounter during the hiring process. We build from the relational demography literature and contemporary research on discrimination in the workplace to propose possible discriminatory effects against Hijabis (Muslim women who wear the headscarf). Specifically, we conduct a field experiment in which confederates portraying Hijabis or not applied for jobs at stores and restaurants. Evidence for formal discrimination (job call backs, permission to complete application), interpersonal discrimination (perceived negativity, perceived interest), and low expectations to receive job offers in the workplace was found for Hijabi confederates. Furthermore, Hijabis were less likely to receive call backs when there was low employee diversity compared to when there was high employee diversity. Implications of these findings with regards to Hijabis and organizations are discussed.

Title: The politics of experience: A discursive psychology approach to understanding different accounts of sexism in the workplace
Author-Name: Penny Dick
Abstract: Researching sexism is not only a controversial undertaking, but one that is rendered problematic due to the fact that many individuals are reluctant to name certain experiences or practices as ‘sexist’. In this article, I use a discursive psychology approach to transcend arguments as to whether certain experiences and practices should be understood as sexist, focusing instead on how, in the context of a research ‘conversation’, participants attempt to warrant their own interpretations of these processes. Using data from research conversations held with two policewomen, who present very different accounts of sexism, I argue that social facts, like sexism, possess an inherent interpretive duality: they can be understood, simultaneously, to be both objective and subjective experiences. The study illustrates that the resolution of competing reality claims (e.g. is sexism a ‘fact’ or is it ‘in the eye of the beholder’) depends upon the processes through which particular versions of reality acquire authority.

Author-Name: Nicolas Balas
Abstract: MNCs’ politics has been considered a ‘contested terrain’ and further research is needed into the dynamics between the Head Office’s drastic restructuring decisions and local responses to understand how collective resistance is performed, and on what conditions. A neo-Gramscian approach is developed to analyse two plants in France facing drastic restructuring, including shutdown. We trace the dynamics of forces significant in aligning resisting subjects. We identify two structural processes – chains of equivalence and chains of difference – which were significant to the constitution of resistance. This article contributes to the development and refinement of a neo-Gramscian approach to management and organization studies in general and to multinational corporations’ politics in particular. It refines the study of multinational corporations’ politics by explaining how collective resistance is constituted and organized, what favours and limits the possibility of creating a collective antagonistic front and t...

Title: Identity undoing and power relations in leadership development
Author-Name: Helen Nicholson
Author-Name: Brigid Carroll
Abstract: Leadership development theory and practice is increasingly turning its gaze on identity as a primary focus for development efforts. Most of this literature focuses on how the identities of participants are strengthened, repaired and evolved. This article focuses on identity work practices that are underdeveloped in the literature: the deconstruction, unravelling and letting go that can be experienced when working upon one’s self. We group these experiences, among others, under the conceptual term ‘identity undoing’ and, based on findings from an 18-month ethnographic study of a leadership development program, we offer five manifestations of how it can be experienced. Through foregrounding the undoing of identity, we are able to look more closely at how power relations shape the leadership development experience. In order to raise questions and propositions for leadership and its development we use a micro-sociological and interactionist approach to explore the interplay between identity and power.

Title: The ascension of Kafkaesque bureaucracy in private sector organizations

Author-Name: Steven H Lopez
Abstract: Although Weber’s ideal typical model of bureaucracy was developed primarily in relation to the state, studies of private sector organizations typically adhere to its formal-rational conceptions with little adjustment. This is unfortunate since bureaucracy in private sector economic organizations has many elements that are poorly captured by and potentially significantly at odds with Weber’s thinking. Most notable in this regard is the pervasiveness of particularistic and often informal, emergent arrangements − arrangements well documented for many decades by workplace ethnographers. This has significant implications for the conception of modern private sector organizations and indeed offers a picture that is more Kafkaesque than Weberian. Significant support for this point is provided by an analysis of content coded organizational ethnographies. Weberian dimensions of bureaucracy − most notably coordinated and specialized organization and training − are predominant in public institutions; private sector e...

Abstract: Future-oriented cognition has been shown to be an important driver of several functional behaviors. In the present article, we build and test theory empirically on the influence of dispositional future focus on organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). We integrate future focus research with regulatory focus theory to examine the two regulatory foci (i.e. promotion and prevention focus) as mediating mechanisms through which future focus influences five distinct organizational citizenship behaviors (i.e. altruism, civic virtue, conscientiousness, courtesy, and sportsmanship). In line with our hypotheses, results from a study of 845 employees show that future focus has a positive influence on altruism, civic virtue, and courtesy over and above important predictors of OCB identified in previous research. Mediation analyses support our theoretical model, indicating that different OCBs are influenced by future focus through either promotion or prevention focus at work.

Title: Low-autonomy work and bad jobs in postfordist capitalism
Author-Name: Matt Vidal
Abstract: In this article I present a critical reconstruction of the concept of postfordism, arguing for a regulation-theoretic approach that views Fordism and postfordism not in terms of production models based on a particular labour process but as institutional regimes of competition, within which there are one of four types of generic labour process: high-autonomy, semiautonomous, tightly constrained and unrationalized labour-intensive. I show that over one-third of US employment is in low-autonomy jobs and sketch an analytical framework for analysing job quality. Contrasting the four labour processes with various measures of job quality produces 18 job types that reduce to one of three job quality categories: good jobs, bad jobs and decent jobs. The typology provides a framework for analysing upgrading or downgrading of four aspects of employment quality within and across the four generic labour processes.

Title: Reconstructing institutional complexity in practice: A relational model of institutional work and complexity
Author-Name: Michael Smets
Author-Name: Paula Jarzabkowski
Abstract: This article develops a relational model of institutional work and complexity. This model advances current institutional debates on institutional complexity and institutional work in three ways. First, it provides a relational and dynamic perspective on institutional complexity by explaining how constellations of logics − and their degree of internal contradiction − are constructed rather than given. Second, it refines our current understanding of agency, intentionality and effort in institutional work by demonstrating how different dimensions of agency interact dynamically in the institutional work of reconstructing institutional complexity. Third, it situates institutional work in the everyday practice of individuals coping with the institutional complexities of their work. In doing so, it reconnects the construction of institutionally complex settings to the actions and interactions of the individuals who inhabit them.

Abstract: The Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model proposes that employee health and performance are dependent upon direct and interacting perceptions of job demands and job resources. The JD-R model has been tested primarily with small, cross-sectional, European samples. The current research extends scholarly discussions by evaluating the full JD-R model for the prediction of psychological strain and work engagement, within a longitudinal research design with samples of Australian and Chinese employees (N = 9404). Job resources (supervisor support and colleague support) accounted for substantial variance, supporting the motivational hypothesis of the JD-R model. However, minimal evidence was found for the strain hypothesis of the JD-R model. The interactions of job demands and job resources were not evident, with only one from 16 interaction tests demonstrating significance. We discuss explanations for our findings. The implications of testing western-derived organizational behavior theories among employees employed...

Title: Direct participation and the quality of work
Author-Name: Duncan Gallie
Abstract: The article compares the importance for the quality of work of three forms of direct participation – individual task discretion, semi-autonomous teamwork and consultative participation – drawing on a representative national survey of British employees. It assesses their implications for employee welfare, specifically their subjective importance, their implications for learning new skills and their effects on psychological well-being. It finds that individual task discretion is the most effective form of direct participation, followed by consultative participation. Although there are also positive effects of semi-autonomous teamwork, these are weaker and less consistently significant. The article finds that the strength of the implications of direct participation vary between employees, particularly by occupational class and the importance employees attach to the use of initiative at work. However, with the exception of those with weak initiative orientation, its effects are generally positive across diffe...

Title: Review Article: How can we make organizational interventions work? Employees and line managers as actively crafting interventions
Author-Name: Karina Nielsen
Abstract: In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the processes of organizational interventions when evaluating the outcomes on employee health and well-being. Nevertheless, process evaluation is still in its infancy and primarily consists of checklists inspired by the public health intervention literature. In these frameworks, employees are seen as passive recipients whose reactions to pre-developed interventions should be evaluated. Current organizational intervention design rests on a participatory approach and recent process evaluations reveal that employees and line managers influence the implementation and the outcomes of organizational interventions. Following the current foci of current frameworks we may miss out on important information on the influence of both the participatory process and the line managers on intervention outcomes. I argue that current evaluation frameworks suffer from four limitations: (i) they are not aligned with state-of-the-art research and practice; (ii) and there...

Abstract: We theorize about and examine empirically the increase in predictive strength of antecedents of voluntary turnover over the first three years of employment using survival analysis with time-varying covariates and period effects. On the basis of employee survey data gathered from 240 newcomers working in a retail bank and organizational turnover records collected over multiple years, we find that job embeddedness and job satisfaction increase in their ability to predict voluntary turnover as tenure increases. The results of this study emphasize the importance of integrating time into theories to better understand the dynamics of the turnover process. Specifically, additional theorizing about when different effects may be manifest and how long they will persist is critical. Equally important is the development and application of research methods that are suited to dynamic modeling, such as those introduced here.

Abstract: This article is a follow-up of Alvesson and Kärreman (2011a), which was in itself a follow-up of Alvesson and Kärreman (2000), and a response to a critique of the former by Hardy and Grant (2012). The critique is addressed directly and the logic behind it investigated critically. The article also addresses wider concerns regarding the politics of research and publishing and the conditions of critique at the present time. The pressure and eagerness to get published lead to strong subspecialization and an inclination to build research approaches within which authors are inclined to reproduce shared assumptions and be unwelcome to critical explorations. The article points to the risk of assumption-challenging work being marginalized through the anticipation of critique leading to hostile reactions and specialized, politically motivated reviewers blocking the publication of far-reaching critique.

Abstract: Drawing on new institutionalism theory, this study examines the influence of institutional logics, the belief systems that direct decision-makers’ attention to particular sets of issues, on human resource (HR) adaptation to demographic changes. We argue that the prevalence of age-neutral HR management and of age-related HR practices such as age assessment and older worker-targeted practices, are shaped by the strength of the strategic (business case), benchmarking (comparing one’s set of policies with peers’) and compliance (laws and regulations) logics. In a sample of 420 US organizations, a strong strategic logic was associated only with greater prevalence of age-neutral HR management. A strong benchmarking logic was associated with greater prevalence of age-neutral HR management, of age assessment practices, and of older worker-targeted practices. A strong compliance logic was associated with greater prevalence of age-assessment and older worker-targeted practices. This article contributes to research ...

Title: Work engagement, job design and the role of the social context at work: Exploring antecedents from a relational perspective
Author-Name: Yseult Freeney
Author-Name: Martin R Fellenz
Abstract: Relational resources are now recognized as significant factors in workplaces and increasing attention is being given to the motivational impact of giving, in addition to receiving social support. Our study builds on this work to determine the role of such relational mechanisms in work engagement, a concept that simultaneously captures drive and well-being. Data from 182 midwives from two maternity hospitals revealed a best-fit model where perceived supervisor support, social support from peers, prosocial impact on others and autonomy explained 52 percent of variance in work engagement. Perceived prosocial impact acted as a significant partial mediator between autonomy and work engagement. This study provides evidence for the importance of perceived prosocial impact and the role of immediate supervisors in facilitating work engagement in midwifery. Results highlight the value of relational resources and suggest their explicit inclusion in current models of work engagement.

Title: Long working hours and working-time preferences: Between desirability and feasibility
Author-Name: Iain Campbell
Author-Name: Brigid van Wanrooy
Abstract: Studies of workers engaged in patterns of long working hours increasingly draw on working-time preference data from large-scale surveys, in particular data on the ‘match’ or ‘mismatch’ of current working hours and preferred working hours. These data are useful, but they are weakened by the common instability of answers to simple working-time preference questions. This article reviews the existing discussion of the causes and implications of this instability. It takes advantage of a small programme of in-depth qualitative interviews in order to examine more closely expressions of working-time preferences among long hours workers. The interview results reveal widespread ambivalence, linked to the fact that employees hold multiple, often conflicting ideas, in particular around the feasibility of a reduction in their working hours. The results point to the need for a careful combination of quantitative and qualitative methods in the study of the causes of long working hours.

Title: Hybrid accountabilities: When western and non-western accountabilities collide
Author-Name: Sadhvi Dar
Abstract: This article critiques the international development sector by questioning the role of western reporting practices in establishing accountability between non-western stakeholders. Homi Bhabha’s theoretical framework on translation and hybridity is applied to understand how recipient NGO workers experience western forms of accountability, such as English-written reports. Drawing on ethnographic research carried out in an Indian NGO, three key findings are outlined. First, reporting subjugates local knowledge leading to workers experiencing disempowerment. Second, reporting in English can give workers a sense of accomplishment precipitating more positive associations with accounting in a western language. Third, workers produce hybrid accounts in response to top-down reporting practices that intermingle donor and local trust-building practices. These hybrid accounts are constituted within multifarious power dynamics, including caste, gender and social status. In conclusion, reporting is highlighted as refle...

Title: Constructing a feminist organization’s identity in a competitive marketplace: The intersection of ideology, image, and culture
Author-Name: Suzy D’Enbeau
Author-Name: Patrice M Buzzanell
Abstract: Feminist organizations today must maintain their distinctive organizational identities in a competitive marketplace in which feminism has become one choice amidst many social change causes. Alignment among organizational identity, stakeholder images, and organizational culture can give feminist organizations a competitive advantage. However, feminist theory and practice have surfaced alignment challenges that can undermine organizational success. This article extends understandings of identity, image, and culture alignment by accounting for the role of ideology. In particular, this article explores how an independent media business that publishes a feminist popular culture magazine localizes feminist ideology discursively to enable alignment and satisfy diverse stakeholders. In doing so, this article fills a gap in feminist organization research by looking at how and where ideological lines are drawn by an organization trading in the economies of popular culture, image, and branding. Lessons for organizat...

Title: The order problem: Inference and interaction in interactive service work
Author-Name: Nick Llewellyn
Author-Name: Jon Hindmarsh
Abstract: This article analyses the work of issuing tickets to queuing customers, thereby contributing to the literature on interactive service work. It draws analytical attention to artful practices through which employees infer ticket orders from local configurations of talk, gesture and bodily movement. It reveals not only the practical reasoning deployed by the service worker, but also the agency of the customer in the course of encounters. Drawing upon video recordings of over 200 separate transactions, the demands of remedying problem orders are analysed to reveal how staff infer and clarify social ‘facts’, such as the customer’s age, their nationality, employment status and willingness to pay the higher ‘Gift Aid’ price. An image of interactive service work emerges that emphasizes the peculiar and skilful articulation of sociological categories in the course of apparently routine low-level work. The concept of ‘inferential labour’ is introduced to capture these processes, which resonates with studies of cate...

Title: ‘Living Space’ at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe: Spatial tactics and the politics of smooth space
Author-Name: Iain Munro
Author-Name: Silvia Jordan
Abstract: Space has become a key analytic concept for the study of organization. While much emphasis has been placed upon the role of designed spaces within the existing literature, as yet there has been little attention paid to the sociality of space and the spatial practices that people employ to enact workspaces. This inquiry provides an ethnographic study of the work of street artists at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. We investigate the spatial tactics that artists employ to create hybrid workspaces within public spaces. We reveal how these spatial tactics are linked to the politics of space by investigating how the artists negotiate the use of public spaces with other users of the space. The study finds that artists employ a distinctive set of spatial tactics to create ‘smooth spaces’ to appropriate and socialize a hybrid workspace. The conceptual contribution of this article develops a processualist account of how hybrid workspaces are created by artists through embodied spatial tactics and how these tactics ...

Title: Identities on call: Impact of impression management on Indian call center agents
Author-Name: Sumita Raghuram
Abstract: Call center agents located in India present themselves at work in a manner that stands in stark contrast to their non-work identities. The impression management tactics they use include using Western names, foreign accents, and scripts that convey physical proximity to customers. This study examines the cognitive demands placed on call center agents as they manage such impressions. The data show that the cultural differences between customers and agents and the use of a telephone as a communication medium intensified demands on agents. In coping with these demands, the agents reassessed their work and non-work identities. At one end of the continuum, some of the call center agents segmented their non-work identities from their work identities. At the other end, call center agents chose to experiment with and incorporate parts of their work identities into their non-work identities, thereby creating hybrid identities. This article discusses implications of these findings for impression management and ident...

Title: The challenge of job quality

Author-Name: Chris Warhurst
Abstract: Job quality is a timely issue because of its potential impact on individual, firm and national well-being. This renewed interest underscores the need for robust conceptualization of job quality. This article provides background to the renewed interest in job quality and, drawing on the contributions to the Special Issue, starts to map the dimensions of job quality, the factors that influence job quality, and the outcomes or impacts of job quality. We identify a number of emergent themes. First, job quality is a multidimensional phenomenon. Second, multiple factors and forces operating at multiple levels influence job quality. Third, the study of job quality is an inherently multi-disciplinary endeavour. Fourth, job quality is a contextual phenomenon, differing among persons, occupations and labour market segments, societies and historical periods. Our mapping of job quality, and the articles in the Special Issue, provide a foundation and springboard for understanding better the theoretically challenging a...

Title: Ethical leadership, moral equity judgments, and discretionary workplace behavior

Author-Name: Scott B Dust
Abstract: The current study examines the role of ethical cognition as a psychological mechanism linking ethical leadership to employee engagement in specific discretionary workplace behaviors. Hypotheses are developed proposing that ethical leadership is associated with employees’ negative moral equity judgments of workplace deviance (a discretionary antisocial behavior) and positive moral equity judgments of organizational citizenship (a discretionary prosocial behavior). In addition, hypotheses propose that moral equity judgments are a key type of ethical cognition linking ethical leadership with employee behaviors. Hypotheses are tested in a cross-organizational sample of 190 supervisor–employee dyads. Results indicate that employees who work for ethical leaders tended to judge acts of workplace deviance as morally inequitable and acts of organizational citizenship as morally equitable. In turn, these judgments guided employee regulation of behavior, and mediated the relationships between ethical leadership and ...

Title: Institutional complexity and logic engagement: An investigation of Ontario fine wine

Abstract: We contribute to research on institutional complexity by acknowledging that institutional logics are not reified cognitive structures, but rather are open to interpretation. In doing so, we highlight the need to understand how actors engage with institutional logics and the creativity that such engagement implies. Using an inductive case study of the Ontario wine industry, we rely on the notion of scripts to explicate how actors engage with the aesthetic and the market logics that are entrenched in their field. Our findings reveal two scripts that are used to adhere to the aesthetic logic (farmer and artist) and one that is used to adhere to the market logic (business professional). We find that not only can actors enact two different scripts to adhere to an institutional logic, but also that flexible script enactment takes place within interactions with specific audiences. Thus, we found no unique match between particular logics and specific audiences, but rather that the aesthetic and the market logics,...

Title: How age similarity preference, uncertainty, and workplace challenges affect conflict
Author-Name: Rhetta L Standifer
Author-Name: Scott W Lester
Author-Name: Nicole J Schultz
Author-Name: James M Windsor
Abstract: In this article, we propose that age similarity preference (ASP) among employees increases workplace difficulties in an age-diverse environment. Individuals use social categorizations such as age groupings to help minimize uncertainty, cope with change, and deal with complexity. When placed in an age-diverse work environment, intergroup comparisons regarding age become more salient. We suggest that when a preference exists among employees to work and interact with those similar in age to themselves in an age-diverse workplace, this will lead to an increase in uncertainty, perceived workplace challenges, and subsequently conflict. Data were collected from 262 employees of an organization in the US Midwest to test our hypotheses. Using multiple mediation modeling, our results suggest that ASP influences the degree of conflict reported, and that uncertainty and perceived work-related challenges mediate the relationship between ASP and conflict. A post-hoc ANOVA analysis of our data also showed a significant ...

Author-Name: Robert Folger
Author-Name: Deshani B Ganegoda
Author-Name: Darryl B Rice
Author-Name: Regina Taylor
Author-Name: David XH Wo
Abstract: We analyze business behavioral ethics in terms of bounded autonomy, namely the result of tensions between the countervailing motivations of reactance (tendencies that involve the freedom of behaving in certain ways as a right) versus deonance (tendencies that involve the appropriateness of behaving in certain ways as an obligation). We focus in particular on how the resolution of such tensions (i.e. establishment of a boundary between rights and duties—“free” behaviors versus “non-free” behaviors—in a state of dynamic equilibrium) can cause behavior to be seen as ethical by the person performing the behavior (the actor), but seen as unethical by impartial observers. That discrepancy comes from the actor’s assessment of the behavior in question as having either an inherent status (the type of behavior it is) or an instrumental status (what it does). This analysis leads us to a discussion of the following four types of situations involving unethical behavior: freedom expansion based on a behavior’s inherent...

Title: When do leaders grant voice? How leaders’ perceptions of followers’ control and belongingness needs affect the enactment of fair procedures
Author-Name: Niek Hoogervorst
Author-Name: David De Cremer
Author-Name: Marius van Dijke
Abstract: Theories that explain employees’ positive emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses to fair procedures rely on control and relational processes. In the present study, we build on these models, but reverse this perspective to examine when leaders provide voice opportunities in their interactions with employees. We argued that leaders may take care of employees’ perceived individual control needs (which influence their own outcomes) by granting them voice. However, this will be the case particularly when leaders perceive that this employee also wants to belong to the organization, because this makes it more likely that employees will use their voice in a way that does not hurt the organization’s interest. Support for this predicted interaction effect was found in a laboratory experiment and a multisource field study. This research is among the first to identify factors that influence whether leaders will be more likely to act fairly, thus integrating procedural justice processes in the leadership liter...

Title: Not quite a revolution: Scrutinizing organizational neuroscience in leadership studies
Author-Name: Dirk Lindebaum
Author-Name: Mike Zundel
Abstract: Several provocative studies on organizational neuroscience have been published of late, many in the domain of leadership. These studies are motivated by the prospect of being able to better explain what causes and constitutes ‘good’ leadership by examining brain activity. In so doing, these studies follow an established path in organizational research that seeks to reduce complex social phenomena to more basic (neurological) processes. However, advocates of organizational neuroscience reveal very little about the fundamental problems and challenges of reductionism. Therefore, our aim in this article is to scrutinize the reductionist assumptions and processes underlying the fast-evolving domain of organizational neuroscience as it is applied to the study of leadership. We maintain that without explicit consideration of, and solutions to, the challenges of reductionism, the possibilities to advance leadership studies theoretically and empirically are limited. In consequence, inferential ambiguities that flo...

Author-Name: Manuela Priesemuth
Abstract: We extend the deontic model of justice (Folger, 1998, 2001) by arguing that not all employees respond to third-party injustices by experiencing an eye-for-an-eye retributive response; rather, some employees respond in ways that are higher in moral acceptance (e.g. increasing turnover intentions, engaging in constructive resistance). We predict that the positive relationship between supervisor abuse of customers and organizational deviance is weaker when employees are high in moral identity. In contrast, we hypothesize that the relationships between supervisor abuse of customers and turnover intentions and constructive resistance are more strongly positive when employees are high in moral identity. Regression results from two field studies (N = 222 and N = 199, respectively) provide general support for our theoretical model.

Title: How can companies decrease the disruptive effects of stretch goals? The moderating role of interpersonal- and informational- justice climates
Author-Name: Zhe Zhang
Author-Name: Ming Jia
Abstract: This article attempts to determine whether stretch goals disrupt organizations and, if so, how organizations minimize those disruptions. We consider how two different kinds of justice climates − interpersonal and informational − interact to influence employees’ unethical behavior and relationship conflicts in the face of stretch goals. The results from 117 departments (including a total of 351 employees and 117 managers) in six Chinese banks support our hypotheses that stretch goals foster unethical behavior and intensify relationship conflict among employees. Furthermore, we find that informational-justice climates greatly reduce the disruptive effect of stretch goals on unethical behavior, and we find that interpersonal-justice climates greatly reduce the disruptive effect of stretch goals on relationship conflict. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.

Title: Knowing work: Cultivating a practice-based epistemology of knowledge in organization studies
Author-Name: Jens Rennstam
Author-Name: Karen Lee Ashcraft
Abstract: While knowledge theorists give attention to knowing in practice, two common habits in the empirical literature, which we call knowledge inherency and skepticism, serve to re-center certain practitioners. The sites in which we study knowing thereby remain limited, hindering a fuller practice turn. We argue that this enduring tendency is problematic because it inhibits our understanding of ‘communicative knowledge’ – a form of knowing central to the contemporary economy. Yet communicative knowledge is persistently relegated to secondary status through a logic that is simultaneously gendered and classed. We thus suggest a more thorough shift toward the study of ‘knowledge in work’ (Thompson et al., 2001), wherein such a priori associations are suspended, and all practitioners de-centered, in the interest of understanding specific forms, systems, and relations of knowledge entailed in situated practices of knowing. The second half of the article develops specific empirical strategies for doing so. The strateg...

Author-Name: Nathalie Belhoste

Abstract: This article develops theory about the perspectives through which expatriate managers and their employees socially construct differences in a cross-cultural context. On the basis of qualitative research on three kinds of organizations – multinational corporations, small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies – we identify three perspectives on differences in a cross-cultural context: the national distance perspective, the social differentiation perspective and the functional distinction perspective. Each perspective relates to a specific basis for categorization (nationality, status and function), focus of attention (values, attitudes and expertise) and definition of diversity (separation, disparity and variety). We find that international experience and country experience on one side, and the purpose of business (business development, business creation or business turnaround) on the other side, explain why some expatriate managers and their employees adopt one perspective or another, sometim...

Title: Unraveling respect in organization studies
Author-Name: Steven L Grover
Abstract: Organizational scholars have invoked the concept of respect and relegated it as a common sense, under-specified construct. This article analyzes the notion of respect by drawing on philosophy and defines respectful behavior as the manifestation of believing another person has value. Two types of respect are identified: appraisal respect is based on individual characteristics, and recognition respect is based on being human and having rights. In the organizational context, appraisal respect is acknowledgement of work performance and recognition respect is the quality of interpersonal treatment. This article presents a new theoretical framework that juxtaposes these two types of respect to model how they have different effects on self-esteem and therefore affect attitudes and behaviors differently. This model allows future research in the organization sciences to invoke respect more precisely, especially organizational justice and leadership research that explicitly or implicitly use concepts of respect.

Abstract: Given corporate scandals, organizational crises, and accounting irregularities (e.g. Citigroup, BP oil spill, Enron, Arthur Andersen), leadership ethics has grown in relevance. The current study takes a discursive approach to engage in a multimethod case study of a consulting and leadership development firm that takes Conscious Capitalism as the impetus for, and target of, leader development. Using constructivist grounded theory and critical discourse analysis, we reveal themes and ‘best practices’ voiced by consultants and clients for cultivating mindfulness and developing ethical leaders, as well as micro- and macro-level paradoxes, tensions, and challenges: structuring-releasing; expanding-contracting; opening up-closing; and collaborating-competing. Our critical approach contributes (a) a critique of Conscious Capitalism as a Discourse that appears to offer hope for business ethics and societal transformation and (b) a critique of ethical leadership development through embedded power relations and the...

Abstract: Healthcare environments have become increasingly complex, especially around the end of life. As they become more complex, organizational members are often pulled in competing directions as they manage to bring order to what otherwise would be a disorderly world. This extensive ethnographic study of a hospice and an emergency department (ED) critically analyzes the nature of discourse and its resulting accomplishments. I use the notion of ‘taming’ to describe the way providers talk about and make sense of their work and work environment, and the consequences it has for their own personal well-being, as well as for care around the end of life. The goal is to elucidate how reclaiming struggle and choice over meaning production is needed for healthcare challenges of the 21st century.

Author-Name: Thierry Nadisic
Abstract: Both organizational justice and behavioural ethics are concerned with questions of ‘right and wrong’ in the context of work organizations. Until recently they have developed largely independently of each other, choosing to focus on subtly different concerns, constructs and research questions. The last few years have, however, witnessed a significant growth in theoretical and empirical research integrating these closely related academic specialities. We review the organizational justice literature, illustrating the impact of behavioural ethics research on important fairness questions. We argue that organizational justice research is focused on four reoccurring issues: (i) why justice at work matters to individuals; (ii) how justice judgements are formed; (iii) the consequences of injustice; and (iv) the factors antecedent to justice perceptions. Current and future justice research has begun and will continue borrowing from the behavioural ethics literature in answering these questions.

Abstract: This article contributes to the literature on identity work and small business studies, by identifying various forms of identity work of female business owners of Turkish and Moroccan descent in the Netherlands, in relation to two sets of identity regulations stemming from their families, regarding the norms of ‘being a good woman’ and ‘dealing with family support’. Identity work refers to the way subjects form, maintain, strengthen or revise constructions of self in relation to the claims and demands issued on them. Our analysis, which is based on McAdams’s life-narrative approach, demonstrates in detail how social actors perform identity work in continuous interplay with their family environment when powerful, multiple, and even contradictory normative demands are made on those identities. We have demonstrated how these migrant female business owners use various cultural repertoires to negotiate and manipulate the family norms and values in order to seek and hold their position in the public domain effe...

Abstract: The article examines the relationship between community embeddedness and work outcomes (e.g. job motivation, networking behavior, and organizational identification) and the mediating role that organizational embeddedness plays in those relationships. We draw upon conservation of resources theory to explain this mediating effect. Data were collected from 338 employees from multiple organizations at three points in time over a ten-month period; this design allowed us to use latent growth modeling to examine the relationships among changes in the independent, mediating, and outcome variables over time. Results from latent growth modeling analyses generally supported the proposed model. Although community embeddedness has been somewhat marginalized in recent empirical research on organizational embeddedness, this article highlights that it is indeed relevant in predicting job attitudes and job behaviors.

Title: Examining workplace mindfulness and its relations to job performance and turnover intention
Author-Name: Erik Dane

Abstract: In recent years, research on mindfulness has burgeoned across several lines of scholarship. Nevertheless, very little empirical research has investigated mindfulness from a workplace perspective. In the study reported here, we address this oversight by examining workplace mindfulness – the degree to which individuals are mindful in their work setting. We hypothesize that, in a dynamic work environment, workplace mindfulness is positively related to job performance and negatively related to turnover intention, and that these relationships account for variance beyond the effects of constructs occupying a similar conceptual space – namely, the constituent dimensions of work engagement (vigor, dedication, and absorption). Testing these claims in a dynamic service industry context, we find support for a positive relationship between workplace mindfulness and job performance that holds even when accounting for all three work engagement dimensions. We also find support for a negative relationship between workpla...

Abstract: Women physicians are confronted with incompatible gendered role prescriptions, whereby the role of the ‘ideal’ mother contrasts sharply with that of the ‘ideal’ physician. This study introduces four goal frames that reflect how women physicians internalize these conflicting role prescriptions and investigates the relationship between women’s goal frames and their career motivation. It also examines the relationship between gender-equality arrangements – inspired by the same underlying ideals – and women physicians’ career motivation, and whether these arrangements moderate the relationship between goal frames and career motivation. Cross-sectional data on 1070 Dutch women physicians collected in 2008 indicate that women physicians with switching goal frames (i.e. those who want to live up to both ideals) are no less career-motivated than women with one dominant goal frame. However, gender-equality arrangements mainly seem to support women physicians who prioritize one role over the other. No evidence was ...

Author-Name: Alessia Contu

Abstract: ‘Partnership’ is a buzzword for agents delivering policy solutions, funding and implementation strategies for effective international development. We call such an ensemble of policies and practices the ‘partnership discourse’. We explore the value of the term ‘partnership’ in international development with an empirical focus on the African context and issues of equality in relations between international and national non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are routinely characterized as partnerships. The results of our research in Uganda indicate that a hiatus exists between the rhetoric and reality of such partnerships. Partnerships on the ground reproduce relations of inequality characterized by subordination and oppression. The retroductive explanation we offer for such an emergent picture is to recast partnerships not as neutral management tools, but as political processes actualized in a terrain that is contested and uneven. Our theoretical contribution is to develop a political theorization of in...

Abstract: This article examines how demographics (gender) and cultural values (power distance) differentially moderate the relationship between mentoring (mentor presence) and career attainment (compensation and organizational position) among 390 managers and professionals in two contrasting cultures (Taiwan versus the USA). The four-way interaction of gender x mentor x power distance x country was significant for both dependent variables, supporting our hypotheses based on theories of power distance and gender egalitarianism. In hierarchical cultures such as Taiwan’s, mentored women with high power distance reported higher career returns than did mentored women with low power distance. In contrast, in egalitarian cultures such as the USA’s, mentored women with low power distance reported higher career returns than did mentored women with high power distance. Our findings demonstrate variation in mentoring outcomes, not just across, but also within, cultures for men and women. We discuss results along with implicat...

Title: You can’t go home again: And other psychoanalytic lessons from crossing a neo-colonial border
Author-Name: Ajnesh Prasad
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to situate the nexus between reflexivity and fieldwork through autoethnographic analysis. Specifically, drawing on psychoanalytic and postcolonial thought, this article utilizes introspective data from field research conducted in the occupied Palestinian territories to explore how Qalandiya – a neo-colonial militarized border crossing between Jerusalem, Israel and the West Bank’s twin cities of Ramallah and al-Bireh – came to significantly alter the researcher’s conceptions of self and Other. Namely, drawing on first-hand experiences at Qalandiya – reconstructed through monologue style voice recordings, emails with colleagues, telephone conversations, personal diary entries, and memory – this article illuminates the discursive impact the field has upon the researcher’s self. Finally, this article concludes with a discussion of the ontological, the epistemological, and the ethical implications of pursuing research at neo-colonial sites in organization studies.

Title: Hidden contexts and invisible power relations: A Foucauldian reading of diversity research
Author-Name: Pasi Ahonen
Author-Name: Janne Tienari
Author-Name: Susan Meriläinen
Author-Name: Alison Pullen
Abstract: This article joins recent critical diversity studies that point to an urgent need to revitalize the field, but goes further by showing the inherent contextual issues and power relations that frame existing contributions. Based on a theoretical reading inspired by Michel Foucault, diversity is presented as discourse that is not independent of the particular research exercise of which it is part but, rather, remains contingent on the prevailing forms of knowledge and choices made by researchers. By attending to more refined understandings of power and context within diversity discourse, this article makes visible and calls into question the categorization and normalization of diversity and its management. It contributes to existing research by suggesting that the knowledge produced by mainstream and critical diversity scholars alike is biopolitical and governmental. To do diversity research differently or ‘otherwise’ requires finding ways to develop theorizations and practices that turn this modality of pow...

Abstract: Despite the common usage of the term, researchers and practitioners have not been able properly to explain what team spirit is and what benefits and drawbacks it might bring to teams. Several definitions have been proposed, but not in a consistent manner. Using a qualitative approach, we worked with one football team to shed light on how individuals experience and characterize team spirit. Our results suggest that team spirit is built around four paradoxes: these are a paradox of selfless egoism; a paradox of results; a paradox of conflict, and a paradox of relationships. Essentially, team spirit can be viewed as an inter-subjectively shared facility with which individual members of a team can balance opposing tensions in a consistent way, managing to maintain a healthy synthesis between individual and collective needs and expectations, preventing the team from dominating the individuals, as well as specific individuals from capturing the team.

Title: Engulfed in the abyss: The emergence of abusive supervision as an escalating process of supervisor–subordinate interaction
Author-Name: Stefan Klaussner
Abstract: I present a dyadic process model to explain the emergence of abusive supervision as an escalating process of supervisor–subordinate interaction. Based on a social exchange framework, the model draws on organizational justice and previous abusive supervision research, as well as insights from behavioral ethics literature. I argue that the emergence of abusive supervision originates from initial subordinate perceptions of supervisor injustice. When reconciliation does not occur, subordinate perceptions of supervisor injustice and supervisor perceptions of inadequate subordinate (response) behavior may accumulate and thereby increasingly reinforce one another in an escalating spiral. It is proposed that perceptions of power asymmetry inhibit reconciliation attempts (e.g. remedial voice) systematically. Eventually, the tipping point of intentional supervisor hostility is reached and crossed. I offer research propositions and discuss implications for future abusive supervision research.

Abstract: Despite researchers’ increasing attention on customer sexual harassment, few studies have investigated its effects on the service performance of frontline employees. This study examined the link between customer sexual harassment, as perceived by frontline employees, and their service performance by focusing on the mediating role of difficulty in maintaining display rules and the moderating role of traditionality. The results from a field survey of 359 supervisor–subordinate dyads in a chain of restaurants in China provided evidence that difficulty in maintaining display rules mediates the negative relationship between customer sexual harassment and service performance. In addition, Chinese traditional values attenuate the relationship between customer sexual harassment and difficulty in maintaining display rules and the mediating effect of difficulty in maintaining display rules. Implications for theory, research and management practice are discussed.

Abstract: Although research to date has established the criterion validity of work engagement, little research has examined relevant boundary conditions capable of altering its documented positive effects on important workplace outcomes, despite widespread appeals to do so (e.g. Parker and Griffin, 2011). In the present four-sample investigation, a competing hypotheses format was adopted, pitting against each other perspectives of ‘politics as a hindrance stressor’ and ‘politics as a challenge stressor’ as moderators of work engagement–work outcomes relationships (e.g. job tension, job satisfaction, work intensity, job performance). Cross-sample findings demonstrated that organizational politics perceptions strengthened positive work engagement–work outcomes relationships, such that engaged individuals were less stressed, more satisfied, worked with greater intensity and exhibited greater performance when they perceived their job environments to be political. This series of results affirms the challenge/opportunity...

Title: Enhancing performance of geographically distributed teams through targeted use of information and communication technologies
Author-Name: Arvind Malhotra
Author-Name: Ann Majchrzak
Abstract: Increasingly, geographically dispersed teams are relying exclusively on sophisticated information and communication technologies (ICTs) to coordinate their knowledge. Current research argues that the reliance on the technology (versus face-to-face) for communication may inhibit geographically distributed team performance. In contrast, we argue that previous research associates negative performance effects with the level or degree of exclusive reliance on ICT without regard to the specific form or ways in which team members use ICT. We hypothesize that teams will be more successful when they use ICT to specifically facilitate the situational awareness needs created by their teams’ composition and task. We studied 54 geographically dispersed teams that all relied exclusively on ICT (with minimal to no face-to-face interactions) for coordination in order to control for the effect of the level of reliance on ICTs. Our multi-source/multi-method study demonstrates that the form of use can have a positive associ...

The impact of two interpersonal harmony motives, harmony enhancement and disintegration avoidance, on psychological climate for communication safety, innovative performance and the moderated mediated processes associated with job autonomy were examined in a survey study in China. Results showed that harmony enhancement was positively related to innovative performance through psychological climate for communication safety. Moreover, job autonomy moderated the relationship between harmony motives and psychological climate for communication safety. Harmony enhancement was more strongly associated with psychological climate for communication safety when job autonomy was low. The relationship between disintegration avoidance and psychological climate for communication safety was positive when job autonomy was high, but negative when job autonomy was low.

Title: Examining the tensions in workplace flexibility and exploring options for new directions
Author-Name: Linda L Putnam
Author-Name: Karen K Myers
Author-Name: Bernadette M Gailliard
Abstract: Workplace flexibility initiatives as a potential remedy for work–life conflicts are the focus of a considerable number of investigations. Despite their contributions, research findings reveal tensions and contradictions in the ways that employees, managers and organizations develop, enact and respond to these flexibility initiatives. This critical review identifies three primary tensions (variable vs fixed arrangements, supportive vs unsupportive work climates and equitable vs inequitable implementation of policies) that reveal inconsistent and sometimes contradictory findings. We tie these tensions, and the management of them, to an overarching dilemma in implementing workplace flexibility, the autonomy–control paradox. To develop alternatives for handling these tensions, we recommend reframing them through changing organizational cultures, adopting a philosophy of adaptability, customizing work and making workplace flexibility an employee right. We conclude by urging organizations and society to reframe...

Title: Feedback seeking from peers: A positive strategy for insecurely attached team-workers

Abstract: Feedback inquiry is a proactive behaviour that is instrumental for gaining information about job performance. However, feedback inquiry also has a social component, especially in the context of flexible team-work environments. Feedback inquiry implies interacting with others, suggesting that relational considerations might affect whether individuals accept and apply feedback to improve their performance. Drawing on this relational perspective, we examined the role of attachment styles in employees’ peer-focused feedback inquiry, as well as the subsequent association of feedback inquiry with job performance. We proposed that individuals higher in attachment anxiety would be more inclined to engage in feedback inquiry from peers, whereas those higher in attachment avoidance would be less likely to do so. We also proposed that individuals higher in attachment anxiety would benefit more from feedback inquiry, such that the association between feedback inquiry and performance is stronger for these individuals....

Title: ‘It’s all hands-on, even for management’: Managerial work in the UK cafe sector
Author-Name: Caroline Lloyd
Author-Name: Jonathan Payne
Abstract: The growth in managerial jobs is often presented by policy makers as evidence of the UK’s success in developing high-skilled, well-paid employment. At the same time, concerns have been raised that the lack of higher level qualifications in the managerial workforce has a detrimental impact on productivity and performance. This article focuses on the relatively neglected figure of the first line manager in private services through a study of the UK cafe sector. It explores the content and quality of the cafe manager’s job, and interrogates the purported benefits of upskilling through graduate level qualifications. The findings indicate that these jobs leave much to be desired in terms of pay and work content, and that managers are highly constrained by the degree of centralized control wielded by head office. Limited autonomy and, in many cases, poor job quality raise crucial questions about the ability of lower level managers to influence performance, even allowing for higher level qualifications.

Title: Making the ideal (local) entrepreneur: Place and the regional development of high-tech entrepreneurial identity
Author-Name: Rebecca Gill
Author-Name: Gregory S Larson
Abstract: Entrepreneurship research has begun to examine the construction of an occupational identity for entrepreneurs, arguing that this identity is intersected by a variety of discourses, including gender, class and race/ethnicity. Yet, these studies only partially account for the myriad ways that entrepreneurial identity, and occupational identity more broadly, may manifest across the US or globally. In this article, we discuss how high-tech entrepreneurial identities are constructed in conjunction with place-based ‘transcendent’ and ‘locale-specific’ discourses. Empirical results from two studies of high-tech entrepreneurs in the western US demonstrate that place both shapes and constrains the possibilities for constructing an ‘ideal entrepreneurial self’. The implications of our research suggest: (i) the importance of ‘relocating place’ to understand the regional shaping of entrepreneurial identity and occupational identity; (ii) the significance of place serving as a rich organizing discourse for studies of ...

Abstract: Responding to Jackson and Joshi’s (2011) call for specific models of the effects of particular diversity types and against the backdrop of the rising desire for the public expression of religious identities in the workplace (Hicks, 2003), we develop a framework that systematically explores when and how the expression of diverse religious identities induces relational conflicts in organizational units. In developing this framework, we integrate the respective literatures on religion studies (e.g. Hicks, 2003), identity-disclosure (e.g. Ragins, 2008) and diversity within organizational groups (Jackson and Joshi, 2011). Our framework specifies three paths whereby the public expression of diverse religious identities can engender relational conflicts. As mediators, we discuss perceivers’ attribution of proselytism and religious discrimination, as well as identity threats. Moreover, we examine the moderating roles of actors’ and perceivers’ religious fundamentalism, perceivers’ religious identity salience and ...

Title: Obesity in organizational context

Abstract: This article argues that obesity is an overlooked topic that deserves to be investigated in organizational studies, in line with the recent interest in embodiment. Obesity plays a pervasive role in everyday organizational life as a source of discrimination, legitimization of power differentials and widespread anxiety even for the non-obese. Obesity is also a thoroughly organized phenomenon. It is increasingly construed as a medical and societal problem and the target of massive efforts to curb the ‘obesity epidemic’. These include workplace health initiatives that offer opportunities for empirical access to otherwise elusive phenomena related to obesity. To substantiate its claims, the article relates research from several fields, notably critical obesity research and empirical studies of embodiment in organizations. It points at intriguing combinations of ubiquitous social influence and failed campaigns, of subjugation and resistance, and of prejudice and critical reflection. Finally, the article indicat...

Title: Subversive functionalism: For a less canonical critique in critical management studies
Author-Name: Rasmus Koss Hartmann
Abstract: Critical management studies (CMS) is increasingly recognized as a distinct and institutionalized field of research within organization and management scholarship. That institutionalization, however, has been a cause for both optimism and concern about what holds the project together and how it might develop in the future. In an effort to provide a constructive direction for further development, Spicer et al. (2009) suggest the orienting concept of ‘critical performativity’ and several tactics for realizing it. I contend that realizing a critically performative agenda is likely to be impeded by the increasingly institutionalized canon of acceptably critical perspectives in CMS, and suggest how it might alternatively be realized by expanding existing canons to include subversive readings of mainstream theory. To this end, I present a set of tactics for this sort of ‘subversive functionalism’ focused on deeper theoretical engagement and exploration of implications, alternatives and integration.

Abstract: Although the literature in international human resource management has developed greatly over recent years, our understanding of the dynamics of the transfer of HR practices in multinational companies (MNCs) from emerging economies with subsidiaries in advanced economies is found wanting. This study addresses this gap in our knowledge by investigating the transfer of employment policies of a Brazilian MNC to its Canadian subsidiaries. It examines interrelated questions about the influence of an emerging-economy parent-business system and how this interacts with the well-developed institutional regulation of the host country in a context of complex relations of dependence and dominance. Our prior expectation that the MNC would have had to adapt its policies to the ‘Canadian way’ was not borne out by the evidence. Instead the Brazilian MNC was found to be adept at capturing significant components of the host country’s institutional setting in a manner that gave it the space to determine the ‘rules’ for its ...

Author-Name: Mark NK Saunders

Abstract: This article provides an empirical test of whether trust and distrust can co-exist in the mind of an employee. Two interrelated questions are considered: firstly, whether trust and distrust judgements are ‘symmetrical’ or whether they can occur ‘simultaneously’ as separate constructs; and, secondly, whether trust and distrust judgements entail the same or conceptually different expectations as revealed in their expressions and anticipated manifestations. Using a concurrent mixed-method design incorporating a structured card sort and in-depth interviews, data were collected from 56 participants in two organizations. The card-sort findings offer little support for the co-existence of trust and distrust, but suggest they could be separate constructs. Interview data indicate that participants do perceive trust and distrust as entailing different sets of expectations and having different manifestations, providing some support for the ‘separate constructs’ thesis. We also find evidence of two new combinations o...

Title: ‘Leader, you first’: The everyday production of hierarchical space in a Chinese bureaucracy
Author-Name: Zhongyuan Zhang
Author-Name: André Spicer
Abstract: Recent studies highlight how organizational power relations are materialized in space. However, relatively little is known about how these spatialized power relations are reproduced on a day-to-day basis. Drawing on a ten-month ethnographic study of a large government office in China, we find that hierarchical space is produced through three intertwined processes. It proliferates as employees actively seek out signs of hierarchy in the organization’s space; it becomes familiarized as employees fabricate and circulate fanciful narratives about their spatial environs; and it is ritualized by employees acting out hierarchical relations across the organization’s space. These processes resulted in a hardening of the hierarchical relations of power. The study extends the existing literature by showing how hierarchical organizational space is not just something that is imposed on employees; it is also imposed by the employees themselves.

Abstract: The study examined the impact of paternalistic leadership behaviors, including authoritarian, benevolent and moral leadership, and information sharing on employee voice and whether information sharing moderates the effects. Using a sample of 286 leader–follower dyads collected from a manufacturing firm, the results indicated that authoritarian leadership was negatively, and moral leadership positively, associated with employee voice. Also, the positive relationship between moral leadership and employee voice was stronger when employees received higher levels of information sharing. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

Title: Intimate, ambivalent and erotic mentoring: Popular culture and mentor–mentee relational processes in Mad Men
Author-Name: Patrice M Buzzanell
Author-Name: Suzy D’Enbeau
Abstract: Mentoring centers on the development of another person through career, psychosocial and role modeling support. As popular cultural portrayals and gendered critiques of mentoring show, not all can be categorized as rational, instrumental and positive. There often are unconscious forces that drive particular mentoring arrangements and offer entrée points into mentorship analyses that contrast with rational approaches. Popular culture images provide an arena to critique dominant mentoring practices. Towards this end, we critically examine the award-winning drama Mad Men (Weiner, 2007) and uncover how non-rational mentoring practices are depicted. We argue that characters engage in intimate, ambivalent and erotic mentoring processes in which loyalties shift and neuroses reflect the nature of workplace social relations. Our critique displays characters’ complicity in perpetuating asymmetrical gendered workplace relations through practices that are seemingly non-rational, presumably meritocratic and/or captured...

Title: Stigma, identity and power: Managing stigmatized identities through discourse
Author-Name: Sammy Toyoki
Author-Name: Andrew D Brown
Abstract: We analyse how men incarcerated in Helsinki Prison managed, through talk, their stigmatized identities as prisoners. Three strategies are identified: ‘appropriation’ of the label ‘prisoner’; claiming coveted social identities; and representing oneself as a ‘good’ person. The research contribution we make is to show how inmates dealt with their self-defined stigmatized identities through discourse, and how these strategies were effects of power. We argue that stigmatized identities are best theorized in relation to individuals’ repertoires of other (non-stigmatized) identities that they may draw on to make supportive self-claims. Prisoners, like other kinds of organizational participants, we argue, often have considerable scope for managing diverse, fragile, perhaps even contradictory, understandings of their selves.

Title: Towards a negative ontology of leadership
Author-Name: Simon Kelly
Abstract: Drawing on recent critical debates concerning the ontology of leadership, this article outlines a radical rethinking of the concept – not as the study of heroic individuals, skilled practitioners, collaborators or discursive actors – but as the marker of a fundamental and productive lack; a space of absent presence through which individual and collective desires for leadership are given expression. Where current critical debates tend to oscillate between variants of the physical and the social in their analyses, this article considers the potential for a negative ontology of leadership; one in which absence, ideological practices and the operation of empty signifiers form the basis for empirical investigation and critical reflection.

Abstract: The goal of this study is to develop a theoretical framework in order to illuminate the cues involved in real life work–family conflict resolution within dual-earner couples. We draw on episodic and longitudinal data from qualitative diaries kept for a one-month period by both members of 24 dual-earner couples (48 participants) with child dependants, as well as from introductory and subsequent in-depth qualitative interviews with the couples, both together and apart. Two distinct types of work–family decision making: a) anchoring decisions and b) daily decisions were revealed, each of which were differentially impacted by enabling and constraining cues, considerations of fairness and equity, and beliefs, values and preferences. The findings suggest that the decision-making process engaged in by couples in incidents of work–family conflict does not progress in a logical sequence, but instead involves numerous complex negotiations and interactions. A decision-making framework encapsulating these findings is...

Yet, many organizations do not have lactation policies in place, co-worker and supervisor communication can be discouraging, and predominant cultural Discourses in the US position breastfeeding at odds with organizational values, often requiring women to define and negotiate support themselves. Drawing upon Structuration Theory, we analyzed interviews conducted with US women who breastfed and worked to illuminate the meanings they held for breastfeeding and organizational breastfeeding support and how those meanings challenge and reproduce social systems that make breastfeeding and working a potentially difficult combination. We argue that their construction of breastfeeding support as a privatized privilege re/produces cultural Discourses that marginalize women’s bodies in organizations. In order to engender support for all bodies that challe...

Title: Review Article: When ‘life itself’ goes to work: Reviewing shifts in organizational life through the lens of biopower
Author-Name: Peter Fleming
Abstract: This review article suggests the English publication of Foucault’s lectures on biopower, The Birth of Biopolitics (2008), might be useful for extending our understandings of how organizational power relations have changed over the last 20 years. Unlike disciplinary power, which constrains and delimits individuals, the concept of biopower emphasizes how our life abilities and extra-work qualities (bios or ‘life itself’) are now key objects of exploitation – particularly under neoliberalism. The term biocracy is introduced to analyse recent reports on workplace experiences symptomatic of biopower. Finally, the conceptual weaknesses of biopower for organizational theorizing are critically evaluated to help develop the idea for future scholarship.

Title: Fun and friends: The impact of workplace fun and constituent attachment on turnover in a hospitality context
Author-Name: Michael J Tews
Author-Name: John W Michel
Author-Name: David G Allen
Abstract: Extending the growing body of research on fun in the workplace, this article reports on a study examinining the relationship between fun and employee turnover. Specifically, this research focused on the influence of three forms of fun on turnover – fun activities, coworker socializing and manager support for fun. With a sample of 296 servers from 20 units of a national restaurant chain in the US, coworker socializing and manager support for fun were demonstrated to be significantly related to turnover. In addition, constituent attachment was found to mediate the relationship between each of the three forms of fun and turnover. This research highlights that not all types of fun are equal and demonstrates that one of the key means through which fun influences retention is by facilitating the development of high quality work relationships.

Title: Modeling team knowledge sharing and team flexibility: The role of within-team competition
Author-Name: Hongwei He

Abstract: This study examines the role of within-team competition (i.e. team hypercompetition and team development competition) in a team process. We developed and tested a model that associates team collectivism as the antecedent of within-team competition, and knowledge sharing and team flexibility as the outcomes. The model was empirically tested with data from 141 knowledge-intensive teams. The empirical findings showed that team collectivism had a positive relationship with team development competition and a negative relationship with team hypercompetition. Regarding the outcomes, team development competition and team hypercompetition had an indirect relationship with knowledge sharing and team flexibility through team empowerment. We offer a number of original contributions to the team effectiveness literature, especially by showing that team hypercompetition and team development competition have different impacts on team knowledge sharing and team flexibility.

Title: Chinese migrants’ work experience and city identification: Challenging the underclass thesis
Author-Name: Stephen J Frenkel
Author-Name: Chongxin Yu
Abstract: Are internal migrant workers who have contributed so much to contemporary Chinese economic growth forming a distinct, impoverished underclass (Chan, 2010; Solinger, 2006) or are they slowly merging into the Chinese working class? In this article sociological theory is employed to develop the distinction between underclass and working class, including the conditions and criteria that enable these social categories to be distinguished theoretically and empirically. Drawing on a large range of survey data, including our own analysis of a recent Chinese migrant worker survey, we examine relevant aspects of work and city experience in order to assess the underclass thesis. In addition, we evaluate the argument that younger migrant workers are significantly different in work orientation and strategies for work-life improvement compared with their more experienced counterparts. We conclude that evidence for the underclass thesis is less compelling than an interpretation that views most migrant workers as transit...

Abstract: This article presents empirical evidence from household and firm survey data collected during 2009−2010 on the implementation of the 2008 Labor Contract Law and effects on China’s workers. The Government and local labor bureaus have made substantial efforts to enforce the provisions of the new Law, which has likely contributed to reversing a trend toward increasing informalization of the urban labor market. Enforcement of the Law, however, varies substantially across cities. The article analyzes the determinants of worker satisfaction with the Law’s enforcement, workers’ propensity to have a labor contract, their awareness of the Law’s content and their likelihood of initiating disputes, and finds that all are highly correlated with education level, especially for migrants. Although higher labor costs may have had a negative impact on manufacturing employment growth, this has not led to an overall increase in aggregate unemployment or prevented the rapid growth of real wages. Less progress has been made i...

Title: Work–nonwork conflict and burnout: A meta-analysis

Abstract: This study meta-analytically examines correlations between dimensions of work–nonwork conflict (work-to-nonwork and nonwork-to-work conflict) and burnout subscales (exhaustion, depersonalization/cynicism), with a special emphasis on the role of moderating variables. The meta-analysis is based on 220 coefficients from 91 samples with a total of 51,700 participants and employs a random-effects model. Primary studies relied on samples of working adults from different cultural backgrounds. Our results revealed that both directions of work–nonwork conflict were strongly related to emotional exhaustion as well as to cynicism (ρ between .34 and .61). The correlations were shown to be moderated differentially by gender, age, marital and parental status as well as by cultural background. Meta-analyses based on primary studies with multi-wave designs indicated that work interfering with nonwork and exhaustion have equal reciprocal effects when considering zero-order correlations. However, within meta-analytical str...

Title: Understanding the positive and negative effects of emotional expressions in organizations: EASI does it
Author-Name: Gerben A van Kleef
Abstract: Emotions have a pervasive impact on organizational behavior. They do not just influence people’s own actions; when expressed, emotions may also exert influence on other organization members who perceive the expressions. Sometimes emotional expressions have ‘symmetrical’ effects, in that positive expressions yield advantageous outcomes for the expresser, while negative expressions produce disadvantageous outcomes. In other cases effects are ‘asymmetrical’, such that negative emotional expressions generate beneficial outcomes for the expresser, while positive expressions produce detrimental outcomes. Drawing on Emotions as Social Information (EASI) theory, I develop a theoretical analysis of when and how expressions of anger and happiness generate symmetrical versus asymmetrical effects. I support my analysis with a review of empirical research on the interpersonal effects of anger and happiness in negotiations and leadership. This review permits two general conclusions: (1) symmetrical effects of anger and...

Title: A complexity perspective of a meta-organization team: The role of destabilizing and stabilizing tensions
Author-Name: Stephanie T Solansky

Author-Name: Deandra Travis
Abstract: Organizations face the reality of needing to work with other organizations to share resources and responsibilities in pursuit of common goals. However, there is limited research regarding the complex nature of meta-organizations. Our purpose is to identify how a meta-organization team operates. We define a meta-organization team and rely on complexity theory to explain the dynamics within the meta-organization team we observed. Based on our analysis, this team was exposed to competing tensions that forced the team into a far-from-equilibrium state and allowed the team to be effective. We propose two types of tensions on complex systems: destabilizing and stabilizing. These tensions keep a system between the boundaries of equilibrium and chaos. As a result of this study, we provide details of key findings and implications of these tensions.

Title: Defined by our hierarchy? How hierarchical positions shape our identifications and well-being at work
Author-Name: Kate E Horton

Abstract: We explore the influence of hierarchy on workers’ identification and well-being. Specifically, we hypothesize that the accessibility of different identity targets will vary according to the distinct priorities and perspectives found at different hierarchical levels, and that this will have implications for the identification and well-being of workers operating in these different positions. Testing our predictions in a sample of 789 naval personnel we find strong support for our hypotheses. Specifically, we find that individuals in operational positions identify strongly with their career and functional workgroups and that these attachments are important in predicting their affective well-being. In contrast, the identifications and well-being of personnel in mid-level and strategic positions are more strongly tied to career and organizational identities respectively. This research provides new insights into the nature and impact of patterns of identification in the workplace, with important theoretical and...

Author-Name: Jennifer L Berdahl
Abstract: The aim of this article is to examine target responses to workplace mistreatment and to analyze factors that affect the degree of discrepancy between actual and ‘ideal’ (i.e. desired) responses. Two-hundred and seventeen faculty members at a major research university in North America reported their actual and ideal responses to mistreatment. The most common responses involved passive and social support-seeking strategies. Respondents generally wished they could have been more assertive. The size of the discrepancy between actual and ideal responses to mistreatment was predicted by the perceived severity of the behavior, the coping strategy chosen and a difference in organizational status and gender between the perpetrator and the target of mistreatment. While our findings show that status differences were associated with a larger discrepancy regardless of the direction of the status differences, our results indicate that the mechanisms behind the discrepancy differed. Despite being a relatively high statu...

Title: Categorization and identification: The identity work of ‘business sellers’ on eBay
Author-Name: Corentin Curchod

Author-Name: Nicolas Neysen
Abstract: This article aims at gaining a better understanding of how, in a market environment, categorized actors construct their identity in relation to the category to which they are assigned. Drawing on extensive fieldwork conducted at eBay, we consider how the newly categorized ‘business sellers’ connected eBay’s framing of the category (categorical framing) to their subjective interpretations of it (categorical self). We find that business sellers perceived varying levels of discrepancy between categorical framing and categorical self, which led them to engage in processes of identification, identity work and disidentification. Based on our findings, we present a framework relating the level of perceived discrepancies to distinctive paths of identification and we draw implications for understanding the interaction of categorization and identification. The framework highlights how feelings of self-enhancement, injustice and alienation intervene in orienting individuals’ paths of identification.

Abstract: This study examines the mediating role of affective and continuance commitment in the relationship between pay satisfaction and voluntary turnover, and the moderating role of negative affectivity. Drawing from data collected at two points in time from a sample of human resource management professionals (N = 509), we found that affective and continuance commitment mediated the negative relationship of pay satisfaction to turnover. Moreover, pay satisfaction’s indirect negative relationship with turnover via affective commitment was weaker among respondents high in negative affectivity, while its indirect negative relationship with turnover via continuance commitment was stronger among those with high negative affectivity. Finally, the residual negative relationship of pay satisfaction to turnover was stronger at high levels of negative affectivity. We discuss the implications of this study for our understanding of the role of affective commitment, continuance commitment and negative affectivity in the pay ...

Abstract: Middle managers occupy a central position in organizational hierarchies, where they are responsible for implementing senior management plans by ensuring junior staff fulfil their roles. However, explorations of the identity of the middle manager offer contradictory insights. This article develops a theory of the identity of the middle manager using a theoretical framework offered by the philosopher Judith Butler and empirical material from focus groups of middle managers discussing their work. We use personal pronoun analysis to analyse the identity work they undertake while talking between themselves. We suggest that middle managers move between contradictory subject positions that both conform with and resist normative managerial identities, and we also illuminate how those moves are invoked. The theory we offer is that middle managers are both controlled and controllers, and resisted and resisters. We conclude that rather than being slotted into organizational hierarchies, middle managers constitute th...

Abstract: This article explores the cultural narratives through which members of organizations define legitimacy during prolonged periods of change. We view legitimacy work as a cultural practice and interpretive process that takes the form of organizational narratives. We show how the shifting configurations of internal power relations shape both the choice and the meaning attached to the varied legitimacy narratives. We investigate the construction of legitimacy through a longitudinal case study based on participant observation of Gamma, a government Research and Development (R&D) organization, during a process of intense change. We provide theoretical insights into the construction and deconstruction of the legitimacy by analyzing the narratives in play during a process of planned change. We claim that legitimation narratives not only evolve in accordance with functional need or, in a sense, that older narratives give room to newer, more updated or relevant narratives, but also that multiple narratives are used ...

Title: Writing materiality into management and organization studies through and with Luce Irigaray

Abstract: There is increasing recognition in management and organization studies of the importance of materiality as an aspect of discourse, while the neglect of materiality in post-structuralist management and organization theory is currently the subject of much discussion. This article argues that this turn to materiality may further embed gender discrimination. We draw on Luce Irigaray’s work to highlight the dangers inherent in masculine discourses of materiality. We discuss Irigaray’s identification of how language and discourse elevate the masculine over the feminine so as to offer insights into ways of changing organizational language and discourses so that more beneficial, ethically-founded identities, relationships and practices can emerge. We thus stress a political intent that aims to liberate women and men from phallogocentrism. We finally take forward Irigaray’s ideas to develop a feminist écriture of/for organization studies that points towards ways of writing from the body. The article thus not only ...

Title: The visible hand of consultants in the construction of the markets for virtue: Translating issues, negotiating boundaries and enacting responsive regulations
Author-Name: Luc Brès

Abstract: Although the resurgence of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been described as the development of ‘markets for virtue’, little is known about the social construction of CSR markets. Prior works either focus on the economic potential of these markets or criticize the social commodification they reflect, denying them any virtue other than generating profit or maintaining the capitalist status quo. This article uses the case of the market for CSR consultancy in Québec to make ‘visible’ the hand of management consultants in the creation of markets for virtue. Building on interviews with 23 consultants and secondary data, we relate three narrative accounts that highlight complementary facets of the construction of the market for CSR consultancy. Our narratives shed light on three distinctive roles of CSR consultants as social and environmental issues translators, market boundary negotiators and responsive regulation enactors. These roles clarify the regulative dynamics underlying CSR commodification an...

Title: Towards a progressive understanding of performativity in critical management studies
Author-Name: Christopher Wickert
Author-Name: Stephan M Schaefer
Abstract: A central debate in critical management studies (CMS) revolves around the concern that critical research has rather little influence on what managers do in practice. We argue that this is partly because CMS research often focuses on criticizing antagonistically, rather than engaging with managers. In light of this, we seek to re-interpret the anti-performative stance of CMS by focusing on how researchers understand, conceptualize and make use of the performative effects of language. Drawing on the works of JL Austin and Judith Butler, we put forward the concept of progressive performativity, which requires critical researchers to stimulate the performative effects of language in order to induce incremental, rather than radical, changes in managerial behaviour. The research framework we propose comprises two interrelated processes: (i) the strategy of micro-engagement, which allows critical researchers to identify and ‘ally’ with internal activists among managers, and to support their role as internal agen...

Abstract: Despite the growing number and importance of service occupations, we know little about how jobholders’ perceptions of societal stigmas of service jobs influence their identification with and attitudes towards work. The present study presents a framework that accords key roles to research on occupational stigma consciousness and the verification of employees’ self-views (i.e. core self-evaluations) to understand employees’ responses to occupational stigmatization. Survey responses from call center employees revealed a negative relationship between occupational stigma consciousness and occupational identification and work meaningfulness and a positive relationship between occupational stigma consciousness and organizational production deviant behaviors for employees who have a positive self-view. Opposite patterns of results surfaced for employees who have a lower positive self-view.

Abstract: In this article, we study emotional processes associated with the project management discourse. Employing a constructionist approach where emotions are experienced within an ordering discursive context, the study identifies four distinct emotional processes associated with the invocation of the project management discourse in daily work practices. From a study of theatre and opera house employees, we suggest that the project management discourse tends to normalize feelings of rigidity and weariness in project-based work, while emphasizing projects as extraordinary settings creating thrill and excitement. Moreover, we argue that this discourse is invoked in ways that lead individuals to internalize emotional states related to chaos and anxiety, while ascribing feelings of certainty and confidence to external organizational norms and procedures. The study highlights how employees construct project-based work as a promise of exciting adventures experienced under conditions of rational control, but also how t...

Abstract: That leadership development is a contested terrain, like any organizational terrain, can scarcely be considered a new idea, yet research into the intricacies of resistance in this context is very much in its infancy. This article takes recent critical scholarship on resistance as its starting point to explore the interdependencies of power, resistance and struggle in a leadership development environment. Drawing on extensive online interactions collected from an 18-month, cross-sector programme with emergent leaders, this article asks whether the different stakeholders in leadership development could benefit from a more open exploration of power and resistance. Such dynamics offer new insights into the relationship between participants and facilitators and raise a series of alternative questions, challenges and strategies for leadership development.

Abstract: Transformational leadership has consistently been argued to enhance diverse team outcomes, yet related research has generated ambiguous findings. We suggest that effectiveness is enhanced in interprofessional teams when transformational leaders engender dynamics that are characterized by interprofessional motivation and openness to diversity. Drawing on the mood-as-information perspective, we argue that negative affective tone moderates the impact of these mediators on team effectiveness. Further, we suggest that this moderating role is such that conditions of high negative affect enhance the mediating role of interprofessional motivation, while low negative affect strengthens the mediating role of openness to diversity. In order to investigate these divergent effects, the current study develops a model of leadership and interprofessional team effectiveness through two pathways reflecting the parallel mediating effects of interprofessional motivation and openness to diversity, and a moderating role for ne...

Title: It’s all a matter of consensus: Leader role modeling strength as a moderator of the links between ethical leadership and employee outcomes
Author-Name: Babatunde Ogunfowora
Abstract: The present research examines the relationships between ethical leadership and unit-level organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) and individual-level job satisfaction. In addition, this study tests the proposition that the impact of ethical leadership on these outcomes is moderated by leader role modeling strength, a unit-level construct that captures within-group consensus regarding the extent to which unit members perceived the leader as a role model of ethical behaviors at work. To these ends, the article draws on social learning theory (Bandura, 1977) and social identity theory (Ashforth and Mael, 1989). The results provide support for the proposed theoretical model in a sample of 297 employees nested in 58 work units. Specifically, ethical leadership was more strongly and positively associated with unit-level OCB and individual-level job satisfaction in work units reporting higher (versus lower) leader role modeling strength. This research highlights the importance of studying leader role modelin...

Abstract: With the changing demographics of the labor force, management of work and family role boundaries has become an important area of research. However, the literature surrounding boundary theory – one of the most prevalent theories of work–family role management – has evolved too narrowly. Although early boundary theory development acknowledged the importance of higher level social institutions, they have been largely omitted from the current research, which is predominantly individual-focused. The present article further develops the role of international regulative institutions in managing work and family role boundaries, including the consequences of their omission in the current literature for individual employees, organizations and the fit between them.

Title: Perceptions of employee voice and representation in the post-acquisition period: Comparative and longitudinal evidence from an international acquisition
Author-Name: Tony Edwards
Author-Name: Martin R Edwards
Abstract: Despite the disappointing performance of international mergers and acquisitions and the widespread recognition that their success depends at least partly on how employees are managed during and after an acquisition, very few studies draw on employee accounts of how they are affected by ongoing restructuring and how much influence employees themselves have over this process. The omission is especially important because of the likely role that national institutions play in conditioning the way employees are affected by organizational change in the post-acquisition period. This article investigates employees’ perceptions of whether they experience voice and representation opportunities following an acquisition through analysis of a unique longitudinal and cross-national dataset that demonstrates national differences in this respect. Moreover, there are also national differences in how these perceptions change over time. We highlight the utility of drawing on employee accounts in longitudinal and comparative ...

Author-Name: Penny Dick
Author-Name: David G Collings
Abstract: Responding to calls to incorporate a more dispersed and localized conceptualization of power in the study of strategy as discourse, in this article we illustrate that while investing senior managers with the authority to speak and enact strategy, at one and the same time strategy discourse renders this group highly visible and vulnerable. Using a Foucauldian-inspired discursive psychology approach to provide a critical analysis of brief stretches of talk in a research interview, we expose the inherent instability and contingency of strategy discourse as it is used to construct and reconcile contradictory accounts of corporate success, failure and senior manager subjectivity. Our core contribution is to show that resistance to strategy discourse is discernible not only through how lower level or other actors contest or undermine this discourse but also by observing the efforts of corporate elites to manage temporary breakdowns (Sandberg and Tsoukas, 2011) that disrupt the background consensus that ordinari...

Title: Putting context into organizational intervention design: Using tailored questionnaires to measure initiatives for worker well-being
Author-Name: Karina Nielsen
Author-Name: Johan Simonsen Abildgaard
Author-Name: Kevin Daniels
Abstract: Realistic evaluation emphasizes the importance of exploring the mechanisms through which organizational interventions are effected. A well-known mechanism in organizational interventions is the screening process. Standardized questionnaires, in popular use, neither consider individuals’ appraisals of working conditions nor the specific context of the workplace. Screening with items tailored to intervention contexts may overcome the limitations of standardized questionnaires. In the present study, we evaluate an approach to develop a tailored questionnaire to measure employees’ appraisals of their specific working conditions. First, we interviewed 56 employees and 17 managers and, later, developed tailored items focused on the working conditions in a postal service. In follow-up interviews, we explore participants’ experiences with the tailored questionnaire, including the development of initiatives, compared with their previous experiences with the company’s annual attitude survey that used standardized s...

Title: ‘Why would you want to do that?’: Defining emotional dirty work
Author-Name: Robert McMurray
Author-Name: Jenna Ward
Abstract: This article considers how and why people work with difficult emotions. Extending Hughes’ typology of the physical, social and moral taints that constitute ‘dirty work’, the article explores the nature of a previously neglected and undefined concept, emotional dirt. Drawing on data from a situated ethnographic study of Samaritans, we consider how the handling of difficult and burdensome emotions, which are often written out of rational accounts of work, is outsourced to others who act as society’s agents in the containment of emotional dirt. We provide the first explicit definition of emotional dirt, and contribute an extension to the existing tripartite classification of occupational taint. Moreover, in naming emotional dirt we seek to open up a sphere of research dedicated to understanding its emergence, nature and relational effects. To this end, we demonstrate how taint emerges as a sociological consequence of the performance of emotional labour as emotional dirty work, while considering how managemen...

Title: Bait and switch or double-edged sword? The (sometimes) failed promises of calling
Author-Name: Brenda L Berkelaar
Author-Name: Patrice M Buzzanell
Abstract: How people talk about their work and careers matters. Desiring meaningful work, people increasingly describe work and careers as a calling. Such callings may be secular or sacred. Popular ways of talking about calling often create problematic, rather than positive, career and life outcomes. In this article, we examine five common, historically influenced assumptions underlying contemporary talk about secular and sacred callings: necessity; agency and control; inequality; temporal continuity; and neoliberal economics. We showcase some of the likely downsides of calling as these underlying assumptions interact with people’s everyday lives. We suggest possible solutions for rehabilitating calling to help people find some of the career and quality-of-life benefits that calling promises. In sum, this essay contributes to a more nuanced understanding of calling and agency in contemporary careers while also offering a framework and direction for developing research and practice on calling.

Title: Understanding when leader negative emotional expression enhances follower performance: The moderating roles of follower personality traits and perceived leader power
Author-Name: Nai-Wen Chi

Abstract: Emotional expression plays an important role in our social lives. This is especially true for leaders, who hold greater power as compared with their followers. Based on the Emotions as Social Information (EASI) model, we explore the effectiveness of leaders’ negative emotional expression on follower performance by examining the moderating effects of follower conscientiousness, agreeableness, power distance orientation and perceived leader power. We collected data from 40 firms across various industry types using a multisource, multiphase research design. The data are comprised of 191 leader−follower dyads, consisting of 86 leaders and 191 followers. The results of the hierarchical regression analysis show that followers’ conscientiousness and agreeableness positively moderate the relationship between leader negative emotional expression and follower performance. However, when followers are low in power distance orientation and perceived leader power, the relationship between leader negative emotional expr...

Abstract: Categorization is known to play an important role in organizations because categories ‘frame’ situations in particular ways, informing managerial sensemaking and enabling managerial intervention. In this article, we advance existing work by examining the role of categorization practices in discursive leadership during periods of strategic change. Drawing on data from an ethnographic action research study of a strategic change initiative in a multi-national corporation, we use membership categorization analysis to develop a framework for studying ‘category predicates’ − defined as the stock of organizational knowledge and associated reasoning procedures concerning the kinds of activities, attributes, rights, responsibilities, expectations, and so on, that are ‘tied’ or ‘bound’ to organizational categories. Our analysis shows that discursive leadership enabled a radical shift in sensemaking about organizational structure categories through a process of ‘frame-breaking’ and ‘re-framing’. In so doing, the lea...

Title: Can critical management studies ever be ‘practical’? A case study in engaged scholarship
Author-Name: Daniel King
Author-Name: Mark Learmonth
Abstract: What happens when you try to engage with management practice as a critical management scholar by actually doing management? Although there have been calls for critical scholars to attempt such engagement, little is known about the practical challenges and learning that may be involved. This article therefore provides a case study that details some of the experiences one of us had when working as a manager while trying to remain true to his critical sensibilities. The story suggests that transforming management practice will be a constant struggle, and that the difficulties of achieving even small changes should not be underestimated. However, change is not impossible. Following Foucault, we argue that critical perspectives, when engaged in particular ways, offer resources through which we might challenge the dominance of managerialist thinking on a practical level − at least in the long run.

Title: Internal and external equity in compensation systems, organizational absenteeism and the role of explained inequalities
Author-Name: Edoardo Della Torre
Author-Name: Matteo Pelagatti
Author-Name: Luca Solari
Abstract: We investigate how the design of compensation systems influences workers’ behaviours at the organizational level by building upon the consequences of equity theory at the individual level. We identify four main gaps to fill in the existing equity-in-compensation research: i) the simultaneous analysis of internal and external inequity; ii) the distinction between inequitable and unequal compensation systems; iii) the organizational-level (rather than individual) effects of inequitable systems; and iv) the inclusion of absenteeism among the negative organizational outcomes of inequitable systems. The analysis of a sample of about 1500 Italian manufacturing firms shows that both internal and external equity are relevant factors in explaining the level of absenteeism. On the one hand, external pay equity is associated with a lower level of absenteeism, and the relationship becomes stronger when high pay levels are explained by past employees’ performances. On the other hand, internal pay equity showed a more ...

Title: Emotional roulette? Symmetrical and asymmetrical emotion regulation outcomes from coworker interactions about positive and negative work events
Author-Name: Constance Noonan Hadley
Abstract: Prior research suggests that, in general, the disclosure of positive emotions at work results in positive consequences for individuals while the disclosure of negative emotions results in negative ones. The current study examines the possibility of asymmetrical emotional outcomes to such disclosures, including those associated with the sharing of positive emotions. Interviews with human service workers elicited 71 detailed descriptions of emotional work events, the majority of which (77%) had been discussed in some manner with coworkers. Qualitative analysis of the incident data shows that both symmetrical and asymmetrical emotion regulation outcomes resulted from these coworker interactions. In regard to the disclosure of negative emotions, an asymmetrical outcome (mitigation) was welcomed, whereas for positive emotions, a symmetrical outcome (capitalization) was desired. Group norms, leader behaviors and coworker responsiveness influenced whether and which emotional events were shared, as well as the ne...

Title: Organizational blind spots: Splitting, blame and idealization in the National Health Service
Author-Name: Marianna Fotaki
Author-Name: Paula Hyde
Abstract: The article examines the escalation of commitment to failing strategies from a psychodynamic perspective as an affective process connecting organizational, systemic and individual levels. We propose a theory of organizational blind spots to explain how such escalation of commitment occurs. Blind spots develop as an organizational defence mechanism for coping with problems resulting from attempts to implement unrealistic strategy or policy goals. Unrealistic strategic aims mobilize and reinforce blind spots through processes of splitting, blame and idealization, thus enabling organizations to persist with unsuccessful courses of action. Organizational blind spots arise when leadership and/or operational members in organizations are unable to acknowledge unworkable strategies. Vignettes from the National Health Service in England (the NHS) are used to illustrate how blind spots sustain an illusory possibility of success while commitment to a failing strategy escalates. The theory of blind spots offers a nov...

Title: Explaining compliance: A multi-actor framework for understanding labour law compliance in China
Author-Name: Sunwook Chung
Abstract: I argue that there is increasing evidence that multiple stakeholders, such as labour intermediaries and independent workers, are involved in the regulation of labour standards in China, resulting in increasing compliance with labour laws. In addition, I argue that the differential interests of multiple stakeholders lead to a variation in compliance across different labour law provisions. I find support for these arguments using original factory-level compliance data collected in southern China between 2009 and 2011. There is ‘thick’ compliance when stakeholders’ interests converge, as observed in the case of written contract requirements. There is ‘thin’ compliance when there is less convergence in stakeholder interests, as observed in the case of compliance with social insurance provisions. Finally, there is no compliance when there is convergence toward non-compliance in stakeholder interests, as observed in the case of overtime hour limits.

Title: Rethinking the philosophical and theoretical foundations of organizational neuroscience: A critical realist alternative
Author-Name: Mark P Healey
Author-Name: Gerard P Hodgkinson
Abstract: Stimulated by the growing use of brain imaging and related neurophysiological techniques in psychology and economics, scholars have begun to debate the implications of neuroscience for management and organization studies (MOS). Currently, this debate is polarizing scholarly opinion. At one extreme, advocates are calling for a new neuroscience of organizations, which they claim will revolutionize understanding of a wide range of key processes, with significant implications for management practice. At the other extreme, detractors are decrying the relevance of neuroscience for MOS, primarily on philosophical and ethical grounds. The present article progresses this debate by outlining an intermediate, critical realist position, in which the insights of social neuroscience are one of a number of convergent building blocks that together point toward the need for a more embodied and socially situated view of cognition in management and organizations.

Title: Extending organizational cognition: A conceptual exploration of mental extension in organizations
Author-Name: Gazi Islam
Abstract: The study of collective cognition has taken many forms in recent years, including collective managerial cognition, organizational learning, shared mental models, transactive memory and psychological climate. However, few studies have confronted the foundational ideas underlying group mentality directly, leaving the concept as largely metaphorical. The current work reviews foundational debates around the conceptual components of group minds to serve as a meta-theoretical heuristic to orient future research. To lay out this framework, conceptual distinctions are drawn between phenomenal, vehicle, content and context elements of cognition. Next, existing approaches are reframed as conjunctions of claims across the four levels, leading to a distinction between configurationalist, situated and extended views of collective cognition. Finally, future research is proposed regarding the interfaces between conceptual levels and the possibility of establishing bona fide group mental entities.

Abstract: This article explores employee voice within the specific institutional arrangement of double-breasting. Double-breasting is when multi-plant organizations recognize trade unions in some company sites, with non-union arrangements at other company plants, or where a unionized firm acquires a new site that it then operates on a non-union basis. We examine three research questions in four separate case study organizations that operate employee voice double-breasting arrangements across 16 workplace locations on the island of Ireland. These questions consider employer motives for double-breasting, the practices that characterize double-breasting employee voice, and the micro-political implications of double-breasting. The article contributes to knowledge on the emergence and impact of double-breasting and employee voice systems. We subsequently advance two theoretical propositions: the first theorizing employer motives for double-breasting, and the second explaining the extent to which the practice of double-b...

Title: Work-worlds colliding: Self-reflexivity, power and emotion in organizational ethnography
Author-Name: Sarah Gilmore

Abstract: While organizational ethnographers have embraced the concept of self-reflexivity, problems remain. In this article we argue that the prevalent assumption that self-reflexivity is the sole responsibility of the individual researcher limits its scope for understanding organizations. To address this, we propose an innovative method of collective reflection that is inspired by ideas from cultural and feminist anthropology. The value of this method is illustrated through an analysis of two ethnographic case studies, involving a ‘pair interview’ method. This collective approach surfaced self-reflexive accounts, in which aspects of the research encounter that still tend to be downplayed within organizational ethnographies, including emotion, intersubjectivity and the operation of power dynamics, were allowed to emerge. The approach also facilitated a second contribution through the conceptualization of organizational ethnography as a unique endeavour that represents a collision between one ‘world of work’: the u...

Author-Name: Samia Chreim
Abstract: This article draws on distributed leadership and leadership-as-practice perspectives to report on a comparative case analysis of leadership configurations. The context of acquisitions is used in the study. Attention is given to the practices of members of the two leadership teams – one from each of the acquiring and acquired organizations – as they attempted to integrate their practices and redistribute leadership roles. The findings show that, despite expectations that distributed leadership would be achieved, the emergent configurations varied across the firms and consisted of distributed leadership, distributed leaderlessness, overlapping leadership and non-distributed leadership. These configurations were underpinned by members’ framings, relational practices and (non)exercise of agency. The article contributes to the leadership literature by proposing the notions of leadership deficits and leadership surpluses in configurations, by exploring how ambiguous leadership spaces are constructed, and by pro...

Abstract: This article outlines a theoretical understanding of competence as the inferred potential for desirable activity within a professional practice. By employing the concept of ‘teleoaffective structure’ as developed in Schatzki’s practice theory, our study investigates how notions of competent and excellent professionals are defined in two separate practices in which highly qualified professionals share formal qualifications. The study is comparative and based on a total of 39 interviews carried out in the Swedish National Police Counter-Terrorist Unit (police) and with recruiters of medical interns (doctors) in Swedish healthcare. Results indicate that, despite obvious differences between the professional groups in the study, some remarkable similarities are apparent in what are regarded as high levels of competence. Surprisingly, technical expertise was downplayed as an indicator of high levels of competence in both practices. The professional groups emphasized flexibility, drive/ambition and social compet...

Abstract: Using the emotions as social information (EASI) model, this study investigated the emotional, attitudinal and behavioral reactions to failure feedback by manipulating negative emotional displays (angry, disappointed or none) and the position level and relational distance of the feedback source. Undergraduate students (N = 260) responded to an organizational failure feedback vignette and completed a subsequent performance task. Results demonstrated that guilt was the complementary emotional experience following displays of disappointment, while reciprocal anger followed displays of anger. These emotional reactions served as important mediators between the emotional displays paired with the feedback message and participant responses of social behaviors, creative task performance and perceptions of the feedback source. In addition, our findings indicated that negative emotions can have positive organizational and interpersonal outcomes. Guilt in response to disappointed displays resulted in beneficial behavi...

Abstract: This article highlights a dynamic and productive duality in the expression of organizational identity claims between demonstrating coherence with the past and responsiveness in the present. Informed by renewed interest in the concept of institutional leadership, which is precisely concerned with the management of this temporal duality, we argue that its reconciliation depends on active discursive intervention. Drawing from archive data of executive speeches at Procter & Gamble (P&G), we suggest that through dissociation, the rhetorical device to distinguish the claim of an accurate or essential interpretation of core and distinctive values from a peripheral or apparent understanding, leaders actively construct fresh potentialities for organizational change. We thereby develop new insights into the dynamic processes of organizational identity maintenance, revealing its capacity to be regenerative and a herald to the new.

Abstract: Although corporate alumni networks are a developing practice, academia has said very little about them and their members. In this article, our goal is to provide an account of how members of such networks construct themselves as alumni. To that end, we adopt a narrative approach to identity construction and empirically explore the identity work that the members of one corporate alumni network carry out in order to sustain their identification with a past organizational setting. Our case study leads us to document four ‘identity stratagems’ (Jenkins, 1996) through which members incorporate elements of their past professional experience into their self-narratives: nostalgia, reproduction, validation and combination. It thus allows for a better understanding of corporate alumni networks and their members, while also contributing to the broader identity literature by further documenting how organizational participants can incorporate elements of a past professional experience into their self-narratives.

Abstract: Ethnography has often been seen as the province of the lone researcher; however, increasingly management scholars are examining global phenomena, necessitating a shift to global team-based ethnography. This shift presents some fundamental methodological challenges, as well as practical issues of method, that have not been examined in the literature on organizational research methods. That is the focus of this article. We first outline the methodological implications of a shift from single researcher to team ethnography, and from single case site to the multiple sites that constitute global ethnography. Then we present a detailed explanation of a global team-based ethnography that we conducted over three years. Our study of the global reinsurance industry involved a team of five ethnographers conducting fieldwork in 25 organizations across 15 countries. We outline three central challenges we encountered: team division of labour, team sharing and constructing a global ethnographic object. The article conclu...

Title: When it can be good to feel bad and bad to feel good: Exploring asymmetries in workplace emotional outcomes
Author-Name: Dirk Lindebaum
Author-Name: Peter J Jordan
Abstract: Within the field of Management and Organizational Studies, we have noted a tendency for researchers to explore symmetrical relationships between so-called positive discrete emotions or emotion-infused concepts and positive outcomes, and negative emotions or emotion-infused concepts and negative outcomes, respectively. In this Special Issue, we seek to problematize this assumption (without aiming to entirely discard it) by creating space for researchers to study what we term asymmetrical relationships. In particular, we explore the topic of when it can be good to feel bad and bad to feel good. The articles presented in this forum demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that appreciating these asymmetrical relationships holds considerable promise for enhanced understanding of a range of management and organizational phenomena, ranging from leadership and followership to emotional labor and dirty work. These unique theoretical and empirical insights have important relevance for organizational practice.

Title: Liminality, space and the importance of ‘transitory dwelling places’ at work
Author-Name: Harriet Shortt
Abstract: This article draws attention to the spaces in-between and employees’ lived experiences of liminal spaces at work. It illustrates how and why liminal spaces are used and made meaningful by workers, in contrast to the dominant spaces that surround them. Consequently, the article extends the concept of liminality and argues that when liminal spaces are constructed, by workers, as vital and meaningful to their everyday lives they cease to be liminal spaces and instead become ‘transitory dwelling places’. In order to examine this shift from ambiguous space to meaningful place, the works of Casey (1993), amongst others, are used to make further sense of the space/materiality/work nexus in organizational life. This article is based on empirical data gathered from a nine-month study of hairdressers working in hair salons and explores the function and meaning of liminal spaces used by hairdressers in their everyday lives. The contribution of this article is three-fold; it argues that space is not just about domina...

Title: The challenge of sustaining organizational hybridity: The role of power and agency
Author-Name: Claudine Mangen
Author-Name: Marion Brivot
Abstract: Hybrid organizations harbor different and often conflicting institutional logics, thus facing the challenge of sustaining their hybridity. Crucial to overcoming this challenge is the identification process of organizational actors. We propose a theorization of how power relations affect this process. More specifically, we argue that an actor’s power influences their own professional identity: an increase [decrease] in their power, via the heightened [diminished] control that this power provides them over organizational discourse, boosts [threatens] their identity. Our theorization has implications for the longevity of a newly adopted logic within an organization. If the new logic modifies incumbent power relations, the identities of (formerly and newly) powerful individuals are influenced, which may lead these individuals to promote or resist the new logic, thereby affecting the odds that the logic will survive within the organization. We illustrate our theorization with a case study in a professional ser...

Abstract: Extending work–family conflict research, we draw on role theory and conservation of resources theory to propose a moderated-mediation model of the relationship between family interference with work, job stress, agreeableness and employee attitudes. We examined the moderating effect of employee agreeableness on the relationship between family interference with work and job and life satisfaction mediated by job stress. Hypotheses were tested in a sample of 756 employees from 15 industries. Results showed a negative association between family interference with work and job satisfaction and life satisfaction through perceived job stress.

Title: Surface acting in service: A two-context examination of customer power and politeness
Author-Name: Jennifer L Wessel
Author-Name: Dirk D Steiner
Abstract: To date, the role of employee perceptions of customers has largely been overlooked in the emotional labor literature, particularly in the area of customer power. In two studies, we first examined the relationships between perceptions of the customer (i.e. power and politeness), surface acting and job-related outcomes in a typical service context (a department store; Study 1) and then explored the generalizability of these findings to a health care service context (a nursing home; Study 2), in which customer–employee relationships, the emotional climate and customer behavior norms differ substantially. Survey results indicate that for department store employees, perceiving customers as having higher power was associated with more reported surface acting and that certain negative effects of surface acting were exacerbated by interacting with impolite customers. These results were not replicated in our sample of nursing home employees. Our research suggests that customer-related variables have an impact on s...

Title: The politics of identity in organizational ethnographic research: Ethnicity and tropicalist intrusions

Abstract: The article addresses aspects of the politics of identity that became manifest in the researcher–researched relationships in the context of an organizational ethnographic field study at a UK-based printing business. As the fieldwork commenced, it quickly became apparent that the researcher’s Brazilian nationality and Latin American ethnic identity were being performed and responded to in certain specific and problematic ways. This study analyzes the dynamics of identity work and identity politics in ethnographic and other qualitative research. However, the specific contribution of this article is that it examines the questions that arise when the typical structures and patterns of research practice – which are themselves embedded in a spatialized politics of knowledge – are reversed. Historically, research in the social sciences (including management and organization studies) has been conducted by researchers from the center in relation to others in the non-center. Furthermore, in so doing, epistemologies...

Title: Humanized management? Capital and migrant labour in a time of labour shortage in South China
Author-Name: Susanne YP Choi
Author-Name: Yinni Peng
Abstract: This article explores changing strategies of managerial control in a labour-intensive factory in South China at a time of labour shortage. It describes power relationships between capital and migrant labour under changing labour market conditions, migrant cohorts and global business environment, and analyses a new paternalist managerial strategy named ‘humanized management’ and workers’ reactions to it. Although ‘humanized management’, as part of East Asian paternalism, advocates mutual respect, care and reciprocity between management and labour, it constructs workers as irresponsible, spoiled children needing to be led, moved, touched, taught and ruled. Its human focus notwithstanding, the new strategy did not result in substantial reforms of managerial despotism, nor did the factory institute any welfare programs for workers. Because of these discrepancies between the ideological avowals and practical application of ‘humanized management’, the new approach was disregarded by workers, who preferred to re...

Abstract: An expanding institutionalist literature on professional service firms (PSFs) emphasizes that these are ridden by contradictions, paradoxes and conflicting logics. More specifically, literature looking at PSFs in a global context has highlighted how these contradictions prevent firms from becoming truly global in nature. What it takes to make partner in the Big 4 is at the core of such interrogations because partners belong to global firms yet are promoted at the national level. We undertake a cross-country comparison of partner promotion processes in Big 4 PSFs in Canada, France, Spain and the UK. Synthesizing existing institutionalist work with Bourdieusian theory, our results suggest that PSFs in different countries resemble each other very closely in terms of the requirements demanded of their partners. Although heterogeneity can be observed in the way in which different forms of capital are converted into each other, we show there is an overall homogeneity in that economic capital hurdles are the mos...

Title: The role of relational resources in the knowledge management capability and innovation of professional service firms1
Author-Name: Na Fu
Abstract: Adopting a relational perspective, this article investigates whether organizational relationship-building routines and relational coordination influence organizational knowledge management capability and ultimately innovation in professional service firms (PSFs). Using data collected from 120 accounting firms in Ireland, support is found for an inter-mediation model where both relational coordination and knowledge management capability intervene in the relationship between relational routines and innovation. Thus, a linkage model is supported whereby relational routines facilitate relational coordination, which enhances knowledge management capability, leading to innovation. This article provides evidence of the importance of relational routines and relational coordination in promoting a firm’s knowledge management capability and in fostering innovation. Results highlight the value of relational resources in PSFs and suggest a novel and easy-to-implement approach for knowledge and innovation management.

Abstract: This article examines the effect of having a labour contract on a range of employee outcomes (wages, hours worked, social insurance coverage and subjective well-being) for a sample of urban and migrant workers in China using data from the Rural-Urban Migration in China (RUMiC) project. Using different methods, we find that the Labour Contract Law has larger effects for urban workers than for migrant workers on receipt of social benefits, subjective well-being and wages, but not for hours worked.

Title: Smell organization: Bodies and corporeal porosity in office work
Author-Name: Kathleen Riach
Author-Name: Samantha Warren
Abstract: This article contributes to a sensory equilibrium in studies of workplace life through a qualitative study of everyday smells in UK offices. Drawing on Csordas’ (2008) phenomenology of intercorporeality, we develop the concept of corporeal porosity as a way of articulating the negotiation of bodily integrity in organizational experience. We explore the corporeal porosity of workplace life through smell-orientated interview and diary-based methods and our findings highlight the interdependence of shared, personal, local and cultural elementals when experiencing smell in office-based work. Our analysis explores three elements of bodily integrity: ‘cultural permeability’; ‘locating smell in-between’; and ‘sensual signifiers’. This suggests that while the senses are part of the ephemeral, affective ‘glue’ that floats between and around working bodies, they also foreground the constantly active character of relationality in organizational life. Corporeal porosity, therefore, captures the entanglement of embodi...

Title: ‘Content to be sad’ or ‘runaway apprentice’? The psychological contract and career agency of young scientists in the entrepreneurial university
Author-Name: Alice Lam
Author-Name: André de Campos
Abstract: This article examines employee agency in psychological contracts by exploring how young scientists proactively shape their careers in response to unmet expectations induced by academic entrepreneurialism. It uses the lens of social exchange to examine their relationships with the professors engaged in two types of activities: collaborative research characterized by diffuse/reciprocal exchange, and commercial ventures, by restricted/negotiated exchange. These two categories show how career agency varies in orientation, form and behavioural outcome depending on the relational context within which their psychological contracts evolve. Those involved in collaborative research experienced a relational psychological contract and responded to unfulfilled career promises by ‘extended investment’ in their current jobs. They use ‘proxy agency’ by enlisting the support of their professors. However, some become ‘trapped’ in perennial temporary employment and are ‘content to be sad’. By contrast, those involved in res...

Title: When normative commitment leads to lower well-being and reduced performance
Author-Name: Christian Vandenberghe

Author-Name: Caroline Manville
Abstract: Normative commitment, or employees’ loyalty to their organization based on a sense of obligation, has received less attention than affective and continuance commitment. Building on recent work suggesting that normative commitment’s meaning is influenced by the within-person context provided by the other components of commitment, we theorized that normative commitment would be experienced as externally driven, hence detrimental to well-being and performance, when few alternatives commitment, a sub-component of continuance commitment, is high. Based on two independent samples (Ns = 366 and 100), Study 1 found normative commitment to be more positively related to emotional exhaustion and psychological distress at high levels of few alternatives commitment. Study 2 (N = 187) found normative commitment to be less positively related to job performance when few alternatives commitment was high. Implications of these findings for our understanding of normative commitment’s workings are highlighted.

Title: How trust functions in the context of identity work
Author-Name: Michaela Driver
Abstract: The study develops a new perspective on trust in organizations by exploring trust in the context of identity work. An analysis of stories in which employees describe how they experienced when the employer violated their trust suggests that individuals draw on trust discourse to validate who they are. Using a psychoanalytically informed framework, the study examines the complexities of trust in the context of struggles with the conscious self and unconscious desire. Trust emerges as a placeholder for what is really wanted but impossible to attain. Based on this perspective, the study offers new insights on why individuals trust, why trust may be resilient, why trust may be engineered and how trust mirrors identity as an elusive and fleeting accomplishment.

Abstract: In the present study, we rely upon an integration of proactive motivation and performance theories to investigate a neglected research question – when is proactive behavior likely to be rewarded or punished? Based upon a self-determination theory perspective of proactive motivation, we hypothesize that leader feelings of responsibility for constructive change moderate the relationship between follower proactive behavior and performance evaluation. The results of a time-lagged study support this hypothesis, indicating that follower taking charge behavior is rewarded with higher performance evaluations only when leaders feel responsible for constructive change. Following the discussion of findings, we discuss practical implications, potential limitations of the present study and directions for future research.

Title: Advancing conceptualization and measurement of psychological capital as a collective construct

Abstract: Psychological capital (PsyCap) has been conceptualized as an individual-level construct concerned with an employee’s state of positive psychological development. However, research has now started to examine PsyCap as a collective phenomenon. Although positive associations between team-level PsyCap and team-level functioning have been demonstrated empirically, there has been limited synopsis regarding the theoretical and measurement foundations of PsyCap at higher levels of analysis. This conceptual article extends collective PsyCap scholarship by applying a multilevel-multireferent framework to explore alternate conceptualizations of collective PsyCap. The framework furthers understanding of PsyCap at higher levels by exploring unique antecedents and emergent processes relating to five proposed forms of collective PsyCap. A series of testable propositions pertaining to the antecedent network of collective PsyCap are offered to guide empirical multilevel PsyCap research.

Title: Trust, reflexivity and knowledge integration: Toward a conceptual framework concerning mobile engineers
Author-Name: Anna Sankowska
Author-Name: Jonas Söderlund
Abstract: Reduced team membership intensity and flux have triggered the emergence of a new cadre of professional workers. In an increasing number of industries, mobile engineers and other types of flexible human resources contribute significantly to team processes and the integration of team members’ knowledge. Little is known about the factors influencing their knowledge integration performance. Addressing this gap by focusing on the transitional nature of their work, we introduce a conceptual framework that models the influence of trust on knowledge integration through reflexivity. Principally, we argue that social and technical reflexivity are processes that transmit the effects of trust on knowledge integration. The interaction between trust and the proposed construct of perceived value of the assignment affects reflexivity’s overall impact on knowledge integration through different constellations of social and technical reflexivity. This interaction explains the paradoxical situation that high trust levels do ...

Abstract: In four studies we examine whether and why respectfully engaging with other organizational members can augment creativity for individuals and teams. We develop and test a model in which respectful engagement among organizational members facilitates relational information processing, which in turn results in enhanced creative behaviors. We found a similar pattern across all four studies – respectful engagement is indirectly related, through relational information processing, to creative behavior at both the individual and team levels. These findings underscore the importance of respectful engagement in facilitating relational information processing and fostering creative behaviors at both the individual and team levels.

Title: Something happened: Spectres of organization/disorganization at the airport
Author-Name: Hannah Knox

Abstract: The article explores the practical accomplishment of organization at an international airport during the course of a number of ‘security alerts’ that disrupted routine ‘modes of ordering’ (Law, 1994). Airports, we suggest, invite us to re-think ‘organization’ as the partial, contingent and always-incomplete outcome of complex order(ing)s and disorder(ing)s played out across various spaces, agencies and materials. When ‘something happens’ we begin to see how spaces, agents and materials are subject to unexpected becomings: objects appear treacherous, spaces mutable, agencies ineffectual and informants unreliable. Following the work of Weick we might say that in such moments of uncertainty we are forced to reconsider our customary ways of thinking about objects, subjects and systems. We argue this thinking requires a relational understanding of organization so that we can better grasp how organizations are continuously being made and un-made through an on-going co-creation and dispersal of parts.

Abstract: Black and minority ethnic (BME) employees appear to experience more difficulty reaching senior leadership positions than do their white counterparts. Using Eagly and Carli’s metaphor of the labyrinth, our aim was to give voice to black and minority ethnic managers who have successfully achieved senior management roles, and compare their leadership journeys with those of matched white managers. This article used semi-structured interviews and attribution theory to examine how 20 black and minority ethnic and 20 white senior managers from a UK government department made sense of significant career incidents in their leadership journeys. Template analysis was used to identify facilitators and barriers of career progression from causal explanations of these incidents. Although BME and white managers identified four common themes (visibility, networks, development and line manager support), they differed in how they made sense of formal and informal organizational processes to achieve career progression.

Abstract: What does inequality mean for dysfunctional organizational behaviours, such as workplace bullying? This article argues that workplace bullying can be understood as a manifestation of intergroup dynamics originating beyond the organization. We introduce the construct of asymmetric intergroup bullying: the disproportionate mistreatment of members of low status groups, with the intended effect of enhancing the subordination of that group in society at large. Analysis of data from 38 interviews with public and private sector workers in Turkey depicts a pattern of asymmetric intergroup bullying, undertaken to achieve organizational and broader sociopolitical goals. Respondents reported bullying acts used to get rid of unwanted personnel, with the goal of avoiding severance pay, or of removing supporters of the former government from positions of political and economic influence. Bullying was also described as working towards the dominance of the sociocultural worldview of one political group over another. We d...

Title: Experimentation and decentralization in China’s labor relations
Author-Name: Eli Friedman
Author-Name: Sarosh Kuruvilla
Abstract: In this introduction to the special issue ‘Changing work, labour and employment relations in China’, we argue that China is taking an experimental and decentralized approach to the development of new labor relations frameworks. Particular political constraints in China prevent interest aggregation among workers, as the central state sees this as posing a risk to social stability. Firms and local governments have been given a degree of space to experiment with different arrangements, as long as the categorical ban on independent unions is not violated. The consequence has been an increasingly differentiated labor relations landscape, with significant variation by region and sector. We note some countervailing tendencies towards re-centralization, but emphasize that this phenomenon remains largely confined to the municipal level. The five articles in this special issue address different aspects of both experimentation and decentralization in labor relations.

Abstract: This article first provides something of an informal narrative of my own academic career and suggests just what is idiosyncratic to that narrative and what seems to me to be rather general. This is followed by a swift look at ethnography as a social practice and some of its defining features highlighting the relatively recent burgeoning of ethnographic studies in organizational research. The following sections examine what I think are exemplary ethnographic career studies and just how these ethnographic studies have changed over time. The next section notes what seems to have not changed much over the years. I conclude by revisiting some of my introductory remarks on academic careers and the always provisional character of ethnographic studies. My normative argument is that while ethnographic work has contributed a great deal to our understanding of both occupational and organizational careers – then and now – such studies are too often overlooked by current variable and measurement-driven career researchers.

Title: Explaining leadership in family firms: Reflexivity, social conditioning and institutional complexity
Author-Name: Tim Edwards

Abstract: Research on leadership in family firms has concentrated on the drivers of performance viewed in the context of reciprocal family and business logics, family or non-family CEOs operating within different family governance and administrative settings. The explanatory aim is to ascertain the optimum configuration of elements for achieving improved economic rents so the benefits of family loyalty do not negatively impact firm performance. Our thesis challenges this research, which treats family leadership as a contingent outcome of the governance and administrative contexts within which family and non-family CEOs make strategic choices. We argue that family leadership studies restrict explanations of action to a narrow bandwidth because leadership is effectively black-boxed when it is treated as an outcome of these contingent relations. To overcome this limitation we propose a nested framing of social conditioning that explains the connections between actors, organizations and multiple social orders (and not ...

We propose a number of amendments to Fehr and Schmidt’s model. We challenge some of the standard tenets of agency theory and tournament theory, demonstrating why equity considerations should be taken into account. We add to the growing literature on behavioural agency theory.

Abstract: Despite a burgeoning of research that examines work passion, the relationships between harmonious and obsessive work passion and job performance have received insufficient attention. Using data from 233 employee–supervisor dyads from multiple organizations in Russia, this study examines the mediating role of organizational identification and the moderating roles of three different types of fit perceptions on this relationship. Results indicate that organizational identification mediates the effect of harmonious work passion – but not obsessive work passion – on performance. Only two types of fit perceptions – person–organization and demands–abilities – were found to moderate the relationship between work passion and performance. Finally, the results showed that person–organization fit perceptions moderate the indirect effect (through organizational identification) of both types of work passion on performance, whereas needs–supplies fit perceptions only moderate the indirect effect of harmonious work passi...

Abstract: In this article, we build on the results of a participatory action research project in healthcare to discuss a number of methods that can strengthen the link between reflexive work and authoring in organizational contexts. We argue that, from an organizational point of view, the challenge is to devise new ways to configure (and consider) people as the authors of their work. This means assuming responsibility for, and constructively contributing to, the goals of the organizations to which they belong. Combining insights from theoretical reflection and experience from the field, the article discusses the tools, process and material conditions for fostering practical reflexivity and organizational authorship. We conclude that much is to be gained if we distinguish between authorship and authoring. Authorship is the general process whereby managers and organizational members contribute to the reproduction of organizational realities. Authoring is constituted by the special circumstances whereby authorship is ...

Abstract: DeRue and Ashford (2010) proposed a social process of leadership identity construction, asserting that leadership identity is co-constructed by way of claims and grants of leader and follower identities. In addition, these authors suggested that the collective endorsement of the broader social context might serve as a catalyst to initiate the leader identity construction process. As a result, they called for qualitative studies to further develop this idea. During archival research of James Meredith’s historic integration of the University of Mississippi, we discovered evidence to support and extend their theoretical arguments. Accordingly, we interpret the archival evidence of support and opposition of Meredith’s defiant integration to contrast the leader identity construction processes of Meredith with his contemporary antagonist, former Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett. We use this analysis to illustrate how the distinctive social context broadly recognized the key element of defiance and collectively...

Abstract: Based on interviews with students and teachers at one electronics company, we analyse the use of student interns to do regular manufacturing work in China. We argue that student workers need to be seen as a distinct category of constrained labour; part of a growing insecure workforce in China. We find that students enrolled in vocational schools are moved into internships, without their consent, to suit the needs of employers. This results in a misalignment between interns and their area of study that invalidates the basic principle of vocational education, which is to combine theory and practice within a sector or occupationally-focused education programme. Teachers in vocational schools follow their students into the factory and become ‘teacher-supervisors’, receiving a second salary for co-managing the utilization of student interns’ labour power. Thus, within such an unfree labour regime, student workers are subject to dual control in the workplace from managerial and teacher-supervisors.

Title: Who am I? Mothers’ shifting identities, loss and sensemaking after workplace exit
Author-Name: Shireen Kanji
Author-Name: Emma Cahusac
Abstract: We analyse mothers’ retrospective accounts of their transition from professional worker to stay-at-home mother using a framework that integrates sensemaking and border theory. The data come from in-depth interviews with former professional and managerial women in London. Continuing struggles to reconcile professional and maternal identities before and after workplace exit illustrate how identity change is integral to workplace exit. The concept of ‘choice’, which takes place at one point in time, obfuscates this drawn-out process. Mothers pay a high cost in lost professional identities, especially in the initial stages after workplace exit. They cope with this loss and the disjuncture of leaving employment by moving back and forth across the border between home and work – a classic action of sensemaking. Subsequent communal sensemaking and community action bolster mothers’ fragile status at home, eventually leading to reconciliation of their loss and finally enabling them to view their exit ‘choice’ as right.

Title: Trouble at the next level: Effects of differential leader–member exchange on group-level processes and justice climate
Author-Name: Anthony T Cobb
Author-Name: Rebecca S Lau
Abstract: Leaders develop different exchange relationships with their followers ranging from higher to lower quality. As these exchange relationships increase in quality a number of beneficial outcomes often accrue to both the leader and the follower when examined at the individual level of analysis. At the work unit level, however, differential leader–member exchange (LMXD) can lead to structural schisms between subordinates receiving higher- and lower-quality exchange that can interfere with productive group processes and the benefits of a favorable work climate. This article examines the incremental effects of group-level LMXD over average group levels of LMX on three group processes (co-worker communications, relationship conflict and team-member exchange) and three justice climates (interactional, procedural and distributive). Results from 87 intact teams indicate that LMXD has a sizable and negative impact on all group-level processes. LMXD also substantially decreases the strength of interactional, procedura...

Title: Re-reading masculine organization: Phallic, testicular and seminal metaphors
Author-Name: Stephen A Linstead
Author-Name: Garance Maréchal
Abstract: This article examines the metaphorical resources provided by specific parts of the male body for thinking masculinity in social and organizational contexts. The genital metaphor of the male phallus is the most familiar, being associated with a form of hegemonic masculinity identified with power and control. However, other parts of the male genitalia can and do act as root metaphors for alternative forms of masculinity. Where the phallic metaphor focuses attention on power and control, the testicular and seminal metaphors highlight aspects of masculinity that are more relational and creative and bring it closer to the feminine. Whilst in social and organizational practice these coexist, in organizational analysis the emphasis has implicitly and explicitly been on the phallic. We generate a framework of the characteristics of each metaphor identifying positive, negative and excessive/inverted modalities that they can take, especially within organizational and institutional settings. We argue that applying a...

Title: Economic inequality of the badli workers of Bangladesh: Contested entitlements and a ‘perpetually temporary’ life-world
Author-Name: Fahreen Alamgir
Author-Name: George Cairns
Abstract: This article discusses the experience of economic inequality of badli workers in the state-owned jute mills of the postcolonial state of Bangladesh, and how this inequality is constituted and perpetuated. Nominally appointed to fill posts during the temporary absence of permanent workers, the reality of badli workers’ employment is very different. They define themselves as ‘a different category of workers’, with limited economic entitlements. We undertake content analysis of the badli workers’ narratives to identify elements that they themselves consider constitute these economic entitlements. We consider their perceptions of discrimination and exclusion and explain how, in response to these feelings, they construct their survival strategy. From this, through the writings of Armatya Sen, we discuss the badli workers’ contextual experience and understanding of economic inequality in relation to extant theoretical understandings, seeking to contribute to the field and to empirical studies in the subaltern c...

Title: What is the relationship between long working hours, over-employment, under-employment and the subjective well-being of workers? Longitudinal evidence from the UK
Author-Name: David Angrave
Author-Name: Andy Charlwood
Abstract: Are long working hours, over-employment and under-employment associated with a reduction in subjective well-being? If they are, is the association long or short-lasting? This article answers these questions through within-person analysis of a nationally representative longitudinal survey from the United Kingdom. The results suggest that long working hours do not directly affect subjective well-being, but in line with theories of person–environment fit, both over-employment and under-employment are associated with lower subjective well-being. However, over-employment is more likely for those who work the longest hours. The duration of the subjective well-being penalty associated with over-employment and under-employment is typically short, but subjective well-being levels tend to remain depressed for those who remain over-employed for two years or more. Results imply that state and organizational policies that reduce the incidence of long hours working are likely to enhance aggregate well-being levels.

Title: Casting the lean spell: The promotion, dilution and erosion of lean management in the NHS
Author-Name: Leo McCann
Author-Name: John S Hassard

Author-Name: Paula J Hyde
Abstract: Lean thinking has recently re-emerged as a fashionable management philosophy, especially in public services. A prescriptive or mainstream literature suggests that lean is rapidly diffusing into public sector environments, providing a much-needed rethink of traditional ways of working and stimulating performance improvements. Our study of the introduction of lean in a large UK public sector hospital challenges this argument. Based on a three-year ethnographic study of how employees make sense of lean ‘adoption’, we describe a process in which lean ideas were initially championed, later diluted and ultimately eroded. While initially functioning as a ‘mechanism of hope’ (Brunsson, 2006) around which legitimacy could be generated for tackling longstanding work problems, over time both ‘sellers’ and ‘buyers’ of the concept mobilized lean in ambiguous ways, to the extent that the notion was rendered somewhat meaningless. Ultimately, our analysis rejects current prescriptive or managerialist discourses on lean w...

Title: What is critical appreciation? Insights from studying the critical turn in an appreciative inquiry
Author-Name: Rory J Ridley-Duff
Author-Name: Graham Duncan
Abstract: Appreciative inquiry was developed in the late 1980s as a process to encourage social innovation by involving people in discovering the ‘best of what is’. Recent research has suggested that appreciative inquiry practitioners’ focus on positivity is now inhibiting appreciative inquiry’s focus on generative theory. This article responds by asking the question ‘what is critical appreciation?’, then seeks answers by studying the critical turn in a Big Lottery Research project. By tracking the narratives of research assistants as they describe the ‘life worlds’ and ‘systems’ in their community, we clarify the recursive processes that lead to deeper levels of appreciation. We contribute to the development of critical appreciative processes that start with a critical inquiry to deconstruct experience and then engage critical appreciative processes during the remainder of the appreciative inquiry cycle to construct new experiences. The initial critical inquiry establishes which system imperatives colonize the lif...

Title: Cultural identity change in expatriates: A social network perspective
Author-Name: Jina Mao
Author-Name: Yan Shen
Abstract: We explore relational patterns of expatriates’ social networks and their impact on expatriates’ change in cultural identity while working abroad. We go beyond mono-cultural assumptions and highlight the importance of examining cross-cultural relational dynamics on maintenance and change in expatriates’ cultural identity. We argue that strong ties in dense networks are most conducive to helping expatriates stay attached to a national culture. Cultural diversity in a social network provides the impetus for cultural identity change. Cross-cultural interconnectedness within an expatriate’s social network contributes to the development of multiculturalism in one’s cultural identity. We also discuss the effect of cultural identity change on expatriation and repatriation adjustment, and provide some practical implications for individuals as well as organizations. Overall, we offer a cross-cultural social network perspective in theorizing about the expatriation experience.

Title: Unleashing angst: Negative mood, learning goal orientation, psychological empowerment and creative behaviour

Abstract: Emotion researchers have found that negative mood may either enhance or inhibit employee creativity. Little is known about this conundrum, however, and in particular when and why each effect occurs. To address this concern, we formulate and test hypotheses about likely moderators of the relationship between negative mood and creative process engagement. Results from an experience sampling study with 556 real-time reports from 68 employees support our hypothesis that negative mood is most strongly and positively related to concurrent creative process engagement among employees who (a) have high trait learning goal orientation and (b) perceive that they are empowered. Our hypotheses and findings help to resolve the ongoing controversy surrounding the nature of the negative mood–creativity nexus.

Title: Ship-shape: Materializing leadership in the British Royal Navy
Author-Name: Beverley Hawkins
Abstract: In this article, I contribute to posthumanist, actor-network influenced theories of leadership, drawing empirically on qualitative data collected at a Royal Navy shore establishment in Great Britain. I demonstrate how a fluid network of hybridized relationships between people and things affords shifting and multiple possibilities for making leadership matter. As configurations of actants evolve these affordances are altered, and the blackboxing processes hiding the material actants co-generating leadership effects are uncovered. A detailed explication of the politicized affordances within actor networks contributes to knowledge about how hybridized relationships co-enable possibilities for action that bring to life, reinforce and call into question the human-centred, gendered, colonialist web of assumptions and practices through which Royal Naval personnel understand and enact leadership.

Title: The view from inside leadership configurations
Author-Name: Peter Gronn
Abstract: In this response to Samia Chreim’s (2015) discussion, it is argued that her article makes an important contribution to recent attempts to define non-heroic approaches to leadership. The primary focus of her article is on the merger and acquisition process as experienced by five firms (an acquiring firm and four acquired business units), and a comparative analysis of transitional leadership patterns in light of explicit pre-merger undertakings given about, and consequent expectations of, subsequent leadership. These expectations were about distributed leadership. In some instances the acquired firms’ expectations were fulfilled while in others they were not. As is pointed out in this response, Chreim’s discussion is significant for the growing body of literature on distributed leadership and, by implication, for wider questions concerned with the appropriate unit of analysis in leadership. Recent scholarship is shown to have been wrestling with different ways of conceptualizing (and researching) leadership...

Abstract: This article develops theoretical understanding of the involvement of wealthy entrepreneurs in socially transformative projects by offering a foundational theory of philanthropic identity narratives. We show that these narratives are structured according to the metaphorical framework of the journey, through which actors envision and make sense of personal transformation. The journey provides a valuable metaphor for conceptualizing narrative identities in entrepreneurial careers as individuals navigate different social landscapes, illuminating identities as unfolding through a process of wayfinding in response to events, transitions and turning-points. We delineate the journey from entrepreneurship to philanthropy, and propose a typology of rewards that entrepreneurs claim to derive from giving. We add to the expanding literature on narrative identities by suggesting that philanthropic identity narratives empower wealthy entrepreneurs to generate a legacy of the self that is both self- and socially oriente...

Abstract: This article explores the conditions under which autonomy may lead to production deviance (unsanctioned, non-task-focused behavior) rather than acting as a motivational job characteristic. In a study of 260 manual laborers, we applied Conservation of Resources Theory to propose an interaction among autonomy, emotional exhaustion and employment opportunity in predicting production deviance. We suggest that employees who experience emotional exhaustion may leverage autonomy to engage in production deviance in efforts to conserve and protect remaining energy reserves, particularly when they feel they can secure ‘better’ opportunities than their current job. Results of hierarchical moderated multiple regression analyses revealed that workers reporting high levels of autonomy, emotional exhaustion and employment opportunity also manifested the highest levels of production deviance.

Abstract: In this article, we examine the implications of perceived management commitment to the ecological environment for employee attitudes and behaviors. Following deontic justice theory, which suggests that individuals are capable of feeling and expressing moral outrage when others are treated poorly, even if such treatment has no direct implications for themselves, we expected that employee attitudes and behaviors would be related to perceived organizational treatment of the environment. At the same time, we expected that these reactions would be moderated by how employees themselves were treated by the organization, in the form of perceived organizational support. In a study of employees and supervisors in a textile firm in Turkey, the results indicate that perceived organizational support moderated the effects of management commitment to the environment on organizational justice, organizational commitment and organizational citizenship behaviors targeting the environment.

Using a sample of 172 Spanish family firms that includes two respondents per firm, we test a structural model that confirms our hypotheses. Our results extend the understanding of social capital beyond family firms by exploring both family- and non-family-based social relationships in a context in which social factors are predominant.

Abstract: This article examines the career scripts held by individuals working in clusters by studying the careers seen as desirable and possible by 42 micro-nanotechnology and computer science researchers in the ‘Minalogic’ cluster, the French equivalent of Silicon Valley. We consider the links between the researchers’ career scripts and their social positions and identify six discrete career scripts that we label organizational nomad, entrepreneurial, organizational extension, cloister, escape and conversion. Central social positions in the cluster are linked with boundaryless career scripts (organizational nomad and entrepreneurial scripts), but individuals also use the resources associated with their central social positions to envisage both extending their careers and the range of tasks they undertake (organizational extension script) within their employing organizations. Others − those holding peripheral social positions − may be unable to match the cluster’s expectations, and so feel trapped in involuntary i...

Abstract: Deviations from heteronormativity affect labour market dynamics. Hierarchies of sexual orientation can result in job dismissals, wage discrimination and the failure to promote gay and lesbian individuals to top ranks. In this article, I report on a field experiment (144 job-seekers and their correspondence with 5549 firms) that tested the extent to which sexual orientation affects the labour market outcomes of gay and lesbian job-seekers in the United Kingdom. Their minority sexual orientations, as indicated by job-seekers’ participation in gay and lesbian university student unions, negatively affected their workplace prospects. The probability of gay or lesbian applicants receiving an invitation for an interview was 5.0 percent (5.1%) lower than that for heterosexual male or female applicants. In addition, gay men and lesbians received invitations for interviews by firms that paid salaries that were 1.9 percent (1.2%) lower than those paid by firms that invited heterosexual male or female applicants for ...

Title: Proposing a culture-centered approach to career scholarship: The example of subsistence careers in the US Arctic
Author-Name: Rahul Mitra
Abstract: In this article, I draw from the culture-centered approach to explore contemporary negotiations of career and work, positing career as a form of cultural practice. Rooted in postcolonial theory and subaltern studies, the culture-centered approach examines the active accomplishment of culture through everyday communicative practices, amidst the structural conditions that frame lived experiences, and focusing specifically on marginalized groups. I first trace how culture is conceptualized in extant career studies, in the psychological, sociological and communicative streams. Identifying both key gaps and paradoxes in the literature, I outline the culture-centered approach, suggesting four key principles to reconceive career as cultural practice. Specifically: career draws on both structure and action; career agency is hybridized across individuals/collectives; career agency is layered and contested; and career is both discursive and material. The framework is illustrated using an example from an ongoing stu...

Title: Narrative identity construction in times of career change: Taking note of unconscious desires
Author-Name: Patrizia Hoyer
Author-Name: Chris Steyaert
Abstract: Working at the intersection of narrative and psychoanalytic theory, we present in this article an affective conceptualization of identity dynamics during times of career change, incorporating the notion of unconscious desires. We propose that frictions in career change narratives, such as the paradoxical co-existence of coherence and ambiguity, allude to unconscious subtexts that can become ‘readable’ in the narrative when applying a psychoanalytic framework. We point to the analysis of 30 life story interviews with former management consultants who report upon a past and/or anticipated career change for illustration. By linking three empirically derived narrative strategies for combining coherence and ambiguity (ignoring the change, admitting the ambiguity and depicting a wishful future) with three conceptually informed psychoanalytic ego-defenses (denial, rationalization and sublimation), we provide an analytic framework that helps to explain why workers in transition may try to preserve both coherence ...

Author-Name: Caroline A Clarke

Abstract: This article reflects upon careering, securing identities and ethical subjectivities in academia in the context of audit, accountability and control surrounding new managerialism in UK Business Schools. Drawing upon empirical research, we illustrate how rather than resisting an ever-proliferating array of governmental technologies of power, academics chase the illusive sense of a secure self through ‘careering’; a frantic and frenetic individualistic strategy designed to moderate the pressures of excessive managerial competitive demands. Emerging from our data was an increased portrayal of academics as subjected to technologies of power and self, simultaneously being objects of an organizational gaze through normalizing judgements, hierarchical observations and examinations. Still, this was not a monolithic response, as there were those who expressed considerable disquiet as well as a minority who reported ways to seek out a more embodied engagement with their work. In analysing the careerism and preoccup...

Author-Name: Dana Unger

Abstract: This two-wave panel study investigates the associations between working time, selective optimization with compensation in private life and relationship outcomes (i.e. relationship satisfaction and self-disclosure) in dual-career couples. We propose that one partner’s selective optimization with compensation in private life either mediates or moderates the association of this partner’s working time and relationship outcomes (i.e. relationship satisfaction and self-disclosure). Moreover, we postulate the crossover (i.e. transmission) of relationship satisfaction and self-disclosure within the couple. To test these hypotheses, we conducted an online study with a time lag of six months, in which 285 dual-career couples took part. We found evidence for selective optimization with compensation in private life as a mediator: working time spent by partners in dual-career couples was associated with selective optimization with compensation in their private life that, in turn, predicted relationship satisfaction an...

Title: Shadows and light: Diversity management as phantasmagoria
Author-Name: Christina Schwabenland
Author-Name: Frances Tomlinson
Abstract: Within the field of critical diversity studies increasing reference is made to the need for more critically informed research into the practice and implementation of diversity management. This article draws on an action research project that involved diversity practitioners from within the UK voluntary sector. In their accounts of resistance, reluctance and a lack of effective organizational engagement, participants shared a perception of diversity management as something difficult to concretize and envisage; and as something that organizational members associated with fear and anxiety; and with an inability to act. We draw on the metaphor of the phantasmagoria as a means to investigate this representation. We conclude with some tentative suggestions for alternative ways of doing diversity.

Title: Pay dispersion and organizational innovation: The mediation effects of employee participation and voluntary turnover
Author-Name: Taiyuan Wang
Author-Name: Bin Zhao
Author-Name: Stewart Thornhill
Abstract: Building on social comparison theory, we posit that a firm’s pay dispersion affects its innovation through employee participation and voluntary turnover. By analyzing data collected at both employee and organizational levels from 1419 firms, we found that pay dispersion had an inverted U-shaped effect on employee participation, which in turn enhanced innovation. Pay dispersion had a positive effect on voluntary turnover, which in turn impaired innovation. These findings contribute to research on economic inequity by revealing the mediation mechanisms of employee participation and voluntary turnover in the relationship between pay dispersion and organizational innovation.

Title: The moral work of subversion
Author-Name: Peter N Bloom
Author-Name: Paul J White
Abstract: This article critically reconsiders dominant understandings of morality and subversion within organizations. Existing organizational literature does not adequately address the important productive role of morality for producing and justifying everyday subversive practices as well as the use of subversion to legitimate power relations and dominant values. Drawing upon interactionist insights, we develop a practice-based account of morality, highlighting the means through which subversion retroactively legitimates the diverse range of actions performed by organizational subjects. This form of retrospective reasoning, which we term ‘moralization’, serves as an important resource for subjects to actively negotiate the often competing moral and practical demands placed on them as organizational subjects. Consequently, we position subversion as an important means of accomplishing, legitimating and preserving a given organizational order, rather than a ‘common sense’ view that subversion necessarily subverts org...

Title: Unfreezing change as three steps: Rethinking Kurt Lewin’s legacy for change management
Author-Name: Stephen Cummings
Author-Name: Todd Bridgman
Author-Name: Kenneth G Brown
Abstract: Kurt Lewin’s ‘changing as three steps’ (unfreezing → changing → refreezing) is regarded by many as the classic or fundamental approach to managing change. Lewin has been criticized by scholars for over-simplifying the change process and has been defended by others against such charges. However, what has remained unquestioned is the model’s foundational significance. It is sometimes traced (if it is traced at all) to the first article ever published in Human Relations. Based on a comparison of what Lewin wrote about changing as three steps with how this is presented in later works, we argue that he never developed such a model and it took form after his death. We investigate how and why ‘changing as three steps’ came to be understood as the foundation of the fledgling subfield of change management and to influence change theory and practice to this day, and how questioning this supposed foundation can encourage innovation.

Title: What motivates entrepreneurial entry under economic inequality? The role of human and financial capital

Abstract: Based on a multilevel analysis of nearly 120,000 observations across 31 countries between 2001 and 2008, we provide novel insights into the moderating effects that economic inequality may have on the distinct roles that human and financial capital play on different types of entrepreneurship. As inequality increases, both forms of capital become weaker deterrents of entry into necessity entrepreneurship, whereas for opportunity entrepreneurship, only financial capital becomes a stronger predictor of entry. We also show that, regardless of inequality levels, both human and financial capital exhibit decreasing marginal returns on the likelihood of entry into necessity entrepreneurship, and that in the case of opportunity entrepreneurship, financial capital exhibits increasing marginal returns. However, inequality does impact the magnitude of marginal returns. Additionally, our statistical analysis provides quantitative support to extant literature arguing that higher levels of economic inequality foster both...

Abstract: This exploratory study examines legitimacy challenges to business spawned by growing inequalities. It uses aesthetic inquiry in the context of the Occupy Wall Street movement to understand the processes of organizational legitimation and delegitimation. By studying photos of slogans and placards from the Occupy Wall Street movement, we show how corporate and business legitimacy are challenged by the public. We identify different types of legitimacy challenges across organizational systems’ levels. We explore implications of these challenges for corporations and the use of aesthetic strategies as delegitimation signals by Occupy Wall Street protesters in order to express their support or discontent with existing norms, values and standards.

Abstract: This article draws attention to reported experiences of boredom in knowledge work. Drawing on extensive qualitative data gathered at two management consultancy firms, we analyze these experiences as a particular interaction with identity regulation and work experiences. We conceptualize the reports of the bored self as a combination of unfilled aspirations and the sense of stagnation, leading to an arrested identity. Our contribution is to expand extant conceptualizations of employee interactions with identity regulation, in particular relating to identity work and identification. The findings provide a critical rendering of the glamourized image of knowledge work.

Title: Beyond choice: ‘Thick’ volunteering and the case of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution
Author-Name: Michelle O’Toole
Author-Name: Chris Grey
Abstract: This article problematizes the dominant assumption in the literature on volunteer work that it is undertaken primarily as a matter of individual choice. Using findings from a qualitative study of volunteers at the not-for-profit organization, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, it is shown that volunteering exists within a dense web of social relations, especially familial and communal relations, so that volunteering is recursively constituted by structure and agency. The concept of ‘thick volunteering’ is developed to denote how in some cases these social relations, especially when the work involved is dangerous, may make volunteering especially significant.

Abstract: This article examines the impact of large scale, ‘macro’ role transitions on professional identity. Drawing on in-depth interviews with two different groups of immigrant professionals, it theorizes how organizational outsiders with established professional identities respond to the institutional requirements and specifically to professional pre-entry scripts in their new host country. The study demonstrates how identity work evolves among each group as they navigate the permeable and impermeable pre-entry scripts in their respective professions. It identifies both barriers and facilitators to engagement with, and fulfillment of, local pre-entry scripts. These findings demonstrate how different professional domains and power structures create different opportunities for re-entry and as a result give rise to different forms of identity work – involving, for example, identity customization, identity shadowing, struggle and enrichment. Implications for policy makers in the field will be discussed, focusing on...

Title: Challenge and hindrance stressors and wellbeing-based work–nonwork interference: A diary study of portfolio workers
Author-Name: Stephen J Wood
Author-Name: George Michaelides
Abstract: Stress-based work–nonwork interference, or negative spillover, is associated with transference of negative emotions from the work to the nonwork domain. It is argued that work–nonwork interference resulting from high work demands does not necessarily entail the reproduction of any affective states. First, calmness can result in lower work–nonwork interference and enthusiasm in higher levels. Second, hindrance stressors can be negatively related to enthusiasm and calmness, while challenge stressors are positively associated with them. Hypotheses about the relationship between stressors and interference that reflect this rationality are developed and tested using longitudinal data from a six-month diary study of portfolio workers. The results offer some support for them and indicate that both challenge and hindrance stressors are positively related to interference. However, for hindrance stressors the indirect effect is positive when mediated by calmness and negative for enthusiasm. In contrast, for challen...

Title: Modelling job crafting behaviours: Implications for work engagement
Author-Name: Arnold B Bakker
Author-Name: Alfredo Rodríguez-Muñoz
Author-Name: Ana Isabel Sanz Vergel
Abstract: In this study among 206 employees (103 dyads), we followed the job demands–resources approach of job crafting to investigate whether proactively changing one’s work environment influences employee’s (actor’s) own and colleague’s (partner’s) work engagement. Using social cognitive theory, we hypothesized that employees would imitate each other’s job crafting behaviours, and therefore influence each other’s work engagement. Results showed that the crafting of social and structural job resources and the crafting of challenge job demands was positively related to own work engagement, whereas decreasing hindrance job demands was unrelated to own engagement. As predicted, results showed a reciprocal relationship between dyad members’ job crafting behaviours – each of the actor’s job crafting behaviours was positively related to the partner’s job crafting behaviours. Finally, employee’s job crafting was related to colleague’s work engagement through colleague’s job crafting, suggesting a modelling process.

Title: A relational, transformative and engaged approach to sustainable supply chain management: The potential of action research
Author-Name: Anne Touboulic
Author-Name: Helen Walker
Abstract: This article describes how action research can advance sustainable supply chain management research. Most sustainable supply chain management research is empirical and little attention has been paid to reflecting upon how research is conducted in the field. Current research fails to make links with ideas of relationality, change and engagement proposed in broader sustainability research. We propose to address this gap by discussing how action research could help address current challenges in sustainable supply chain management. The article explores the proponents and application of action research as a relevant methodology for knowledge development in the field, based upon a critical analysis of sustainable supply chain management and action research, including a review of previous action research studies and insights from a research project in which action research was applied. Particular emphasis is put on exploring the links between the sustainability dimension of sustainable supply chain management an...

Title: Looking intra-organizationally for identity cues: Whether perceived organizational support shapes employees’ organizational identification

Abstract: We propose that employees’ perceptions of intra-organizational cues are an important factor influencing their identification with their organizations. Building on self-categorization theory, we examine whether perceived organizational support influences organizational identification. We contend that in addition to the mediating effect of affective commitment, organizational identification also mediates the effect of perceived organizational support on employees’ extra-role behavior. We collect perceptions of perceived organizational support, organizational identification and extra-role behavior information from 363 nurses in China using a three-wave data collection method and find empirical evidence to support most of our hypotheses. We find that collectivism moderates the indirect effect of perceived organizational support on extra-role behavior through organizational identification. We discuss the implications of our findings.

Title: Critical Essay: Reconsidering critical performativity

Abstract: In recent years, we have witnessed the emergence of ‘critical performativity’, a concept designed to debate relationships between theory and practice and encourage practical interventions in organizational life. Notwithstanding its laudable ambition to stimulate discussion about engagement between critical management studies researchers and practitioners, we are concerned that critical performativity theory is flawed as it misreads foundational performativity authors, such as Austin and Butler, in ways that nullify their political potential, and ignores a range of other influential theories of performativity. It also overlooks the materiality of performativity. We review these limitations and then use three illustrations to sketch out a possible alternative conceptualization of performativity. This alternative approach, which builds on Butler’s and Callon’s work on performativity, recognizes that performativity is about the constitution of subjects, is an inherently material and discursive construct, and ...

Abstract: In this article, I argue for ‘bringing inequality back in’ to organizational research in order to investigate the role of management and organizational practices in macro-level economic inequality. To set an agenda in this area, I suggest considering three loci where the links between organizations and inequality may be observed: the organizational locus comprising the producer/employee, investor and consumer dimensions; the inter-organizational locus to help disentangle issues related to the distribution of economic rewards across value chains, large financial versus non-financial organizations, and across occupations and organizations in general; and socio-political system as a locus where issues related to social change, political influence and the institutional system may be unpacked. In addition, I suggest considering the link between organizations and inequality from other important vantage points: elites, demographics, global inequality and debt. I also briefly highlight issues related to data and ...

Abstract: Research in a number of disciplines has shown that high levels of economic inequality adversely affect individuals and societies. Surprisingly, research examining the business consequences of societal level economic inequality is virtually nonexistent. In this article, I present a framework to study how economic inequality affects organizational performance. I suggest that economic inequality indirectly affects organizational performance via human development in the society, and directly via its effects on individual employees and their workplace interactions, as well as via the institutions in which the organizations are embedded. Further, I present a brief research agenda that seeks to illuminate the relationship between economic inequality and management and conclude with an overview of this special issue.

Author-Name: David M Boje

Abstract: This research extends our understanding of organizational sensemaking through storytelling to highlight complex processes of organizational change in space, time and strategic context. We focus on the concept of antenarratives, how managers’ and other stakeholders’ fragmented speculations regarding futures may legitimate or resist organizational change. Antenarratives are not yet fully-formed narratives, but rather pieces of organizational discourse that help to construct identities and interests. We explain the theoretical relevance of Russian socio-linguist Mikhail Bakhtin’s space and time conceptualizations (chronotopes) for strategic narratives of change, and illustrate how antenarratives play important roles in narrative chronotopes. We relate German philosopher Martin Heidegger’s reasons for being in relation to others (existential ontology) to stakeholders’ and organizational identities, and to antenarrative glimpses in Bakhtin’s chronotopes. Through these theorizations, we contribute to conversati...

Abstract: This article explores the idea of unlearning on the basis of empirical data drawn from 73 social workers’ accounts of addressing their problems and challenges in critical action learning sets. To address intractable or wicked problems, characterized by having multiple stakeholders with competing perspectives and by an absence of obvious solution, it may be necessary first to unlearn existing responses and to ask fresh questions to illuminate what is as yet unknown. Action learning privileges questions over solutions in seeking learning from action on organizational challenges, whilst critical action learning is a variety that employs insights from critical social theory to promote critical reflection and unlearning in this process. The article breaks new ground in claiming: first, that unlearning in the context of the wicked problems of social work is characterized less by the discarding of outmoded knowledge and routines and more by a critical unlearning that opens up new possibilities of not knowing and...

Abstract: This article addresses the question: why does disorder tend to simultaneously accompany efforts to create order when organizing? Adopting a communication-centered perspective, we specifically examine the role of texts in the mutual constitution of order and disorder. Drawing on empirical material from three qualitative case studies on project organizing, we show that attempts of ordering through language use and texts (i.e. by closing and fixing meaning) tend to induce disordering (i.e. by opening the possibility of multiple meanings), at the same time. As we contend, these (dis)ordering dynamics play a key role in the communicative constitution of organization, keeping them in motion by calling forth continuous processes of meaning (re-)negotiation.

Title: Organization at the margins: Subaltern resistance of Singur
Author-Name: Mahuya Pal
Abstract: Based on fieldwork and subaltern studies as a theoretical framework, this article engages organizational discourses of farmers in Singur, India. Opposing their land grab by the state for a corporate project, the farmers join the global struggle against land acquisition by subaltern communities, a prominent feature of the neoliberal economy. My conversations with the farmers reveal that discourses of violence and non-violence informed their organization of struggle. Further, their organization of resistance emerges as a self-organization, demonstrates the interplay of agency and structure, and follows an ethico-political ideology to challenge the imperial power produced by state-corporate nexus. In particular, cultural value frames of ahimsa (non-violence) and dharma (moral) guide their organizational principles centered on ethical considerations, justice and human dignity. This research brings forth the counter-hegemonic potential of the Singur resistance and suggests its possibilities to contribute to th...

Title: Recognition and the moral taint of sexuality: Threat, masculinity and Santa Claus
Author-Name: Philip Hancock
Abstract: This article explores the ways in which a desire for recognition characterizes the work of a particular category of service worker, the semi-professional Santa Claus performer. Employing a series of observations and in-depth, semi-structured interviews, it considers ways in which such work is underpinned by a struggle for recognition based on an exchange of love and social esteem that is immanent to the perceived reality of the performance of the character himself. The discussion focuses on the risk posed to the possibility of this relationship by the attribution to these performers of a tainted identity, one premised on the combination of a debased version of male sexuality and an increasingly prevalent cultural unease surrounding the relationship between children and adults. It concludes by arguing for a broader reconsideration of the concept of taint – particularly moral taint – as a far more fluid and contingent concept than has traditionally been deployed, as well as the value of engaging with the im...

Abstract: We use interviews and a focus group with leaders of a sample of nonprofit professional and trade membership associations based in the United States to understand what the leaders recognize to be their membership association’s diversity challenges and initiatives. We identify incentives, identity and power challenges as fundamental influences on the diversity of potential and existing members. Our analysis reveals a paradox in which attempts to increase the association’s inclusiveness are met with countervailing desires to maintain the membership association’s exclusiveness. We find that leaders may attempt to manage the paradox through strategies that legitimize diversity initiatives, change the membership association’s identity to reflect the valuing of diversity, and take advantage of organizational structures to embed diversity-related practices and accountability. These strategies have been discussed in the diversity management literature but without our paradox perspective. Additionally, paradox lite...

Study 1 developed a measure for leisure crafting and provided evidence for its reliability and validity. In study 2, we followed 80 employees over the course of three weeks. We hypothesized that weekly leisure crafting would be more likely during weeks of high job strain (i.e. high quantitative job demands and low job autonomy) combined with sufficient autonomy at home, and during weeks of high activity at home (i.e. high quantitative home demands and high home autonomy). Furthermore, we predicted that weekly leisure crafting would relate positively to weekly satisfaction of basic human needs. Results indicated that leisure crafting was pronounced during weeks with high job strain combined with high home autonomy. However, an active home condition (i.e. high home demands and high home autonomy) was unrelated to lei...

Title: Rethinking the soft skills deficit blame game: Employers, skills withdrawal and the reporting of soft skills gaps
Author-Name: Scott A Hurrell
Abstract: Soft (e.g. interpersonal and social) skills are receiving ever more attention with employers frequently reporting that employees lack these skills. The ‘blame game’ for these skills deficits is frequently directed at the individual, family or government. Scant attention has been paid to the possibility that people may possess soft skills but decide to withdraw them because of disaffection with their employer. Taking a critical perspective and drawing on three case study establishments, this article finds that some managers blamed soft skills gaps on skills withdrawal. The employee data did not, however, reveal greater employee disaffection in the establishment worst affected by soft skills gaps. Investigation of withdrawal instead revealed more about employees who had left the organizations and the propensity for employers to blame employees for soft skills gaps. The study also affirmed that organizations may be to blame for their soft skills gaps if they do not contextually integrate selection, induction...

Title: Introductory note
Author-Name: Paul K Edwards
Abstract: The topic of this special issue is an important and timely one, as all the articles explain. It is also a particularly challenging one for scholars: just how we turn the injunction to connect organizations to inequality into a meaningful research programme is harder than might seem. I am thus particularly grateful to the special issue editors for defining an agenda and producing a set of articles that addresses it. Given that the agenda is challenging, the format of the special issue is slightly unusual. We have the usual five articles on specific topics. Framing them are essays by each of the special issue editors that explain and address different aspects of the wider scholarly challenges of the agenda. Hari Bapuji synthesizes a mass of research that explores the links running from inequality to organizations; he also indicates the contributions of each of the articles. Suhaib Riaz looks at how organizations themselves generate inequality and the intersections between dimensions of inequality and the me...

Title: The cultural grammar of governance: The UK Code of Corporate Governance, reflexivity, and the limits of ‘soft’ regulation
Author-Name: Jeroen Veldman
Author-Name: Hugh Willmott
Abstract: We identify limits of ‘reflexive governance’ by examining the UK Code of Corporate Governance that is celebrated for its ‘reflexivity’. By placing the historical genesis of the Code within its politico-economic context, it is shown how its scope and penetration is impeded by a shallow, ‘single loop’ of reflexivity. Legitimized by agency theory, the Code is infused by a ‘cultural grammar’ that perpetuates relations of shareholder primacy as it restricts accountability to narrow forms of information disclosure directed exclusively at shareholders. Engagement of a deeper, ‘double loop’ reflexivity allows account to be taken of the historical conditions and theoretical conceptions that shape practices and outcomes of corporate governance. Only then is it possible to disclose, challenge and reform narrow conceptions, boundaries and workings of ‘reflexive governance’.

Title: The social potency of affect: Identification and power in the immanent structuring of practice
Author-Name: Mark Thompson
Author-Name: Hugh Willmott
Abstract: We address the centrality of affect in structuring social practices, including those of organizing and managing. Social practices, it is argued, are contingent upon actors’ affectively charged involvement in immanent, yet indeterminate social relations. To understand this generative involvement, we commend a temporally-sensitive, critically-oriented theoretical framework, grounded in an affect-based ontology of practice. We demonstrate the relevance and credibility of this proposal through an analysis of the interactions of Board members in a UK consulting company.

Title: Symmetrical and asymmetrical outcomes of leader anger expression: A qualitative study of army personnel
Author-Name: Dirk Lindebaum
Author-Name: Peter J Jordan
Author-Name: Lucy Morris
Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the utility of anger at work, suggesting that anger can have positive outcomes. Using the Dual Threshold Model, we assess the positive and negative consequences of anger expressions at work and focus on the conditions under which expressions of anger crossing the impropriety threshold are perceived as productive or counterproductive by observers or targets of that anger. To explore this phenomenon, we conducted a phenomenological study (n = 20) to probe the lived experiences of followers (as observers and targets) associated with anger expressions by military leaders. The nature of task (e.g. the display rules prescribed for combat situations) emerged as one condition under which the crossing of the impropriety threshold leads to positive outcomes of anger expressions. Our data reveal tensions between emotional display rules and emotional display norms in the military, thereby fostering paradoxical attitudes toward anger expression and its consequences among followers.

Title: Rethinking the benefits and pitfalls of leader–member exchange: A reciprocity versus self-protection perspective
Author-Name: Jeremy B Bernerth
Author-Name: H Jack Walker
Author-Name: Stanley G Harris
Abstract: Existing literature assumes employees sharing high-quality relationships with supervisors hold advantageous positions over their peers under the leader–member exchange model. We propose environmental conditions limit the generalizability of this logic. Our framework is based on the idea that certain environments threaten the cycle of resource exchange and reciprocity, a foundational assumption in existing leader–member exchange models. To demonstrate this effect, we integrate social exchange and self-regulation theories to define four generalized environmental conditions we label appetitive alignment, appetitive misalignment, aversive misalignment and aversive alignment. We discuss accompanying propositions including both theoretical and practical implications of a contextualized leader-member exchange model to help future researchers anticipate when the benefits associated with high-quality leader–member relations and the pitfalls of low-quality relationships are attenuated by the environment.

Title: Making the absent subject present in organizational research
Author-Name: Michaela Driver
Abstract: This study explores how researchers engage with research subjects. Specifically, it examines the struggle to account for the lived experience of subjects under study while producing knowledge about and for them. Drawing on psychoanalytic, specifically Lacanian, theorizing, the study suggests that such struggles are even more complex when real subjects are absent and impossible to account for. It advances the idea that by articulating the research subject through four different discourses, researchers may take different positions toward this absence. In the first, researchers produce research subjects and put them to work. In the second, subjects are subsumed through systematic knowledge production. In the third, the subject serves the production of knowledge as a function of the split subject’s enjoyment. In the fourth discourse the researcher becomes the object of desire so as to empower subjects in their becoming. It is suggested that each discourse allows researchers to take a different stance toward t...

Abstract: Higher education has been subject to substantial reforms as new forms of performance management are implemented in universities across the world. Extant research suggests that in many cases performance management systems have disrupted academic life. We complement this literature with an extensive mixed methods study of how the performance management system is understood by academics across universities and departments in Finland at a time when new management principles and practices are being forcefully introduced. While our survey results enabled us to map the generally critical and negative view that Finnish scholars have of performance management, the qualitative inquiry allowed us to disentangle how and why our respondents resent the ways and means of measuring their work, the assumptions that underlie the measurement, and the university ideal on which the performance management system is rooted. Most significantly, we highlight how the proliferation of performance management can be seen as a catalys...

Title: The labour market for jazz musicians in Paris and London: Formal regulation and informal norms
Author-Name: Charles Umney
Abstract: This article examines the normative expectations freelance jazz musicians have about the material conditions of live performance work, taking London and Paris as case studies. It shows how price norms constitute an important reference point for individual workers in navigating the labour market. However, only rarely do they take ‘stronger’ form as a collective demand. Two further arguments are made: first, that the strength of norms varies very widely across labour markets, being much stronger on jobs where other qualitative attractions (such as the scope for creative autonomy) are weak. Second, in the Paris case, an ostensibly solidaristic social insurance mechanism (the Intermittence du Spectacle system) had the seemingly paradoxical effect of further weakening social norms around working conditions. Workers’ individual efforts to meet the system’s eligibility criteria often disrupted the emergence of collective expectations around pricing, and in some cases the existence of formal regulation itself was...

Abstract: Although substantial knowledge regarding the antecedents and outcomes of leader–member exchange (LMX) differentiation has been accumulated, numerous questions related to this topic remain underexplored. To enhance the understanding of LMX differentiation and team-focused outcomes, this study proposed that LMX differentiation has a curvilinear relationship with team creativity and that team LMX quality (represented by the LMX median in this study) moderates the association between these two variables. An investigation based on 59 teams from multiple Chinese companies was conducted. The results indicated that LMX differentiation has an inverted U-shaped relationship with team creativity, and LMX median moderates the inverted U-shaped relationship. Specifically, for teams with a low LMX median, the curvilinear relationship is stronger, whereas for teams with a high LMX median, the slope of the curve becomes nearly flat, thus losing the inverted-U effect. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed, ...

Author-Name: David R Hekman

Author-Name: Michael G Pratt
Abstract: We suggest that organizational and professional identification are two sources of motivation that can be channeled in similar or different directions based on perceived organizational and professional regulatory focus. Specifically, we hypothesize and find that both types of identification-based motivation are channeled toward diagnosis behaviors when professionals think their coworkers and colleagues value a promotion focus, and they are channeled toward treatment behaviors when professionals think their coworkers and colleagues value a prevention focus. Our results advance research on social identification by helping to explain how and when organizational and professional identification influence work performance, and also advance the organizational literature on professions by introducing diagnosis and treatment as two theory-derived types of in-role performance for professional employees.

Abstract: This article argues that recent calls in this journal and elsewhere for Critical Management Studies scholars to embrace rather than reject performativity presents an overly optimistic view of (a) the power of language to achieve emancipatory organizational change and (b) the capability of lone Critical Management Studies researchers to resignify management discourses. We introduce the notion of failed performatives to extend this argument and discuss its implications for critical inquiry. If Critical Management Studies seeks to make a practical difference in business and society, and realize its ideals of emancipation, we suggest alternative methods of impact must be explored.

Title: Liminal roles as a source of creative agency in management: The case of knowledge-sharing communities
Author-Name: Jacky Swan
Author-Name: Harry Scarbrough
Author-Name: Monique Ziebro
Abstract: Studies suggest that the experience of liminality – of being in an ambiguous, ‘betwixt and between’ position – has creative potential for organizations. We contribute to theory on the link between liminality and creative agency through a study of the coordinators of ‘knowledge-sharing communities’; one of the latest examples of a ‘neo-bureaucratic’ practice that seeks to elicit innovative responses from employees while intensifying control by the organization. Through a role-centred perspective, our study found that both the structural and interpretive aspects of coordinators’ role enactments promoted a degree of creative agency. ‘Front-stage’ and ‘back-stage’ activities were developed to meet the divergent expectations posed by senior management and community members, and the ambiguity of their roles prompted an array of different role interpretations. Our findings contribute to theory by showing how the link between liminality and creative agency is not confined to roles and spaces (consultancy work, pr...

Title: Critical Essay: Building new management theories on sound data? The case of neuroscience
Author-Name: Dirk Lindebaum
Abstract: In this critical essay, I contend that accelerating demands for novel theories in management studies imply that new methodologies and data are sometimes accepted prematurely as supply of these novel theories. This point is illustrated with reference to how neuroscience can inform management research. I propose two demand forces that foster the increased focus on neuroscience in management studies, these being (i) the direction of public research funding, and (ii) publication bias as a boost for journal impact factor. Looking at the supply side, I note that (i) the statistical power of studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (or fMRI, the ‘gold’ standard) is unacceptably low, (ii) the use of imprecise ‘motherhood’ statements, and (iii) the dismissal of ethical concerns in the formulation of management theories and practice informed by neuroscience. I then briefly outline the bad consequences of this for management theory and practice, emphasize why it is important to prevent these consequences,...

Title: When the ‘unorganizable’ organize: The collective mobilization of migrant domestic workers in London
Author-Name: Zhe Jiang
Author-Name: Marek Korczynski
Abstract: The collective mobilization of migrant workers is an important issue for analysis. Three key barriers to the mobilization of migrant workers have been identified – employment conditions, which tend to prevent migrant workers coming together; the framings held by migrant workers, which marginalize an understanding of their position as that of exploited workers; and the issue of the sustainability of any mobilization. The article examines migrant domestic workers as a case in which collective mobilization appears highly unlikely. The article uses the social movement approach as a meta-theoretical framing to explore the collective mobilization of migrant domestic workers in London. As such, it analyses how the ‘unorganizable’ organize. We show that mobilization changed the framing of migrant domestic workers from ‘labourers of love’ to workers with rights. It was able to do this because it addressed the three barriers to mobilization: by creating a space for the development of communities of coping among mig...

Title: How does customer affiliative behaviour shape the outcomes of employee emotion regulation? A daily diary study of supermarket checkout operators
Author-Name: David Holman
Abstract: Few studies have examined how customer behaviour shapes the outcomes of employees’ emotion regulation. Drawing on existing literature, this article tests two alternative models of customer affiliative behaviour (e.g. smiling, engaging in short conversation), employee emotion regulation (surface acting, deep acting) and employee outcomes (emotional exhaustion, objective task performance). In one model, customer affiliative behaviour is a mechanism that mediates the relationship between employee emotion regulation and outcomes, and in the other model customer affiliative behaviour moderates this relationship. The models were tested on data drawn from a daily diary study of 49 supermarket checkout operators and store performance records. The findings from multilevel analyses make a significant contribution to understanding how a key part of the social context during service interactions (i.e. customer affiliative behaviour) is a mechanism and moderator of employee emotion regulation. Results show that the ef...

Abstract: Is work-related smartphone use during off-job time associated with lower conflict owing to the blurring of the boundaries between work and family life? Or does it help employees juggling work and family demands? The present four-day quantitative diary study (N = 71 employees, N = 265–280 data points) aims to shed light on the relationship between daily work-related smartphone use during off-job time, and daily work–family conflict and daily family role performance, respectively. Moreover, individuals’ general segmentation preference is investigated as a potential cross-level moderator in the relationships between daily work-related smartphone use during off-job time and both work–family conflict and family role performance. Overall, the results of multilevel modelling support our mediated moderation model indicating that for integrators more frequent work-related smartphone use during off-job time is associated with better family role performance through reduced work–family conflict.

Abstract: Organizational changes are costly ventures that too often fail to deliver the expected outcomes. Psychological empowerment and affective commitment to change are proposed as especially important in turbulent contexts characterized by multiple and ongoing changes requiring employees’ continuing contributions. In such a context, employees’ beliefs that the changes are necessary, legitimate and will be supported, are presumed to increase psychological empowerment and affective commitment to change. In a three-wave longitudinal panel study of 819 employees, we examined autoregressive and cross-lagged relations among latent constructs reflecting change-related beliefs (necessity, legitimacy, support) and psychological reactions (psychological empowerment, affective commitment to change). Our findings suggest that psychological empowerment and affective commitment to change represent largely orthogonal reactions, that psychological empowerment is influenced more by beliefs regarding support, whereas affective c...

Title: ‘What happens when you intuit?’: Understanding human resource practitioners’ subjective experience of intuition through a novel linguistic method
Author-Name: Eugene Sadler-Smith
Abstract: The objective of this research was to understand the phenomenon of intuition from the perspective of the intuitor. Against a background of a steadily growing interest in intuition in managerial decision research, and inclining towards a phenomenological stance, the research used a novel linguistic method based on ‘de-nominalization’ to access participants’ (124 human resource practitioners) experiences of intuition. Based on an analysis of responses to the question ‘What happens when you intuit?’, the article: defines intuition based on participants’ subjective experiences; reveals the subjective experience of intuition as comprising three phases − ‘intuiting’, ‘intuition’ and ‘implementing’; uncovers two aspects of intuitive affect − ‘bodily awareness’ and ‘cognitive awareness’; and establishes that participants use primary metaphors to articulate their experiences of intuition. The article outlines the theoretical implications and practical relevance of these findings, and makes suggestions for further ...

Title: Institutional fields as linked arenas: Inter-field resource dependence, institutional work and institutional change
Author-Name: Santi Furnari
Abstract: Theories of institutional change have paid limited attention to the ways in which relations between institutional fields might facilitate or hinder institutional change. I introduce inter-field resource dependence as an important condition explaining institutional change between fields. Building on resource dependence theory, I conceptualize two dimensions of inter-field resource dependence: mutual dependence and power imbalance. I argue that these two dimensions have opposite effects on the likelihood of institutional change between fields. Mutual dependence between two fields increases the chances of institutional change by inducing actors in both the fields to work at creating new shared institutions in order to regulate their mutual dependence. Power imbalance between two fields decreases the chances of institutional change by inducing actors in the dominant field to work at maintaining existing institutions in order to preserve their power. Thus, different types of inter-field resource dependence mot...

At the same time, we largely disagree on how critical scholars could support effective, progressive changes. In this rejoinder, we respond to but also absorb Cabantous et al.’s critique of progressive performativity and sketch three ways of how to advance discussions of Critical Management Studies’ role in organizational scholarship.

Title: A theory of Abject Appearance: Women elite leaders’ intra-gender ‘management’ of bodies and appearance
Author-Name: Sharon Mavin
Author-Name: Gina Grandy
Abstract: In this article, we develop a theory of Abject Appearance to explain women elite leaders’ embodied identity work within a context of intra-gender relations. The theory of Abject Appearance illuminates a dynamic and dialectical process whereby women elite leaders ‘manage’ the ambiguities of their ‘in-between’ and ‘abject’ status. This process is understood as a possible material effect or consequence of women’s abjection in organizations. Women elite leaders hold power through their formal positions, yet remain marginalized in social relations because their feminine bodies are out of place in organizations. In a qualitative study with women elite leaders, we illustrate how the theme Fascination with bodies and appearance depicts a dialectical process of simultaneous disgust and attraction with women’s bodies and appearance. We discuss how this material effect of abjection may be played out through two embodied identity work strategies in an intra-gender context, namely: Shifting focus from the body and app...

Abstract: Drawing on the person–organization fit literature and person-categorization theory, we proposed that new executive performance depends on both their self-perceptions as well as their fit as seen by senior executives. Using three-phased, multisource data from newly-hired executives of a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company across their first six months on the job, we found that senior executive pre-entry person–organization fit expectations of their followers (new executives) are positively related to their post-entry person–organization fit perceptions through the partial mediating role of their leader–member exchange relationships. Furthermore, results also revealed that senior executive person–organization fit perceptions were significantly and positively related to new executive in-role and extra-role performance, but only when new executives’ own perceptions of person–organization fit were low.

Abstract: Workplace safety is a concern for both scholars and practitioners alike because accidents and injuries can result in time away from work and lost organizational resources. This study focuses on how one type of post-incident discussion can be effectively used to promote positive safety norms. It adds to the growing body of research on after action review meetings, one type of post-incident discussion intervention commonly used in high reliability organizations to increase future workplace safety behaviors. This study also extends the sensemaking and high reliability literatures by examining a three-way interaction between perceived frequency of after action review meetings, ambiguity reduction and psychological safety. Survey data were obtained from 330 firefighters. Results from the three-way interaction showed that safety norms were highest when perceived after action review frequency, ambiguity reduction and psychological safety were simultaneously high, and safety norms were lowest when perceived after...

Title: When and why do individuals craft their jobs? The role of individual motivation and work characteristics for job crafting
Author-Name: Cornelia Niessen
Author-Name: Daniela Weseler
Author-Name: Petya Kostova
Abstract: As a proactive behavior, job crafting refers to changes in the task (cognitive, and behavioral) and social boundaries at work. This article focuses on antecedents of job crafting and the development and validation of a job crafting scale. In Study 1 (N = 466), an exploratory factor analysis with one half of the sample (n = 233) and a confirmatory factor analysis with the other half (n = 233) supported a three-dimensional structure of job crafting (task crafting, relational crafting and cognitive crafting), and convergent as well as discriminant validity of job crafting, in relation to personal initiative and organizational citizenship behavior. In Study 2 (N = 118, two points of measurement), we cross-validated the measure and demonstrated that job crafting was related to, yet distinct from, taking charge. We found that an increase in job crafting at Time 2 was predicted by need for positive self-image (Time 1), as well as by work experience (Time 1). Need for human connection (Time 1) was related to job ...

Title: On temporary organizations: A review, synthesis and research agenda
Author-Name: Catriona M Burke
Author-Name: Michael J Morley
Abstract: Despite the ascendency of temporary organizations to common practice in many industries, and their expansion as an area of academic inquiry, research evidence on their genesis, development and impact remains fragmented across diverse fields, many of which fail to engage with each other. Our purpose in this article is to bring greater systematics to the scholarship on temporary organizations through documenting their evolution and assembling their bricolage. To this end, we first define and delineate the concept of the temporary organization and we develop an inductively derived framework for organizing the literature comprising individual/team attributes and interior processes, task attributes, tensions between the temporary organization and the permanent organization, networks and organizational fields and performance/outcomes of temporary organizations. Following an explication of these attributes and the dominant relationships between them, we suggest how this nascent area of inquiry might advance thro...

Title: When saying sorry may not help: Transgressor power moderates the effect of an apology on forgiveness in the workplace
Author-Name: Xue Zheng

Abstract: An apology, as an expression of remorse, can be an effective response from a transgressor to obtain forgiveness from a victim. Yet, to be effective, the victim should not construe the transgressor’s actions in a cynical way. Because low-power people tend to interpret the actions of high-power people in a cynical way, we argue that an apology (versus no apology) from high-power transgressors should be relatively ineffective in increasing forgiveness from low-power victims. We find support for this moderated mediation model in a critical incidents study (Study 1), a forced recall study (Study 2) among employees from various organizations and a controlled laboratory experiment among business students (Study 3).These studies reveal the limited value of expressions of remorse by high-power people in promoting forgiveness.

Title: Do women advance equity? The effect of gender leadership composition on LGBT-friendly policies in American firms
Author-Name: Alison Cook
Author-Name: Christy Glass
Abstract: We advance the literature on the demographic factors that shape organizational outcomes by analyzing the impact of the gender composition of firm leadership on the likelihood that a firm will adopt lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)-friendly policies. Drawing on social role and token theory, we test the relative impact of CEO gender and the gender composition of the board of directors separately and together in order to identify the effects of gender diversity at the top of the organization. We rely on a unique data set that includes corporate policies (gender identity and sexual orientation non-discrimination policies, domestic-partner benefits, and overall corporate equality index scores) as well as the gender of the CEO and board of directors among Fortune 500 firms over a 10-year period. Our findings suggest that firms with gender-diverse boards are more likely than other firms to offer LGBT-friendly policies, whereas findings for firms with women CEOs offer mixed results.

Title: Bourdieu and the gendered social structure of working time: A study of self-employed human resources professionals
Author-Name: Steve Vincent
Abstract: This article uses the sociology of Bourdieu to explore the social structure of working time and uses this approach to analyse interview data from 25 self-employed human resources professionals practicing in the UK. Bourdieu’s approach to exploring resources, as forms of capital that are deployed strategically by actors within social fields, is used to compare outcomes for respondents with different working time patterns. The findings demonstrate that self-employed professionals’ uses of resources are affected by distinctive and gendered temporal rhythms within and between social fields. These temporal patterns typically serve the interests of well-resourced (more typically male) actors who structure their lives according to specific routines. Self-employed people with less working time often struggle to synchronize their lives with their environments and so are often at a disadvantage in accessing and using resources. The analysis, which develops novel propositions about the ways in which actors become di...

Title: Imagining organization through metaphor and metonymy: Unpacking the process-entity paradox
Author-Name: Dennis Schoeneborn
Author-Name: Consuelo Vásquez
Author-Name: Joep Cornelissen
Abstract: Within organization studies, Morgan’s seminal book Images of Organization has laid the groundwork for an entire research tradition of studying organizational phenomena through metaphorical lenses. Within Morgan’s list of images, that of ‘organization as flux and transformation’ stands out in two important regards. First, it has a strong metonymic dimension, as it implies that organizations consist of and are constituted by processes. Second, the image invites scholars to comprehend organizations as a paradoxical relation between organization (an entity) and process (a non-entity). In this article, we build on Morgan’s work and argue that flux-based images of organization vary in their ability to deal with the process-entity paradox, depending on the degree to which its metaphorical and metonymic dimensions are intertwined. We also examine three offsprings of the flux image: Organization as Becoming, Organization as Practice, and Organization as Communication. We compare these images regarding their metaph...

Title: Safety climate and increased risk: The role of deadlines in design work
Author-Name: Kevin Daniels

Author-Name: Varuni Wimalasiri
Abstract: Although much research indicates positive safety climate is associated with reduced safety risk, we argue this association is not universal and may even be reversed in some contexts. Specifically, we argue that positive safety climate can be associated with increased safety risk when there is pressure to prioritize production over safety and where workers have some detachment from the consequences of their actions, such as found in engineering design work. We used two indicators of safety risk: use of heuristics at the individual level and design complexity at the design team level. Using experience sampling data (N = 165, 42 design teams, k = 5752 observations), we found design engineers’ perceptions of team positive safety climate were associated with less use of heuristics when engineers were not working to deadlines, but more use of heuristics when engineers were working to deadlines. Independent ratings were obtained of 31 teams’ designs of offshore oil and gas platforms (N = 121). For teams that wor...

Title: Constructing positive identities in ableist workplaces: Disabled employees’ discursive practices engaging with the discourse of lower productivity
Author-Name: Eline Jammaers

Author-Name: Stefan Hardonk
Abstract: This article explores how disabled workers engage with the ableist discourse of disability as lower productivity in constructing positive identities in the workplace. Disabled employees inhabit a contradictory discursive position: as disabled individuals, they are discursively constructed for what they are unable to do, whereas as employees they are constituted as human resources and expected to be able to produce and create value. Our discourse analysis of 30 in-depth interviews with disabled employees identifies three types of discursive practices through which they construct positive workplace identities: (1) practices contesting the discourse of lower productivity as commonly defined; (2) practices contesting the discourse of lower productivity by redefining productivity; and (3) practices reaffirming the discourse of lower productivity yet refusing individual responsibility for it. The study advances the disability literature by highlighting how disabled speakers sustain positive workplace identities...

Abstract: In this article we extend the debate about critical performativity. We begin by outlining the basic tenets of critical performativity and how this has been applied in the study of management and organization. We then address recent critiques of critical performance. We note these arguments suffer from an undue focus on intra-academic debates; engage in author-itarian theoretical policing; feign relevance through symbolic radicalism; and repackage common sense. We take these critiques as an opportunity to offer an extended model of critical performativity that involves focusing on issues of public importance; engaging with non-academic groups using dialectical reasoning; scaling up insights through movement building; and propagating deliberation.

Abstract: In this article we explore how elite actors respond to a field-wide crisis. Drawing from a study of CEOs of large US banks in the immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis, we show how elite actors use rhetorical strategies to defend their dominant position in the field. Specifically, we show how actors strengthen their epistemic authority – the perceived expertise and trustworthiness of an actor – through four distinct but interwoven rhetorical strategies. Actors used two internally-directed means of strengthening epistemic authority by providing rational guarantees and expressing normative responsibilities, and two externally-directed strategies that sought to strengthen their own epistemic authority by lowering the epistemic authority of others through critiquing judgments and questioning motives. We contribute to research on defensive institutional work by highlighting how elite actors rhetorically defended their position following a field-wide crisis.

Title: Social organization, classificatory analogies and institutional logics: Institutional theory revisits Mary Douglas
Author-Name: Danielle M Logue

Abstract: As a social theory of organization, it is unsurprising that institutional theory draws upon the profound and ambitious work of the late anthropologist Mary Douglas. One of the foundational concepts of organizational institutionalism, institutional logics, directly draws upon her work. Yet, in recent times this foundational role has faded from view. This is unfortunate for there is much continuity in current work with that of Douglas, it now being 50 years and 30 years respectively, since the publication of two of her formative works. The deep analogies that underpin classificatory systems and the processes by which they are sustained remain significant areas under continued investigation by institutional theorists. Thus, in this article we revisit Douglas’ core arguments and their connections to institutional theorizing. We specifically explore her contribution of ‘naturalizing analogies’ as a way of accounting for the unfolding of change across levels of analysis, extending, modifying and enriching expla...

Abstract: Findings from prior research on the relationship between functional diversity and team innovation have been inconclusive. This study aims to reconcile the mixed findings in the literature by investigating how functional diversity may influence team innovation and when such influence may or may not occur. The view of teams as information processors suggests that functionally diverse teams may capitalize on their knowledge benefits to produce innovations through knowledge sharing. However, knowledge sharing and subsequent team innovation do not necessarily occur in functionally diverse teams. Drawing on the motivated information processing in groups theory, we propose that affect-based trust in a team moderates the effects of functional diversity on team innovation (via knowledge sharing). The results based on a sample of 96 research and development teams indicate that functional diversity had a negative indirect relationship with team innovation via knowledge sharing when affect-based trust in a team was l...

Author-Name: Karim Mignonac
Abstract: The physical health consequences of perceived injustice at work are an important yet underexplored area of research. Using the job-stress recovery literature as an overarching framework, we argued that incomplete recovery because of sleep disorders and subsequent emotional exhaustion is a possible underlying mechanism through which organizational justice relates to employee musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). Using both self-administered questionnaires and medical examination to assess MSD, we tested our argument in two studies. Based on a randomly selected sample of employees from a variety of organizations, Study 1 found organizational justice to be negatively related to MSD through diminished sleep-related disorders. Using a sample of employees in nursing homes for the elderly, Study 2 extended these results by showing that the organizational justice–MSD relationship is sequentially mediated by sleep disorders and emotional exhaustion.

Title: What do employees want and why? An exploration of employees’ preferred psychological contract elements across career stages
Author-Name: Chin Heng Low

Abstract: Employees’ psychological contracts comprise their beliefs about what they have to contribute to their organizations and what inducements they will receive in return. One recommended approach to attract and retain employees is to design psychological contracts that allow them to contribute in desirable ways and receive attractive inducements. However, we know little about the factors that affect psychological contract preferences. We present a qualitative study on the preferred psychological contracts of employees who are in different career stages. Our findings reveal that the roles and self-concepts that employees take on at a particular career stage may shape preferences for stage-relevant contributions and inducements. These findings advance psychological contract theory by highlighting the plausible link between employees’ career stages and their psychological contract preferences.

Title: Metaphors, organizations and water: Generating new images for environmental sustainability
Author-Name: John M Jermier
Author-Name: Linda C Forbes
Abstract: Research across the social sciences and related fields has made it clear that metaphors underwrite both scientific and everyday thinking. Gareth Morgan’s work in this area, most vividly developed in his classic book Images of Organization, illustrates how metaphors underwrite thinking about organizations and the important role they can play in generating new thinking. In this study, we use and extend Morgan’s (2006) thesis of ‘organizations as instruments of domination’ (IoD) to reflect on critical issues in organizational studies related to water and the broader natural environment. We find extending the IoD image to be helpful: (i) in deriving and elaborating a metaphor that reflects a risky trend (‘organizations as water exploiters’); and (ii) in generating and developing a new metaphor that is explicitly normative and nature-centered (‘organizations as water keepers’). The water keeper image brings needed attention to water problems and invites further research on activist organizations (businesses an...

Title: ‘Curiouser and curiouser!’: Organizations as Wonderland – a metaphorical alternative to the rational model
Author-Name: Darren McCabe
Abstract: The metaphors in Morgan’s (1986) Images of Organization largely imply order, rationality, stability and manageability. This reflects that the text is concerned with facilitating the design and management of organizations. This article draws on Lewis Carroll’s (1865) novel Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland to propose Wonderland as an alternative metaphor that places at centre stage issues such as absurdity, irrationality, uncertainty and disorder. Rather than a marginal or temporary aberration, it is argued that such conditions need to be understood as an everyday experience for many. This metaphor is important because those who are tasked with managing organizations may find it stressful and puzzling that they are so inept, when they compare their experiences and achievements with the rational model. In this sense, it offers both comfort and perhaps encouragement, but it should also foster humility and caution in terms of what those at the top can achieve. Likewise, those on the receiving end of irrational...

Title: Othering, ableism and disability: A discursive analysis of co-workers’ construction of colleagues with visible impairments
Author-Name: Nanna Mik-Meyer
Abstract: The aim of this article is to explore how able-bodied co-workers engage in the ‘othering’ of colleagues with impairments. Taking a discursive analytical approach, the article examines interviews with 19 managers and 43 colleagues who all worked closely with an employee with cerebral palsy in 13 different work organizations. The primary finding of the article is that co-workers spontaneously refer to other ‘different’ people (e.g. transvestites, homosexuals, immigrants) when talking about a colleague with visible impairments. This finding suggests that disability is simultaneously a discursive category (i.e. the discourse of ableism prevents co-workers from talking about the impairments of a colleague) and a material phenomenon (i.e. employees with impairments are a distinct category of employees in the eyes of the co-workers). Othering of employees with disabilities thus demonstrates contradictory discourses of ableism (which automatically produce difference) and tolerance and inclusiveness (which automat...

Title: ‘Wow! That’s so cool!’ The Icehotel as organizational trope
Author-Name: Jonathan Pinto
Abstract: This article introduces the Icehotel, the world’s first and largest hotel to be constructed entirely of ice and snow, as a unique and generative organizational trope. As a trope (and metaphor, in particular), it both supplements and complements Morgan’s seminal book, The Images of Organization, and generates unique insights with regard to surprise, unifinality, purity, eco-coreness and rebirth. The Icehotel also serves as a lens for examining organizations through each master trope, that is, metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche and irony. Evidence of metonymy in language describing the Icehotel is presented. The case for synecdoche is made by arguing that the Icehotel is a species of two genera, that is, temporary organizations and paradoxical organizations. Also, the Icehotel is not only paradoxical (i.e. a form of irony), but also generates four other paradoxes, namely, the ways that organizations are evolutionary yet revolutionary, negative as well as positive, different yet similar and unsustainably sustain...

Title: Older British employees’ declining attitudes over 20 years and across classes
Author-Name: Michael White
Author-Name: Deborah Smeaton
Abstract: British employers, under increasing competitive pressures, and applying new technology and work organization, have sought to reduce labour costs, resulting in work intensification and precarity. Older employees as a result are exposed to work demands that conflict with expectations of favourable treatment in late career. National survey data for Britain in the years 1992, 2001, 2006 and 2012 demonstrate a decline in overall job attitude among older employees following the changed conditions of the 1990s and across the major recession that began in 2008. To assess whether this decline is unequally distributed, decomposition by socio-economic class is carried out. This shows that older employees in the ‘service class’ of managerial and professional employees are affected at least as much as older employees in intermediate and less-skilled classes, thus underlining the age effect and showing that ‘service-class’ employees are not invulnerable to a changing economic environment.

Abstract: This article explores contrasting forms of ‘knowledge leadership’ in mobilizing management research into organizational practice. Drawing on a Foucauldian perspective on power–knowledge, we introduce three axes of power–knowledge relations, through which we analyse knowledge leadership practices. We present empirical case study data focused on ‘polar cases’ of managers engaged in mobilizing management research in six research-intensive organizations in the UK healthcare sector. We find that knowledge leadership involves agentic practices through which managers strive to actively become the knowledge object – personally transposing, appropriating or contending management research. This article contributes to the literature by advancing the concept of knowledge leadership in the work of mobilizing management research into organizational practice.

Abstract: Organizational support theory (OST) suggests that employees develop a general perception of the extent to which the organization values their contributions and cares about their well-being (perceived organizational support – POS), and respond to that support through attitudes and behaviors that are beneficial toward the organization. Although OST emphasizes both social exchange and self-enhancement processes, most accounts of POS’s effects are rooted in social exchange. For example, POS’s linkages with commitment and retention have been explained as an exchange of support for positive attitudes and continued employment. This research sheds light on self-enhancement’s less-understood role in fostering these reactions by demonstrating the influence of social comparison effects. Drawing on a sample of 342 employees nested in 82 work-units of a US hospitality company, our analysis demonstrates that favorable POS comparisons with peers in one’s work-unit are positively associated with commitment and retention,...

Title: Food and music matters: Affective relations and practices in social justice organizations
Author-Name: Lynne Keevers
Author-Name: Christopher Sykes
Abstract: In this article, we focus on the organizing practices of a community-based, not-for-profit, social justice organization. We investigate how organizational participants interweave bundles of practices involving food and music to choreograph the affective relations that bring forth a sense of belonging, participation, recognition and respect between diverse people, thereby enacting social justice. This article examines the everyday, organizing practices associated with food and music and shows how not only are food and music excellent entrances to understanding organizational practices but they are also instrumental in constituting and reconstituting the performance of social justice. In this way, our article brings attention to the dimensions of knowing which are not primarily about representing but about affecting. In particular, practices of respect, recognition and belonging are rendered communicable across the boundaries of difference, dependency and inequality, forming platforms for solidarity and the...

Title: ‘Trapped’ by metaphors for organizations: Thinking and seeing women’s equality and inequality
Author-Name: Linzi J Kemp
Abstract: Gender was consistently identified as a major force in all editions of Images of Organization (Morgan, 1986, 1997, 2006), yet 30 years after publication of Morgan’s (1986) seminal work, women’s equality remains elusive in twenty-first-century workplaces. This state of affairs became the stimulus for the present research study, and its purpose the exploration of influences on women’s equality and inequality from the eight metaphors contained in Images of Organization (Morgan, 1986, 1997, 2006). Data were collected from a sample of 70 articles in 30 leading academic journals that referenced Images of Organization (Morgan, 1986, 1997, 2006), and were analyzed for within-domains similarity between the eight metaphors and imageries of women in organizations. The results were then investigated for women’s equality and inequality via content analysis. Four themes of influences on women’s equality and inequality were identified from these metaphors for organizations. The implications of these findings are discuss...

Title: Theorization as institutional work: The dynamics of roles and practices
Author-Name: Sébastien Mena
Author-Name: Roy Suddaby
Abstract: This study unpacks the construct of theorization – the process by which organizational ideas become delocalized and abstracted into theoretical models to support their diffusion across time and space. We adopt an institutional work lens to analyse the key components of theorization in contexts where institutional work is in transition from changing institutions to maintaining them. We build on a longitudinal inductive study of theorization by the Fair Labor Association – a private regulatory initiative that created and then enforced a code of conduct for working conditions in apparel factories. Our study reveals that when institutional work shifts from changing to maintaining an institutional arrangement of corporate social responsibility, there is a key change in how the Fair Labor Association theorizes roles and practices related to this arrangement. We observe that theorization on key practices largely remains intact, whereas the roles of different actors are theorized in a dramatically different manne...

Abstract: Members of teams are often prone to interpersonal communication patterns that can undermine the team’s capacity to engage in self-learning processes that are critical to team adaptation and performance improvement. We argue that team leader coaching behaviors are critical to ensuring that team discussions that may foster learning new teamwork skills and strategies are unfettered by the tendency of two or more members to exhibit contentious interpersonal communications. We accordingly test a model in which team contentious communication moderates the mediated relationship of team leader coaching behaviors on team innovation effectiveness and team task performance. In a study of 82 work teams, team leader coaching behaviors exhibited indirect, positive relationships with both team innovation effectiveness and team task performance through team learning, but only among teams with an average or higher level of contentious interpersonal communication. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for the l...

Abstract: This introduction examines the contributions of articles in this special issue to organization theory, especially efforts to rethink or add to Morgan’s metaphors and to generate new organizational images. In general, the articles in this issue offer new metaphors and sub-metaphors and enrich specifications for two of Morgan’s images. Moreover, they address ways of rethinking Morgan’s images through developing meta-metaphors and comparing his images with other sets of metaphors. In addition, the contributors to this special issue rely on a number of ways to generate new metaphors, namely through evaluation and critique, empirical and experiential observations, fantasy, and conceptual development. This introduction concludes with an appeal for scholars to increase their knowledge of Morgan’s metaphors, especially what they are and what they entail.

Title: Commentary: Beyond Morgan’s eight metaphors
Author-Name: Gareth Morgan
Abstract: This article focuses on the interplay between metaphor and metonymy in the construction of organization theory. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the relationship between the use of metaphor as a way of thinking and a way of being, and the specific metaphors that are produced through this process. It suggests that too much emphasis is often placed on metaphors as abstracted epistemological constructs rather than on understanding the more dynamic and changing role they play in the interactive modes of engagement through which people seek to grasp, concretize and act on their world. Developing the approach and ideas first presented in Images of Organization, this article suggests that a flexible use of metaphor can help us engage and understand the multidimensional and paradoxical nature of organizational life and help us to deal with the emerging issues shaping the contemporary socio-political–technological–organizational landscape. The article suggests that because most current approaches in s...

Title: Binary logics and the discursive interpretation of organizational policy: Making meaning of sexual harassment policy
Author-Name: Debbie S Dougherty
Author-Name: Marlo Goldstein Hode
Abstract: Although workplace policies are written in neutral terms that give the appearance of rationality, research shows that policy meanings are in fact constructed and negotiated through discursive practices. Sexual harassment policies illustrate this phenomenon. Sexual harassment is a highly complex and fluid phenomenon that is dependent on context and culture for its meaning. Although sexual harassment policies tend to use language that appears to lie outside of the interpretive stream, these policies are in fact always subject to discursive interpretation. One particularly powerful form of discursive interpretation lies in the interplay between binary logics and binary language. This study explored the interplay between macro-level binary logics, mezzo-level sexual harassment policy and micro-level binary language during organizational members’ discussions about their organization’s sexual harassment policy. Our analysis of focus group and interview data revealed that participants discursively produced what ...

Title: In pursuit of ambidexterity: Managerial reactions to innovation–efficiency tensions
Author-Name: Angeliki Papachroni

Author-Name: Sotirios Paroutis
Abstract: Whereas tensions arising from the pursuit of ambidexterity have been documented, how these are interpreted and managed by actors themselves remains largely unexplored. Based on in-depth case research in a large Scandinavian-based telecommunications organization pursuing ambidexterity, we identify a path-dependent process of tension interpretation and tension management at different levels of the organization. Our findings suggest that, in the context of an ambidextrous strategy, actors are actively involved in managing arising tensions based on their differing interpretations of these tensions (where ambidextrous demands are seen as complementary, conflicting or interrelated). We find that these interpretations are influenced by actors’ strategic orientation and organizational level. Our study extends understanding of the pursuit of ambidexterity in practice, offering a pluralist, path-dependent perspective of how actors perceive and deal with ambidexterity tensions.

Title: The paradoxical effect of self-categorization on work stress in a high-status occupation: Insights from management consulting
Author-Name: Julia Mühlhaus
Author-Name: Onno Bouwmeester
Abstract: Following social identity theory, the way in which individuals appraise stressful encounters and cope with them is influenced by their membership of social groups, which presumes self-categorization as a group member. To date, the impact of self-categorization on stress has mainly been studied for low-status groups. This article uses an interview study among management consultants to explore how self-categorization in terms of occupational identity impacts work stress in a high-status occupation. Adding to previous research, we find that not only low-status but also high-status groups benefit from self-categorization when coping with stressful situations. In line with prevailing theoretical assumptions, we even empirically find an ‘upward spiral’. We illustrate how consultants’ social identity as high-performing professionals helps them cope with stress, which in turn creates a feeling of social inclusion. However, we also find a ‘downward spiral’, where social identity provokes work stress among manageme...

Title: How leader and follower attachment styles are mediated by trust

Abstract: The current study utilizes attachment theory to understand how leader–follower relationships impact emotional and behavioral outcomes in the workplace. Specifically, we examine the roles of two dysfunctional attachment styles – anxious and avoidant attachment – as determinants of trust in leaders, stress and citizenship behaviors. Results showed that followers with anxious attachment orientations reported experiencing more stress, whereas followers with avoidant attachment orientations were less likely to engage in organizational citizenship behaviors. Moreover, we found that the relationship between attachment orientations and workplace outcomes are mediated by affective and cognitive trust. However, these negative outcomes only occur when the follower has a leader with an avoidant attachment orientation. Implications for training, selection, job design and understanding leader–follower dynamics are discussed.

Abstract: This study examines the alleged organization of violence by Coca-Cola through a field study conducted in a village in India. It draws on the works of Judith Butler to show how subaltern groups are derealized and made into ungrievable lives through specific, yet recurrent, practices that keep violence unchecked. Many participants attempt to resist derealization through protest activities that showcase their vulnerability. However, the firm appropriates their claims to vulnerability through a paternalistic discourse that justifies intensified violence and derealization. This research offers insights into accumulation through derealization and on the effects of resistance to it.

Title: The subversive craft worker: Challenging ‘disutility’ theories of management control
Author-Name: Dale Tweedie
Author-Name: Sasha Holley
Abstract: Although sociologists and psychologists have documented various motivations for working, the concept of work as essentially disutility or undesirable retains broad resonance among influential economists and social theorists. These concepts imply that workers will tend to avoid or ‘shirk’ their work task unless subjected to management controls. Yet emerging counter-narratives have sought to retrieve and develop alternative concepts of work as craft, where workers are motivated to work well or be recognized for doing so. On these approaches, management controls can decrease the quality of the final outputs. This article uses a case study of cleaners in Australia to challenge influential representations of workers as prone to ‘shirking’ and the interpretation of management control to which these perspectives lead. The article argues that craft concepts of work derived from Richard Sennett and contemporary recognition theory provide alternative narratives of how workers can derive satisfaction from working we...

Title: Becoming hybrid: The negotiated order on the front line of public–private partnerships
Author-Name: Simon Bishop
Author-Name: Justin Waring
Abstract: This article examines how tensions in institutional logics, created in the formation of hybrid organizations, are played out, and partially resolved, through micro-level interactions within everyday work. Drawing on the negotiated order perspective, our research examined how the ‘context’, ‘processes’ and ‘outcomes’ of micro-level negotiations reflect and mitigate tensions between institutional logics. Our ethnographic study of a public–private partnership within the English healthcare system identified tensions within the hybrid organization around organizational goals and values, work activities, hierarchies and the materials and technologies of work. We also identified processes of negotiation between actors, which contributed to negotiated settlements, at times combining elements of parent institutional logics, and at other times serving to keep parent logics distinct. The article demonstrates the relevance of negotiated order perspective to current institutional logics literature on hybrid organizations.

Title: Expatriation and career success: A human capital perspective
Author-Name: Aarti Ramaswami

Abstract: Very little is known about the linkages between expatriation and objective measures of career success. In this field study we address the expatriation–compensation attainment relationship, after controlling for different kinds of international experience, among 440 graduates of elite MBA programs from around the world. The results suggest that a positive compensation return only accrues to repatriates who have experienced more than one expatriate assignment, perceived acquired knowledge and skills to be utilized during post-repatriation periods, and who are working at higher organizational levels. These findings, along with a supplementary analysis, support an explanation of the results based on human capital theory. That is, expatriation relates to compensation attainment because it is an intense developmental experience, and not merely a selection or signaling mechanism. Furthermore, by incorporating the concepts of value of human capital, richness of human capital, and opportunity to display human capi...

Title: Flexible scheduling, degradation of job quality and barriers to collective voice
Author-Name: Alex J Wood
Abstract: This article examines the operation of flexible scheduling in practice through a case study of a large retail firm in the United Kingdom. It includes analysis of 39 semi-structured interviews, participant observation of shop floor work and non-participant observation of union organizing as well as analysis of key documents. The findings highlight the high level of generalized temporal flexibility across employment statuses. This temporal flexibility enables firm flexibility without necessitating a reliance upon contingent workers. Temporal flexibility is found to entail manager-control of flexible scheduling and is shown to be damaging to perceptions of job quality as it acts as a barrier to work-life balance. Union presence and collective bargaining at the firm are found to be ineffective at influencing flexible scheduling so as to improve job quality. This ineffectiveness can be explained by the union operating in an employer-dominated industrial relations environment in which its associational power is...

Author-Name: Kimberly D Elsbach

Abstract: We examine how both automatic and motivated modes of categorization are integral to understanding momentary perceptions of organizations, including perceptions of organizational identity and legitimacy. We begin by discussing how extant organizational research has relied, primarily, on single modes of categorization to describe how we form momentary perceptions of organizations. These ‘single-mode’ frameworks have explained momentary organizational perceptions as the result of either automatic categorization (i.e. driven by unconscious cognitive processes) or motivated categorization (i.e. driven by individual needs and desires). While these frameworks explain much about momentary organizational perceptions, we provide some notable examples that do not follow the paths they predict. To more fully explain momentary organizational perceptions, we present a framework grounded in psychological research that considers how both motivated and automatic modes of categorization influence these perceptions.

Author-Name: Sophie Hennekam
Abstract: This qualitative study reports on how pregnant women integrate their future maternal identity with their existing work-related identity. Twenty-four women were interviewed at three times during their pregnancy: during the first, second and third trimesters. A grounded theory approach was used to analyse the data and social learning theory was adopted as a theoretical framework to assist in interpreting the findings. The findings suggest that the availability or lack of realistic and attainable role models influences the degree to which the transition to motherhood during pregnancy was successful. When role models were readily available, the transition went well, but, when role models were absent, two less successful strategies were identified, leading to negative psychological outcomes. The study also stresses the importance of other contextual factors, such as the gender composition of organizations and the educational attainment of the individual pregnant women, in the way women perceive their transitio...

Abstract: Giving the crucial role of organizational context in shaping individual attitudes and behaviors at work, in this research we studied the effects of collective work-unit perceptions of social context on individual work resilience and two key individual outcomes: job satisfaction and job performance as rated by the supervisor. We theorized that collective perceptions of social context act as antecedents of individual variables, and that individual job satisfaction mediates the relationship between collective perceptions of social context and job performance, and between work resilience and job performance over time. A sample of 305 white-collar employees, clustered in 67 work-units, participated in the study. Hierarchical linear modeling highlighted that collective perceptions of social context are significant related to individual work resilience. Moreover, results showed that individual job satisfaction fully mediates the relationship between collective perceptions of social context and individual job per...

What methodological opportunities might it afford for developing self-reflexive research? What political and ethical problems might it pose for organizational researchers, particularly in relation to the challenges associated with power asymmetries, and the risks attached to ‘fixing’ subjects within the research process? The article outlines and evaluates a method described as anti-narrative interviewing, arguing that it constitutes a potentially valuable methodological resource for researchers interested in understanding how and why idealized organizational subjectivities are formed and sustained. It further advances the in-roads that Butler’s ...

Title: Organizational citizenship behaviour and job satisfaction: The impact of occupational future time perspective
Author-Name: Julia G Weikamp
Author-Name: Anja S Göritz
Abstract: This study examines how occupational future time perspective (OFTP) affects organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) and job satisfaction. OFTP reflects how much time and how many opportunities people perceive themselves as having left in their occupational future. OCB comprises extra-role behaviours that aim to support other individuals in the organization (OCBI) and the organization as a whole (OCBO). Socioemotional selectivity theory posits that people with an open-ended OFTP strive for knowledge-oriented goals (i.e. OCBO). In contrast, people with a constrained OFTP strive for emotion-oriented goals (i.e. OCBI). Thus, the more people perceive their OFTP as open-ended, the more they should show OCBO rather than OCBI. Applying a motivational OFTP approach to job satisfaction, the greater the open-ended people’s OFTP, the more they should be satisfied with their job if they show more OCBO than OCBI because they can pursue their own goals. Findings support our hypotheses for people’s perceived remaining...

Title: Doing and undoing gender in innovation: Femininities and masculinities in innovation processes
Author-Name: Lara Pecis
Abstract: Despite the rising interest in the intertwining of individuals, organizations and institutions in innovation research, scant attention has been paid to the ways that their relations produce and reproduce specific gender dynamics throughout the innovation process. Innovation research has been characterized by a gender blindness that conceals the gendered nature of innovation processes. This article draws on the material collected through an ethnographic investigation conducted in two research organizations to illustrate how innovation processes are gendered when specific forms of masculinities and femininities are constructed, enacted and resisted by men and women. This article contributes towards developing a gendered understanding of innovation by introducing the term ‘positions of displacement’ to signal the fluidity and messiness of doings and undoings of femininities and masculinities through innovation practices.

Abstract: A widely-cited proposition in boundary theory states that it is difficult for individuals to transition between roles, especially when these roles are highly segmented. Surprisingly, this hypothesis has not been directly tested. We provide an empirical test of these propositions and draw from the self-regulation literature to expand boundary theory in exploring how episodes of cognitive role transitions impact job performance. We propose that cognitive role transitioning is cognitively demanding, which consumes the limited executive control resources that facilitate effective job performance. In a multilevel study of 619 employees providing 4371 episodes, we observed that work-to-family cognitive role transitioning was negatively related to job performance, and this effect was mediated by self-regulatory depletion. Although individuals with greater role integration were somewhat more likely to experience cognitive role transitions than those with segmented roles, these individuals were also buffered from ...

Title: Temporal issues in person–organization fit, person–job fit and turnover: The role of leader–member exchange
Author-Name: Corine Boon
Author-Name: Michal Biron
Abstract: Person–environment fit has been found to have significant implications for employee attitudes and behaviors. Most research to date has approached person–environment fit as a static phenomenon, and without examining how different types of person–environment fit may affect each other. In particular, little is known about the conditions under which fit with one aspect of the environment influences another aspect, as well as subsequent behavior. To address this gap we examine the role of leader–member exchange in the relationship between two types of person–environment fit over time: person–organization and person–job fit, and subsequent turnover. Using data from two waves (T1 and T2, respectively) and turnover data collected two years later (T3) from a sample of 160 employees working in an elderly care organization in the Netherlands, we find that person–organization fit at T1 is positively associated with person–job fit at T2, but only for employees in high-quality leader–member exchange relationships.

Title: Mixed feelings, mixed blessing? How ambivalence in organizational identification relates to employees’ regulatory focus and citizenship behaviors

Abstract: Recent conceptual work suggests that the sense of identity that employees develop vis-a-vis their organization goes beyond the traditional notion of organizational identification and can also involve conflicting impulses represented by ambivalent identification. In this study, we seek to advance this perspective on identification by proposing and empirically examining important antecedents and consequences. In line with our hypotheses, an experimental study (N = 199 employees) shows that organizational identification and ambivalent identification interactively influence employees’ willingness to engage in organizational citizenship behavior. The effect of organizational identification on organizational citizenship behavior is significantly reduced when employees experience ambivalent identification. A field study involving employees from a broad spectrum of organizations and industries (N = 564) replicated these findings. Moreover, results show that employees’ promotion and prevention focus form different...

Title: Compositions of professionalism in counselling work: An embodied and embedded intersectionality framework
Author-Name: Maria Adamson
Author-Name: Marjana Johansson
Abstract: This article explores the embodied compositions of professionalism in the context of the counselling psychology profession in Russia. Specifically, we develop an embodied intersectionality framework for theorizing compositions of professionalism, which allows us to explain how multiple embodied categories of difference intersect and are relationally co-constitutive in producing credible professionals, and, importantly, how these intersections are contingent on intercorporeal encounters that take place in localized professional settings. Our exploration of how professionalism and professional credibility are established in Russian counselling shows that, rather than assuming that a hegemonic ‘ideal body’ is given preference in a professional context, different embodied compositions may be deemed credible in various work settings within the same profession. An embodied intersectionality framework allows us to challenge the notion of a single professional ideal and offer a dynamic and contextually situated a...

Title: Microfinance and the business of poverty reduction: Critical perspectives from rural Bangladesh
Author-Name: Subhabrata Bobby Banerjee
Author-Name: Laurel Jackson
Abstract: In this article we provide a critical analysis of the role of market-based approaches to poverty reduction in developing countries. In particular, we analyse the role of microfinance in poverty alleviation by conducting an ethnographic study of three villages in Bangladesh. Microfinance has become an increasingly popular approach that aims to alleviate poverty by providing the poor new opportunities for entrepreneurship. It also aims to promote empowerment (especially among women) while enhancing social capital in poor communities. Our findings, however, reflect a different picture. We found microfinance led to increasing levels of indebtedness among already impoverished communities and exacerbated economic, social and environmental vulnerabilities. Our findings contribute to the emerging literature on the role of social capital in developing entrepreneurial capabilities in poor communities by highlighting processes whereby social capital can be undermined by market-based measures like microfinance.

Abstract: Based on a case study of a large consulting firm, this article makes two contributions to the literature on reputation and identity by examining how an organization responds when its identity is substantially misaligned with the experience and perceptions of external stakeholders that form the basis of reputational judgments. First, rather than triggering some form of identity adaptation, it outlines how other forms of identity can come into play to remediate this gap, buffering the organization’s identity from change. This shift to other individual identities is facilitated by a low organizational identity context even when the identity of the firm is coherent and strong. The second contribution concerns the conceptualization of consulting and other professional service firms. We explain how reputation and identity interact in the context of the distinctive organizational features of these firms. Notably, their loosely coupled structure and the central importance of expert knowledge claims enable individ...

Author-Name: David Courpasson
Author-Name: Françoise Dany
Author-Name: Rick Delbridge
Abstract: The meaningfulness of the physical place within which resistance is nurtured and enacted has not been carefully considered in research on space and organizations. In this article, we offer two stories of middle managers developing resistance to managerial policies and decisions. We show that the appropriation and reconstruction of specific places by middle managers helps them to build autonomous resisting work thanks to the meanings that resisters attribute to the place in which they undertake resistance. We contribute to the literature on space and organizations by showing that resistance is a social experience through which individuals shape physical places and exploit the geographical blurring of organizations to develop political efforts that can be consequential. We also suggest the central role played by middle managers in the subversion of these meaningful places of resistance.

Abstract: Issues relating to litigation and other forms of employee legal claiming are at the forefront of the practice of human resource management. However, organizational scholars have paid scant attention to this important aspect of organizational life. Underrepresented in this collective research have been investigations into how social influence variables impact the legal claiming process. We add to the understanding of legal claiming by evaluating how perceived levels of accountability, reputation and political skill affect individuals’ willingness to engage in contentious and non-contentious legal claiming. We also investigate the impact that social influence has on individuals’ advice to other potential claimants. This study employed a longitudinal design utilizing both scenarios and survey data collection. Results from our study partially support the conclusion that individuals are more risk-averse in their own legal claiming considerations than they are in the advice they offer to similarly-situated othe...

Title: Digging deeper towards capricious management: ‘Personal traits become part of the means of production’
Author-Name: Gerard Hanlon
Abstract: What follows examines the shifting nature of work to argue that we need to look beyond the employment relationship and the work organization to understand labour. It suggests one tendency in capitalism is to generate ‘all labour as productive of value’ (Harvie, 2005: 161), so that we subsume life to work. The article also suggests that, rather than being new, this development is an intensification of the past. Indeed, by returning to early management writers, it asserts that we can see the scale of management’s political ambition to subsume life to work. As such, to understand labour we need to comprehend the broader issue of capitalism’s social reproduction and the manner in which it recalibrates the subject as a ‘subject of value’.

Abstract: We draw on gender role theory to examine the relationships among employee-rated work–family conflict, supervisor perceptions of employee work–family conflict, employee gender and supervisor-rated job performance. We found that the relationship between employee-rated work–family conflict and supervisor perceptions of employee conflict varied based on both employee gender and the direction of conflict under consideration. Specifically, the relationship between the two rating sources (employee and supervisor) was stronger for male employees when conflict was considered. However, the relationship between the two rating sources was stronger for female employees when family-to-work conflict was considered. Supervisor perceptions of employee work–family conflict were negatively related to employee job performance ratings. More generally, we found support for a moderated mediation model such that the relationship between employee-rated work–family conflict and job performance was mediated by supervisor perception...

Title: The indeterminacy of ‘temporariness’: Control and power in neo-bureaucratic organizations and work in UK television
Author-Name: Jonathan Morris
Author-Name: Catherine Farrell
Author-Name: Mike Reed
Abstract: Whereas historically the UK television industry has been characterized by hierarchy and vertical integration of programme production within a few large broadcasters, new neo-bureaucratic temporary organizational forms have proliferated in the industry in the past 20 years. This has been a product of a variety of factors, including globalization, technological change in the industry, deregulation and cost-cutting. This article draws on research involving 75 participants working in the large broadcasters, independents and as freelancers. The temporary form in the industry is an extreme case, in that they can be of very short duration (under a week). This has far-reaching implications for industry coordination and control. However, these forms are far from ‘one-offs’ and they are continuously reinvented and recast. This neo-bureaucratic form is controlled and regulated by the major producers through a set of powerful normative methods, based partly on an evolving custom and practice, but also in the extreme ...

Title: Slipping into functional stupidity: The bifocality of organizational compliance
Author-Name: Roland Paulsen
Abstract: Drawing on ethnographical work at the Swedish Public Employment Service, this article contextualizes functional stupidity in relation to other types of organizational compliance. Rather than seeing stupidity as a personality trait, I argue that it should be regarded as a transient unreflective mode of compliance one may yield to for a number of reasons but also reflect on in hindsight. Based on the empirical material, I distinguish 10 ‘stupidity rationales’ emanating from reflective types of compliance with which employees can motivate the practice of functional stupidity. Functional stupidity can be seen as the modus operandi of ego-dystonic compliance we enter in order to endure long hours of imposed work assignments we would rather not perform.

Title: Taste matters: Cultural capital and elites in proximate Strategic Action Fields

Abstract: Recent literature suggests that elites are increasingly fragmented and divided. Yet there is very little empirical research that maps the distinctions between different elite groups. This article explores the cultural divisions that pertain to elite factions in two distinct but proximate Strategic Action Fields. A key insight from the article is that the public sector faction studied exhibits a much broader, more aesthetic set of cultural dispositions than their private sector counterparts. This permits a number of inter-related contributions to be made to literature on both elites and field theory. First, the findings suggest that cultural capital acts as a salient source of distinction between elite factions in different Strategic Action Fields. Second, it is demonstrated how cultural capital is socially functional as certain cultural dispositions are strongly homologous with specific professional roles. Third, the article demonstrates the implications for the structure of the State when two culturally ...

Author-Name: Angela Martinez Dy

Abstract: This article critically analyses the manner in which intersectionality and related social positionality shape digital enterprise activities. Despite popular claims of meritocratic opportunity enactment within traditional forms of entrepreneurship, ascribed social characteristics intersect to influence the realization of entrepreneurial potential. However, it is purported that the emerging field of digital entrepreneurship may act as a ‘great leveller’ owing to perceived lower barriers to entry, disembodiment of the entrepreneurial actor and the absence of visible markers of disadvantage online. Using an interpretivist approach, we analyse empirical evidence that reveals how the privileges and disadvantages arising from intersecting social positions of gender, race and class status are experienced by UK women digital entrepreneurs. This analysis challenges the notion that the internet is a neutral platform for entrepreneurship and supports our thesis that offline inequality, in the form of marked bodies, s...

Title: The systems psychodynamics of gendered hiring: Personal anxieties and defensive organizational practices within the New Zealand film industry
Author-Name: Jocelyn Handy
Author-Name: Lorraine Rowlands
Abstract: This article uses systems psychodynamic concepts to explore the creation and reproduction of gendered inequality within the New Zealand film industry. The article focuses on the ways in which senior film production workers’ anxieties about hiring, or working with, women influence the process of assembling project teams. It suggests that the process of choosing team members creates considerable anxiety for both senior film production workers with responsibility for hiring and lower-status team members who need to rely on them to create high-functioning teams. The industry ideal of the autonomous creative worker is implicitly gendered, conforming more closely to traditional concepts of the unencumbered male worker than traditional ideals of femininity and motherhood. The antithesis between these representations creates anxiety, raising unconscious fears that women as a category are less trustworthy workers. Consequently, discriminatory hiring practices that diminish these anxieties become collectively accep...

Title: Re-situating organizational knowledge: Violence, intersectionality and the privilege of partial perspective
Author-Name: Kate Lockwood Harris
Abstract: Scholars have called repeatedly for more nuanced understandings of power and organizational knowledge, but researchers have yet to integrate available critical frameworks that could link these concepts. Moreover, existing analyses of power in organizational knowledge tend to focus on role differences but do not yet consider how social differences – including gender, race and sexuality – shape knowledge. Working from a practice-based approach, I draw upon standpoint theory and intersectionality to show how whiteness, masculinity and heteronormativity are embedded in organizational knowledge. I construct this argument using a case study at a US university known for having some of the best systems for building organizational knowledge about sexual violence on campus. I argue that the university’s practices – specifically those related to interpretation and definition – mask heterogeneity in knowledge across the university. I also show how practices give the university’s knowledge the appearance of neutrality...

Title: The case for reinvigorating quality of working life research
Author-Name: Gudela Grote
Author-Name: David Guest
Abstract: The quality of working life became an important topic in the 1960s and 1970s, helping to stimulate an early approach to evidence-based policy advocacy drawing on interdisciplinary research by social scientists. Over the years it fell out of the limelight but much relevant, albeit fragmented, research has continued. We present a case for rekindling an integrated and normative approach to quality of working life research as one means of promoting workers’ well-being and emancipation. We outline an updated classification of the characteristics of quality of working life and a related analytic framework. We illustrate how research and practice will benefit from following this renewed quality of working life framework, using work design as an example. Concluding, we aim to stimulate debate on the necessity and benefits of rebuilding a quality of working life agenda for marrying academic rigour and practical relevance in order to support interventions aimed at fostering worker emancipation and well-being.

Abstract: This article investigates the interactive effects of extrinsic value orientation and competence supportive feedback on the work outcomes of in-role and extra-role performance, and employees’ subjective well-being at work. Two studies are presented with samples consisting of a cross-section of employees and, for Study 1, their managers. In keeping with established theory and findings, competence supportive feedback demonstrated positive and significant main effects. In support of this article’s unique predictions, these relationships were amplified (in-role and extra-role performance) and attenuated (subjective well-being) at higher levels of individual extrinsic value orientation. Findings for well-being were more closely examined with the second sample, and an underlying mechanism of experienced work demands was identified. Thus, it seems that motivational sensitivity to the instrumental value of competence supportive feedback, in addition to its recognized psychological value, may drive work engagement ...

Abstract: Employee safety citizenship behaviors are crucial to risk management in safety-critical industries, and identifying ways to encourage them is a priority. This study examines (i) whether safety citizenship behaviors are a product of social exchanges between employees and organizations, and (ii) the organizational exchanges (i.e. actual activities to support employees) that underlie this relationship. We studied this in the offshore oil and gas industry, and investigated whether organizational activities for supporting workforce health are a signal to employees that the organization supports them, and an antecedent to safety citizenship behaviors. Using questionnaires, we collected data from employees (n = 820) and medics (n = 30) on 22 offshore installations. Multi-level path analysis found that where activities to support workforce health were greater, offshore employees were more likely to perceive their organization to support them, and in turn report more commitment to the organization and safety citiz...

Title: Network characteristics: When an individual’s job crafting depends on the jobs of others
Author-Name: Lorenzo Bizzi
Abstract: Because job crafting research proposes that individuals alter jobs on their own, there is an open debate on how others influence an individual’s job crafting. Whereas previous research has recognized that incumbents engage in job crafting depending on the characteristics of their own job, this study shows that job crafting depends on the job characteristics of the incumbents’ network contacts, meaning all employees in the organization with whom the incumbents frequently communicate about task-related issues. Applying role theory, the article theorizes that network contacts act as role senders who affect job crafting because they communicate role expectations that vary as a function of their own task activities. Key empirical findings show that contacts’ autonomy and contacts’ feedback from the job positively affect job crafting, whereas contacts’ task significance exercises a negative effect. The findings further show that the effect of job crafting on performance depends on the central position occupied ...

The diachronic analysis describes the micro, local, historical, intra-organizational work that serves as a proving ground for generating resistance before proceeding to institutional level work; in doing so, the article explores how leadership activities can be ‘scaled up’ to affect institutions through the intermediary of an organization. Identity violations triggered a founder’s sensemaking and moved her to lead others to resist institutional forces on her own organization’s training practices.

Title: A history of vocational ethics and professional identity: How organization scholars navigate academic value spheres

Abstract: In recent years, Michael Burawoy has sparked a discussion about the role of social sciences in society. He calls for an increased interaction between different value spheres in social science, because ‘the flourishing of each depends on the flourishing of all.’ To ensure this interaction, he proposes that we pay better attention to the micro-politics of academic lives, not least their historical, geographical and biographical specificity. The current article contributes to this agenda, contextualized in the field of Organization Studies. It analyzes the vocational micro-politics of organization scholars, especially with a focus on historical and biographical specificity. Based on in-depth interviews with 15 senior scholars, many considered founding figures of Organization Studies, I analyze how they navigate value tensions in different historical periods. To understand historical differences, the article draws on a combination of Burawoy and Boltanski and Chiapello. To understand individual navigation of ...

Abstract: In this article, we develop the founding elements of the concept of Communities of Practice by elaborating on the learning processes happening at the heart of such communities. In particular, we provide a consistent perspective on the notions of knowledge, knowing and knowledge sharing that is compatible with the essence of this concept – that learning entails an investment of identity and a social formation of a person. We do so by drawing richly from the work of Michael Polanyi and his conception of personal knowledge, and thereby we clarify the scope of Communities of Practice and offer a number of new insights into how to make such social structures perform well in professional settings. The conceptual discussion is substantiated by findings of a qualitative empirical study in the UK National Health Service. As a result, the process of ‘thinking together’ is conceptualized as a key part of meaningful Communities of Practice where people mutually guide each other through their understandings of the sam...

Abstract: This article explores the intersection of branding, identity and control. It develops the notion of identity-incentive branding and links research on the collective-associative construction of occupational identities with work on identity incentives as an engaging form of control. Empirically, we draw on a case study of a North American grocery chain that is known for employing art-school graduates and other creative talents in creative (store artist) and non-creative shop-floor positions. The study shows that the brand is partly built outside–in through association with employees who embody brand-relevant characteristics in their identities and lifestyles. In return, those employees receive identity opportunities to validate their desired sense of self as ‘creative subject’. We discuss the dual nature of identity-incentive branding as neo-normative control and outline its implications for the organization and the employees.

Title: How practice makes sense in healthcare operations: Studying sensemaking as performative, material-discursive practice
Author-Name: Lotta Hultin
Author-Name: Magnus Mähring
Abstract: This article aims to move sensemaking theory forward by exploring a post-humanist view of how sense is made in material-discursive practices. Answering recent calls for novel theoretical views on sensemaking, we adopt a relational ontology, assuming subject and object to be ontologically entangled, and viewing agency as a circulating flow through material-discursive practices. Employing this perspective, we study how sensemaking unfolds at the emergency ward of a Nordic university hospital. By working through the concepts of material-discursive practices, flow of agency and subject positions, we produce an account of sensemaking that decenters the human actor as the locus and source of sensemaking, and foregrounds the performativity of practices through which certain ways of acting become enacted as sensible. This allows us to propose an alternative to the traditional view of sensemaking as episodic, cognitive-discursive practices enacted within and between separate human actors. With this view, what make...

Using a two-wave longitudinal design with a 12-month time lag and samples of employees (total N = 2183) from Australia, New Zealand, China and Hong Kong, the present research investigated whether the mediating relationships between social support, work–family conflict and well-being outcomes were moderated by gender, geographical region and the presence of dependants in the household. Supervisor support and family support were associated with lower work–family conflict, and hence reduced psychological strain and increased job and family satisfaction, for women and for employees in China and Hong Kong, but not for employees in Australia and New Zealand. However, the presence of dependants was not a significant moderator. Our findings illustrate the importance of ...

Title: Communicative tensions of meaningful work: The case of sustainability practitioners
Author-Name: Rahul Mitra
Author-Name: Patrice M Buzzanell
Abstract: This study, based on in-depth interviews with 45 practitioners in the emerging field of environmental sustainability, argues for a more nuanced approach to studying the meaningfulness of work. Drawing from the tension-centered approach, we posit that sustainability practitioners derived meaningfulness in tensional ways from circumstances and factors that were both enabling and constraining, stemming from various organizational, professional and political structures. This occurs through ongoing negotiation that spans everyday work processes, the perceived impact of such work, and participants’ career positioning. In addition to examining meaningfulness as a dynamic and contested negotiation, rather than a purely positive outcome, the political implications of such meaning-making are traced. We close by discussing some implications for future research on meaningfulness of work.

Title: Motivation and identity: A psychoanalytic perspective on the turn to identity in motivation research
Author-Name: Michaela Driver
Abstract: Taking the recent turn to identity in motivation research as its starting point, the study attempts to move the field further beyond instrumentalizing and fractionalizing conceptions in which motivation is simply a question of pulling the right levers. Drawing on a psychoanalytic, particularly Lacanian, perspective and an analysis of 51 narratives shared by employees from a number of occupations, it develops a more fine-grained and complex understanding of how motivation functions in the context of identity work. Specifically, the study explores how motivation is invariably mapped onto internal struggles with unconscious subjectivity and desire. These may align individuals more with organizational ideals of the properly motivated employee, but also create an empowering space in which employees can work through work-related fantasies and find enjoyment on their own terms. The implications of this perspective are discussed.

Title: What works for whom in which circumstances? On the need to move beyond the ‘what works?’ question in organizational intervention research
Author-Name: Karina Nielsen
Author-Name: Mariella Miraglia
Abstract: A debate has arisen out of the need to understand true intervention outcomes in the social sciences. Traditionally, the randomized, controlled trial that answers the question of ‘what works’ has been considered the gold standard. Although randomized, controlled trials have been favoured in organizational intervention research, there has been an increasing interest in understanding the influence of context and intervention processes on the outcomes of such interventions. In the present critical essay, we question the suitability of trials and meta-analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of organizational interventions and we suggest that realist evaluation that seeks to answer the questions of what works for whom in which circumstances may present a more suitable framework. We argue that examining the content and process mechanisms through which organizational interventions are effective, and the conditions under which these are triggered, will enable us to better understand how interventions achieve the de...

Title: Whistle-blowing and the politics of truth: Mobilizing ‘truth games’ in the WikiLeaks case
Author-Name: Iain Munro
Abstract: This article investigates the role of ‘truth’ as an object of contention within organizations, with specific reference to the ‘politics of truth’ in the WikiLeaks case. For an empirical illustration of a ‘truth game’, this article draws on varied accounts of the WikiLeaks whistle-blowing website. The article shows how different ‘truth games’ are mobilized by different organizational actors engaged in a politics of truth. The article demonstrates the existence of different truth games at work in the WikiLeaks case. It shows WikiLeaks’ profound challenge to hegemonic games of truth in terms of a ‘networked parhessia’, which entails a radical transformation of the process of truth-telling in support of whistle-blowers and in pursuit of an explicitly emancipatory, anarchist political agenda. Networked parhessia provides a new infrastructure to enable a ‘parhessia of the governed’. This article demonstrates how WikiLeaks is of singular importance as a case study of organizational resistance in the way it moves...

Title: Authentic leadership in context: An analysis of banking CEO narratives during the global financial crisis
Author-Name: Helena Liu
Author-Name: Leanne Cutcher
Author-Name: David Grant
Abstract: The concept of authentic leadership rose to prominence through its idealization as an inherently moral and universally desirable trait. We problematize this romantic notion by exploring how the ‘authenticity’ of the CEOs of four major Australian banks was discursively constructed before and during the global financial crisis (GFC). Using multimodal discourse analysis of media texts, we show how what it meant to be an ‘authentic leader’ was co-constructed differently by the CEOs and the media. We also highlight the dynamic nature of context, where the GFC was variously framed by and for each of the CEOs. Our study challenges the acontextual notion of authentic leadership by showing how a discursively constructed context can reinforce or undermine leaders’ narratives of authenticity.

Title: Not all brokers are alike: Creative implications of brokering networks in different work functions
Author-Name: Diego Stea
Author-Name: Torben Pedersen
Abstract: Brokers are expected to be more creative than employees embedded in closed social structures because they occupy a position in the social space that provides them with access to non-redundant knowledge. However, the extant research provides partly inconsistent findings on the creative implications of brokerage, which raises important questions about when and how brokering between otherwise disconnected colleagues leads to individual creativity. We advance the relational perspective on individual creativity by adopting a contingency view, and showing that a curvilinear (inverted U-shape) specification of the relationship between brokerage and creativity applies particularly when brokers work in research and development, as they are more likely to intensively exploit their structural opportunities. In addition, we show that brokers who work in research and development are more sensitive to work environments that protect their cognitive resources, such that they exhibit greater creativity when the work envir...

Author-Name: Jason Kanov

Author-Name: Neil D Walshe
Abstract: This article elaborates the organizational literature’s process theory of compassion – an empathic response to suffering – which falls short of adequately explaining why and how compassion unfolds readily in some workplace situations or settings but not in others. We address this shortcoming by calling attention to the basic uncertainty of suffering and compassion, demonstrating that this uncertainty tends to be particularly pronounced in organizational settings, and presenting propositions that explain how such uncertainty inhibits the compassion process. We then argue that understanding the accomplishment of compassion in the midst of uncertainty necessitates regarding compassion as an enactment of courage, and we incorporate insights from the organizational literature on everyday courageous action into compassion theory. We conclude with a discussion of implications in which we underscore the importance of organizational support for the expression of suffering and the doing of compassion, and we also c...

Title: Power, corruption and lies: Mis-selling and the production of culture in financial services
Author-Name: Matthew J Brannan
Abstract: The extent of recent misconduct in retail financial services questions assumptions that mis-selling is perpetrated by rogue traders dealing in sub-prime markets. Yet we know little about the organizational dimensions of mis-selling and specifically how new employees are introduced to and subsequently enact mis-selling behaviour when not explicitly encouraged to do so. This article seeks to understand the mechanics of mis-selling through an ethnographic account of the opening of a new retail financial services call centre, and analysis of the ritual nature of the sales interaction. The study documents the training, induction and initial work of direct sales agents to better understand the complexity, social relations and organization of mis-selling, together with the way in which regulation and management regimes shape sales practice and consequent employee behaviour. The critical analysis of sales rituals allows us to explain how mis-selling becomes embedded in organizational practice and contributes to o...

Title: A realist alternative to meta-analysis: Two papers
Author-Name: Paul K Edwards
Abstract: Meta-analysis (the statistical combination of a set of studies in a given area, with the aim of establishing an overall or average effect of something) is increasingly common in work and organization studies. Critiques of meta-analysis are now common. There is also a well-known alternative based in realism. The purpose in bringing together the two papers by Nielsen and Miraglia and by Vincent and colleagues is not to rehearse the critiques or simply explain realism or realist evaluation. The two papers certainly perform these functions in setting out problems with meta-analysis and also identifying when and to what extent it remains valid. The goal, however, is to move forward by showing what a realist synthesis would look like and illustrating how it works. Vincent and colleagues lay out the principles, while Nielsen and Miraglia take the case of intervention studies to show how realist evaluation works.

Abstract: Meta-analysis has proved increasingly popular in management and organization studies as a way of combining existing empirical quantitative research to generate a statistical estimate of how strongly variables are associated. Whilst a number of studies identify technical, procedural and practical limitations of meta-analyses, none have yet tackled the meta-theoretical flaws in this approach. We deploy critical realist meta-theory to argue that the individual quantitative studies, upon which meta-analysis relies, lack explanatory power because they are rooted in quasi-empiricist meta-theory. This problem, we argue, is carried over in meta-analyses. We then propose a ‘critical realist synthesis’ as a potential alternative to the use of meta-analysis in organization studies and social science more widely.

Title: Work–life management in legal prostitution: Stigma and lockdown in Nevada’s brothels
Author-Name: Sarah Jane Blithe
Author-Name: Anna Wiederhold Wolfe
Abstract: Across occupations, people contend with the difficult task of managing time between their work and other aspects of life. Previous research on stigmatized industries has suggested that so-called ‘dirty workers’ experience extreme identity segmentation between these two realms because they tend to cope with their occupational stigma by placing distance between their work and personal lives. Through a qualitative study of Nevada’s legal brothel industry, this article focuses on the prevalence of boundary segmentation as a dominant work–life management practice for dirty workers. Our analysis suggests that work–life boundaries are disciplined by legal mythologies and ambiguities surrounding worker restrictions, occupational ideologies of ‘work now, life later,’ and perceived and experienced effects of community-based stigma. These legal, occupational and community constructs ultimately privilege organizations’ and external communities’ interests, while individual dirty workers carry the weight of stigma.

Abstract: This article explores how postfeminist and prosperity gospel discourses intersect in an organizational context to produce a particular ideal of feminine subjectivity that reproduces a neoliberal agenda. We focus on narratives written by female national vice presidents in a multi-national network marketing organization headquartered in America. Network marketing tends to attract a vast number of women who are enticed by grand messages of material and spiritual riches; however, such messages are often at odds with the precarious and uncertain working conditions. We contribute to gender and organization scholarship by introducing the concept of evangelical entrepreneurial femininity to explore the tensions and demands that are placed on women in an organizational context where postfeminism and prosperity gospel discourses intersect. In doing so, we question the expectations and constraints that many working women negotiate in this neoliberal age of alleged ‘freedom’ and ‘equality,’ and raise a number of conc...

Title: Beneath the white gaze: Strategic self-Orientalism among Chinese Australians
Author-Name: Helena Liu
Abstract: This article analyses the ethno-cultural identities of Chinese Australian professionals through a postcolonial lens. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 21 participants, it explores how they engaged in self-Orientalism; casting themselves as exotic commodities for the benefit of white people and institutions. In particular, they enacted Chinese stereotypes through ‘mythtapping’ and ‘mythkeeping’ in order to secure recognition under the white gaze. As mythtappers, professionals presented themselves as custodians of an ancient and mysterious culture that offered organizational wisdoms for ‘the West.’ As mythkeepers, the professionals allayed white anxieties by surrendering themselves to white Australians as pathways into their communities. However, the professionals’ Orientalized identities are not passively determined, but are in some cases tactically and strategically resisted through ‘mythbusting.’ The article contributes to postcolonial theorizing by demonstrating how imperialist ideologies constrain th...

Abstract: Systematic research considering job context as affecting ethnic discrimination in hiring is limited. Building on contemporary literature on social categorization and cognitive matching, the interactive effect of context characteristics (client contact; industry status) and person characteristics (i.e. ethnic cues: Maghreb/Arab vs Flemish-sounding name; dark vs light skin tone) were investigated using an experimental field study among 424 white majority HR professionals. Findings showed that equally qualified applicants with a dark skin tone received lower job suitability ratings than applicants with a light skin tone, particularly when they were screened for high client contact/low industry status positions and low client contact/high industry status positions. It is concluded that some ethnic cues (such as skin tone) may be more salient compared with other cues and that job context may influence the salience of ethnic cues and steer hiring discrimination in subtle ways. Implications of these findings for...

Abstract: Participatory intervention approaches that are embedded in existing organizational structures may improve the efficiency and effectiveness of organizational interventions, but concrete tools are lacking. In the present article, we use a realist evaluation approach to explore the role of kaizen, a lean tool for participatory continuous improvement, in improving employee well-being in two cluster-randomized, controlled participatory intervention studies. Case 1 is from the Danish Postal Service, where kaizen boards were used to implement action plans. The results of multi-group structural equation modeling showed that kaizen served as a mechanism that increased the level of awareness of and capacity to manage psychosocial issues, which, in turn, predicted increased job satisfaction and mental health. Case 2 is from a regional hospital in Sweden that integrated occupational health processes with a pre-existing kaizen system. Multi-group structural equation modeling revealed that, in the intervention group, k...

Title: Who gets to lead the multinational team? An updated status characteristics perspective
Author-Name: Minna Paunova
Abstract: This article examines the emergence of informal leadership in multinational teams. Building on and extending status characteristics theory, the article proposes and tests a model that describes how global inequalities reproduce in multinational teams, and accounts for who gets to lead these teams. It is argued that an individual’s language (i.e. a specific status characteristic) and nationality (i.e. a diffuse status characteristic) predict deference received from peers (i.e. leadership status). However, individuals enhance and/or compensate for the effects of their status characteristics by virtue of their core self-evaluations. A study of over 230 individuals from 46 nationalities working in 36 self-managing teams generally supports the expected main and moderation effects. Individual core self-evaluations enhance an otherwise weak effect of English proficiency, but compensate for low levels of national development. The article concludes with implications for practice, and linking micro- and macro-level...

Author-Name: Margarita Mayo

Abstract: In the last 22 years, research on diversity in teams has been propelled by information processing and social categorization theories, and more recently, by theories of disparity/(in)justice and access to external networks. These theories stress different diversity processes, treating team diversity respectively as variety of information, as separation, as disparity, and as variety of access. We appraise this literature by identifying major problems in the way these four foundational theories are used either alone or in combination, arguing that the related theoretical models are inherently incomplete and static. In an attempt to resolve these problems, we introduce a metatheoretical framework that relates these four foundational theories according to the metadimensions of group boundary and diversity mindset. We also propose a metatheoretical model that identifies interactions among the four diversity processes and specifies diversity response patterns to team success or failure over time. Our metatheoret...

Abstract: How do corporations attempt to regulate the ways middle managers draw on discourses centred on ‘effectiveness’ and ‘ethics’ in their identity work, and how do these individuals respond? We analyse the discursive struggle over what it meant to be a competent manager at Disneyland, where middle managers were encouraged to construe their selves in ways that emphasized ‘being effective’ over ‘being ethical’, and managers responded with identity work that positioned them as searching for the practical wisdom (phronesis) to make decisions that were both effective and moral. The theoretical contribution we make is twofold. First, we analyse processes of identity regulation and identity work at Disneyland, highlighting divergences between corporate injunctions and middle managers’ appropriations of them, regarding what it meant to be a practically wise manager. Second, we discuss a phronetic identity narrative template, contestable both by organizations and managers, in which people are positioned as questing for...

Abstract: Using mixed methods, this article examines the role of body art as a form of branded labour in customer-facing jobs. It brings together employee selection and relationship marketing into one framework, and uniquely conceptualizes body art as an asset in the labour market, rather than the traditional liability. In Study 1, 192 respondents with management experience participated in an online laboratory experiment in which they were asked to rate photographs of tattooed and non-tattooed job applicants in two hypothetical organizations: a fine dining restaurant and a popular nightclub. In Study 2, 20 in-depth, qualitative interviews were carried out with managers, tattooed front-line employees and potential consumers in two real-world service sector firms. The results show how body art can be strategically used to positively convey the brand of organizations, primarily those targeting a younger, ‘edgier’ demographic of customer.

Abstract: We conducted this realist evaluation study of an organizational health intervention involving 421 low-skilled workers (50% female), half of whom were immigrants, in three companies over six months. Non-profit agencies implemented peer-mentoring and taught peer-mentors and line managers how to enhance social support in order to improve workers’ work situation in a participative way. We formulated five mechanisms of change: the company management encouragement mechanism, the role model mechanism, the peer-mentor support mechanism, the line manager support mechanism, and the participative work improvement mechanism. We combined realist evaluation with a quasi-experimental design and process evaluation in a multi-methods approach. Results of multiple group latent change models and qualitative research showed that intervention-group workers perceived increases in peer-mentor support but not in line manager support. Peer-mentors managed to initiate high-quality improvements at work. Intervention-group workers s...

We identify four types of boundary work that sourcing agents used to manage combinations of accommodative and non-accommodative buyers and suppliers in order to work through boundaries created by buyers’ liability of foreignness: reinforcing, flexing (type 1 and 2) and restoring. We also found four essential conditions for a sourcing agent to become an effective boundary spanner in practice: acquiring knowledge about the rel...

Abstract: In this critical essay, we respond to Lindebaum’s argument that neuroscientific methodologies and data have been accepted prematurely in proposing novel management theory. We acknowledge that building new management theories requires firm foundations. We also find his distinction between demand and supply-side forces helpful as an analytical framework identifying the momentum for the contemporary production of management theory. Nevertheless, some of the arguments Lindebaum puts forward, on closer inspection, can be contested, especially those related to the supply side of organizational cognitive neuroscience research: functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data, motherhood statements and ethical concerns. We put forward a more positive case for organizational cognitive neuroscience methodologies and data, as well as clarifying exactly what organizational cognitive neuroscience really means, and its consequences for the development of strong management theory.

We identify the cultural basis of regulation, show how it operates through specific norms, and detail how it implies gender. Based on an empirical study of men and women in management who are passionate about their healthy and fit bodies and athletic lifestyles, we demonstrate how norms set by managerial athleticism – understood as a particular regulative regime – operate through three discursive practices: perfecting the body, advocating against non-fit bodies, and becoming a role model. We show how the norms operate in both explicit and abject fashion and how they are implied in masculine language and materialized in physical (athletic) bodies. We offer new insights on how bodily identity regulation occurs and elucidate the gendered complexity and contradicti...

Title: Trajectories and antecedents of integration in mergers and acquisitions: A comparison of two longitudinal studies
Author-Name: Martin R Edwards
Author-Name: Jukka Lipponen
Author-Name: Tony Edwards
Author-Name: Marko Hakonen
Abstract: Despite existing research examining snapshots of employee reactions to organizational mergers and acquisitions (M&A), there is a complete absence of work theorizing or exploring rates of change in employees’ organizational identification with the merged entity. We address this gap using two three-wave longitudinal panel samples from different M&A settings, tracking change in identification through a two-year period. Theorizing trajectories of change in identification across the organizations in both settings, we make predictions linked to expected antecedents of change in identification. Our research context (M&A-1) involves a merger of three Finish universities tracking 938 employees from each organization in three waves (nine months pre-merger to 24 months post-merger). Our second context (M&A-2) involves a multinational acquisition tracking 346 employees from both the acquired and acquiring organization in three waves (from two to 26 months post-acquisition). Using Latent Growth Modelling, we confirm p...

Title: Different ways new information technologies influence conventional organizational practices and employment relationships: The case of cybervetting for personnel selection
Author-Name: Brenda L Berkelaar
Abstract: Cybervetting – employers’ use of online information from social media and search engines to evaluate job candidates – may displace, supplement or shape conventional personnel selection and employment relationships in unexpected ways. Analysis of 45 interviews suggests that typically extractive approaches to cybervetting have the potential to displace less recognized, yet valuable, relational functions of more interactive practices depending on the functions and values users apply to the adoption and use of particular information and communication technologies. These findings highlight the need to consider how people implicitly and explicitly compare the functions of emerging technology-enabled practices with conventional organizational practices and salient values to understand when an emerging practice may displace, supplement or have no effect on a conventional practice. This study offers a preliminary framework for understanding how emerging sociotechnical practices evolve and with what effect, thereby...

Title: Casual employment and long-term wage outcomes
Author-Name: Irma Mooi-Reci
Author-Name: Mark Wooden
Abstract: Temporary and other forms of non-standard employment are an important feature of modern labour markets. Yet, relatively little is known about how much and under what circumstances such employment arrangements impact on long-term wage outcomes. Using longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey spanning the period 2001 to 2014, we examine how employment status earlier in a working career is associated with subsequent wage dynamics. Particular attention is paid to how wage trajectories vary with gender and age. Estimates from a series of panel data models of real hourly wages reveal that among men there is an average long-run penalty from casual employment of about 10%, suggestive of scarring effects. Nevertheless, for men in most age groups this wage penalty does eventually begin to shrink. Among prime-age men, however, there is no evidence of catch-up; indeed, for this group the wage gap widens over time. Among women the estimated average long-run wage penal...

Title: Proactivity routines: The role of social processes in how employees self-initiate change
Author-Name: Heather C Vough
Author-Name: Uta K Bindl
Author-Name: Sharon K Parker
Abstract: Proactive work behaviors are self-initiated, future-focused actions aimed at bringing about changes to work processes in organizations. Such behaviors occur within the social context of work. The extant literature that has focused on the role of social context for proactivity has focused on social context as an overall input or output of proactivity. However, in this article we argue that the process of engaging in proactive work behavior (proactive goal-striving) may also be a function of the social context in which it occurs. Based on qualitative data from 39 call center employees in an energy-supply company, we find that in a context characterized by standardized work procedures, proactive goal-striving can occur through a proactivity routine – a socially constructed and accepted pattern of action by which employees initiate and achieve changes to work processes, with the support of managers and colleagues. Our findings point to the need to view proactive work behaviors at a higher level of analysis th...

Title: The shaping of sustainable careers post hearing loss: Toward greater understanding of adult onset disability, disability identity, and career transitions
Author-Name: David C Baldridge
Author-Name: Mukta Kulkarni
Abstract: Through this interview-based study with 40 respondents in the United States we have outlined enablers of career transitions and sustainable careers for professionals who have experienced severe hearing loss as adults. To sustain careers after adult onset disability, respondents engaged in a quest for meaning and big picture answers to ‘who am I?’ and ‘am I still successful?’ This included redefining themselves – e.g. I am now both a person with a disability (disability identity) and a successful professional (professional identity) – and career success (e.g. now I care about service to society as much as I care about material artifacts). Respondents also adopted new work roles where disability was a key to success (e.g. becoming an equal employment officer) and utilized social networks to continue being successful. Such redefining of work and networks supported the aforesaid quest for meaning and big picture answers. Findings not only indicate how individuals experience career success after a life-changin...

Title: Work–family interface in the context of career success: A qualitative inquiry
Author-Name: Mina Beigi

Author-Name: Michael B Arthur
Abstract: Work–family researchers are increasingly recognizing the need to expand their focus to advance the field. One population largely neglected by work–family researchers is individuals who have been extremely successful in their careers. In addition, organizational career scholars have largely neglected the interplay between employees’ work and family lives. This study contributes to the work–family literature by studying work–family interface (WFI) in the context of career success. We sought to explore the lived experiences of 28 distinguished professors who are among the top 2–5% of scholars in their field, to provide an in-depth understanding of their WFI and the prominent factors affecting it over their careers. Our findings have theoretical implications for both work–family and career success literatures.

Title: When too many are not enough: Human resource slack and performance at the Dutch East India Company (1700–1795)
Author-Name: Stoyan V Sgourev
Author-Name: Wim van Lent
Abstract: Slack is an elusive concept in organizational research, with studies documenting a variety of relationships between slack and firm performance. We advocate treating slack not as a resource, but as a practice – a sequence of events and responses over time. A longitudinal analysis of the Dutch East India Company (1700–1795) highlights the use of slack as a response to a resource constraint (the shortage of skilled labor). After documenting the negative performance effects of skill shortage, we identify a trade-off in the use of human resource slack (number of sailors above what is operationally required), in which slack enhanced operational reliability, but reduced efficiency. Derived from a historical context, this trade-off has contemporary relevance and is helpful in reconciling contradictory evidence on slack.

Title: Frontiers in Group Dynamics
Author-Name: Kurt Lewin
Abstract: In the first of these articles, those aspects of group life which can be represented as an equilibrium in a phase space were considered. In the discussion of social equilibrium it was emphasized that for understanding social events, and for planning social action, a reference from the phase space to the total social field is usually necessary. As an example of such an analysis of a social field, certain problems of social channels will be discussed briefly in this second article. We shall then consider some general problems of social planning, with particular reference to the role of “action research ” in bringing about social change.

Abstract: The present paper deals with an effort to combine the resources of social dynamic psychology in exploring patterns of social, motivational and cognitive factors in children that may contribute to their attitudes towards important social issues. To diagnose or anticipate these patterns at an age where the modifiability is relatively great and where educational efforts can be applied on a wide scale seems ofparticular importance.

Title: Proactive Differentiation, Sequence Restraint, and the Asymmetry of Power: A                 Multidimensional Analysis
Author-Name: Louis N. Gray
Author-Name: Bruce H. Maybew, Jr.
Abstract: A variety of factors affect the configurations of power relations and communication systems observed in human groups, only a few of which are relatively well understood. Previous research has made it clear, for instance, that the communication structure of a group may have important implications for the power structure (Bales, et al., 1951; Homans & Reiken, 1954; Leik, 1967; Gray, et al., 1968; Richardson, et al., 1969; von Broembsen, et al., 1969). Nevertheless, the kinds of effects which may be observed can be expected to vary with situational aspects confronting the group and the understanding of these factors may be crucial to the development of reasonably precise organizational theory. This paper examines a relationship involving (1) the differentiation of participation by group members in the communication process, (2) formal restraint upon the communication structure, and (3) the relative symmetry or asymmetry of interpersonal power relations measured on three separate dimensions. Previous research...

Title: The Effects of Subordinates' Behaviour on Managerial Style
Author-Name: Bruce J. Crowe
Author-Name: Stephen Bochner
Author-Name: Alfred W. Clark
Abstract: A manager faced with variations in subordinates' behaviour will accommodate his behaviour to fit the interpersonal circumstances. This will happen even if it means reversing a stated preference for a particular managerial style. This hypothesis was tested in a laboratory experiment. Subjects acted as managers working with subordinates to devise an itinerary for a visiting head office executive. In a 2 x 2 design, democratic and autocratic managers, classified according to scores on a leadership belief scale, were assigned both democratic and autocratic subordinates. On observing their responses, it was found that both types of managers behaved democratically with democratic subordinates and autocratically with autocratic subordinates. The results show that subordinates' influence is strong enough to bring about a response from managers that is opposite to their own preference. The influence of subordinates, therefore, must be included in theories that seek to understand the manager-subordinate relationshi...

Title: Communication Network Research: An Examination of Controversies
Author-Name: Alvin M. Snadowsky
Abstract: This study was concerned with the salient issues in communication network research. When the organizational phase was separated from the operational phase of problem-solving, centralization was adequate in both phases where the probems were simple symbol identification tasks. Although a centralized operational procedure also was adopted by all groups solving complex arithmetic tasks, the decentralized network permitted the organizational flexibility necessary for considering various possibilities before formulating a method. During the organizational period the authoritarian leader imposed structure in the decentralized network and the democratic leader worked to overcome the restrictions in the centralized network. Authoritarian-led groups required less time for planning than democratic-led groups, but the former were less efficient in solving the taks.

Title: Identification and Personal Learning in T-Groups
Author-Name: David R. Peters
Abstract: The importance and impact of the practice of laboratory training have been increasingly recognized in recent years. However, as with most innovatory techniques of social change, invention and creativeness in practice have far outstripped our systematic knowledge of the internal dynamics of laboratory training and its results. Several general models suggest broad stages of group development or list some conditions of personal learning-although seldom have these models been accompanied by systematic research. However, as several reviews have noted (Stock, 1964; Schein & Bennis, 1965; Lieberman et al, 1969) these general models do not seem to deal adequately with the intrapersonal dynamics of the learning process and the phenomenology of the participant. This research project aimed to examine some fundamental questions: how, more precisely, do people learn in laboratory training; what dynamic mechanisms and specific theory of learning are involved; and what relation does this personal learning process have t...

Title: Some Developmental Correlates of Scarcity
Author-Name: Lawrence K. Williams
Abstract: Investigating the 'culture of poverty' is currently in vogue. Given the recent focus on the poor within the United States, the values, family structure, and behavior of the poor are being examined and re-examined. If nothing else, this activity seems to be uncovering the fact that the poor in the United States are not unlike the poor of many other cultures. Most of the research has been, and is, centered on the adult; in particular, on the discrepancies between the adult poor and the 'Protestant ethic' middle class society as it is reflected, if not in the reality of the middle class itself, at least in the mind of the reseacher.This paper explores the development and maintenance of the value system associated with the poor by focusing on the concept of scarcity.2 Further, it attempts to explain the transmission of these values through child-training activities; that is, to dig beneath the vague concept of socialization. The base for the research reported here is in Peru. Learning theory models are examin...

Title: Perceptions and Factions in a Therapeutic Community
Author-Name: Peter Sheldrake
Author-Name: Brian Turner
Abstract: This paper presents a study of the perceptions and beliefs, the cognitive structures, found among staff members of a psychiatric ward in a British Psychiatric Hospital.1 It is based on the analysis of data from a cognitive grid test, which was devised during field research.2 The evidence suggests that members of small groups do not share a single, common structure of perceptions and beliefs, rather that a complex relationship exists between the social structure of the group and the beliefs its members hold. Cognitive structure or organization here refers to the degree of rigidity or flexibility that characterizes an individual's perceptions. It is suggested that a person who is highly structured perceives in a more global way than a person who is less structured. The data from the cognitive grid test offer a partial insight into whatever cognitive structures might exist with a group.3 The guiding hypothesis of the present study is that, contrary to previous assumptions, especially by those working in comp...

Title: Situational Determinants of Equitable Behavior
Author-Name: Kerry Thomas
Abstract: Adams' dissonance-based equity theory is compared with a normative approach based on the value-expectancy-normative (VEN) model of social behaviour. This alternative view of equity phenomena avoids difficulties associated with consistency theory by attributing motivation to reduce inequity to conformity with an equity norm. It retains most of the behavioural predictions of Adams' model but emphasizes the effect of situational factors known to influence conformity. It is suggested that the VEN model is particularly useful for predicting behaviour in cases of profitable inequity where self-interest and equitable behaviour are in conflict. In the first experiment high and low profitable inequity were induced by two levels of overpayment, and reward re-allocation examined under two 'surveillance' conditions. Reward re-allocation occurred as predicted by Adams, but the effect of magnitude of inequity on outcome choice supported the VEN prediction rather than predictions derived from Adams' somewhat ambiguous s...

Title: The Need-hierarchy and Theories of Authority
Author-Name: David D. Van Fleet
Abstract: The need-heirarchy concept and three theories of authority (Formal, Situationist, and Acceptance) are reviewed, and an integrated framework for discussing their interrelationships and importance to organization theory and human relations is developed. The formal theory may be useful in discussions of profit-seeking, formal organizations, but in explaining individual behavior it uses only the lower order needs and expressive behavior. The situationist approach is applicable to a wider range of organizations and uses higher level needs in explaining individual behavior, but does not fully account for the impact of the individual upon his environment. The Acceptance Theory can be used in discussing any form of organization and, in addition, recognizes the full impact of the individual in those organizations using the full range of needs as well as both coping and expressive behavior. The Acceptance Theory is, then, the more general, more inclusive, and more applicable basis for a theory of authority.

Title: Group Member Traits, Group Process, and Group Performance
Author-Name: James R. Sorenson
Abstract: A laboratory study utilizing sixteen three-man groups varying in member trait composition was executed using measures of group task behavior as well as group performance. The research suggests the fruitfulness of employing measures of group composition, task behavior, and group performance simultaneously. The data suggest that the two group member traits studied, remote associates proficiency and social differentiation had an effect on group performance by shaping the quantity and distribution of both evaluative and elaborative behaviors of the groups. The traits also had an effect on group performance by molding the amount of group conflict generated over the discussion of alternative solutions to group problems.

Title: Retroactive Inhibition of Cognitive Dissonance by Increasing Intensity of Counter-advocacy
Author-Name: John C. Touhey
Abstract: To examine the applicability of Bern's self-perception theory to the reversal of cognitive dissonance, subjects wrote counter-attitudinal essays under conditions of high and low choice and were provided either no feedback or bogus feedback designed to increase their judgments of the strength, effectiveness and extremeness of their counter-advocacy. Bogus feedback reversed 74 per cent of the attitude change shown by subjects who wrote under conditions of high choice without feedback. Low choice subjects in both feedback conditions and control subjects showed no change. The findings are interpreted in terms of communicator credibility and it is proposed that additional variables identified by the self-perception theory might effectively inhibit attitude changes induced by cognitive dissonance.

Title: The Physical Correlates of Variety in Work
Author-Name: John W. Dickson
Abstract: The level of variety in work in four shop floor work situations was investigated by means of semi-structured interviews with the workers. Variety was found to occur mainly at the level of batches (that is work units of one to two hours duration) and was generally unimportant in other periods of time. Discretion in work enabled the job occupants to possess more variety in work through allowing different responses to the same stimuli of the work situation. Preferences for different levels of variety were affected by such features of the work situation as bonus earnings and individual levels of skill on particular tasks.

Title: Violence and Vietnam: a Comparison between Attitudes of Civilians and Veterans
Author-Name: David Brady
Author-Name: Leon Rappoport
Abstract: Based on a multidimensional concept of violence, this study introduces a questionnaire permitting the assessment of general and specific orientations toward violence, and compares responses obtained from six representative groups: middle-aged males, females, college males, females, enlisted Vietnam veterans, and serving field grade officers. Findings indicate that among the civilian groups, middle-aged males are most positive toward violence, while college females are least positive. In the enlisted veteran and officer samples, those who report heavy combat experience have the highest general violence scores. Factor analyses reveal specific attitude patterns for the different samples, with violence in the service of law and order being the major dimension of response variance. Several implications are discussed.

Author-Name: Arthur M. Cohen

Abstract: This study investigated the effects of repression-sensitization communication network change, task change, and situation change on leadership continuity. Twenty-four five-man groups, homogeneously composed of either repressers or sensitizers, participated in a wheel network, a completely-connected network, and a leaderless group discussion (LGD) setting. Before the LGD setting they received either a success, failure, or no evaluation. Represser groups exhibited greater leadership continuity than sensitizer groups between the wheel and the completely-connected networks. However, through the three group settings, discontinuity tended to predominate regardless of personality or evaluation. A secondary analysis of the data investigated the reasons for these findings.

Title: Factors Influencing Intentions and the Intention-Behavior Relation
Author-Name: Icek Ajzen
Author-Name: Martin Fisbbein
Abstract: Communicative and compliance behaviors of subjects working in three-person groups were predicted. Consistent with Fishbein's modified version of Dulany's theory of propositional control, subjects' intentions to perform these behaviors correlated highly with their attitudes toward the behaviors and with their normative beliefs about the behaviors, multiplied by their motivation to comply with the norms. Behavioral intentions correlated significantly with behavior, although intervening events were found to attenuate the intention-behavior relation. Measuring intentions after these intervening events had occurred, or taking the intervening events into account, was shown to improve behavioral prediction. These findings were compared with prediction of behavior from traditional attitude measures.

Title: A Subcultural Account of Media Effects
Author-Name: Dennis Howitt
Author-Name: Richard Dembo
Abstract: Most laboratory and field studies into media effect have focussed on aggressive drive or attitude. Overall, their results suggest that a relationship exists between media violence and personal aggression -though the findings are by no means clear-cut. In contrast to this assessment, the present paper asserts that the mass media exert no proven influence at all. Reinterpreting previous work and discussing the findings of new research, we argue that a subcultural explanation is the most promising way of synthesizing their results and expanding the limited insight into media impact provided by the effects paradigm. The influence of the media can only be gauged by understanding the social and cultural conditions in which the media-audience relationship takes hold.

Title: Expectancy Theory in Work and Motivation: Some Logical and Methodological Issues
Author-Name: Mabmoud A. Wabba
Author-Name: Robert J. House
Abstract: The development of expectancy theory is described and 14 alternative models of expectancy are contrasted. It is argued that the essence of the theory in work and motivation is the choice of work behavior. As such, it is shown that the present formulation of theory in industrial and organizational psychology, and consequently the empirical research based on it, ignores the rationality assumptions underlying this choice behavior. Some of these assumptions are specified. It is pointed out that the major constructs of the theory (expectancy and valence) lack the necessary theoretical classification. Several issues in need for further research are discussed. The concept of instrumentality is found to be ambiguous and difficult to operationalize. Finally, it is shown that the typical formulation of the theory is based on optimization choice criteria (maximizing or satisficing) and the empirical validity of these criteria is questioned. Alternative criteria are proposed. The empirical findings in the field are i...

Title: Towards an Array of Organizational Control Modalities
Author-Name: John W. Sutherland
Abstract: This paper explores the proposition that environmental field properties tend to determine both the structural and behavioral aspects of the organizations resident in the fields. In what is largely a speculative exercise then, I attempt to define four ideal-type environmental fields, from which four ideal-type organizations may be derived. To lend the analysis some prescriptive or operational significance for the social theorist, I then attempt to show why there is a unique organizational control modality appropriate for each of the ideal-types. Finally, these four organizational control modalities will be shown to be potentially useful as cornerstones for a generalized theory of organizational behavior.

Title: Factors of Satisfaction and Importance in an Academic Setting
Author-Name: Yehuda Amir
Author-Name: Mosbe Krausz
Abstract: In order to examine aspects of Herzberg's two-factor theory of satisfaction in an academic setting, 262 students were studied. Specific aims of the study were: (a) identification of Motivation and Hygiene variables in an academic setting, and examination of the relationship between them; (b) identification of factors of importance and satisfaction, and examination of the similarity between them. The results do not support Herzberg's notion that gratification of Motivation factors contributes principally to the presence of satisfaction whereas non-gratification of Hygiene factors creates dissatisfaction. Furthermore, no support was found for the two-factor theory based on the factor analysis of satisfaction items. However, importance of satisfaction items could easily be divided into Motivation and Hygiene factors, suggesting that the two-factor theory may be more suited to the importance of variables than to satisfaction with them.

Title: Effects of Medium of Communication on Experimental Negotiation
Author-Name: J. A. Short
Abstract: Pairs of subjects performed a simple negotiation task over one of three media of communication (face-to-face, closed circuit television, or a loud-speaking audio link). One person was required to argue a case which was consonant with his personal views; the other person was required to argue a case that bore no necessary relationship to his personal views. Medium of communication had a significant effect on the outcome of the negotiation: the side whose case was consonant with his personal views was more successful under face-to-face than under audio-only communication. Results in the video condition resembled those in the face-to-face condition. The findings are interpreted in terms of a greater emphasis on interpersonal considerations (as opposed to interparty considerations) in face-to-face discussions than in audio discussions.

Title: Power and Prestige Through Music in Tsongaland
Author-Name: Thomas F. Johnston
Abstract: This paper outlines the role of communal music in the social institutions of the Tsonga of Mozambique and the Northern Transvaal, and how it serves to enhance the power and prestige of the chiefs controlling these institutions. It is shown how musical performances mirror social stratification, and how various musical practices such as the visiting team-dancing at neighboring courts reflects the occupational roles, rivalries, and social allegiances of performers and audiences. The acquirement of chiefly power and prestige hinges in some cases upon innovative musical behavior and musical diffusion, particularly of possession cults, which have a large following.

Title: The Effect of Interpersonal Values on Laboratory Training: An Empirical Investigation
Author-Name: Ralph H. Kilmann
Abstract: The present study investigated the effect of participant and trainer Interpersonal Value Constructs (IVC's) on the behavior and experiences that took place in eight sensitivity training groups. IVC's were defined as: mental categories through which an individual perceives and interprets the desirable and undesirable features of interpersonal behavior. The assessment of IVC's was by a scaled projective technique: the Kilmann Insight Test (KIT). Results suggest that interpersonal values as communicated by mostly nonconscious expressions do influence behavior in a T-group. In particular, depending on the match between trainer and participant IVC's (similarities and/or dissimilarities) the participant is more likely to have 'positive' interpersonal experiences in his group. Also, independent of the trainer, the specific IVC's that a participant applies in his group affects other participants becoming attracted to him and developing respect towards him.

Title: Parental Permissiveness as Perceived by the Offspring and the Degree of                 Marijuana Usage Among Offspring
Author-Name: Deryl G. Hunt
Abstract: This survey research, using typological and cross-tabulation procedures with a randomly selected sample of 563 black and white, primarily Catholic-democratic middle-class, undergraduate students from a northern urban university, explored and analyzed the relationships between perceived parental permissiveness (laissez-faire, autocratic, quasi-democratic, and democratic) and the degree of marijuana usage (high, medium and low) among offspring. The following hypotheses were tested and found to obtain: (1) Perceived laissez-faire parent-child relationships lead to high marijuana usage by offspring; (2) Perceived autocratic parent-child relationships lead to medium use of marijuana by offspring; (3) Perceived quasi-democratic parent-child relationships lead to low marijuana usage by offspring; and (4) Perceived democratic parent-child relationships lead to low marijuana usage. In addition, a summary of four intervening variables, age (16-18, 19 and above) sex, race (black, white) and peer group orientation (s...

Title: An Integrative Balance Notation for the Attractiveness-Persuasiveness                 Relationship in Persuasive Communication Versus Forced Compliance
Author-Name: Kalman J. Kaplan
Author-Name: Reuben M. Baron
Abstract: The present paper attempts to employ aspects of the incentive-dissonance controversy regarding the effects of monetary reward in a discussion of the relationship between the likeability or attractiveness of a source and his persuasiveness. To this end 'persuasive communication' and 'forced compliance' are distinguished as two paradigms of social influence. The case is made that a positive attractiveness-persuasiveness relationship follows an incentive rule and has been most strongly supported in the persuasive communication context. In contrast, a negative attractiveness-persuasiveness relation follows a dissonance rule and emerges from the forced-compliance literature. Balance terminology is utilized to molecularly analyze this problem, the separation of 'liking' and 'unit' relations being especially useful in our attempts to diagram the dynamics of forced compliance. Such analysis allows a diagrammatical comparison of the persuasive communication and forced compliance paradigms. In general, our interpre...

Title: Commitment in an Israeli Kibbutz
Author-Name: Helen F. Antonovsky
Author-Name: Aaron Antonovsky
Abstract: This paper attempts to deal with the concept of commitment to a society in the context of a commitment-alienation continuum. Twcr aspects of commitment were measured: cohesion or affective commitment and control or ideological commitment. Data were collected in a society intentionally structured to solve the problem of alienation: a kibbutz in Israel. Measures of the two dimensions of commitment were related to overall satisfaction and a series of ten variables (involving social roles, values and interpersonal relations) which were posited to be significant in the lives of kibbutz members. The main findings were:1. The degree of commitment to the society is positively related to the degree of overall social need satisfaction.2. The degree of commitment tends to be higher the more the individual is satisfied in those areas of life which are important to him.3. Persons occupying roles considered important in the society tend to be more committed to the society than persons occupying less important roles.

Title: Political Sociology in the United States: A Case Study of Theoretical Change                 and Continuity
Author-Name: Philo C. Wasburn
Abstract: Political sociology is viewed as an interdisciplinary hybrid rather than as a subfield of sociology. Nevertheless, some of the basic features of research in political sociology conducted in the United States are those characteristic of American sociology in general. American political sociology has emphasized social-psychological research and has focused on the conditions of the stability of Western political democracies. These and certain other related orientations have handicapped the analysis of protest, violence, change and the political development of non-industrial societies.Confronted by the spectre of worldwide vehement political protest, conflict and change, political sociology seems likely to develop new paradigms to deal with such phenomena. Such paradigms may direct greater attention to the works of anthropologists, economists and traditional political scientists. The paradoxical result would be that American political sociology would appear to become increasingly interdisciplinary while actua...

Author-Name: David C. Lundgren
Author-Name: Dodd H. Bogart
Abstract: The study explores the thesis that group size, as it influences interaction patterns and attitudes of members within the immediate group situation, will affect the orientations toward societal change which become adopted by members. Twenty large (15-member) and twenty small (5-member) groups were compared. The groups were instructed to discuss and reach consensus on a set of conservatism-radicalism items. The findings supported hypotheses concerning: (1) a positive correlation between group size and member dissatisfaction; (2) a positive correlation between member dissatisfaction and group radicalism; and (3) a positive correlation between size and group radicalism. In addition, differences in these trends were observed as a function of sex composition of the groups.

Title: Contingency Theory Applied to Small Business Organizations
Author-Name: Eric H. Neilsen
Abstract: The effects of size on Lawrence and Lorsch's contingency theory of organization, originally derived from these authors' studies of large business firms, were explored by replicating their measures on two small firms operating in separate industries. The results suggest that, while the logic of their formulation holds for small firms as well as large, the forms small firms evolve and the problems they encounter in behaving in ways consistent with this logic differ from those of large firms in a number of ways. In particular, there is less interpersonal and structural differentiation in response to task diversity in the small firms and a more complex relationship between task related differentiation and the quality of relations between departments. Additional field observations also suggest that the effective handling of conflict stemming from non-task related issues is especially difficult in the small firm, while differentiation in response to task diversity and the problems this creates are handled rathe...

Title: Interpersonal Style and the Communication Dilemma: I. Managerial Implications                 of the Johari Awareness Model
Author-Name: Jay Hall
Abstract: The Johari Awareness Model of interpersonal processes was explored as a paradigm for research into interpersonal style and communication practices in organizations. Data from 1,000 managers and 115 MBA graduate students regarding their use of Exposure and Feedback processes in relationships with subordinates, colleagues, and superiors were obtained via the Personnel Relations Survey. In addition, data regarding personality traits were gathered using the MMPI, CPI, and Famous Sayings tests; and information about managerial style preferences was gained from the Styles of Management Inventory. Investigations of the effects of role relationships, managerial orientation, and personality traits on interpersonal processes were made. A number of significant multivariate effects were found suggesting that the Johari model may be a viable tool for dealing with personalistic aspects of the communication dilemma in human systems.

Title: Toward a General Theory of Leadership
Author-Name: William E. Halall
Abstract: This paper presents a theory which is intended to integrate existing knowledge in the field of leadership behavior. Prominent concepts, theories, and research evidence in the literature are synthesized to form a theoretical framework comprising five models of leadership. Each model specifies the conditions of task technology and subordinate motivation for which a particular style of leadership is congruent, thereby resulting in leadership effectiveness. This framework is generalized to derive three propositions which form a tentative general theory of leadership: (1) leadership effectiveness is positively related to congruence; (2) there is a tendency toward congruence and (3) there is a tendency toward evolution.

Abstract: The aim of the study is the examination of the actual process of eruption of the violent act.The study, therefore, concentrates on a stimulus-response interaction and examines the nature of the provocation, the nature of the reaction, and the relationship between the two factors. These three components constitute one cycle, and each cycle acts as a stimulus to the subsequent one.If the first cycle of interaction is not clear to the parties, the interaction will tend to escalate in its intensity until the meaning of Alter's action is clarified; then, if it is perceived as provoking it could erupt into violence. Or, if Alter's meaning was finally defined by Ego as neutral or friendly, the tension will subside and jocular friendship might ensue. However, if the interaction is still ambiguous, the initial cycles might be forgotten, and the subsequent cycles, even if ambiguous, will be defined as provoking, and violence may erupt.

Abstract: In the study reported here, mean scores of the Flexibility and Tolerance for Ambiguity scales of the CPI did not increase significantly following encounter group training. It was found however, that people who sign up for encounter groups are already significantly more flexible than people who do not come to encounter groups. It can be seen then, that the significance of the treatment effect depends more on who goes (volunteers vs. non volunteers) rather than what happens (lecture vs. encounter groups.)

Title: Rejection of the Retiree Role: A Study of Female Industrial Workers in Their 50's
Author-Name: Dan Jacobson
Abstract: Inferences from previous studies on the meaning of work and retirement for older female blue-collar workers are reviewed. Data are reported on willingness to retire and several related attitudinal variables with particular reference to differences between semi-skilled female and male subjects who approach retirement age. Results show that female subjects are less likely to be positively oriented toward retirement than are male Ss. For both sexes, reluctance to retire is associated with expected deprivations of a primarily extrinsic nature. However, among women work-based social ties emerge as the chief correlate of the wish to go on working. It is suggested that female Ss' pre-retirement attitudes are, in part, an extension of their degree of satisfaction with social attributes of the work situation. Their comparatively stronger inclination to remain employed may be affected by a changing life style which becomes less decisively centered on the home and its diminishing range of social options.

Abstract: Ss rated the appropriateness of each of a fixed sample of behaviors in each of a fixed sample of situations. A cluster analysis of the intercorrelations of situations across behaviors yielded four distinct and homogeneous situation clusters. A cluster analysis of the intercorrelations of behaviors across situations produced four homogeneous and distinct behavior clusters. The relationship between the situation clusters and behavior clusters was examined and indicated that certain behavior clusters were uniquely appropriate in certain situation clusters. The implications of these results for (a) the interpretation of behavior X situation interaction effects, (b) situational classification as a basis of scientific concept formation and, (c) the identification of instances of behavior-environment congruence were discussed.

Title: An Experiment on Participation in a Latin American Factory
Author-Name: Richard S. Juralewicz
Abstract: In a field experiment the extent of psychological participation was manipulated for three groups of women operators in the garment industry in Puerto Rico. It was found that a moderate level of participation through representatives led to greater increases in productivity than either a higher level of direct participation or a lower level of indirect participation, again through representatives. This result is compared with that of Coch and French who found that direct participation was more effective than participation through representation. No clear differences were found between the groups on other dependent variables or in the effect of conditioning variables. The main result, as well as trends in the data, suggests that the effects of participation are influenced by cross-cultural variations.

Title: Systems Models, Economic Models and the Causal Texture of Organizational Environments: An Approach to Macro-Organization Theory
Author-Name: J. L. Metcalfe
Abstract: Using analogies from systems theory and economic theory, a more precise specification of the nature of the problem posed by 'turbulent' organizational environments is developed. This analysis points to the need for macro-organizational theory to explain the behaviour of complex interorganizational systems. Models from political theory are used as a basis for studying the integrative problems of pluralistic systems and the process of macro-organizational management. The role of 'second order' and 'network' organizations in developing the capacity of a system to formulate and implement 'macro-policies' is discussed.

Title: Task Environment and Decentralization: A Cross-National Replication
Author-Name: Bernard C. Reimann
Abstract: A study of 19 Northeast Ohio manufacturing firms replicated the major result of a recent study of 30 industrial enterprises in India, in that management concern for task environmental agents was significantly related to the organizations' degree of decentralization. However, where this relationship had been linear in the Indian context, it was curvilinear in the shape of an inverted U in the U.S. setting. For relatively centralized firms a strong positive relationship between decentralization and management concern for task agents was observed, while this relationship actually was negative for the relatively decentralized firms. Some interesting differences between the Indian and American studies were also observed for relationships between decentralization and management concern for individual task agents (such as consumers, suppliers, or employees).In spite of some differences in the measure of both management concern and decentralization between the two studies, the replication of the Indian results in...

Title: Proxemics and Stress: An Empirical Study of the Relationship Between Living Space and Roommate Turnover
Author-Name: Ronald P. Rohner
Abstract: Drawing upon prior work in animal and human proxemics as a general stimulus for .this research, we confirmed the hypothesis that male university students sharing rooms with twinbeds choose new roommates significantly more often than students sharing rooms with bunkbeds. All rooms were the same size and were provided by the university with the same basic furnishings. The critical difference in the two types of rooms appears to lie in the relatively greater living space and visual privacy gained by students in rooms with bunkbeds, one above the other in relation to the loss of visual privacy and more restricted space available to students in rooms with single beds lined against two walls.

Title: A Path Analysis of Variables Influencing Labour Turnover
Author-Name: John S. Gow
Author-Name: Alfred W. Clark
Author-Name: Graham S. Dossett
Abstract: A brief questionnaire was devised to study the determinants of length of service for a sample of 57 former telephone advertisement sales girls. Path analysis was used to explore the hypothesized complex pattern of interrelationships among the variables. It was found that optimal challenge and social integration had direct effects on length of service. Job evaluation, pressure and higher order needs affected length of service indirectly through these two variables. There was a tendency for pressure to lead to negative feelings about management and supervision. These negative feelings heightened perceived optimal challenge which, in turn, had a positive effect on staying in the job. Most of the variables were shown to discriminate between leavers and current employees. It is suggested that these findings and the method used to uncover them provide the basis for a refinement of theories of labour turnover. In general the findings suggest that the properties associated with autonomous work groups increase len...

Title: Structure of Organizations in Occupational Interest Associations
Author-Name: Lex Donaldson
Author-Name: Malcolm Warner
Abstract: This paper reports an extension of the Aston studies of organizational structure to the field of occupational interest associations. The sample consisted of six trade unions and one professional association. The fundamental relationships of the dimensions of organizational structure to each other, and to size (whether number of employees, members or branches), were shown to hold in this new context. A greater Centralization of occupational interest associations than business firms was observed and this was seen as facilitating the exercise of control by the members through the representative institutions. The political processes of representation within such associations is briefly discussed.

Title: Occupational Satisfaction of Farm Husbands and Wives
Author-Name: Lakshmi K. Bharadwaj
Author-Name: Eugene A. Wilkening
Abstract: Data from a sample of 500 Wisconsin farm families provide only partial support for the hypothesis that husbands and wives derive their primary satisfaction with occupational success from aspirations and attainments in their respective role areas. Farm mechanization and level of living best predict the husband's satisfaction, while gross farm income is the single most important predictor of the wife's satisfaction. Also, among aspiration measures, it is the husband's home aspiration that is most predictive of his satisfaction, while his farm aspiration and not the wife's home aspiration best predicts the satisfaction of the wife. The results suggest that in evaluating occupational success the couples utilize different perceptual frameworks which reflect the relative salience of farm and family roles in their lives. The couple's goal orientations and interests do not simply reproduce culturally determined sex-role patterns.

Title: Trainer-Member Influence in T Groups: One-Way or Two-Way?
Author-Name: David C. Lundgren
Abstract: The study examined the influence of trainer attitudes upon member attitudes toward the group, and of member attitudes upon trainer self-attitudes, at early and later time points in seven weekend T Groups. It was found that members accurately perceived trainers' attitudes toward the group and that members' own attitudes corresponded closely with their perceptions of trainer attitudes. At the early time point, self-attitudes of senior trainers showed near-significant negative correlations, and self-attitudes of co-trainers showed low positive correlations, with their perceptions of member attitudes towards themselves. At the later time point, both senior trainer and co-trainer self-attitudes were strongly associated with their perceptions of member attitudes toward themselves but these perceptions bore little relationship to actually reported member attitudes. Trainers showed a strong and consistent tendency to underestimate the favourability of member attitudes towards themselves.

Title: Collective Stress and Community Transformation
Author-Name: David F. Gillespie
Author-Name: Ronald W. Perry
Author-Name: Dennis S. Mileti
Abstract: The research on emergent organizations indicates that they arise during periods of collective stress, serve as transitory social systems providing neglected community inputs and, then, dissolve after the troublesome period has passed (Haas and Drabek, 1973:6; Taylor et. al., 1970:79-108). Quarantelli (1970:4), however, has pointed out that only '... some emergent groups cease to exist when the immediate crisis is over, whereas others become part of a new social order.' The conditions which correspond to such a group becoming an established organization, Quarantelli (1970:11) suggests, '... rest on the new group being defined as one that carries out necessary tasks or activities not the traditional responsibility of already established groups or organizations.' This account may be adequate for depicting community transformation which results from sudden impact disaster agents such as earthquakes, tornadoes, bombings, etc., but it fails to do more than illustrate the 'climate' in which an emergent organizat...

Title: On Structure and Process in Work Motivation
Author-Name: Allen R. Solem
Abstract: Takes the position that work motivation may be viewed as a function of intellectual vs. emotional factors in behavior and relationships between them; the intellectual, reality factors providing situational structure and the emotional aspects yielding the energy supply. Four groups, technical and managerial, (N = 104) were sampled on favorable-unfavorable dimension of factual and objective current work experiences separately from the affective and emotional. Data analysis indicated (a) subjects readily made the distinction; (b) objective factors defined the situational structure; (c) ego-centered factors of interpersonal and object relations yielded emotional experiences; (d) skill may furnish important linkages between structural and emotional experiences. A framework and implications for analysis of work activities and experiences toward increased effectiveness and intrinsic satisfaction from work activity are discussed, together with lines of further current investigation.

Title: The Effects of Extraneous Mass Mediated Stimuli on Power Relations: Some                 Preliminary Findings
Author-Name: Louis N. Gray
Author-Name: Maxmilian H. von Broembsen
Abstract: Five specific directional hypotheses are advanced concerning the effects of extraneous mass mediated stimuli on dyadic power relations as behaviorally defined. The hypotheses generally derive from a simple notion of stimulus confusion and the effects of this confusion both on learning and response probabilities. While only two of the hypotheses show strong statistical significance, all of the hypotheses are directionally correct; an event that would occur only 1/32 of the time under the null hypothesis. The authors conclude that, given their small sample size, the underlying theory may be relatively satisfactory and that it is possible for mass mediated stimuli of an extraneous nature to effect the development of power structures in groups exposed to the media presentations.

Title: Decision Processes, Expectations, and Adoption of Strategies in Zero-Sum Games
Author-Name: John C. Touhey
Abstract: To examine the possibility that expectations and related psychological variables interact with the direction of payoff to determine strategies in zero-sum games, an experiment by Lieberman (1962) was replicated and extended. Subjects played 300 trials on matrixes without saddle points against an opponent's minimax strategy or strategies that increased or decreased payoffs. Findings showed that subjects who received decreased payoffs shifted to minimax strategies but subjects who received increased payoffs exploited the game beyond the values established by the manipulation. Findings of post-experimental interviews indicated that increased payoffs led to relatively accurate expectations and judgments of the game, and two separate individual decision processes are proposed to account for the adoption of mixed strategies.

Title: Machiavellianism, Locus of Control, Aggression, Performance and Precautionary                 Behaviour in Ice Hockey
Author-Name: Gordon W. Russell
Abstract: The sport of hockey served as a setting for the investigation of the relationships between both Machiavellianism and I-E locus of control and three behavioural indices of aggression. Physical aggression, challenge to authority, and total aggression were positively related to Mach V scores and I-E locus of control, the only exception being I-E and physical aggression. Goal scoring, as a performance measure, was positively related to challenge to authority and total aggression while assists were highly correlated with all measures of aggression and I-E locus of control. Measures of precautionary behaviour were generally unrelated to the scales.

Title: Has the Research Challenge to Motivation—Hygiene Theory Been                 Conclusive? An Analysis of Critical Studies
Author-Name: Ben Grigaliunas
Author-Name: Yoash Wiener
Abstract: Since its publication, Motivation-Hygiene (M-H) theory (Herzberg, Mausner and Snyderman, 1959) has made a wide impact on the field of job attitudes and motivation. The theory with its implications has produced a large following of proponents as well as a significant number of critics and has created a major controversy in the history of Industrial Psychology. In 1967, Whitsett and Winslow attempted a detailed analysis of research studies critical to M-H theory. They pointed out that many investigations were characterized by methodological flaws, misrepresentation of results and gross misunderstanding of M-H theory.In the last several years, the number of critical articles has not declined. Some old flaws, pointed out by Whitsett and Winslow, have persisted and new issues have emerged. Many of the critical studies have concluded that M-H theory is not valid. Korman (1971), discussing it in a textbook, stated: 'Conclusions by Dunnette, Campbell, and Hakel (1967) based on their work, as well as that of Ewen,...

Title: Majority and Minority Perceptions and Behavior in Cross-Cultural Teams
Author-Name: Ross A. Webber
Abstract: Four hundred and fifty-six students were constituted into 1 14 four-person cross-cultural teams in which the three man majority in each group were American White Males. An American White Female, American Black Male or Foreign Male was the single minority member. After 13 weeks of joint tasks, data on roles claimed for self and attributed to others were collected by questionnaire and essay. Interviews supplemented the questionnaire.The American White Male majority claimed task leadership for themselves or attributed it to other AWM's. They perceived all minorities as generally following and contributing relatively little. In turn, most minority members did not claim leadership. Those few that did strive for leadership were usually rejected. American White Females tended to respond with complementary stereotypic behavior: they were relatively passive, claimed non-leadership, adhered to group norms and were cooperative. In contrast, American Black, European and Latin American Males tended to violate group no...

Title: A Contingency Approach to Laboratory Learning: Psychological Types Versus                 Experiential Norms
Author-Name: Ralph H. Kilmann
Author-Name: Vern Taylor
Abstract: This study investigated the psychological dynamics and situational factors that determine whether an individual will experience support and/or confrontation in a laboratory setting. The psychological dynamics were represented by C. G. Jung's psychological types and the situational factors were the experiential norms that manifest these psychic functions. A Contingency framework was derived to suggest the conditions that will lead to the acceptance or rejection of the laboratory experience, or to self-awareness and personal growth. The research data give reasonable evidence to this framework, and the implications of the study are given for: (1) the identification of the rejectors of particular laboratory experiences, (2) the design of different laboratories via alternative experiential norms, and (3) the intervention strategies for staff and trainers according to the laboratory setting and goals.

Title: Interactive Effects of Uncertainty and Self-Control on the Acceptance of                 Responsibility for, and Satisfaction with, Performance
Author-Name: Jerry D. Dermer
Abstract: This study investigates the interactive effects of environmental uncertainty and self-control on the acceptance of responsibility for, and the satisfaction with, performance. A sample of graduate management students completed a questionnaire containing Rotter's locus of control scale and descriptions of four administrative situations, differing in environmental uncertainty and in the amount of self-control possible. Each case was followed by questions about the amount of responsibility they would accept if put in charge, and their satisfaction if they performed above or below average. An analysis of variance was then performed on these data.It was found that the situational factors identified significant differences and interactions but that the locus of control factor did not. Specifically, under both the low and high self-control situations, increasing the amount of environmental uncertainty reduced the amount of responsibility accepted. However, under the low self-control environment there was a signif...

Abstract: This study investigated the effects of (1) instructions outlining procedures to be followed in group decision-making and (2) level of self orientation among group members upon the quality of group decisions. Groups receiving consensual instructions systematically performed better than uninstructed groups, however instructed groups utilized about 50 per cent more time in making their decisions. While no significant overall effect was found for self orientation among uninstructed groups high self oriented 'groups' resorted to averaging significantly more often than low groups. The practical implications of the findings are drawn.

Title: Social Factors in Posthospital Adjustment: A Test of Alternative Models
Author-Name: Jeanne Ranek
Author-Name: Clagett G. Smith
Abstract: Five theoretical models gleaned from the literature on exmental patient adjustment are tested to determine their comparative predictive powers. The models include the medical, moralistic, anomie, labeling, and interactionist models. Findings suggest that a dynamic interactionist framework is more efficacious for predicting posthospital adjustment than other, more static models. Variables which predict best are ideology and behavioral expectations of significant others. These results substantiate the interpretation shared by interactionist theorists that definitions of social reality (e.g., mental illness) are constructed by, as well as influential in, everyday social interaction.

Title: The Outcomes of Resource Use in Migrant Families
Author-Name: Tamara Kotler
Author-Name: S. B. Hammond
Abstract: A sample of 41 migrant mothers and their sons provided test and interview data spanning a ten year period. These were used to develop and examine a measure of the socioeconomic and non material resources of the families. This correlated strongly with achievement and personality measures of the sons over ten years.In comparison with a large cross-sectional sample of native born men, the educational achievements of the migrant group were found to be superior, despite initial disadvantages due to their immigrant circumstances. These effects are explained in terms of compensating parental efforts and skills.With regard to personality outcomes, however, the performance of men from low resource families in the migrant group was inferior both to those with high resources and to the native born group as a whole. Parental contributions are again considered, and a close study of specific parental competences is proposed.

Title: Persuasiveness and Accent-Message Incompatibility
Author-Name: Peter Powesland
Author-Name: Howard Giles
Abstract: An experiment was conducted in order to investigate the effect of a speaker's accent upon listeners' responses to a communication. Speeches in favour of and against the Industrial Relations Act 1971 were recorded by one speaker using (a) RP (received pronunciation) and (b) a regional accent. Each of four groups of predominantly RP-speaking subjects heard one of the four accent-message combinations. The version which was most effective in influencing subjects' opinions was the RP-accented speech against the Act. This result is discussed in terms of compatibility between message-content and speaker's accent, listeners' identification with the speaker and the discrepancy between the listeners' original attitudes and that advocated by the speaker.

Abstract: This study tests the relative and combined merits of two behavior modification inputs for effecting predictable and productive task group behavior change. Two hundred and seventy-seven subjects, mostly between 20 and 27 years of age, acted in problem solving groups of five to seven members. Analysis of variance results indicate that video tape presentation of model groups and video tape feedback yield significant behavioral change. It is concluded that video tape feedback and modeling can be utilized in a constructively oriented behavior modification effort in a task group context.

Title: Determinants of Supervisory Behavior: A Role Set Analysis
Author-Name: Jeffrey Pfeffer
Author-Name: Gerald R. Salancik
Abstract: While most studies have examined the consequences of different supervisory behaviors, the present study examines some determinants of supervisory actions. It is argued that the behavior of the supervisor is constrained by the demands of others in his role set. It was found that the expectations of a supervisor's boss and those of his subordinates and peers accounted for a significant portion of the observed variation in behaviors across 53 supervisors in the housing division of a large state university. Further, the extent to which supervisors conformed to their bosses' expectations was related to the number of persons and the proportion of the time spent supervising, the demands to produce, the supervisor's sex, and the proportion of the decisions made by superiors. Multivariate analysis indicated that the expectations of subordinates were more important in influencing social behaviors, while the expectations of the bosses were more important in determining work-related behaviors. Results are discussed i...

Title: Reactions to the Draft Lottery: A Test of Conflict Theory
Author-Name: Leon Mann
Author-Name: Thomas C. Dashiell
Abstract: A set of predictions from the conflict theory of decision making with regard to the effects of a threat to behavioral freedom were tested. The first selective service draft lottery, drawn December 1969, in which young men with low numbers were threatened with the draft provided a vehicle for the study. Attitudes of 84 Harvard seniors toward major draft-exampt and draft-vulnerable post graduation career alternatives were measured five days before the lottery and either one day or 10 days after. Conflict theory predicted that after the lottery men with low draft numbers would (a) show a decrease in attraction toward draft vulnerable alternatives (job, graduate school, travel) because they now produced threat of the draft and (b) show an increase in attraction toward draft-exempt alternatives because they now represented a means of avoiding the draft. The results provided support for the conflict theory predictions, men with low numbers showing a decrease in attraction toward the risky, non-draft exempt alte...

Title: Towards a Political Theory of Organizational Intervention
Author-Name: Andrew M. Pettigrew
Abstract: This paper discusses the neglected theme of the political context of the interventionist's work in terms of the client-consultant relationship and the consultant-consultant relationship. It is suggested that the internal consultant's ability to influence clients will be a function of his possession and tactical use of five power resources: expertise, control over information, political access and sensitivity, assessed stature and group support. Of these, the first three appear to be necessary but not sufficient conditions for consultant power. Once he has the political access and understanding, the consultant's ability to negotiate and persuade depends on his assessed stature with the appropriate figures in his political network.

Abstract: One hundred and nineteen white student Ss responded to semantic differential, behavioral differential, Likert scales and other measures tapping attitudes, perceptions and factual information relevant to the race riots of the mid to late 1960's. Items were factor analyzed and composite scores on the resulting factors were used in later analyses. Thirty-seven experimental Ss were given reading material containing a summary of the salient points made in the Kerner Commission Report. Twenty-nine controls received dummy reading material. The questionnaire was re-administered three weeks later to both groups. A number of significant shifts in attitudes were obtained; these were typically in a direction more consistent with the findings of the Kerner Commission Report, which advocated social change. Significant shifts occurred in Ss' evaluation of changing social policy as well as in their expression of behavioral intentions toward stimulus persons of both races who strongly favored civil rights action. Attitude...

Title: Acts of Turning as Stress-Resolving Mechanisms in Work Groups (With Special                 Reference to the Work of W. R. Bion)
Author-Name: Karen F. Pridham
Abstract: This study tested a theory based in Bion's work and developed to explain group members' acts of turning to individuals, group norms, and traditions, as if, in so doing, to move the group to operate in some specific mode or condition. A group operating in the condition of basic assumption culture activity is postulated to give rise to a state of stress, since in that condition, the work expectations of group members are confronted with group activity that does not allow work. Conjectures derived from the theory of acts of turning as stress-resolving mechanisms specified the kind of agency to which an individual intending a certain group activity would turn, given a basic assumption culture as the group condition. Tests of hypotheses corroborated the conjectures. Further theory development is warranted to explain those acts in which the agency turned to was inconsistent with the group activity intended.

Title: How Psychologically Dangerous are T-Groups and Encounter Groups?
Author-Name: Cary L. Cooper
Abstract: A number of people involved in the field of group training have suggested that Sensitivity Training (or T-groups as they are commonly called in Europe) and Encounter Groups may be 'counter-productive', 'disrupt ongoing personality functions', and 'encourage inappropriate levels of intimacy which may destroy rewarding psychological relationships with other people' (Mann, 1970: Crawshaw, 1969). That is, that this form of training is potentially dangerous and may have psychologically disturbing consequences for participants. Until recently the claims and counter-claims with respect to this issue have consisted primarily of opinions and inference drawn from limited or circumscribed experience (i.e., 'I knew a person once who attended a T-group...' vs. 'In my many years of training T-groups and Encounter Groups, I have never known a single case of...') Some empirical research is now being conducted to evaluate in a more systematic and controlled way this important issue. The magnitude of the problem can be see...

Title: Images of Inequality in Sweden and Britain
Author-Name: Richard Scase
Abstract: A number of writers have suggested that the institutions of industrial-capitalism are conducive to the development of false consciousness. This article investigates this claim by reference to a comparative study of attitudes towards the class structure among two groups of English and Swedish workers. It finds that the Swedish workers-compared with the English-have more realistic assessments about patterns of economic rewards but less accurate conceptions of mobility chances. It argues that these attitudes are a consequence-if only partly-of the meritocratic and egalitarian policies of the Swedish labour movement. Hence, it suggests that although capitalist societies may have various ideological and institutional similarities, there are other normative influences which contribute to important differences between them, particularly in terms of the level of workers' consciousness and general social awareness.

Abstract: The organizational behavior literature on leadership is marked by persistent conceptual problems which limit its applicability to the study of superior-subordinate relationships within organizations. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for viewing superior-subordinate relationships that makes explicit the differences between leadership, power, and authority. Several popular organizational behavior models of leadership are reviewed in light of the proposed framework and the conceptual inconsistencies associated with these models highlighted. Several benefits of the proposed framework for organizational research in the area of superior-subordinate relations are discussed.

Title: One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich: A Study of the Structural Requisites                 of Organization
Author-Name: John J. McDonough
Abstract: The paper utilizes Solzhenitsyn's novel, One day in the life of Ivan Denisovich, to portray the operation of organization structure at its least understood level as a psychological artifact. The novel provides a rare opportunity to observe structure 'in action' at the level of the organizing scheme employed by the central character, Shukhov, in his quest for survival. The unencumbered view of structure in operation as a psychological artifact leads to an understanding of the paradox which organization structure presents to organization analysts and theoreticians.The principal source of the paradox lies in an understanding of the transformation process which structure performs at the psychological level. The organizing power of structure lies in its ability to reduce a complex field of relationships into a manageable set of objects and categories. In the process of this transformation the very medium of thought is altered in a way that, by definition, obscures the field of relationships whose interplay def...

Title: Emergent and Contemporary Life Styles: An Inter-generational Issue
Author-Name: Frank Friedlander
Abstract: In order to explore the diverse and emerging patterns of life styles within our social milieu, the beliefs, values, and preferences of a heterogeneous sample of 1 154 men and women were factor analyzed. Derived life styles were then related to various biographic and demographic data. Three life style dimensions emerged: (1) The formalistic life style which places a heavy reliance on higher authority, law and order, precedent, and advancement as a criterion of success. The formalistic is older, higher in men than women, typical of sales, business, and technical occupations, and greatest in the Protestant religions. (2) The sociocentric life style which looks to close intimate relationships for guidance and direction. The sociocentric shows a drop with age until 25 years and then a rise, is most typical of the social service and science occupations, and is higher in women than men. (3) The personalistic life style which looks to himself for guidance and direction, and places a high value on his personal fre...

Title: Socio-Technical Systems in Weaving, 1953-1970: A Follow-up Study
Author-Name: Eric J. Miller
Abstract: In 1953-54, experimental changes in work organization were introduced in automatic and non-automatic loom-sheds of an Indian textile mill (Rice, 1953, 1955a, b, 1958, 1963). In each case semi-autonomous work-groups were established with responsibility for production and routine maintenance on a group of looms. Subsequently, these forms of working were extended to other loom-sheds. In 1970 a follow-up study of the 'group system' in four locations, including the two original sites, showed that in one the non-automatic experimental loom-shed the work organization and levels of performance had remained virtually unchanged over the 16 years, while in a newer automatic loom-shed group working had largely disappeared. Considerable regression had occured in the site of the automatic loom experiment, and the remaining non-automatic site displayed variation in modes of group working. The paper suggests that the effective persistence of the 'group system' in at least one area implies that the assumptions in Rice's o...

Title: Freshman Socialization: The Influence of Social Class Backgrounds on the                 Adaptation of Students
Author-Name: Dennis C. Bumstead
Abstract: A questionnaire based study of the entering students at a major American university examines their social-class backgrounds and the effects of these backgrounds on the students' adaptation to the university. It is shown that less than 20 per cent of the students came from genuinely working-class or blue-collar backgrounds. This is followed by analysis of adaptation differences between higher and lower background groups. Some indications of poorer adaptation among the lower background group are found in terms of anomie, academic performance and advisors' ratings. However, no significant differences are found in terms of personal control, political alienation or satisfaction. It is concluded that both prior socialization and socialization at the university contribute to the fact that the social-class origins of this university's students do not differentiate their subsequent occupational achievement. However, it is shown that the similar levels of satisfaction shown by the two groups do have different sourc...

Title: Reactions to Three Types of Distributive Injustice
Author-Name: Gregory V. Donnenwerth
Author-Name: Kjell Y. Tbrnblom
Abstract: Recent formulations of distributive justice or equity theory are examined. It is suggested that the basic differences, and indeed difficulties, of these formulations lie in the manner in which social comparisons have been conceptualized. It is proposed that as a result of these conceptual problems, existing formulations account for only a small number of the many possible types of injustice situations. A conceptual elaboration of distributive justice theory is presented. It is demonstrated that within what has previously been recognized as one type of distributive injustice there are many other possible types of injustice states. An examination of one of the many related propositional elaborations is presented. An hypothesis derived from this proposition is tested in one cognitive and one experimental study. This hypothesis proposes that individuals will differentially define and respond to previously unrecognized injustice states. The results of both studies clearly indicate that individuals do different...

Title: Interdependence Among Organizational Variables
Author-Name: M. C. Knowles
Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the interrelationship between a set of organizational variables. It used a matrix analysis whereby fourteen work organizations or Sections within a company were assessed with respect to ten variables - production, quality, costs, job satisfaction of operatives, job satisfaction of supervisors, work anxiety, accidents, absence, labour turnover and industrial unrest.When the Sections were ranked on the individual measures it was found that wide and consistent differences existed between the Sections; within the Sections the variables were clearly interrelated. This effect could be called the interdependence phenomenon of organizational behaviour.This property was most pronounced in one group of Sections characterized by high performance achievements, favourable attitudes and organizational stability, and in another group of Sections characterized by low achievements, considerable dissatisfaction, and organizational instability involving high levels of accidents, absence, labo...

Title: Interrelationships Among Mobility, Health and Attitudinal Variables in an                 Urban Elderly Population
Author-Name: Margret Fine
Abstract: 169 urban elderly Ss were interviewed to study (1) the interrelationships among mobility, health, demographic and factor analytically derived attitudinal variables and (2) the characteristics of users and non-users of an innovative transportation program. Positive correlations were obtained between mobility and each of the following variables: self-assessed health (p < .001); functional ability (p < .001); current income (p < .005); Life Satisfaction (p < .001); and Ego Integrity (p < .001). Current income was positively correlated with Life Satisfaction (p < .001) and Optimism about the Future (p < .005) and negatively correlated with Authoritarianism (p < .005) and Political Powerlessness (p < .005). Life Satisfaction and Ego Integrity were positively correlated with selfassessed health (p < .001 in both cases). Age, income and education did not differentiate between users and non-users, nor did four of the five attitude factors. However, users manifested significantly poorer self-assessed health and fu...

Title: Strategies of Administrative Control and Organizational Effectiveness
Author-Name: Bernard C. Reimann
Author-Name: Anant R. Negandhi
Abstract: The results of a comparative study of thirty manufacturing firms in India indicated that the most effective organizations tended to choose a unidimensional strategy of administrative control. This strategy consisted of the use of formalized procedures to control decentralized decision-making with respect to both human and material resources. The least effective firms chose a similar strategy of control, however they emphasized mainly those procedures involving the control of material resources and tended to neglect their human resources in this respect. These results are interpreted as evidence in favor of normative theory of administrative control in organizations. The most effective strategy for maintaining indirect control over a decentralized decision-making process appears to be one which effectively integrates the rational material resource controls with the more intangible human resource control mechanisms.

Abstract: Questionnaires on eight role conflict categories (Time Management, Relations with Husband, Household Management, Financial, Child Care, Expectations for Self, Expectations of Others, and Guilt) were administered to 518 women. Marital status was found to be a significant variable with married women expressing more conflict than other women. Never married and formerly married women did not differ significantly from each other. The results further suggested the existence of a generalized role expectation for women and the importance of the husband in marriage.

Title: Attitudes Towards Participation among Local Authority Employees
Author-Name: Joe Lischeron
Author-Name: Toby D. Wall
Abstract: Employee attitudes towards participation in management decision-making is recognized as a subject which, though under researched, is of considerable contemporary importance. A questionnaire study of the attitudes of one hundred and twenty seven blue-collar employees leads to the following conclusions. First, whilst employees experience little participation they do express strong desires to be involved in decision-making. Second, the form of participation preferred depends upon the nature of the decision involved. In middle-management decision-making most employees would like to participate through personal contact with management; in top-management decisions employee representation is desired; and in pay related decisions participation through trade union representation is favoured. Finally, attitudes towards participation are positively related to job satisfaction. The usefulness of such questionnaire data as a starting point for the implementation of participative practices is discussed.

Title: The Ability to Predict Workers' Preferences: Further Evidence
Author-Name: Peter Brosnan
Abstract: This abstract reports a follow-up of an earlier survey of the ability of managers and trade union officers to predict workers' preferences. It was found that even when economic and social conditions change a good deal, and despite changes in individuals' preferences, the 'average union members' ' preferences for pay and fringe benefits remain remarkably constant. This being the case, the results of the earlier survey would have been an excellent source of information about workers' preferences. However the managers and union officers were unable to assess workers current preferences and the majority of persons who had predicted preferences in both surveys performed more badly in the second, most overestimating the limited changes in preferences which had occurred. It was concluded that those who work closest to the ordinary worker are less capable of deciphering the confusing array of information which they receive about him.

Title: The Judgement Process in Management Students' Evaluation of their Learning Experiences
Author-Name: John G. Burgoyne
Abstract: The ideal approach to evaluating management development programmes has often been held to involve objective measurement of achievement of criteria, carried out within an experimental design which allows any chance discovered to be attributed to the programme itself rather than any other factor. In practice many evaluation studies rely on the collection, after the programme, of evaluative opinions from the participants. Campbell et al. (1970) have pointed out that such opinionbased follow up studies may give valid results if the judgements made by the participants, which underlie their expressed opinions, themselves embody the logical and scientific procedures that give validity to the experimental type of study.This research investigates the process of judgement underlying the formation of evaluative opinions by programme participants. The methodology of 'protocol analysis', used so far mainly in laboratory studies, is employed. This calls for an inductive analysis of the content of recordings made when a...

Abstract: The French Test of Insight was administered to 118 executives, scientists and engineers working on seventeen pharmaceutical and chemical industry R + D projects. Scoring was according to McClelland et al., nAch and Veroff nPow systems. The R + D projects were classified as successful and unsuccessful by outside experts, both from a technical and an economic point of view. Blind analysis showed that (1) nAch significantly correlated both with technical and economic success, (2) nPow was a strong factor making for both kinds of success when present in conjunction with nAch but a factor making for failure in the absence of nAch, (3) nAch proved to be a factor making for success both on projects which allowed for initiative and those that did not, nPow on the other hand furthered success on non-initiative projects only, on initiative ones it promoted failure. Results are discussed in the light of the nAch construct, the theory of the human need for work; and various nPow constructs.

Title: Job Enlargement: A Multidimensional Process
Author-Name: Lex Donaldson
Abstract: This paper reports the results of an evaluation study into the effects of a job enlargement exercise on female assemblers of electrical domestic appliances. Data on job satisfaction and perceptions of job attributes are analysed, and a comparison is made between the group with the enlarged job and another group of operatives who are performing tasks fairly similar to those which the enlarged group were performing prior to job enlargement. The results indicate that the expected increases in satisfaction associated with greater work variety, novelty and felt use of abilities were achieved. There were some dissatisfying outcomes related to decreased social interaction and somewhat increased effort of work. It is suggested that opportunities for social interaction could have been maintained by a different job redesign. The increased effort of work was hypothesized to relate to the presence of multiple motives for change among the management team. The need is stressed to conceptualize job enlargement as a phen...

Author-Name: Michael Aiken
Abstract: The present study, based on data obtained in a set of health and social welfare agencies, attempted to develop some measures for examining organizational communication and to relate those measures to worker satisfaction. The communication properties of primary concern were the formality of the communication network and the direction of communication in the organization. The results indicated that these dimensions could be specified empirically and that their relationships to satisfaction measured. Those relationships were found to vary depending upon whether satisfaction with the job or with co-workers was the focus. The study discusses several implications of the differentiation made among dimensions of communication and proposes some hypotheses to be tested in further research on the social-psychological correlates of organizational communication patterns.

Title: A Boolean Analysis of Interpersonal Perception
Author-Name: Burton L. Alperson
Abstract: Laing, Phillipson, and Lee (1966) have developed an ingenious technique, the Interpersonal Perception Method (IPM), for the determination of the degree to which the members of a dyad agree on important issues, understand one another, feel understood, and realize the understanding of the other member. Unfortunately, a number of problems make it unlikely that the potential of the IPM will be realized: (a) it is nearly impossible to avoid getting tangled in complex semantics, (b) relationships among terms are obscure, (c) derivation of terms is completely intuitive and sometimes ambiguous, and (d) scoring procedures are tedious and difficult.Boolean analysis of the IPM makes its truth-functional structure explicit. In so doing it removes the need for intuitive derivations of terms; it clarifies the structure of IPM relation ships; it substantially reduces scoring efforts; and it provides a logical and rigorous substructure for the IPM which allows it to be developed as a general method for the study of inter...

Title: The Two Meanings of External Invalidity
Author-Name: Arie W. Kruglanski
Abstract: A distinction is proposed between two different senses of the treatment by background interaction (termed 'external invalidity' by Campbell & Stanley, 1966). The distinction parallels the dichotomy between universalistic (or theory centered) and particularistic (or context centered) objectives of behavioral research. In its universalistic sense the interaction above suggests a redefinition of the abstract meaning attached to the independent variables effective with respect to a given phenomenon of interest. In its particularistic sense this interaction defines the concrete contexts over which a given outcome will hold. The implications of the proposed distinction are discussed in reference to the phases of (1) designing the experiment and (2) evaluating the obtained results.

In this study the criminality of rural Arabs in Israel is analyzed in terms of culture-conflict. Interviews with prisoners and non-prisoners supply the data and the statistical analyses confirm the main hypotheses.

Title: The Demise of Management and the Ritual of Employment
Author-Name: Denis Pym
Abstract: Industrial man's central social ritual is employment. This article is about my continuing personal explorations of the link between the condition of employment and a range of pressing issues - alienation, the overconsumption of scarce resources and pollution. I am expressing here a point of view relevant in limited time and space. Since the tradition of industrial social and behavioural enquiry is geared to maintaining a deception, our primary task is the search for reality. The case against the institutions of employment begins with their literary basis (the central role of written words and numbers in transactions) and rational veneer. Rites in this context fail to fulfil the function of religious activity. Employment, in short, is bad ritual. Important, though. debatable, distinctions are made here between positive work and negative employment and the consumption of the former by the latter. Attention is focused on the convergence of employment and ritual with the growth of large organizations and the ...

Abstract: Two experiments examined the group polarization hypothesis. In Experiment I group discussion polarized the evaluations of six hypothetical faculty members, three described positively and three negatively. 'Good' faculty were rated and paid even more favorably after group interaction and contrariwise for 'bad' faculty. Experiment II separated subjects into groups which were conservative or liberal in attitudes regarding women. Subsequent discussion of statements regarding the role of women yielded an increase in the attitude gap between the conservative and liberal communities.

Title: Interpersonal Style and the Communication Dilemma: II. Utility of the Johari                 Awareness Model for Genotypic Diagnoses
Author-Name: Jay Hall
Abstract: The Johari Awareness model of interpersonal processes was again employed as the theoretical framework for exploring the nature of communicative practices in human systems. From Hall's (1974) earlier series of studies of managerial use of the Exposure-Feedback processes in organizations and personalistic influences on communication effectiveness, the presence of several underlying sources of variance was suggested. The possible existence of genotypic factors - as opposed to the more commonly cited phenotypic effects which are manifested - was thought to have system-wide implications for communicative practices, particularly at the level of systems diagnosis. The present study was conducted to test for the presence of three underlying unmanifested genotypic influences on communication in organizations: (1) a security genotype, (2) a reciprocity genotype, and (3) a form-function genotype. Employing the Personnel Relations Survey and the Management Relations Survey as assessments of personal and collective us...

Abstract: There is some question as to the usefulness of Etzioni's typological theory of compliance in organizational research. This study with a sample of 265 blueand white-collar workers in six organizations tests propositions from the theory concerning relationships between power used by organizations, commitment of workers to the organization and task performance. The results cast doubt on the usefulness of a classification scheme using concrete organizational types, but support the proposition that the more normative (less utilitarian) the power, the greater the commitment. Little or no relationship was found between power and task performance or commitment and task performance.

Title: Levels of Analysis in Social Psychology and Related Social Sciences
Author-Name: Gian Sarup
Abstract: This paper seeks to explicate the widely used but largely unworked concept of levels of analysis in social psychology by examining its origin, need, and place in the discipline. Following Schneirla's distinction between levels of organization and levels of analysis, it outlines the problem of varied relationships between the two kinds of levels and discovers among social psychologists distinctly reductive, anti-reductive, and interdisciplinary attitudes toward the idea of levels. The presentation culminates in a paradigm of levels which generates not only the ideal typical approaches, but also clarifies the actual patterns of interdisciplinary relations, in social sciences.

Abstract: This article explores the results of a questionnaire study which focused on how four types of change agents, the Outside Pressure Type, the Organization Development type, the Analysis for the Top Type and the People Change Technology Type diagnose organizations. The four types of change agents were found to use different diagnostic categories. The differences were found to relate to both their value orientation and to the change techniques which they employ.

Title: A Note on Attitudes to Jointness of the Conjugal Role Relationship and Family                 Size: A Study of Norms among Ghanaian Students
Author-Name: Christine Oppong
Abstract: In this paper data from a sample of Ghanaian University students is used to test the cross-cultural validity of the hypothesis that jointness of the conjugal role relationship is associated with small family size norms and segregation with large family size norms (Hawthorn, 1971: 94). Approval of jointness and segregation is measured by means of an ordinal scale based upon responses to eight different statements about the division of labour, decision-making and finances. The data support the hypothesis as there is a significant correlation between attitudes to family size and jointness of the conjugal relationship.

Title: Group Composition and Changes in Self-Actualization in T-Groups
Author-Name: Peter B. Smith
Author-Name: Michael J. Linton
Abstract: A field experiment is reported concerning ten one-week sensitivity training groups. Groups were composed-according to their scores on Schutz's FIRO-B. It was predicted that the optimal conditions for change were provided by heterogeneous compositions. Three groups were composed to be heterogeneous for control behaviour but homogeneous for affection behaviour. Three further groups were homogeneous for affection but heterogeneous for control. The remaining four groups were heterogeneous for both need areas. Changes on Shostrom's Personal Orientation Inventory were found in all conditions. Control-heterogeneous groups increased on 'existentiality' and 'nature of man' subscales, while affection-heterogeneous groups increased on 'inner-directedness' and 'feeling reactivity'. Groups heterogeneous for both need areas showed change on all four of these POI scales. Most change thus resulted from the groups with the most heterogeneous compositions.

Title: Interdependence and Complementarity-The Case of a Brokerage Office
Author-Name: Johannes M. Pennings
Abstract: This paper attempts to develop a framework for defining the concept of interdependence theoretically and operationally. A distinction is being made between task, position-role, social and skill interdependence. The significance of these distinctions for outcome variables is discussed. Data descriptive of members of brokerage offices reveal weak or negligible intercorrelations among the modes of interdependence. Social interdependence appears to be the best predictor of organizational or group performance. The implications of the findings are discussed.

Title: Person-Job Congruence and Individual Adjustment and Development
Author-Name: John J. Morse
Abstract: This research was conducted at the clerical and hourly employee levels in two large organizations. It investigates the congruence or 'fit' of five personality predispositions with the relative certainty of jobs. The hypothesis tested is that this person-job congruence is related to individual psychological adjustment and development at work, as represented by an individual's 'sense of competence' on the job. The hypothesis is supported and the implications of the findings, especially regarding understanding the meaning of work for an individual, are discussed.

Title: Employee Participation: An Experimental Field Study
Author-Name: J. A. Lischeron
Author-Name: T D. Wall
Abstract: An experimental field study involving over three hundred blue-collar male employees and their superiors was conducted to investigate the hypothesis that participation in management decision-making is a determinant of satisfaction at work. A system of participation - Action Planning Groups - based on regular meetings between shop-floor employees and management proved effective in influencing organizational decisionmaking and was seen to be worthwhile by both parties. However, the increased participation achieved was not reflected in greater employee satisfaction. It is argued that these findings are consistent with previous experimental evidence. The reasons which lie behind the frequently expressed belief that participation is an important determinant of satisfaction at work are discussed. Employee desires for participation were also found to be unaffected by the experimental manipulation.

Title: Rank Order Survey of Seven Employee Self-Interest Areas
Author-Name: Cecil Fuselier
Author-Name: Jon J. Tanja
Abstract: 'In our society there is no single situation which is potentially so capable of giving some satisfaction at all levels of basic needs as is the occupation' (Schletzer, 1966).Employees have definite self-interests that they expect to receive from their employer. Among these self-interest areas are items such as: (1) opportunity for expression and development, (2) acceptable hours and wages, (3) fair and efficient leadership, (4) interest in work, (5) recognition as an individual, (6) safe-healthy work conditions, and (7) economic security.To gain a better insight into how pharmacists rank these seven employee self-interest areas, a study was proposed with six objectives. These objectives were: (1) to obtain a pharmacist opinion of the ranking order of the areas studied, (2) to classify these rank order findings into individual categories, (3) to provide some managerial insight as to how sex, degree held, area of practice and other vital statistics affect an individual's response to the rank order of the ar...

Abstract: This article examines the development of experiential learning groups in terms of their social values and the socioeconomic conditions leading to their growth. In addition, and more importantly, it will attempt to prophesy the future of the human relations/experiential movement by a detailed examination of four socioeconomic trends: Anglo-American orientation of the movement, production and growth trends of advanced capitalist economies, shifting age structure, and the changes in the expression of middle-class needs. These issues are considered in the context of the developing and developed countries separately.

Title: Staff Processes and Pupil Attitudes
Author-Name: Alice Z. Seeman
Author-Name: Melvin Seeman
Abstract: This paper examines the relation between the involvement of teachers in school management and their pupils' school-relevant attitudes. The teacher participation is conceived in terms of a process of dialogue, decision-making, and action-taking (DDA) regarding particular changes under way in the school. The pupil attitudes that are shown to be associated with DDA are attitudes toward learning, attitudes toward school, and the pupil's self-concept. Data are presented to substantiate the view that it is not the teachers' personal characteristics (e.g., teaching experience or dogmatism) which are crucial in developing favorable student attitudes, but rather the teachers' organizational participation. The evidence indicates that teachers who are more involved in the dialogue-decision-action process have students with more favorable attitudes; and that these teachers likewise reflect the greater sense of mastery (low powerlessness scores) that staff participation hypothetically should encourage.

Title: A Discontinuity Theory of Psychological Development
Author-Name: D. J. Isaac
Author-Name: B. M. O'Connor
Abstract: A discontinuity theory of psychological development is designed such that the associated experimental work relies on quantitative variates of behavior to discriminate stages. Using a dynamic element, expressed abstractly in terms of "poles" and "relations, " a series of structures relating to developmental stages is constructed. The element operates in either of two ways: in a discriminating mode or confusing mode. Operating in the discriminating mode, poles and relations become more defined; operating in the confusing mode leads to loss of discrimination of poles and relation. The element is applied to an imaginary situation of baby with mother. In the course of applying the element, a resolution of the situation into two components is introduced, which leads finally to a unity which comprises a self-structure and two classes of objects, things and persons. The essential structure of this unity, expressed in terms of a self-pole related to an object-pole serves as the level 1 structure of the series. In ...

Title: Worries about Deprivation of Job Rewards Following Computerization: A Partial                 Order Scalogram Analysis
Author-Name: Samuel Shye
Author-Name: Dov Elizur
Abstract: The introduction of a major change in an organization, like computerization, may be expected to raise some worries on the part of affected employees. Four sources of worries experienced by the employees of accounting departments are discussed: job security, job stability, job proficiency, and job interest. An empirical structure of these worries, based on scalogram technique, was found, and an interpretation for it is proposed. By the use of Partial Order Scalogram Analysis, a parsimonious description of the contents behind the variables was obtained. Empirical profiles can be characterized by two scores, rather than the original four, by means of two scales: the joint scale represents the "amount" of worry and the lateral scale measures the composition or the "quality" of worry. The findings confirm our hypothesis concerning the content underlying the lateral ("quality-of-worries') scale, namely that it reflects the degree of "intrinsicality" versus "extrinsicality" of the job reward the loss of which is...

Abstract: This study analyzes the structure of the relations between experiences in Israel and abroad, and expectations for the future in Israel as reported by Israelis residing in the U.S. and France. A facet definition of the inclination to reimmigrate to Israel is presented, and, on its basis, hypotheses are formulated regarding the relations between the definitional framework and the empirical observations. The results support the main hypotheses. An empirical double-ordered conceptual system is obtained, which reflects the two facets of the definition: Situation (manner, country, and time), and Areas of Life (spiritual, material, and intermediate). Some structural differences were found between the U.S. and the French samples.

Title: An Integrated Formalization of Organization-Environment Interdependencies
Author-Name: Dennis S. Mileti
Author-Name: David F. Gillespie
Abstract: A formal model is developed facilitating (1) an integration of theories dealing with organization-environment interaction, and (2) an explanation of how an organization's boundaries become increasingly permeated by the environment. It is argued that rates of change per se represent the principal impetus in promoting adaptive exchanges between an organization and its environment, both for long-term (evolutionary) and short-term (mutational) changes in the environment. The model reveals that a key variable in organization-environment interdependencies is the ratio of legitimate demands placed upon the organization by the environment to either the capacity or minimum performance levels of the organization.

Title: A Framework for Analyzing Interorganizational Relationships

Author-Name: Robert C. Clark
Abstract: Earlier theories on interorganizational relationships have adopted either the social or psychological approach, resulting in incomplete analysis of the nature of and the parameters influencing the phenomenon. This study proposed and tested a framework that combines the two approaches. It analyzed four most common types of interagency relationships-cooperation, conflict, competition, and merger-among three agricultural institutions, and the organizational and personality factors determining their occurrence. Findings show that a limited number and degree of cooperative relationships existed, whereas competition and conflicts were more prevalent. Cooperation was facilitated by dynamic and democratic leadership, while competition and conflicts were attributed to change in leadership style and centralized administrative practices.

Abstract: This study compared the sexual permissiveness of sex-integrated dormitory living with sex-segregated dormitory living by collecting data, using a before-after design, from a probability sample of 245 students enrolled at a Southeastern state-supported university. The self-administered question naire, which included a Guttman-type scale on sexual permissiveness, was completed early in and again near theend of the 1972-1973 school year. While no significant differences were found in the sexual permissiveness of sex-in-tegrated and sex-segregated dormitory students early in the school year, sex-integrated dormitory students were characterized by greater sexual permissiveness at the end of the year.

Title: Values and Practice in the Therapeutic Community
Author-Name: Nicholas Manning
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of putting ideology into practice. The radical idea of the therapeutic community within psychiatry in the 1950s never became completely translated into action. This ideal-real discrepancy is explored for a major therapeutic community established in the 1950s, Henderson Hospital, and a comparison is made between staff and patient treatment values and their evaluation of the helpfulness of actual group practice over an 18-year period. It was hypothesized that the gap between values and practice would widen under the impact of informal social processes, distorting the transfer of ideology into practice. The results confirm this hypothesis, which is explicated by reference to the generation of group norms and informal social processes, such as leadership "careers. "

Title: Management Sanctions and Absence Control
Author-Name: Nigel Nicholson
Abstract: The effect of deterrent measures on employee absence is a neglected topic and what little research there has been has not produced consistent findings. The present paper reports the effects of a sudden clamp-down of management sanctions on the absence behavior of a female workforce. The prediction that this action would not significantly alter the level of absence, but would affect the form absences took, was confirmed by the results, which showed a conversion of short to longer spells and uncertificated to certificated absence. The implications for control systems and their reliance on medical certification as a principal legitimizing criterion are discussed.

Title: Environmental Change in a Psychiatric Setting
Author-Name: Charles J. Holahan
Abstract: The extensive physical remodeling of a psychiatric admissions ward was conducted to investigate the relationship between ward design and patient behavior. This paper presents an analysis of important changes in the ward social system, including staff role relationships, distribution of power, and communication styles, which were generated by the physical changes and mediated the effects on patient behavior. The social system impacts are conceptualized as operating through a time-ordered process of environmental change involving four phases-petrification, unfreezing, resistance, and personalization. Psychological issues underlying the translation of environmental change into change at the level of the ward social system are discussed. Finally, comparisons are drawn between interventions based on environmental strategies and those based on organizational development techniques.

Title: Changing Behavior in Task Groups Through Social Learning: Modeling Alternatives
Author-Name: Gordon A. Walter
Abstract: This study explores the relative effects of "acted" and "natural" social models upon the behaviors of members of problem-solving groups. Major differences between model group behaviors were identified by 62 judges. A "pretest-posttest control group" experimental design was used to examine the behavioral effects of modeling for 72 subjects, which was measured using a behavioral coding technique developed by Hoffman and Maier. The central finding in this experimental effort was that "acted" models were more effective in promoting behavior change than were "natural" models. Theoretical implications and possible applications of the research findings are discussed.

Title: The Search for Environmental Complexity
Author-Name: Richard N. Osborn
Abstract: Contingency organization theory suggests that the match between environmental complexity and formal structure is an important determinant of organizational performance. However, there are a number of different interpretations of environmental complexity which may or may not be related. The purpose of this paper is to outline several different views of environmental complexity and empirically test the extent to which they predict the performance of 26 mechanistically structured antipoverty agencies. Statistical analysis is based on multiple linear regression. Measures for complexity include the general level of socioeconomic development, the occupational mix in the surrounding area, the uncertainty in the immediate environment of the agency, and the reliance of the agency on outside units. The performance criteria are based on an analysis of the degree of goal attainment of the sample units. Results suggest that there are considerable differences in different interpretations of environmental complexity in ...

Title: Ethnomethodology
Author-Name: Raymond Gordon
Abstract: This article argues that ethnomethodology is subjectivist and psychologically reductionist. It neglects the importance of social structure, and collective realities in its methodology and its findings are not subject to confirmation. Ethnomethodologists put a mistaken reliance upon phenomenology, whereas a more heuristic means of understanding would be gained by employing a dialectical and materialist method, which would link modes of consciousness with existential conditions. Such a link would facilitate an appreciation of the reality of social facts, their impingement upon human social consciousness, and the ways in which consciousness modifies reality. The essential difference between this approach and that adopted in ethnomethodology is that the dialectical method recognises that knowledge grows out of the conflict between "being" and "consciousness, " and in the contradictions between conditions of life and perceptions of its alternatives. For the ethnomethodologist, knowledge is a taken-for-granted ...

Title: Participative and Power-Equalized Organizational Systems
Author-Name: J. Timothy McMahon
Abstract: The theories of participation and power equalization are discussed in terms of their philosophy, objectives, and techniques. A clarification of the differences between the theories is presented based upon the amount and distribution of influence within an organizational system. The participation and power-equalization hypotheses are tested using attitude data collected from three levels of management in 12 plants of a large manufacturing organization and a multivariate ANOVA design. The major finding is the identification of a consistent interaction pattern involving participation and power equalization which enhances prediction of satisfaction and effectiveness over that offered by the variables singularly. This finding suggests the integration of the theories of participation and power equalization.

Title: A Comparative Analysis of the Psychological Consequences of Change
Author-Name: Robert H. Lauer
Author-Name: Rance Thomas
Abstract: Both social scientists and laymen have defined the present age as one of anxiety, and many have linked that anxiety with rapid change. The present study investigates the relationships between change in individual life circumstances, perceived rate of social change, and anxiety level. These relationships are examined in two samples-one from England and one from the United States. In both societies, there is a positive correlation between both kinds of change and anxiety level, with the perceived rate of social change being more significant as a predictor of anxiety level than change in life circumstances. In both societies, the effects of rate were moderated when the change is defined as desirable. A few differences between the two societies are noted and discussed. In general, however, the data support the notion that a high rate of change generates psychological reactions which require adjustment on the part of individuals, with the reaction moderated when the changes are perceived as desirable.

Title: The Effect of Situational vs. Behavioral Problem Statements on Solution Quality
Author-Name: Allen R. Solem
Abstract: This experiment explores whether the manner in which a problem is stated to a group influences the nature of the solution. Groups of three, including a discussion leader-member, were asked to develop at least two solutions toward improving output of a circular five-man assembly line. Productivity is limited to the pace of a slow man who must be retained. Many solutions are possible. One solution, rotation, is clearly superior to all others, yet is rarely developed. Leaders were given one of four prepared problem statements to read aloud to their groups prior to 20-minute discussions. The statements differed primarily on a behavioral versus situational dimension. Results indicate that problem statements designed to orient discussion toward situational factors significantly more often cause groups to develop the insightful solution than do behaviorally oriented problem statements. More generally, the results suggest that leader use of basic principles for stating problems can upgrade the quality of the grou...

Title: A Test of Alternative Models of Expectancy Theory
Author-Name: Leon Reinharth
Author-Name: Mahmoud A. Wahba
Abstract: The inconsistent findings of prior studies in expectancy theory are examined with reference to various logical and methodological issues. A comprehensive test of the theory is proposed in broadening the base of the behavioral alternatives available to the individual in the work situation. A method is suggestedfor incorporating negative as well as positive instrumentalities and acts. Nine alternative models are tested, including the expectancy variables, additive, multiplicative, and combined versions. The findings of the study do not support the theory as a predictor of effort and performance, and provide moderate support to the theory as a predictor of total job satisfaction. None of the predictor models is found to be superior to any of the others. The findings confirm those of other recent studies, and suggest that the theory may explain only a limited portion of behavior on the job.

Abstract: The Abelson-Rosenberg consistency theory has failed to live up to its potential in providing adequate explanation andfostering creative research. Specifically, the theory fails to fully operationalize "least effort" and rarely presents falsifiable hypotheses. This paper attempts to adapt consistency theory to a geometric framework correcting the above shortcomings and several others so that consistency can be fruitfully applied in psychology, political science, and other social sciences. Two examples are included from political science to illustrate the geometric approach.

Title: Political Constraints on Public Policy
Author-Name: Robert N. Spadaro
Abstract: This exploratory research considers folkways devised by political leaders in general and specifically engaged in campaigning as cues to social and policy constraints and manipulative strategies. First, while we know a good deal about voter experience, we have little systematic knowledge of the politician's campaign experience, and thus our understanding of this important mass-elite linkage is limited. Kingdon (1968) has reported that politicians experience minimal learning in a campaign, whether they win or lose. The model developed here explores political folkways which may serve as important clues to (1) understanding the impact and learning of the campaign on the politician, and (2) determining whether these folkways lead to an accurate assessment and/or potential means of influencing the voters.

Abstract: The organization set is a basic concept for analyzing the relations between an organization and its environment. This article pro vides a theoretical basis for using it to study the way that organizations adapt their environments to their own needs, rather than responding to situational demands. First, the network of interorganizational relations is conceptualized in terms of dimensions of social integration. Subsequently, organizational strategies appropriate for dealing with problematical aspects of organization set integration are identified. The character-defining consequences of the combination of strategies an organization uses are illustrated from an empirical study of the National Economic Development Office.

Abstract: Subjects in a boys' secondary school were asked to participate in an experiment which exposed them to the risk of up to 50% hearing loss. Of 42 Ss, 39 participated voluntarily. Each operated a fake "sound generator" similar to Milgram's "shock generator" and administered to himself a supposed stimulus whose "danger level" was prominently displayed before him. The highest level of stimulus to which each was prepared to go was recorded. Results showed a close similarity with those obtained by Milgram when his Ss were instructed to administer dangerous shocks to others. The correspondence between the results in obedience experiments and Allport's J-curve of institutional conformity is discussed. It is contended that interpretations of experimental obedience as deriving from release of aggression or from the acceptance of malevolent intent as compatible with legitimate authority are inadequate. It is argued that both inside and outside the laboratory authority commonly functions to direct behavior in cases wh...

Title: Social Patterns and Norms in Lebanon and the United States
Author-Name: Paul D. Starr
Abstract: This study reports selected respondents' views of the norms and patterns generally present in the contemporary societies of Lebanon and the U.S.A. Employing an instrument initially developed by Miller in the comparison of Ibero-Latin-American societies with those of the Anglo-American culture complex, it is possible to compare judgments of Lebanon and the U.S.A. on a number of characteristics, to consider indications of recent changes in American society, and to observe several interesting similarities between Lebanon and other societies which share in the tradition of the circum Mediterranean culture area.

Title: Influence of Schools on Economically Disadvantageous Attitudes: A Solomon                 Islands Study
Author-Name: Alastair M. Macbeth
Abstract: While there is recognition that attitudes affect national economic advance in developing countries, there is doubt whether schools can significantly influence attitudes and whether it is morally right for them to attempt to do so. This study examines the economically detrimental attitude of regionalism in a Solomon Islands secondary school and measures (by an extended sociogram technique which largely eliminates response set) changes in regionalism with exposure to a school experience which stressed regional integration. Significant decreases in regionalism were recorded. However, the author warns that factors other than school policy (e.g., the boarding element, parental support, and the fact that regionalism in society had not reached crisis proportions) may have been preconditions of the attitude change. It is doubtful if schools should be expected to change attitudes to suit political or economic ends.

Title: On the Metaphysics of Social Psychology: A Critical View
Author-Name: Ned Levine
Abstract: Two contrasting social metaphysics are discussed: the naturalistic and the historical. The naturalistic metaphysics emphasizes general conditions, transhistorical explanations, laws in nature, reductive explanations, positivism, cumulative, and value-free knowledge, whereas the historical emphasizes specificity, historical conditions, man-made laws, descriptive explanation, inference, holism, and value-affected knowledge. An analysis of social psychology and sociology journals suggests that social psychology as a discipline is more naturalistic than historical in its orientation. Social psychology studies tend to be experimental, using students as subjects, small samples, and inferential statistics, and are more discipline-bound in referencing, whereas sociology studies are more descriptive, using structural categories of population as subjects, larger samples, and descriptive statistics, and are more related to other social sciences in terms of referencing. Implications of these results for social psycho...

Title: Further Thoughts on Experiments in Industrial Democracy and Self-Management
Author-Name: Malcolm Warner
Abstract: Participation is developing its own mythology, with Germany, or Yugoslavia, becoming the Mecca, depending on the model of industrial democracy chosen. Britain, some observers claim, has de facto workers' control via shop-steward power. Can empirical research produce hard evidence, and sift realitiesfrom myths? The paper argues that we need a contingency theory of industrial democracy with appropriate organizational designs for each national setting; and that design and policy formulation should be more closely related. Participation, too, should take place in the designing process of systems.

Title: The Demand for Participation among Employees
Author-Name: George Hespe
Author-Name: Toby Wall
Abstract: Britain 's entry to the European Economic Community has addedfuel to the frequently fiery debates amongst politicians, managements, trade unions, and social scientists on the merits of existing member countries' current participative practices. These discussions seem to carry an underlying assumption that the furtherance of such systems as Employee Directors and Works Councils will be reflected in an improved quality of working life for employees. This paper suggests that participation will be more meaningful to workers when those to be affected participate in decisions concerning the practices to be adopted in their own workplace. The authors' studies, in organizations ranging from a coal mine to a number of hospitals, reveal considerable individual and organizational differences in the manner and extent of desiredparticipation. It is concluded that the higher level forms of participation, though of commendable ideal, may be inappropriate where the climate of the organization denies employees suitable op...

Title: Participation, Organization, and Social Cohesion
Author-Name: John Child
Abstract: There is a demand for the extension of participation in organizational decision-making. If realized, this should strengthen the stability of a democratic society through providing more people with a meaningful experience of democratic processes. At the same time, however, organizations are continuing to become bigger and their control more centralized. This trend is illustrated for Britain. It leads to an increasing remoteness of decision making on policy issues away from employees and members of the public. The effects of bureaucratization, which accompanies growth, exacerbate the remoteness. So far as participation is concerned, a growing contradiction is therefore emerging between social ideology and social reality, and this is not being given adequate recognition. The likely result is a weakening commitment to collective social objectives and a declining perceived legitimacy of social institutions. It is concluded that a resolution of this problem would be assisted by recognizing how the economic adva...

Title: A Norwegian Strategy for Democratization of Industry
Author-Name: Thoralf Ulrik Qvale
Abstract: The paper describes certain parts of "The Industrial Democracy Program, " (IDP), an action research project which was started in Norwegian industry in 1962 with the joint sponsorship of the Norwegian Trade Union Confederation and the Confederation of Employers. Although the emphasis is on the practical application of a strategy for social change, some background information and description of the content of this program is also given. Under the assumption that changes in the concrete work situation might be the key to a process whereby employees could improve their conditions for taking part in decisions, a series of experiments have been staged in companies representing different technologies. Some results from the program are discussed. One conclusion is that it is possible within existing companies and under the existing economic system to make changes in work organization, job design, etc., so that workers experience a more meaningful and rewarding situation, become more committed to their work, and t...

Title: Workers Experience of Participation: The Case of British Rail
Author-Name: E. Linden Hilgendorf
Author-Name: Barrie L. Irving
Abstract: The paper reports the results of secondary analysis of data from a random sample survey of the attitudes of British Rail employees to worker participation in management decision-making. The aim of the secondary analysis was to determine empirically which elements of the concept of participation formed a coherent interconnected set. The analysis shows that the job experience and the opportunity to be involved in various kinds of decision making affect attitudes to participation. These environmental prerequisites are matched by person-centered characteristics such as the internalization of the concept of responsibility and a positive orientation toward the task of processing information. Paradoxically, it is established that management's critics come mostly from those who are positively disposed to participation and already have a limited experience of it. It is argued that job design and organizational structure have educational potential with respect to increased worker participation.

Title: Identification, Personality Needs, and Managerial Position
Author-Name: Thomas Rotondi, Jr.
Abstract: An empirical research study was conducted to determine the relationships between the personality needs and identification models of organizational personnel. Also examined were the effects of managerial position upon such relationships. Variables under investigation included n Affiliation, n Achievement, organizational identification, work group identification, occupational identification, and external group identification. To reflect the impacts of differing occupations and organizational philosophies, data was collected and analyzed from a geographically diverse sample of 187 U.S. industrial employees. Significant findings of the study showed that (a) among managers, both n Affiliation and n Achievement were directly associated with each of the identification models, whereas (b) among nonmanagers, n Affiliation was related directly to occupational identification and work group identification, with n Achievement being directly associated only with occupational identification.

Abstract: An exploratory examination of the social perception of a rape victim was conducted. Sex of respondent, victim's history of rape, number of rapes in the area, and victim acquaintance with the rapist were investigated by having subjects respond to a standardized videotape of an interview with a presumed victim. Results revealed two consistent findings: Males viewed the victim as contributing to the rape to a greater degree than females. The victim was seen as provoking the episode to a greater degree when she had been raped before than when she had not been raped before. Several interactions were also obtained.

Author-Name: Thomas A. Kochan
Author-Name: L. L. Cummings
Author-Name: George P. Huber
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the theoretical relevance and validity of using utility models and scaling techniques as an approach to operationalizing the concepts of goals and goal incompatibilities. The approach was used, with empirical data from municipal government officials in 380 cities, to test the propositions that (1) structural differentiation in organizations is associated with goal incompatibilities, and (2) goal incompatibilities are correlated with conflict in organizations. Both propositions were supported. On the basis of a literature review, it was concluded that (1) the concepts of goals and goal incompatibilities play important, but controversial, roles in organization behavior, and (2) there has been very little empirical research directed toward operationalizing these concepts. On the basis of the empirical research, it was suggested that the approach generates valid operationalizations of goals and goal incompatibilities. Goals which were shared across units tend to be of moderate importan...

Abstract: This research examined: (a) the relationship between the internal work motivation of employees and their job performance; and (b) the moderating effect of individual growth need strength, co-worker satisfaction, and supervisory satisfaction on the relationships between several job characteristics and internal motivation. Results showed positive, significant relationships between the measure of internal motivation and employees' rated work quality, quantity, and effort. In addition, significant relationships between the job characteristics and internal motivation were obtained for employees who were desirous of growth satisfactions and who experienced high satisfaction with their supervisors and co-workers. Implications of the results for future research on job design were discussed.

Title: Factors Affecting Acquisition of Beliefs about a New Reward System
Author-Name: Paul S. Goodman
Author-Name: Brian E. Moore
Abstract: This paper examines the relationships between individual, organizational, and interpersonal variables on the acquisition of beliefs about a new organizational reward system. The setting for the research is the introduc-tion of a companywide incentive plan (Scanlon Plan) into a manufacturing plant. Two types of beliefs are analyzed: (1) the belief that suggestion-making behavior leads to a reward (system expectancy); and (2) the belief that, given the effort, the individual can make productivity-related sugges-tions (self-expectancy). After the introduction of the reward system, managers' beliefs about this new Plan are more affected by individual level variables (e.g., educational level), while beliefs of blue-collar workers seem more affected by organizational (e.g., nature of task) or interpersonal variables. A measurement 6 months after the Scanlon Plan had been in operation seemed to indicate that the beliefs remained relatively stable. However, despite frequent bonuses from and participation in the n...

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to review the conceptual and methodological approach of one of the authors who has been identifying and modifying system states while a consultant to educational, industrial, and govern-mental institutions. We set out the approach as follows: First, we identify the elements which comprise the general system andfunction to maintain its existent state. These elements are called GIST (Groups, Individuals, Struc-ture, and Technology) and make up the subsystems of any organization which has begun to undergo bureaucratization. Second, we present the hierarchy of organizational values and human needs which are met depend-ing upon the social-psychological state of the system at a given time. Third, we review the development of social-psychological measurement tools.

Title: Presenting Problems in Social Consultancy: Three Case Histories Concerning                 the Selection of Managers
Author-Name: Alastair Bain
Abstract: This paper examines the nature of presenting problems in social consultancy through analyzing three case histories concerned with the selection of managers. A theory is put forward that the role that is assigned by the presenter to the consultant contains within it the presenter's denied relationship to the problem. The work of social consultancy reverses this process such that what has been projected into the role of consultant is taken back by the presenter in the form of his link to the problem. The social space containing consultant, presenter, and problem has thereby been changed.

Title: Limitations and Prospects of Planned Change in Multinational Corporations
Author-Name: Ehud Harari
Author-Name: Yoram Zeira
Abstract: Planned organizational change efforts have rarely been initiated in multi-national corporations (MNCs). A survey we conducted among top man-agers of MNCs in various countries revealed why: managers are unfamiliar with the intricacies of the process, skeptical of the prospects for its success, and apprehensive of possible damaging effects. A major factor considered problematical is that the cultural heterogeneity of MNCs' work force is bound to lead to different perceptions of existing policies and patterns of organizational behavior and incongruent perceptions of the desired ones. We hypothesize four types of relationships between the existence of such differences or similarities and the prospects for successful planned change in MNCs. Subsequently, the analysis of three stages of a planned change effort in one MNC-diagnosis, analysis, and introduction of changes-sug-gests that differences in the perceptions of the existing situation may not preclude successful planned change under the following condition...

Title: The Effects of Motivational Orientation on Deindividuation
Author-Name: Russell R. Hamby
Abstract: Three motivational orientations (individualistic, competitive, and coopera-tive) were replicated from Deutsch (1960), and their effects on deindividua-tion in small groups were compared to a control condition. Indices were replicated from other studies of deindividuation, and behavior in the groups was coded in order to analyze the factors of deindividuation. Three factors were extracted, and they were disorganization, cohesion, and egocentrism. Composite indices were constructed, which revealed that deindividuation occurred in the individualistic condition more strongly than in any other condition. Also, while typically the three factors also occurred most strongly in the individualistic condition, cohesion was highest in the cooper-ative group, and egocentrism did not differ between individualistic and competitive conditions. It was noted that, while deindividuation has been conceptualized as the loss of inner restraints, the disorganization factor included indices of both individual and group restraint...

Abstract: Boundary-spanning activity was studied in a large manufacturing company through a sample of 192 managers, engineers, and supervisors. Contrary to prior theory and research, this study found boundary-spanning activity unrelated to role conflict or ambiguity and positively related to job satisfac-tion for the total sample. Boundary-spanning activity was also positively related to a number of job characteristics for the total sample. Marked dif-ferences in boundary-spanning activity and its relationships with other variables, however, were found across occupational levels. While managers and engineers generally had boundary-spanning activity related to high levels of job satisfaction and job characteristics, first-level supervisors had boundary-spanning activity related to higher role conflict and lower job satisfaction with opportunities for promotion.

Title: Sex Differences in Emotionality: A Multidimensional Approach
Author-Name: Jon G. Allen
Author-Name: Dorothy Markiewicz Haccoun
Abstract: An Emotionality Survey was developed to assess sex differences in three dimensions of emotion: covert responding, interpersonal expression, and attitudes toward responses and expressions. Situational determinants of responses were also investigated. Within each of these areas, four types of emotion were distinguished: anger, fear, joy, and sadness. In general, females exceeded males in reported emotionality, but sex differences varied as a function of dimension and type of emotion. Differences were greatest for interpersonal expression, and for fear and sadness. Females also reported more of an interpersonal basis for their emotional responses. The findings suggest a sex difference in the functional significance of emotion, and support a multidimensional approach to the investigation of sex differences in emotionality.

Abstract: The season's records of a Canadian ice hockey league provided the data for an investigation of aggression in relation to crowd size and competition. Crowd size was positively related to aggression in one season but not in the preceding year. Aggression increased over the three periods of game play but not across the season. League standing and the score existing during play were both significantly related to aggression. However, the aggression displayed by a team in a match was unrelated to their league standing vis a vis that of their opponents. The results are generally discussed within a frustration-aggression framework.

Abstract: Three studies investigated the degree and maintenance of idealized images in the marriage relationship. The first study provided strong evidence that one's image of one's spouse is highly idealized vis-a-vis relevant comparison persons. Studies two and three provided evidence that idealization is maintained through a pattern of biased causal attributions, such that one's spouse is credited with responsibility for good behaviors whereas bad behaviors are regarded as situationally caused. The role that idealization serves in perpetuating marital constructions of reality (Berger & Kellner, 1964) is discussed.

Author-Name: David C. Lundgren
Author-Name: Catherine Schaeffer
Abstract: Characteristics of interpersonal feedback and responses to feedback, as a function of time (early versus later sessions), sender (trainers, male members, female members), and individual group, were studied in four NTL Bethel Tgroups. Over time, member feedback became more expressive and less focused upon here-and-now events, while trainer feedback became more nondirective. During early sessions, trainer feedback was less expressive, less focused upon self-other relationships, less here-and-now, more negative and confronting, more abstract, and more interpretive than member feedback, although these differences diminished by later sessions. No significant differences were apparent between male and female senders. Group differences outweighed their similarities. Acceptance versus rejection of member feedback was related only to the extent to which feedback was positive and supportive.

Title: The Passive Small Group: Working Concepts
Author-Name: James P. Gustafson
Abstract: Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin Medical School A small group that shows little substance, involvement, or prospects for change poses a common practical problem for the group leader or consultant, who must identify the relevant issues that need to be spoken to or interpreted. This paper presents three perspectives that should be considered by the group leader or consultant in the diagnosis of these situations: (1) intergroup difficulties; (2) patterns of shared magical thinking; and (3) negative (ego) judgments about the safety of the situation for individual contributions. The literature which separately describes each of these perspectives is reviewed. A case study, of a Small Study Group, in which all three kinds of issues arose at different points in its history, demonstrates the practical application of this integrated theory of passivity in the small group. Although many situations of passive, apparently uninvolved small groups have behind this surface a complexity of intergroup ten...

Title: An Approach to the Analysis of Faculty-Student Interactions in Small Groups
Author-Name: Stuart T. Hauser
Author-Name: Roger L. Shapiro
Abstract: The adolescent's experience in groups and institutions is determined in important ways by the nature of the authority in these settings. To study adolescent relationships with those in authority positions we have used methods of participant observation in small groups. In two different settings we served as consultants for regularly meeting groups of adolescents and adults. On an adolescent psychiatric ward, these groups included patients, the ward administrator, and the head nurse. In a comparison setting from a private day school the groups comprised students, a school administrator, and a teacher. In this paper we report findings from the school study, where one of us (STH) met as a consultant with three groups over a total of 1/2 years. The observations we discuss primarily concern the various coping strategies used by the groups'faculty members. Attempts to abandon school role behaviors were common among the faculty members of the groups. Our observations suggest that these repeated efforts to either...

Title: Toward a Tolerance Theory of Worker Adaptation
Author-Name: Derek Biddle
Author-Name: Geoffrey Hutton
Abstract: The paper examines the ways in which people can achieve toleration of what is to them, and may appear to others as, an unsatisfying or impoverished work situation. The examination is based on an empirical study of six departments or workshops in an engineering company in the South of England. The analysis is made, not in terms or motives, needs, and attitudes, but in terms of living space-the psychological territory which serves to mediate and protect an individual's inner world and sense of worth. Jobs themselves, and organizational action, define apermitted living space which may or may not be congruent with the individual's required living space. Adaptive actions, to adjust individual living space or to construct group living spaces, are exemplified from the research cases, and shown to affect people's relations with their jobs, supervision, management, and unions. Links are made with the psychology of play and creativity and the social psychology of neighborhood.

Title: Attempted Suicide and Cultural Change: An Empirical Investigation
Author-Name: Alex Robertson
Author-Name: Raymond Cochrane
Abstract: Monitoring ofpatient records has shown that, over the last decade in Edinburgh, there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of attempted suicide among men aged under 25; whereas among men aged over 40, the rates have remained stable. This trend is paralleled in other parts of the U.K. The research described in this paper was based on the assumption that a change has occurred in the world-view of young people, and that this has been responsible for the differential increase in attempted suicide. The elements of this change were seen as: (a) an emphasis on the importance of "self-fulfillment"; (b) a belief that society, rather than the individual, should be responsible for providing the means to personal fulfillment; (c) a resulting tendency to regard social and material deprivations as obstacles to self-fulfillment. It was postulated that individuals who possess these values, and who live in objectively deprived circumstances, would be less willing to tolerate stresses than would their older counte...

Title: Reactions at Work and Their Influence on Nonwork Activities: An Analysis of a                 Sociopolitical Problem in Affluent Societies
Author-Name: Bertil Gardell
Abstract: Traditional ways of organizing work in industrialized societies are in conflict with basic human needs related to creativity, influence, and growth. This conflict seems to affect adversely not only work satisfaction and job and labor-market behavior, but also participation in and rewardsfrom nonwork activities such as participation in organized cultural, political, and educational activities. Evidence is also given for adverse effects on selfesteem and mental health. The advance of the Welfare State is seen as the materialfoundation making possible the present change in work values and expectations, calling for increased worker influence on different levels in the production system and for an increased quality of working life. At the same time, however, increased expectations are made toward the quality of nonwork activities and toward greater equality between sexes and generations, e.g., in relation tofamily duties, education, and labor-market opportunities. These value changes callfor a broader approach...

Title: Behavioral Science Engagements: Taxonomy and Dynamics
Author-Name: Albert B. Cherns
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the modes of engagement between social scientists and their clients. There are three significant variables: the negotiability of the problem, the openness of the client to the nature of the solution, and the discretion allowed to the social scientist in choice of method. During engagements clients experience pressure to close options, while social scientists wish to keep them open. The resulting balance determines the nature of the engagement at any time.

Title: The Relation of Individual Search Activity to Subjective Job Characteristics
Author-Name: John W. Dickson
Abstract: A part of the process of managerial problem solving is search. A number of subjective job characteristics, namely discretion, variety, unpredictability, and work interdependence, were examined to determine whether they are able to discriminate between managers who engage in a high level of search activity and managers who engage in a low level of search activity. Discretion was found to be the most important subjective job characteristic. Variety and work interdependence also contribute to the discrimination of managers along the dimension of search activity.

Author-Name: Melvin L. Reichler
Abstract: Information was gathered on several aspects of the work integration of a sample of husbands and on the marital satisfaction and power relations of the husbands and their wives. These data were separately factor analyzed, producing three factors of work integration: Job Satisfaction, Power Relations, and Mobility Aspirations; and two factors of marital integration: Marital Satisfaction and Conjugal Power. The items loading these factors were intercorrelated with the following results: items dealing with the intrinsic satisfactions of work, such as meaningfulness of work, liking for it, control over pace of work, correlated significantly with items indicating satisfaction of both husband and wife; items indicating extrinsic satisfactions of work, such as income, recognition, and job prestige, were not related to items of marital satisfaction. Additionally, there was little relationship between work integration and conjugal power. Finally, mobility aspirations appeared to be determined by wife's dominance an...

Title: Stand When Your Number is Called: An Empirical Attempt to Classify Types of                 Social Change Agents
Author-Name: Noel M. Tichy
Author-Name: Harvey A. Hornstein
Abstract: Interviews and questionnaires were administered to a varied group of professional social change agents. A four-category typology of change agent types was developedfrom an inductive analysis of the data. The categorization scheme best accounted for differences in the following areas: personal characteristics, values relative to social change, conceptualizations about what mediates change, change technologies employed, and the settings in which change work is carried out. The four types of change agents which emerged were: (1) the Outside Pressure Type who works to change systems from outside through the application of pressure using such tactics as mass demonstration, civil disobedience, and violence; (2) the Analysis for the Top Type who works primarily with business and government units to improve efficiency and output and employs analytic procedures to develop expert advice; (3) the Organization Development Type who works to improve a system 's problem-solving capabilities through applied behavioral sc...

Abstract: The removal of group members and the recruiting of new ones are central processes in the maintenance of a group, yet they receive little study. Bases for determining who will be expelled and who initiated are stated in the form of propositions. A number of hypotheses are then offered concerning conditions that may cause events to run counter to these propositions.

Title: The Pseudomutual Small Group or Institution
Author-Name: James P. Gustafson
Abstract: A mode for defense of the status quo in a small group or institution is described in this paper: namely, the blurring of the awareness of critical boundaries, including those boundaries of external relations with other groups, internal disagreement, language distinctions, the role of the leader, and the individuality of group members. The systematic use of these defenses, previously described by Wynne, Ryckoff, Day, and Hirsch (1958) in relation to family dynamics and summarized by the term "pseudomutuality, " is described here in relation to public small groups and institutions. The findings of Wynne, et al., Laing and Cooper (1964), Laing (1967), and Orwell (1946), concerning different aspects of pseudomutuality, are reviewed. A case study of systematic use of the entire mode of pseudomutuality from an Intergroup Exercise of a Group Relations Conference is presented. Effective consultation to small groups or institutions which utilize these defenses must proceed by clarifying the critical boundaries tha...

Title: Compliance with Legal and Bureaucratic Rules: The Case of Self-Employed                 Taxpayers in Israel
Author-Name: Miriam Domstein
Abstract: A random sample of about 2,500 self-employed taxpayers was chosen to investigate the conformity of taxpayers to income tax regulations. The indices of conformity are based on data derived from the taxpayers' files in the Income Tax Division. Two sets of hypotheses were formulated and tested, based on the proposition that a person's compliance with norms is a function of his basic orientations toward these norms on the one hand, and of the control system related to norm compliance on the other hand. In general, the findings support the basic proposition and the specific hypotheses derived from it. They also indicate that the basic orientation tends to be a major determinant of compliance in regard to the norms which determine the general terms of contact of the public with the organization, while the impact of the control structure is more complex and pervasive.

Abstract: This paper describes a structured model of conflict resolution, illustrated with examples from two workshops. The model stresses the task requirements of conflict resolution as contrasted with current process-oriented models. After defining the conflict and gathering information, participants choose among the options: Influence Attempts, Creating New Solutions, Redefinition of the Conflict, and Gathering More Information, returning to information-gathering and renewed choice until the conflict is resolved. The relative success of the initial 2-day workshops engenders optimism regarding further refinement of the model.

Title: Social Organization and Spatial Organization
Author-Name: R. Lecuyer
Abstract: In afirst experiment groups offivesubjects solved problems while seated at either a circular or a rectangular table. The leader's position at the end of the rectangular table enhanced his ability to direct the group. Leaders of the circular table did not benefit from a privileged position and were forced to ease group tension arising from competing solutions put forth by group members. In the second study, the experimenter either actively intervened in afour-member discussion or refrained. The groups all discussed at a circular table before moving to a rectangular table in a different room. Before-after comparisons of the seats chosen were made. Choice of seats at the rectangular table reflected the social relations that developed in the first part of the experiment.

Title: A Study of Situational (Cooperative/Competitive) and Personality ("High" and                 "Low" Participation) Factors on the Role Enactment of Human Relations Problems
Author-Name: Elizabeth Chell
Abstract: Individuals were selected according to their participation rates in a large group discussion. The effect of "high" and "low" participation on their performance in a subsequent triadic group problem-solving situation was measured using Bales' Interaction Process Analysis (Bales, 1950). The situation was manipulated by varying the conditions of cooperation and competition under which the individuals interacted. The effect of the interaction between the dimension of personality (participation rate) and the situation was also measured. It was found that there was a significant behavioral difference in the interaction of the "high" and "low" participators; that personality and situationalfactors were important determinants in specified ways of behavioral differences. The implications of this research for training personnel are discussed.

Title: Overtime, False Returns, and Restrictive Practices: The Perception of an                 Industrial Pay System
Author-Name: A. J. M. Sykes
Abstract: This study describes an industrial pay system established in the 1930s, which by 1956-the date of the study-had long been made obsolete by subsequent inflation and pay increases. It was, nevertheless, maintained in operation by the use of certain "patching" devices: unnecessary overtime, false returns, and restrictive practices. These were successful because, as analysis of the labor turnover showed, the men were interested only in the amount they earned, and not in their working conditions or in the time taken to earn it. The maintenance of the obsolete pay system by the use of such devices was not in the interests of either the management or the men but, for different reasons, they believed it to be. A common factor behind these beliefs was the failure of the management, the shop stewards, and the older men, at least, to perceive the extent and permanence of the changes which had taken place since the 1930s. This led to a common belief that the changes were merely temporary and that conditions would eve...

Title: On the Number and Size of Subgroups
Author-Name: John S. B. Lindsay
Abstract: The fact that a group may subdivide into smaller subgroups is examined in the light of probability theory. It is argued that the largest number of ways in which any size group can divide into subgroups of different sizes (including the monad) is the likeliest variant to occur. Such "commonest" variants include both monads (individuals) and polyadic subgroups; and it is inferred that the coexistence of worlds constructed in an individual idiom and those constructed in a collective mode is a natural consequence. Recorded data relating to the biological individual in his family context, to the "casual" individual in informal groups, to solo and group medical practices, and to larger occupational and religious groups are found to be consistent with the probability hypothesis put forward.

Title: The Effects of Social Power and Preexisting Attitudes on Public and Private                 Responses to an Induced Attitude

Abstract: A set ofpredictions was developed in which the occurrence of private acceptance, given that public compliance has been obtained, is viewed as a function of both the type of socialpower used by the influencing agent, and the magnitude of preexisting opposing attitudes within the individual being influenced. The attitude of 116 introductory psychology students toward the course requirement that they serve as subjects in psychology experiments was used to test the main predictions. Although these predictions were not supported by the data, further analysis uncovered the following results concerning the occurrence of private acceptance: (a) those subjects with a greater discrepancy between preexisting opposing attitude and induced attitude showed less private acceptance than those with less discrepancy, and (b) females showed more private acceptance when the influencing agent used reward power rather than referent power, while males showed more private acceptance when the agent used referent power rather than...

The results support the contention that the conceptual model on which the instrument was based does have applicability when applied to educational institutions. The data also provide support for the contention that the instrumentation discriminates between organizations. Further, the utility of the instrument, both theoretical and practical, is discussed.

Title: Guidelines for Overcoming Empirically Identified Evaluation Problems of                 Organizational Development Change Agents
Author-Name: Achilles A. Armenakis
Author-Name: Hubert S. Feild
Author-Name: William H. Holley
Abstract: Several authors have written about the problems of conducting organizational development (OD) evaluations, but two inadequacies still remain. First, many of these problems are quite likely indigenous to the situations experienced by the writer in his evaluations, and they may not be widely applicable or generalizable to a large number of practitioners. Thus, one may be concerned as to whether these are the problems that OD practitioners can expect to experience in their OD evaluations. The second inadequacy is that the problems reportedly experienced by OD practitioners are rarely found in the literature on OD evaluations. In fact, only one or two problems are generally discussed, and these problems have been experienced by the researcher in a specific evaluation. Due to these inadequacies, a survey questionnaire, the OD Survey Questionnaire, was developed to ascertain the evaluative problems of OD practitioners. With the members of the OD Network serving as the survey population, questionnaires were mail...

Author-Name: Bernard McCarthy
Abstract: Forty-eight male subjects who had previously completed Berger's selfacceptance (self-esteem) scale worked on problem-solving tasks in four person groups. After completion of the tasks, bogus feedback was provided which indicated that the group as a whole had done very well, very poorly, or average. No feedback was provided about the quality of individual performances. As predicted, perceptions of personal responsibility for the group's performance were found to be directly related to the quality of the bogus feedback; subjects in the success conditions felt more responsible than did subjects in the failure conditions, with the average feedback conditions falling intermediate. Contrary to predictions, self-esteem was not related to perceptions of personal or environmental responsibility for the group's performance. However, an interaction was obtained between selfesteem and group performance feedback on how much subjects felt that their prior behaviors were influenced by the other group members. High self-...

Title: Measurement of Beliefs
Author-Name: Rogene A. Buchholz
Abstract: This study assesses two different approaches to measuring beliefs about work as a human activity. The first approach is a whole systems approach that asks for a response to five different concepts of work expressed in paragraphs on a questionnaire. The second approach involves responses to individual belief statements that are then factor analyzed to form the same five dimensions expressed in the paragraphs. The computation of results shows a significant difference in scores between the two methods of measuring beliefs, thus making the question of which method measures "true" belief a crucial one for future research.

Author-Name: Susan V. Lourencol
Abstract: Reports of social conflict and failure within organizational planned change are few. This study, based on 15 months of participant observation, historical analyses, and informal interviews, depicts a three-year intervention into a commercial enterprise. The state of the organization and the strategies by which change was introduced are analyzed. Conflict avoidance, both by organization members and the two consultants involved in the change process, are demonstrated, and their conflicting philosophies of induced social change contrasted. Outcomes based on a prescriptive model of change are compared to a model of change providing a guide for choice among behaviors. Lastly, a theory of development based on Kohlberg's notions of conventional and principled morality is imposed on these two approaches to planned change and its implications discussed.

Title: Distributive Justice: Typology and Propositions
Author-Name: Kjell Y. Tornblom
Abstract: Previous formulations of injustice have left undiscovered the majority of the possible types of justice and injustice and have tended to conceal many of the structural features of the few types that have been recognized. It is here proposed that a specification of the structural properties of injustice types is crucial to making accurate predictions of people's reactions in such situations. By clearly specifying the various comparisons between two particular individuals, and between them and people associated with given reference positions, with respect to their inputs and outcomes, a typology of just and injust situations is constructed. A set of propositions is advanced with regard to the order of the various types of injustice in terms of the magnitudes ofjustice motivation that a person is likely to experience in such situations. These propositions prompt the questioning of two of J. S. Adams' conjectures with regard to magnitudes of injustice. They also lead to the conclusion that any "main type" or ...

Abstract: This paper examines the role of the educational linking agent in facilitating the dissemination and use of research information at the local school level. Four critical variables are examined: the amount of initiative used to reach the target group, the intensity of the relationship between the field agent and the client, the degree of expertise exhibited by the agent in carrying out the linking role, and the scope of the agent's clientele. Each is found to have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the linkage. A model is developed which summarizes the relationship between the variables discussed in the data.

Title: The Stratification of Work and Organizational Design
Author-Name: Ralph Rowbottom
Author-Name: David Billis
Abstract: To try to deepen an understanding of what hierarchies of management levels are about, a descriptive theory is offered of the existence of a natural stratification of the work to be done in organizations. It is based on action-research over a number of years in Social Services Departments in England and Wales. It appears that the first five successive organizational levels are concerned with what may briefly be categorized as: prescribed output work, situational response work, systematic service provision work, comprehensive service provision work, and comprehensive field coverage work. Examples are quoted of how this conceptual framework has been used in practice (a) to clarify and simplify existing managerial structures, and (b) to help design total organization according to the quality of response to the environment which is required.

Title: Hierarchy, Alienation, Commitment, and Organizational Effectiveness
Author-Name: William M. Evan
Abstract: Four dimensions of organizational hierarchy are identified: inequality of skills and knowledge, inequality of rewards, inequality of authority, and inequality of information distribution. Instead of the prevailing and largely untested hypothesis that hierarchical structure is positively related to organizational effectiveness, an alternative hypothesis is formulated, viz., that it is negatively related. This hypothesis is linked to a causal model interrelating hierarchical structure with work alienation, organizational commitment, and organizational effectiveness. Some evidence for the alternative hypothesis is examined. The four-dimensional concept is then used to assess the burgeoning literature on industrial democracy. The phenomenon of "shop-floor democracy" is conceptualized as involving a process of destratification with respect to allfour dimensions of hierarchy. In view of environmental pressuresfor the rationalization of organizations as well as the secular trend in this direction, a destratifica...

Title: Personal and Situational Determinants of Attribution of Responsibility for an Accident
Author-Name: Jerry I. Shaw
Author-Name: James A. McMartin
Abstract: An experiment was conducted to examine the hypothesis that self-protective attribution of responsibility for accidents is a function of personal relevance, situational relevance, and severity of the accident's consequences. As predicted, high personal and high situational relevance between the accident perpetrator and the subject-observers lessened their attributions of responsibility for a severe accident relative to a mild one, whereas low personal and high situational relevance increased their assignment of responsibility for a severe accident. Furthermore, the variability of subjects' responsibility attributions was significantly greater when both relevance cues were present than when they were absent. These findings were taken as evidence for two self-protective attribution tendencies: (1) "blame-avoid-ance," in which the observer is motivated to eschew blame should he become involved in a severe accident, and (2) "harm-avoidance, " in which the observer is motivated to preclude a severe accident fro...

Title: Differential Administrative Capacity and Organizational Development: A                 Kibbutz Case Study
Author-Name: David Billis
Abstract: This paper presents a discontinuous analysis of organizational development and the part played by administrative capacity considered as a summation of individual attributes. Based on 20 years'study of one kibbutz, it is suggested that there are qualitatively different levels of demand for administrative capacity, which can be identified and which, if they are not in equilibrium with available aggregate supply, cause serious organizational disturbance. In particular, imbalance in the supply-demand equation is presented as an alternative explanation of large-scale defection of members in the case study. Analysis of the career progressions of a number of kibbutz managers supports the contention that the rate of development of administrative capacity varies and that training cannot lift managers through the critical boundaries associated with different strata of work.

Title: The Human Subject: A Study of Individual Experimental Participation
Author-Name: Eric Skuja
Author-Name: Peter W. Sheehan
Abstract: Intensive analysis of subjects' individual perceptions of an experimental task was conducted in distinctly different contexts of testing. Independent sets of subjects were tested individually in a rapport-inducing context (defined as collaborative) and a traditional context of research engagement (defined as contractual). Collaborative subjects were either known before hand or not known beforehand by the experimenter who tested them. The task was a difficult problem-solving one that allowed subjects to manifest their changing perceptions of the test situation over time. Results indicated marked within-subject variability and intergroup variation in subjects' attitudes to the experimenter and his test procedures. Data highlighted, in particular, the error of typing subjects in terms of well-defined roles or collections of social attitudes. The pattern of interplay between subject and experimenter was multidimensional and suggested the need to redefine the application of the concept of role to the social ps...

Title: The Quality of Working Life: An Analysis
Author-Name: Maurice Philippe Boisvert
Abstract: Differences between workers' and researchers' concepts of the quality of working life were identified through the analysis of 155 questionnaires completed by white-collar workers. For workers the concept seems limited to intrinsic work aspects while for researchers its scope extends to the organizational and career domains of action. This difference indicates that misunderstandings are likely to arise that will endanger analysis and remedial actions with respect to the quality of working life.

Title: Individual Characteristics as Sources of Perceived Uncertainty Variability

Author-Name: John W. Slocum, Jr.
Abstract: Most contingency theorists have focused on perceived environmental characteristics while ignoring the possible impact of individual differences among subjects. The view that an organization is for the most part what people perceive it to be suggests the need to identify the potential role of individual differences in the perceptions of organizational properties. Four sources of variability in the perception of uncertainty were suggested and measured with a sample of 5i corporate division managers. Cognitive process variables were more consistently related to a manager's perceived uncertainty than were perceived environmental variables.

Abstract: The present study tests for the first time Niederhoffer's assertions that (1) cynicism, a long-standing problem among police, can be reduced by or is incompatible with professionalism and (2) cynicism in early and late stages of one's police career is low, but high in mid-career. Cases in this study are uniformed police personnel in nine Northwest Pacific police departments. The findings lend some support to both propositions but with important qualifications: The cynicism-professionalism linkage is due in part to differential bias, and the mid-career peak in cynicism is not very pronounced.

Title: The Internalization of the Female Stereotype by College Women

Abstract: It has often been assumed that through the process of socialization sex stereotypes are internalized, becoming, so to speak, second nature. This investigation examines the self-concepts, public selves, and perceptions of the female stereotype of a sample of college women and finds significant differences between the self-concepts of individuals and their public selves and their perception of the female stereotype, which suggest that the female stereotype is not internalized but rather acts as an external constraint in the behavior of such females.

Title: An Experiment in Autonomous Working in an American Underground Coal Mine

Author-Name: Grant R. Brown
Abstract: This paper presents a work-in-progress report on an action research project which began in the summer of 1973 at an underground coal mine in the eastern United States. Its aim has been to improve safety and increase job satisfaction while at the same time raising the level of performance. It is a joint undertaking of union and management and is part of a national program of demonstration quality of work-life projects. The first phase consisted of a sheltered experiment of one year's duration in which volunteers manned a selected mine section as autonomous groups. The responsibilities of the section were extended to include support work. The experiment was sufficiently successful that a decision was made to extend this method of working to the mine as a whole. This constitutes the second phase of the project which is still under way. The paper gives a detailed account of the complexities and difficulties so far encountered in proceeding from a sheltered experiment in a part system to the operational transf...

Title: You Can't Take Fingerprints Off Water: Police Officers' Views Toward "Cop"                 Television Shows
Author-Name: Alan F. Arcuril
Abstract: Given the disclaimers of the tentative and suggestive nature of the data, a majority of the 816 police officers in this study indicated that they viewed police shows that stressed professionalism. Police professionalism, which seemed to explain the popularity of some shows and the disdain for others, was discussed in terms of three overlapping factors: reality of the episode, believability of cops, crooks, and dialogue, and correctness of investigatory and other procedures. Of the 13 police shows surveyed, Adam 12 achieved the highest scores from policemen on both the realism and frequency dimensions. Interesting dialogue, humor, and correct police procedure were cited time and again by respondents who watched this show. Yet the key to the explanation of Adam 12's apparent popularity-along with F.B.I., Dragnet, and Streets of San Francisco-seems to be the high level of professional conduct. In all these shows, police are portrayed as competent, well-trained, dedicated-and professional. If the plots are oc...

Abstract: Four leadership styles were varied to study effects on individual risk-taking behavior in group settings. Democratic and authoritarian leadership styles significantly depressed a shift toward risk in groups when compared to laissez-faire led groups and no designated leader groups. These findings were in opposition with the usual shift toward risk noted when individuals meet in groups. Future research directions and implications of these findings are discussed.

Title: Evolving Alternative Organization Designs: Their Sociotechnical Bases
Author-Name: Louis E. Davis
Abstract: The implicit assumptions underlying dominant or classic organization designs and the presentforces in society are examined as a background for rise of alternative organization designs. Some fourteen attributes commonly shared by the new designs are presented. These include systemic structure and roles, organizations as open systems, design by joint optimization, organizational uniqueness, stated organizational values or philosophy, quality of working life as an essential objective, comprehensive roles, selfmaintaining social units, flat structure, participation, minimal status differences, make large small, iterative evolutionary development, and minimal critical specifications. Some attributes are a response to needs for institutional survival, others for long-term economic survival, and still others for enhanced institutional effectiveness. A postscript compares evolving alternative organization designs with proposals of proponents of intermediate technology.

Title: The Role of Environment in a Configurational Theory of Organizations
Author-Name: Stephen M. Shortell
Abstract: This paper refines existing conceptualizations of organizational task environments by distinguishing among environmental complexity, diversity, instability, uncertainty, dependence, and hostility. Based on these concepts, a typology is presented that suggests that certain combinations of environmental dimensions are important for classifying organizations. Further, the various combinations of environmental dimensions are used to specify a configurational theory of organizations by suggesting interaction effects between the various environmental dimensions and internal organizational design. Based on the typology of environmental dimensions and three premises, twelve propositions are derived for empirical testing. The existing literature relevant to some of the propositions is reviewed, the strengths and limitations of the theory are presented, and some implications for organizational research are discussed, particularly in terms of constructing more comprehensive theories of organizations.

Title: Patterns of Alienation in Inner City Ghettos
Author-Name: William W. Philliber
Abstract: Although high rates of alienation are known to exist in inner city ghettos, it is not known whether that alienation is directed toward society as a whole or if individuals make distinctions between different sectors of the social system. Relationships between the levels of alienation directed toward four aspects of society are analyzed to determine if they are the result of a single underlying response to society or if they are the product of separate orientations. The findings show that individuals in low-income areas develop a generalized response to the bureaucratic aspects of urban society. They do not view society in terms of its component subsystems but instead treat each sector as a part of the whole. However, the orientation of a person to his neighborhood is independent of his orientation toward other aspects of society.

Title: Organizational Activism and Its Relation to "Reality" and Mental Imagery
Author-Name: Roger D. Evered
Abstract: The paper explores some of the attributes of organizational activists, in terms of their personality types, their characteristic behaviors, and their imaging styles when personally confronting their own futures. It was found that activists prefer intangible imagery to the tangible sensible world; are intuitives rather than sensers; are internally rather than externally oriented; are somewhat compulsive; are self-generative in terms of their identity; and are diversity generators rather than diversity regulators. The study provides a significant bridge between (a) Lewin 's little-recognized formulation of the life-space notion in terms of 'degrees of reality/irreality'; (b) the intuitivesensing dimension of Jung's theory of psychological types; and (c) the internal-external dichotomy of Rotter and others. The overall aim of the paper is to contribute to the integration of the conceptual foundations of the social sciences, in order to create an eventual theory of social change.

Title: Job Characteristics and the Attitudes of Female Manual Workers: A Research Note
Author-Name: David Birchall
Author-Name: Ray Wild
Abstract: This note reports an exploratory investigation of the relationship between certain job characteristics (cycle time, stage in the process, nature of the work, work pacing), workers'perceptions of their jobs, and their attitudes to them. Data were collected by interview and forced-choice questionnaire in respect of the jobs of 428 full-time female workers employed on 21 manual semiskilled jobs. Multiple linear regression was employed in order to control the effects of certain intervening variables. Job satisfaction was found to be positively related to stage in the process and work pacing, and negatively related to cycle time and nature of the work. The validity of some of the normal assumptions of job design is questioned and it is concluded that in some situations it may not be desirable to prescribe job designs that result in the provision of greater variety, responsibility, and worker control.

Title: Indices for Consistency in Qualitative and Quantitative Structures
Author-Name: Edmund R. Peay
Abstract: Indices for clusterability, a generalization of balance, are developed as measures of the tendency toward consistency in structures represented by signed graphs. The effects of path length are taken into account as well as the importance of algorithmic methods for analyzing complex structures. Strength of relationship is incorporated as the approach is extended to quantitative structures, where values are assigned to the interpoint relationships. Certain crucial advantages of analyzing quantitative rather than the usual qualitative structures receive attention, including the possibility of distinguishing different forms or levels of the consistency criterion. Relationships with existing indices are discussed.

Title: Some "Real-Life" Accounts of Influential Relationships
Author-Name: John Shaw
Abstract: A preliminary study of influential relationships in their lives was carried out on the basis of reports from 10 subjects. These were content-analyzed for source characteristics, types of relationship, nature of the influence process, source/content orientation, and the functional autonomy of induced behavior or attitudes. A mixture of the processes of influence described by Kelman (1958) emerges in some cases, either through various combinations of socialpower, attractiveness, or credibility, or by successive stages of compliance, identification, or internalization. In long-term relationships, internalization may follow initial identification for source-oriented subjects, provided that conflicting influences are minimal. There is some evidence that the process of influence for content-oriented subjects operates in the way that Kelman and Eagly (1965) suggest. The functional autonomy of induced behavior or opinions is a likely outcome of long-term satisfying relationships whether the source characteristics...

Title: The Qualities of Leadership: How Male Medical Students Evaluate Their Female Peers

Author-Name: Aaron Honori Katcher
Abstract: The Bales Group Space Questionnaire, which measures perceptions of dominance, friendliness, and orientation toward task accomplishment, was given to the members of six-person anatomy dissection groups containing one, two, or three women. The medical students were asked to characterize themselves and other group members once at the start of the term and again at its conclusion. Male medical students ranked women relatively low on dominance, regardless of the number of women in a group, both at the start and at the end of the term. Women were ranked as neither highly friendly nor highly unfriendly. There was no effect of time or of group composition on ratings offriendliness. Group composition did affect male perception of women's task orientation. In groups with one woman, women were ranked relatively low on task orientation. In groups with more than one woman, women were equally distributed along the ranks in task orientation. The results suggest that males tend to stereotype women's behavior and exclude ...

Title: Goals and Bureaucratic Decision-Making: An Experiment
Author-Name: Barry Bozeman
Author-Name: William E. McAlpine
Abstract: The objective of this experiment was to determine how certain attitudes and strategies of individuals impinge on their patterns of choice in a set of controlled decisional contexts representing a bureaucratic decision environment. Of particular interest was a decisional pattern in which the individual strives to maximize individual goals to the detriment of organizational and "mission" goals. The subjects of analysis were 81 undergraduate students who were grouped into teams and asked, after consulting with team members, to make decision choices concerning individual, group, and mission goals. It was hypothesized that variance in individual decisions could be explained by team interaction and psychological attribute variables. It was found that a mission strategy was most likely to be pursued by individuals who were relatively cosmopolitan and uncynical. Team strategies were largely a function of team strategy variables. The attitudinal variables were not particularly useful in predicting variance in an i...

Title: Escalation: The Determinants of Commitment to a Chosen Course of Action
Author-Name: Barry M. Staw
Author-Name: Frederick V. Fox
Abstract: Previous research has shown that individuals are most likely to escalate the amount of resources committed to a course of action when they have been personally responsible for negative consequences. The present study examined the process of escalation over three points in time and under four experimental conditions. A 2 X 2 X 3 factorial experiment was conducted in which personal responsibility, efficacy of resources, and time were the independent variables, and commitment of resources to a course of action was the dependent variable. The results replicated the escalation effect over an immediate time period, but showed that investment of resources in a course of action was not stable over time. Although there were immediate effects of personal responsibility and efficacy of resources upon escalation behavior, these two variables interacted with the time factor.

Title: How Individuals Conceptualize Conflict: Identification of Steps in the                 Process and the Role of Personal/Developmental Factors
Author-Name: Meryl Reis Louis
Abstract: Organizational conflict management has tended to emphasize the effects of another party's behavior and of background conditions upon an individual's conflict behavior, implicitly treating conflict parties mechanistically as interchangeable responders to conflict stimuli. In contrast, this paper highlights individual differences as significant factors in conflict management. Drawing upon the more humanistic and clinical psychological literatures, the present paper develops a conceptual framework of the process through which an individual conceptualizes conflict and the impact of personal/developmental variables upon conceptualization. The model was developed using methods of grounded theory generation. Stages in the conceptualization process were found to be: experience symbolization, causal attribution, intentional attribution, context analysis, content analysis, and choice assessment. Individual differences act as perceptual screens and can trigger distortional defenses at each stage in the processing of...

Title: The Loci of Work Satisfaction: Job, Interaction, and Policy
Author-Name: Ralph Katz
Author-Name: John Van Maanen
Abstract: Three thousand five hundred subjects from four governmental organizations (two municipalities, one county, and one state) were interviewed to investigate the nature ofjob satisfaction in the public sector. The intent of the study is to examine the relationships between components of satisfaction and various conceptually objective design variables of the work environment including characteristics of the assigned tasks, work assistance, pay, promotions, and communications, among others. Using the techniques of multidimensional scaling and clustering, a tripart locus of work satisfaction is derived involving job properties, interactional features, and organizational policy variables. Each of the loci is shown to be analytically distinct and related to a specific set of design features. The implications of these findings for change programs such as job enrichment are subsequently discussed.

Title: Protestantism and Retrospective Labeling: A Cross-Cultural Study in Person Perception
Author-Name: Bernard Goitein
Author-Name: Mordechai Rotenberg
Abstract: Person perception was studied experimentally to test certain predictions following from Rotenberg's theory concerning the effects of the Calvinist conception of Man on Western culture. Americans scored significantly higher than Israelis on a Protestant ethic scale. When American and Israeli subjects were asked to rate, on the basis of past information, the probabilities of a person being at present a mental patient ("damned') or a successful businessman ("elect'", Americans were consistently more deterministic in their interpersonal perceptions than Israelis. The hypothesis that in retrospective labeling increases in probability ratings of the outcomes, once a label has been assigned, will be greater among Americans than Israelis was not confirmed. Implications for future research are briefly discussed.

Author-Name: Nigel Nicholson
Author-Name: Toby Wall
Author-Name: Joe Lischeron
Abstract: Absenteeism and labor turnover rates have not proved to be consistently predictable on the basis of individual attitudes towards work. It is argued that this inconsistency might in part be attributed to three factors: (a) the lack of studies using the individual worker as a unit of analysis; (b) the use of inappropriate measures of labor turnover; and (c) insufficiently broad coverage of worker attitudes in the measures used. In the present study an attempt is made to avoid these problems. Individually reported absence and the propensity to leave were examined as correlates of satisfaction with several work dimensions and attitudes towards influence at different levels of organizational decision-making. It was found that satisfaction, particularly with the work itself, was negatively related to both absence and the propensity to leave. Moreover, perceived influence in decision-making, especially at lower organizational levels, was related to the two dependent variables. The implications of these findings ...

Title: Autonomy and Participation at Work
Author-Name: Bertil Gardell
Abstract: The interrelationships of job content, job involvement, and worker participation are investigatedforprocess workers, massproduction workers, and batch workers, on the basis of a hypothesis that demandsfor workerparticipation are generally favored by autonomy and high skill characteristics in one's own job. As to demands for increased personal participation the hypothesis is supported in the process industry, but not in metalworking industry, where high skill demands are found in craft-based batch production. This difference is discussed in terms of integration and continuity in the production process. In both industries it is found that high involvement in repetitive and unskilled tasks is not accompanied by increased demands for participation. As to demands for worker participation through the system of representative democracy these are generally high and tend to increase with increasing autonomy in one's own job. Perceived success for the system of representative democracy leads to increasing demands f...

Title: What Future for the Female Subject? Some Implications of the Women's Movement                 for Psychological Research
Author-Name: Helen Weinreich
Abstract: The scientific effects of the recent changes in perspectives on female role are reviewed, in terms of the rapid rise of research in the area of sex-role development, attribution of sex differences, and the attention paid to the biases consequent upon scientific as well as popular sex-role stereotyping. It is argued that not only more, but new, questions are being asked as a consequence of this change of perspective. A number of studies are examined that indicate the effects on female self-definition and self-evaluation of the cultural stereotypes. Studies of women's movement participants are reviewed that illustrate something of the processes and prerequisites involved in the rejection of sex-role stereotypes and the redefinition of the self. The interaction of political and scientific thought that is particularly manifest in this area of psychological investigation is commented upon.

Title: Dimensions of Organizational Technology and Structure: An Exploratory Study
Author-Name: Bernard C. Reimann
Abstract: Based on a review of the literature on organization structure and technology, a model is developed for describing process technology along two dimensions: (1) the degree of use of mass-production technology, and (2) the degree of technical change. Results of a field study indicate that neither dimension of technology is very strongly related to structure. Rather the two dimensions of technology appear to interact in their relationship to structure-especially with respect to the degree of centralization. Among manufacturing firms using relatively low degrees of mass production, centralization is strongly and positively related to the degree of technical change, but among relatively mass-production-oriented firms this relationship is nil. These results are interpreted to suggest that the extent to which a manufacturing organization can or will change its internal structure in response to technological changes may well be contingent on the degree to which it is already committed to using mass-production tech...

Abstract: A framework and method of a three-country comparative study on the process of participative decision-making is described. Research methods, models, and instruments are developed in the context of a longitudinal de-sign. The major hypotheses relate to the situationally determined relation between power decentralization, skill utilization, and effectiveness. The four-year study hopes to provide at least partial answers to some theoretical as well as practical questions in a field of considerable current controversy in Europe.

Title: User Influence and the Success of MIS Projects: A Contingency Approach
Author-Name: Anders Edstrom
Abstract: In the present study we investigate alternative specifications of the relation-ship between user influence and the success of the management information system (MIS) project. The aim is to learn if success varies with the influence of different types of users, the phase of the development process during which influence is exerted, the effectiveness of the communication process, the characteristics of the task that the system is designed to support (task environment) and the characteristics of existing computer-based systems (system environment). Data are collected by structured interviews of key actors in the development process. The results indicate that the factors specified above are important contingencies for the relationship between user influence and the success of MIS projects. Tentative causal models are proposed to relate the important variables.

Title: Black, White, White Gifted, and Emotionally Disturbed Children's Perceptions of the Reality in Television Programming
Author-Name: William A. Donohue
Author-Name: Thomas R. Donohue
Abstract: Given the general and somewhat contradictory nature of previous research examining children's perceptions of the reality in television programming, this paper attempted (1) to separate the different levels of television content, (2) to determine the extent to which personal experience with specific role and situational stereotypes influence judgments of television's presenta-tions, and (3) to examine a wide range of socioeconomic status (SES) char-acteristics within the context of the same study to facilitate direct compari-sons. The results of the study indicate that lower SES Blacks and emotion-ally disturbed children view specific role stereotypes and general situations as significantly more real than do Whites and gifted children. The implica-tions of these findings relevant to the child's maturation process were explored.

Title: Assimilation and Contrast Effects in the 1972 Election
Author-Name: Donald Granberg
Author-Name: Richard Jenks
Abstract: Longitudinal data from the 1972 election study of the Survey Research Center were analyzed to examine for possible displacement effects (assimi-lation and contrast) in estimations of the candidates'positions on 14 issues. Pervasive assimilation of one's preferred candidate occurred, and this appeared to be stronger than the contrast of one's nonpreferred candidate. The latter was deemed unreliable for Nixon voters placing McGovern and marginally reliable for McGovern voters placing Nixon. Displacement effects tended to be slightly larger before than after the election. Among the McGovern voters, those expecting him to win showed a greater change in displacement effects than those not expecting him to win. Among the Nixon supporters, the Republicans showed greater assimilation than the Demo-crats or Independents. Assimilation appeared to be directly associated with ambiguity while contrast tended to be inversely associated with ambiguity. People placing a preferred candidate tended to show less variance th...

Title: Administrator Effectiveness: The Effects of Advocacy and Information on                 Achieving Outcomes in an Organizational Context
Author-Name: Jeffrey Pfeffer
Author-Name: Gerald R. Salancik
Abstract: The effects of (J) information about the distribution of subunit influence, (2) information about the subunit's standing on various dimensions, and (3) the effects of advocating that allocations be based on dimensions favoring the subunit were examined for a sample of academic departments in a large state university. Advocating the use of criteria favorable to the subunit was positively related to allocations, particularly for more powerful subunits and less critical and scarce resources. Knowledge about the organization's political structure primarily benefitted the allocations of less powerful de-partments. These results heldfor resources allocated through committees of department representatives. However, for general fund allocations, made through an administrative decision process, advocacy tended to decrease re-source allocations, with this effect observed more for high power depart-ments. The results are discussed in terms of the liaison role of the administrator, employing the conceptualization of ...

Title: On the Psychology of the Apollo Moon Scientists: A Chapter in the Psychology                 of Science
Author-Name: Ian I. Mitroff
Author-Name: Inez Fitzgerald
Abstract: This paper describes afollow-up study of a 4-year investigation of the scientific attitudes and personalities of a select sample of the Apollo moon scientists. Semantic differentials for the purpose of eliciting the structure of scientific roles and personalities were administered. Also administered were the Leary Adjective Check List and Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank. The results show not only that there are strong and sharp differences among a small number of different scientific "types," but also that scientists are affectively involved with their work to a high degree. The results of the study lend support to some of Abraham Maslow's provocative ideas regarding the psychology of science.

Title: A Methodological Critique of Fifty-Eight Selected Work Experiments
Author-Name: Thomas G. Cummings

Author-Name: Roy Glen
Abstract: This paper evaluates the internal and external validity of 58 work experiments-e.g., job enrichment, participative management, and autonomous group studies. The experiments are classified according to their independent and dependent variables; then each study's research design is evaluated in terms of various threats to internal and external validity. The results show that the attitudinal and performance improvements reported in the experiments are questionable but not altogether implausible. The findings of the studies appear to be generalizable to a wide range of populations and settings. Several suggestions for the improvement of research in this field are presented in light of the results of this critique.

Title: Personality Characteristics and Interracial Contact as Determinants of Black                 Prejudice Toward Whites
Author-Name: Linda A. Foley
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to determine how interracial contact affects the attitudes of Blacks toward Whites. The study also delineates the personality characteristics predictive ofprejudice and prejudice changes, and how these characteristics differ between Blacks and Whites. The subjects were 112 male inmates (63 Blacks and 49 Whites) newly admitted to a medium security state correctional institution. Over a period of 1 month every new inmate was requested to answer a series of questionnaires to assess his cognitive complexity, self-esteem, attitudes toward people, and prejudice. Three weeks after his first session each subject was requested to respond to a second measure of prejudice. The data indicate that initially Whites were much more prejudiced than Blacks. The contact situation increased prejudice in Blacks and decreased prejudice in Whites. Within each group positive attitudes toward people in general predicted a decrease in prejudice. This was the only variable which functioned the same for ...

Title: Status Equilibration: Fueled by Uncertainty, Frustration, or Anxiety?
Author-Name: Donald B. Trow
Abstract: Status incongruence in groups is thought to produce tension and to give rise to attempts at equilibration of the incongruence by one means or another. Status incongruence is inevitably confounded with its constituent status differences, however, and it is possible that they by themselves produce part or all of both the tension and the equilibration. Attitudes toward status and toward incongruence are here employed to disentangle these main and interactive effects. Results suggest that anxiety concerning status per se has more to do with both the tension and the equilibration of status incongruent encounters than does either sensitivity to the imbalance of incongruence or frustration engendered by its injustice.

Title: Sex Differences in Attitude to Parenthood
Author-Name: Michael Humphrey
Abstract: Attitudes to parenthood were explored in prospective adopters and ordinary parents by means of a repertory grid technique. Contentment and mother-hood were more strongly associated in the minds of wives than contentment andfatherhood in the minds of husbands. Men (especially when childless) were likely to associate fatherhood with masculinity, whereas femininity and motherhood were conceptually independent in both groups of women. The findings are interpreted as supporting the concept of traditional differences between male and female viewpoints.

Title: Sex Roles and Personality Correlates
Author-Name: Dorothy D. Nevill
Abstract: A list of 1, 000 names, stratified by sex and socioeconomic status, was randomly chosen from the population of a university community. A questionnaire packet consisting of the Bem Sex-Role Inventory, the Tennessee Self Concept Scale, and the Personal Orientation Inventory was mailed to those people who indicated a willingness to participate in the study. Analysis of the data revealed a strong positive relationship between androgyny as measured by the BSRI and the two measures of psychological health. The Results were taken to support the hypothesis that the availability of multiple soles to an individual was related to that person's skill in social behavior and to the larger context of healthy personality.

Abstract: A number of studies dealing with subunits and total organizations have confirmed the relationship between large group size and increase in conflict and disputes together with decrease in morale, cohesiveness, and consensus. The question arises: Are the theoretical implications, empirical findings, and hypotheses for subgroups and total organizations generalizable to larger social systems? The size-conflict hypothesis is examined in relationship to the population size of nations and the magnitude of intranation and internation conflict. The results of the study show that the propositions formed at one level of analysis can be employed successfully at another level.

Title: The Higher-Order Needs of London Bus Crews: A Two-Factor Analysis
Author-Name: Godfrey Gardner
Abstract: In a study of London bus drivers and conductors it was found, first,. that Herzberg's two-factor theory of job satisfaction was well supported by the analysis of aggregate responses, whereas the individual analysis supported only that half of the theory relating to Motivators. Second, as predicted, lower-order needs (Hygienes) exceeded higher-order needs (Motivators) by three to one. On the basis of educational and cultural trends it was predicted that, compared with older workers, younger workers would show a greater concern for higher-order needs. This was not substantiated. In general, within the two factors there were many discrepant items. It is suggested that the time has now come to use Herzberg's M-H analysis as a way of looking at organizations rather than motivation.

Title: Toward an Adequate Theory of Stress Resolution in Work Groups
Author-Name: Karen F. Pridham
Abstract: The theoreticalformulations of stress in small, face-to-faceproblem-solving or work groups that are available in the literature are characterized by conceptual problems which limit usefulness. In particular, the study of mechanisms which members use and the moves which the group as a whole makes to resolve a state of stress that is related to its functioning is precluded. This paper proposes a theoreticalformulation that is grounded in the work of W. R. Bion and that incorporates a concept of stress intended to permit analysis of group moves and individual mechanisms to resolve stress. Two extant theoreticalformulations of work group behavior that include a concept of stress related to group processes are reviewed in light of three metatheoretical criteria. These criteria are: (1) stress that is specified as a state of the group, (2) stress responses that are characterized by alloplastic adaptation (i.e., processes that modify circumstances or shape the environment), and (3) stress that is transactionally...

Title: Observations on the Functions of Voluntary Associations, with Special                 Reference to West African Cities
Author-Name: Michael K. Schutz
Abstract: The author cites examples of West African voluntary associations (VAs) and discusses the various expressive and instrumental benefits they provide for participants. In categorizing the groups, he treats expressive and instrumental orientations as two separate and variable dimensions. Accordingly, every VA has a value, either high or low, on each dimension. The author offers propositions and empirical evidence regarding the frequency of occurrence and the general nature of the four types of VAs thus generated. Finally, he suggests that these propositions would also apply to social movement organizations, and calls for more efforts to synthesize findings from a number of related areas.

Abstract: Three studies are reported that test the hypothesis that the best attitudinal predictor of behavior is one that is specific to the behavioral criterion. In all three studies, an individual's attitude toward performing the behavior was more highly correlated with behavior than the individual's attitude toward the object of the behavior. This was true (a) in predicting both current and future behaviors of individuals, (b) by using either self-reports or "observer" reports of the behavioral criterion, and (c) across three different behaviors.

Abstract: Managers (236) from 12 different companies were examined for the prevalence of Type A behavior. In addition, a number of work habits and job related variables (work hours per week, travel habits, job satisfaction, job tension factors, salary) were obtained on each respondent. Overall, 61% of the managers were classified as Type A's, and between companies the percentage varied between 50 and 76%. Type A behavior was also found to be related to recent company growth rates. On work habits, it was found that that extreme Type A 's tend to work more hours per week and travel more days per year. It was also found that the Type A 's tend to be less satisfied with their jobs. Using factor analysis, fivejobfactors were isolated and these were entitled Ambiguity, Locked-In, Stagnation, Isolation, and Contentment. Type A's were found to be different from Type B's on the factors Locked-In and Contentment. The Locked-In factor is interpreted as reflecting greater self-confidence among the Type A's. The Contentment fac...

Title: Individual Differences in Participative Decision-Making
Author-Name: Richard M. Steers
Abstract: This investigation examines the relative contributions of several individual difference factors to the amount of subordinate participation in decisionmaking (PDM) allowed by superiors among a sample of 103 male and female employees. It was found that females as a group are more participative than males and that such sex differences often affect the relation of personality variables to PDM. Moreover, the findings serve to support and extend Vroom and Yetton's (1973) findings concerning individual and situational contributions to PDM by examining such findings for males and females separately.

Abstract: This article investigates the correlation of personality variables and inter-group conflict resolution modes. In the first of two -research approaches, EPPS scores of 64 college students on aggression, dominance, affiliation, and achievement were correlated with preferences for confronting, forcing, and smoothing. A field study correlated EPPS variables of 19 boundary personnel with ratings on resolution modes by 57 interorganizational correspondents. As hypothesized, achievement was positively correlated with confronting under both research approaches. Only students' aggression scores correlated weakly and positively with preference for forcing. Affiliation and smoothing were also weakly and positively correlated with the students but not in the field.

Author-Name: B. M. O'Connor
Abstract: Results are presented of the third experiment in a series designed to test a discontinuity theory of psychological development. Use is made of the phenomenon of loss of skill under conditions of increasing rate of change of perceptual field. The scores provided by a population mixture of university undergraduates and graduates separate clearly into two groups which are identified with levels 4 and 5 of the theory. The series provides a compound indirect test of the theory and also substantiates earlier problem-solving experiments. A secondary analysis of the results provides indications of the proportions of schoolchildren (and university undergraduates) corresponding to the different levels of psychological development. Much wider differences in development are revealed than are suggested from conventional psychological and educational research.

Title: The Leader, She: Dynamics of a Female-Led Self-Analytic Group
Author-Name: Mei-fei Elrick
Abstract: The dynamics of self-analytic, or learning groups, are understood in terms of the leader as male. Since males and females are socialized into different roles in our society and these roles are differently valued, it was questioned whether the dynamics of this type of group would change if the leader were female. The data used to explore this question were gathered in a university course, Group Dynamics, in which the nominal leader was female. In the early life of the group there was a certain amount of denial that the leader was female. This was aided by the stereotype of the professor-leader being male. As the group progressed, this effect diminished. One interesting difference in the dynamics of this female-led group was that the males and not the females "killed" the leader, as has been found in male-led groups. Other trends which appeared were lessened competition in the group, a feeling of castration and/or powerlessness on the part of some of the males, and some differences in the hero role.

One of the primary purposes of community-based corrections is the delivery of service, aiding in the reintegration of the offender into the community. Organization exchange theory is utilized as the theoretical basis for program implementation, a three-stage model is developed as a planning guideline for the acquisition of needed services, and afinal model is presented which serves an implementation function for the "ideal-type" model presented.

Title: An Attributional Analysis of Responsibility for a Happy Accident: Effects of                 Ability, Intention, and Effort
Author-Name: James A. McMartin
Author-Name: Jerry I. Shaw
Abstract: Two experiments concerned with attribution of responsibility for a happy accident were conducted in order to distinguish defensive attribution theory from an attributional model of achievement evaluation. The principal findings were: (1) In both experiments responsibility judgments decreased as the severity of the happy accident increased (the "happy accident" effect); and (2) this effect was attenuated when the stimulus person (SP) had been described as exerting effort in the situation, but it was not affected by information about SP's ability or his intentions. These data are interpreted as support for the attributional model of achievement evaluation as well as an attributional formulation derived from equity theory. Sex differences were also discussed.

Title: Authority and Democracy in Organizations
Author-Name: Lawrence B. Mohr
Abstract: Participativeness as a style of supervision is considered as a dependent variable. The data do not directly support the initial hypotheses in any important way, but severalfindings of interest emerge indirectly from a more detailed, multivariate analysis. First, supervisory behavior in these terms is probably influenced significantly by affect between supervisor and subordinates. Second, when affect is not a factor, supervisory style is more rational, with participativeness depending on the training of the subordinates and their perceived capacity to contribute constructively to decision-making. Third, the measurement of participativeness in research affects theoretical development in an important way, since the technical and professional level of subordinates probably has a significant effect upon their objective level of participation but not upon the degree of participation as reported by them. Fourth, the latter finding is significant for the much more common body of research in which participation is...

Title: Marginality, Role Conflict, and Status Inconsistency as Forms of Stressful Interaction
Author-Name: Paul D. Starr
Abstract: Many sociologists have hypothesized that persons who possess inconsistent or conflicting attributes will tend to experience stress and manifest certain psychological characteristics which are markedly different from those who possess ordinary combinations of attributes. This problem has been regarded from three theoretical perspectives, the "theories" of the marginal man, role conflict, and status inconsistency. After examining the ways in which each perspective has been employed, this paper discusses several points of convergence and specifies implicit assumptions each makes about the nature of the interaction involved. Some conclusions are offered which indicate the usefulness of a reductionist approach in the formulation of sociological theory and in the conduct of research.

Title: Computers and Management Structure: Some Empirical Findings Re-examined
Author-Name: Daniel Robey
Abstract: This paper re-examines empirical literature which relates computerization to organization structure. Explanations are sought for the conflicting findings regarding the effects of computer adoption on centralization and decentralization. A review of the literature suggests that: (1) computers do not cause changes in the degree of delegation, (2) computerized systems are sufficiently flexible to facilitate either centralized or decentralized structures, and (3) the degree of delegation in these studies is related to task environmental conditions of the organizations studied. Certain conceptual and methodological issues pertaining to this line of research are discussed, including the meaning of centralization, the perceptual bias in interviewing affected managers, the lack of adequate effectiveness measures in most studies, and the very basic problem of treating computerization as a variable. Further research on computerization should focus away from the present confining framework to look at environmental c...

Author-Name: Daniel Charles Feldman
Abstract: The research examines the use of initiation activities during socialization, examining both "initiation to the task, " which serves to increase the feelings of competence of employees, and "initiation to the group," which serves to increase the feelings of acceptance of employees. Using interview and questionnaire data from 118 hospital employees, the research presents empirical evidence which suggests that people who undergo identifiable, symbolic initiations do not feel either significantly more competent or accepted than those who do not. In the context of a broader contingency model of socialization the research also examines: (a) those variables that do influence how competent and accepted employees come to feel; (b) the outcomes of initiation activities; and (c) the relationship between initiation to the task and initiation to the group.

Abstract: The purposes of this research were, first, to examine the relationship between self-expression in organizational participation and the professional and nonprofessional dimension; second, to replicate Bonjean and Markham's study on a professional organization; and third, to determine the utility of this questionnaire as an administrative tool. This paper is an extension of research, particularly in personality and organization theory, which examines the relationship between individual predispositions and organizational constraints. This empirical investigation is aimed at examining this '`fit" for professional and nonprofessional staff in a professional organization. The questionnaire utilized consists of 24 items which comprise the self-expression measure and 10 behavioral measures and a measure of job satisfaction. The first three hypotheses suggest that there will be significant differences between subgroups on the level of self-expression and the ranking of ideal job characteristics and satisfactions. ...

Title: An Observation Study of a Large Public Accounting Firm
Author-Name: C. Richard Baker
Abstract: The concern of this inquiry is with management strategy in a large, international public accounting firm. The large accounting firm must deal with a variety of difficult problems in its efforts to grow and remain successful. Borrowing from the terminology of Emery and Trist, the interrelatedness of many of these problems tends to suggest a "turbulent field environment. " In this paper, an observation approach is used to discover the strategy which the large accounting firm employs in its attempt to deal with a complex and changing environment. Results indicate that there is a three pronged strategy consisting of providing clients with a tangible product (Doing), marketing the image of the firm to the business community (Representing), and marketing the image of competence and integrity of the firm to the government and society (Being). Indications are that the firm is successful in dealing with its environment on a piecemeal and short-run basis. Implications for the long run are less clear.

Abstract: This exploratory study investigated the impact of managerial influence by joint formal managers in a complex configuration. The vertical influence attempts by the two managers in the configuration interacted when predicting unit performance and suggested that only one of the two should attempt to play an active role in influencing subordinates. There was also an interaction between the lateral relations of the managers which again suggested that only one should stress exchanges with other units. Propositions for future research are provided.

Title: Group Cohesiveness as a Determinant of Egocentric Perceptions in Cooperative Groups
Author-Name: Barry R. Schlenker
Author-Name: Rowland S. Miller
Abstract: It has been consistently found that members of cooperative groups claim greater personal responsibility for their group's performance after a group success rather than failure. However, when high group cohesiveness is present, norms and interpersonal bonds may exist that mitigate against taking high personal credit for success and low blame for failure. Hence, it was hypothesized that in high cohesive groups, there would be little or no relationship between the assignment of personal responsibility and the quality of the group product, while in low cohesive groups, responsibility would be directly related to the quality of the group product. To test this hypothesis, 96 subjects interacted in four-person, problem-solving groups. Supposedly on the basis of prior individual test scores, subjects were informed that they were either highly compatible (high cohesiveness) or incompatible (low cohesiveness) with the other group members. After the group tasks, subjects were told that their group had been either ve...

Title: Personal Scenarios: An Empirical Study of Their Relation to Individual                 Performance and to Organizational Activism
Author-Name: Roger D. Evered
Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between an individual's scenario about his own future and his characterizing behaviors within the institutional setting. Statements made by 87 persons about their own futures (5 years ahead) are examined, coded (in terms of the person's ease of projecting himself into the future situation), and related with measures of the person's overall performance and activism within the organizational system. The relationships (and nonrelationships) found indicate that there are behaviorally important differences in individual styles of cognizing one's own future. Two different orientations toward futurity seem to be evidenced from these results and those previously reported by the author in Human Relations. The first is a facility to project oneself ahead and to picture one's own future, which is associated with active participation in the ongoing organizationalprocesses. The second is a motivation to generate multiple images of alternatives to the prevailing system, which is ass...

Title: Workers' Participation: A Critical Evaluation of Coch and French
Author-Name: Godfrey Gardner
Abstract: The famous Coch and French (1948) experiment was a pioneer effort that helped to stimulate research into the organizational effects of employee participation in management. In this respect it has done valuable service. However, the continued flow of uncritical references and citations calls for a frank appraisal of the experimental design and the generally accepted conclusions. This paper reveals about twenty faults in the study and suggests that it is time that references become more cautious.

Title: Black-White Differences in Job Satisfaction, Group Cohesiveness, and                 Leadership Style
Author-Name: Jugoslav S. Milutinovich
Abstract: Data from three organizations (n = 460) were used to compare the job satisfaction, group cohesiveness, and perception of leadership style of black and white, blue-collar and white-collar, male andfemale workers in a stratified matched sample. The results of this study suggest some differences in work attitudes between black and white workers. The most dissatisfied group of workers were the black white-collar females when compared with their white counterparts. However, for some occupational classes differences in work attitudes seem minimal.

Title: Toward an "Intent" Model of Conflict Management Among Principal Parties
Author-Name: Kenneth W. Thomas
Author-Name: Louis R. Pondy
Abstract: The paper notes the relative neglect, within the conflict literature, of conflict management activities by the principal parties themselves. In part, this is asserted to reflect the legacy of behaviorism and experimental gaming. The authors lay a groundwork for a theory of conflict management activities among principal parties by examining the role of attributed intent within conflict episodes. A literature review indicates that attribution of other party's intent is a central activity in conflict episodes, and that these attributions play a crucial mediating role in shaping each party's reactions to the other's behavior-specifically mediating hostility and retaliation. The authors also present attributional data from executives which indicate that there are strong biases in the perception of intent-namely that individuals tend to see themselves as cooperative and reasonable, but attribute competitiveness and unreasonableness to the other party. Given their importance and ambiguity, attributions of intent...

Title: Adverse and Growthful Effects of Experiential Learning Groups: The Role of                 the Trainer, Participant, and Group Characteristics
Author-Name: Cary L. Cooper
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics of experiential learning groups associated with adverse and growthful effects. Data were collected on trainer behavior/personality, participant personality/conditions of participation, and group process characteristics, and these were linked to two generic outcome measures (i.e., other trainee perceptions and work colleague reports). It wasfound that both positive and negative effects of such groups are (a) strongly related to the trainer's behavior and personality, (b) unrelated to group process and structured variables (e.g., degree of confrontation, level of intimacy in the group, etc.), and (c) associated with trainees' personality predispositions in the short run but not in the long term. The implications of these findings are fully discussed.

Title: The Relationship Between Organization Technology and the Direction and                 Frequency Dimensions of Task Communications

Author-Name: Frederic E. Finch
Abstract: Studies which attempt to link organization technology and task communication patterns in the organization are few, and most of these deal only with the directionality (i.e., vertical vs. horizontal) dimension. This field study focused not only on the direction of task communications but also on the frequency of task communications. Structured observations, a survey questionnaire, and interview data-gathering methods were used in three departments of one organization, each employing a different technology. Results indicate that for task communications an inverse relationship exists between technological certainty and the proportion of organization member communications which are vertical; a direct relationship exists between technological certainty and the proportion of organization member horizontal communications; and no relationship exists between technological certainty and the proportion of organization member diagonal communications. Also, the data support an inverse relationship between technologica...

Author-Name: Bureon Ledbetter, Jr.
Abstract: Evidence is presented that the textile industry is beginning to recognize the severity of the employee turnover problem. Work redesign has been a proposed solution in other industries whereby the intent was to provide employees with work that satisfied their psychological and social needs. However, research has not shown work redesign to produce consistently positive results. Investigators have concluded that individual reactions to job characteristics may be moderated by such variables as their background (urban vs. rural), the existence of a Protestant Work Ethic (strong vs. weak) and the individual's need strength (high vs. low). If the textile industry does undertake work redesign as a solution to the turnover problem, it would be of extreme importance to know what moderates individual reactions to job characteristics. The results of this research indicate that individual need strength is a better moderator than Protestant Work Ethic for employees in a Southeastern textile mill. The authors present al...

Author-Name: James T. Tedeschi
Abstract: In a previous study Holmes had subjects wait for 5 or 30 minutes for a partner and then provided them with an opportunity to deliver shocks to the late partner or someone who was conscripted to replace him. He found that more shocks were delivered the longer subjects waited, irrespective of the partner's responsibility for the delay. The present study replicated these results, but showed that delay did not have an effect on harm-doing when the subjects and partner had an equal temporal input into the experimental situation. An equity interpretation was offered for these findings.

Title: Organizational Consultants: A Comparison of Styles
Author-Name: S. R. Ganesh
Abstract: An underdeveloped aspect of Organizational Development literature is the need for understanding individual organizational consultants and their styles, which influence their interventions. It is through understanding styles that one can begin to appreciate and understand the process of application of behavioral science knowledge to the development of organizations. In this paper an attempt is made to provide insights into consulting styles through a summary of results of research on 21 leading organizational consultants, 11 in the U.S.A. and 10 in India. Three "approach-related" and three "person-related" elements of styles are elaborated upon, using data from in-depth "client-centered" interviews with the consultants. Two distinct styles of organizational consulting emerge from the data and their relation to values, approaches, and consulting experience are discussed, as are their interrelations.

Title: The Effects of Employee Ownership on Organizational Identification, Employee                 Job Attitudes, and Organizational Performance: A Tentative Framework and Empirical Findings
Author-Name: Richard J. Long
Abstract: Noting a paucity of research on the subject, this article attempts to explore the effects of employee ownership, concentrating on possible relationships between ownership and such variables as organizational identification, employee job attitudes, and organizational performance, and on identifying variables which may moderate these relationships. After development of a conceptual framework, empirical data obtained from study of a trucking company recently purchased by most of its employees are presented and discussed. These data support the plausibility of many of the hypothesized relationships, but do not permit strong causal inferences. Although the author tentatively concludes that employee ownership appears to have improved employee attitudes and organizational performance in this case, he stresses that much further research, in a variety of settings, specifically designed to permit causal testing of the propositions suggested here, is badly needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.

Title: Managerial Succession in a Factory and Changes in Supervisory Leadership                 Patterns: A Field Study
Author-Name: James L. Koch
Abstract: Managerial succession is a common phenomenon in organizations, and this event is often associated with significant changes in leadership style. Yet the influence of succession on behavior in organizations has received very limited study. The present study combined two kinds of data, clinical onsite observations and longitudinal survey data, to examine the changes in supervisory leadership patterns, group processes, and satisfaction levels associated with a change from supportive-oriented management to taskoriented management. Taken together, these data provide a replication of Gouldner's classic case study of social processes arising out of an unexpected change in the management of an industrial plant. They also lend support to the intermethod reliability of survey research data and clinical observations in assessing the phenomena under consideration.

Title: Dimensions of Management System and Performance in Continuous-Process Organizations
Author-Name: Robert T. Keller
Abstract: The relationships among management system dimensions and performance were studied in 44 continuous-process organizations located in Pennsylvania. Organic management systems, as opposed to mechanistic systems, were found to be related to both higher profitability and subjective organizational performance ratings. Specifically, a de-emphasis of both an impersonal hierarchy and the use of rules for decision-making were significantly related to higher performance for this sample. Based on prior research, the sample was then split into highand low-performance subsamples and examined with cluster analysis. Much more clearly defined clusters among the management system variables were found for the low-performance than for the high-performance subsamples. Implications for organizational theory and management and for future research are discussed.

Title: A Case Study of Role Conflict: Roman Catholic Priests
Author-Name: Mary Ellen Reilly
Abstract: The concept of role conflict is explored with data gathered from a population of Catholic priests in the diocese of Springfield, Massachusetts. Seventeen potential sources of role conflict were investigated and levels of agreement on eight current issues within the Church were assessed. In each area it was found that younger priests were experiencing more severe role conflict. Likewise, the youngest men indicated that they perceived noticeable differences in expectations concerning their role performance from numerous others whom they served. Some role conflict appeared to be resolved by attaching greater significance to younger reference and significant others. The existence of role conflict among Catholic priests, especially the younger men, seems to be confirmed.

Title: Examination of Alternative Models of Job Satisfaction
Author-Name: Ramon J. Aldag
Author-Name: Arthur P. Brief
Abstract: Researchers examining efficacy of alternative measures of job facet satisfaction have generally assumed overall job satisfaction to be an additive function of weighted facet scores. This paper considers the linear compensatory model implied by such an assumption as well as two nonlinear alternatives. It is found that conjunctive and disjunctive models predict overall job satisfaction about as well as does the linear compensatory model. Further, simulated general satisfaction scores are used to examine the extent to which aggregation of data across individuals using differing combinatory models may lead to systematic bias in favor of a particular model. The results suggest that while use of the linear compensatory model may be justifiable on the basis of mathematical simplicity, conclusions drawn by researchers using that model should be tempered by the recognition that alternative models with sharply differing theoretical bases and practical implications may have equivalent descriptive ability.

Abstract: Ethnic attitudes and preferences of Jewish youth in Israel from Middle Eastern and Western ethnic background were investigated in this study. A multiscale questionnaire was administered to 1033 ninth-grade students in 30 classrooms from ethnically integrated schools in different parts of the country. Results indicated that the two groups perceived themselves as being markedly different from each other. However, (1) ethnic attitudes in this sample were asymmetrical, since both Middle Eastern and Western sub-jects expressed more positive evaluation of and preference for persons of Western than of Middle Eastern background; (2) ethnic attitudes varied with academic status in each ethnic group; and (3) Middle Eastern subjects displayed a more differentiated person perception than did subjects of Western background. Implications of thesefindings were considered from a variety of theoretical perspectives as well as in terms of their generality in light of current research in Israel and the United States.

Abstract: The common problem in the life of working small groups of division into opposed camps that are unable to cooperate [schism] is considered here in theory and in practice. The first aim of the paper is to integrate previous theoretical contributions into a single coherent model, which will provide intelligibility and lines of intervention to the group leader or consultant. The second aim is to show this conceptualization in practice, in work with a seminar in a Group Relations Conference and in work with a small group of medical students studying "The Doctor-Patient Relationship. " What is em-phasized is the ease with which subgrouping is made more defensive and in-transigent by the leader's articulation of it and the necessity for getting back to the task in common and the resistance to this task.

Author-Name: James P. Gustafson
Author-Name: Lowell Cooper
Abstract: The authors consider the necessary conditions for group members and their consultants to study group processes together. They consider how the collaborative working relationship is achieved in other social fields, in the psychoanalytic "therapeutic alliance, " in the seminars of Balint (1954) for general practitioners and in the educational-political work of Freire (1970). They discuss the phenomena of noncollaborative small study groups (Bion, 1961) and how these might be understood in depth-psychological and social-political terms: as the consequence of errors of abandonment and intrusion, and as continuations of average social oppression. They illustrate both the success and failure of neophyte consultants in securing collaboration in these terms, and, finally, summarize what they consider to be essential: How consultants pass tests of the meaning and strength of their collabora-tive intentions.

Title: The Intentional Distortion of Information in Organizational Communication: A                 Laboratory and Field Investigation
Author-Name: Charles A. O'Reilly, III
Abstract: This report summarizes the results of several laboratory andfield studies in-vestigating antecedents to and consequences of the intentional distortion of information by senders in organizational communication networks. Lab-oratory studies were used to examine the impact of two interpersonal vari-ables (trust in the receiver, perceived influence of the receiver over the sender) and directionality of information flow (upward, lateral, and down-ward) on senders' propensities to block or suppress information. Field studies were used to establish the external validity of the laboratory investi-gations and to relate information distortion by senders to job satisfaction and performance. Results of these studies demonstrate that (1) a bias exists towards screening certain types of information from upward transmission; (2) low trust in the receiver of a message results in significantly more sup-pression by senders of information, especially information which reflects unfavorably on the senders; and (3) a measure o...

Author-Name: Michael Gurevitch
Author-Name: Alex Weingrod
Abstract: Based upon data collected by means of a mailed questionnaire, this article examines the widely held assumption that "everyone knows everyone else" within the compact Israeli national elite. Data were collected on acquaintanceships among political, bureaucratic, economic, professional, academic, and cultural-artistic elites. The elites tend to be drawn from among the European-origin well educated minorities, although such features as kinship, schooling, and army service are unimportant for making initial contacts. The analysis shows that elite members do not all know one another, although groups such as politicians and media specialists are acquainted with a strikingly high proportion of elite members. Moreover, there appears to be a central core group within the elite composed of politicians, bureaucrats, and economic specialists who are strongly acquainted with one another. Finally, the findings indicate the demise of the elite "generalist, " and their replacement by functional, well trained specialists.

Title: Methodological Problems Confronting Cross-Cultural Criminological Research                 Using Official Data
Author-Name: Gideon Vigderhous
Abstract: The major aim of this paper is to present and discuss some of the methodological problems involved in utilizing cross-cultural criminal statistics and to examine the reliability of international homicide rates. The major problem criminologists face in comparative research is the problem of comparability. This problem could be examined in light of the discrepancy which might exist between the operational and nominal definitions of various types of crime. The major sources of international crime statistics are Interpol (International Criminal Police Organization) and WHO (World Health Organization). Analysis of the comparability of these sources with regard to homicide revealed zero-order correlation of r = .95 for 33 countries. A longitudinal analysis correlating homicide data from the two sources revealed mixed results. The correlation between the two sources varied for different countries between .04 and .90. Analysis of homicide rates extractedfrom WHO revealed a high level of stability and reliability....

Title: Who Does What: Role Stereotypy, Children's Work, and Continuity Between                 Generations in the Household Division of Labor
Author-Name: Charles A. Thrall
Abstract: Inclusion of children in the present interview study of 99 families required adaptation of the Blood and Wolfe measures of division of labor. The revised measure of stereotypy reveals a more complex picture than reported previously. There are distinct differences unrelated to objective conditions between families in their attitudes toward children's chores. It is suggested that the best single predictor of a family's division of labor may be the previous generation, but there is also less variation between families now than in the past. Most families continue to be quite traditional in their pattern, with strong emphasis on division of labor by sex for both parents and children.

Author-Name: Richard L. Miler
Abstract: The present paper reports the results of two experiments which examined how subjects choose partners for work interactions. In both experiments subjects were given feedback ("very good, " "good, " "average," "poor") about their previous level of performance and about the performance of others who could be chosen as partners for an evaluated or nonevaluated work interaction. The results of Experiment 1 indicated that there was an overall tendency for subjects to choose "very good" or "good" partners scoring in the upper quartiles. Further, "very good" and "good" subjects tended to select similar ability partners whether the interaction was expected to be evaluated or not. "Average"subjects tended to pick "good" partners for the evaluated interaction and "very good" partners for the nonevaluated interaction. "Poor" subjects showed the opposite trend. In Experiment 2 subjects received performance feedback and indicated their partner choicesfor evaluated or nonevaluated interactions consisting of either two o...

Title: The Development of the Small Group
Author-Name: Philip Wells Shambaugh
Abstract: The literature of small group development is vast but, despite two recent reviews, theoretically inconclusive. This article summarizes a selection of prominent theories representative of the field, clustering them around three related models, a recurring phase model, a sequential phase model, and a changing leadership model. A conceptual synthesis is then presented using two related dimensions, the fluctuating psychological closeness of the members as they approach individuation and the stepwise generation of the group's culture. It is suggested that groups evolve through a series of stable structures separated by phases of hostility and narcissism as the leader, or later the culture, fails to satisfy the needs of the group.

Title: Representing Interpersonal Relations in Families: Mutual Evaluations
Author-Name: Tamara Kotler
Author-Name: Peter W. Salmon
Abstract: Four members were selected from each family in a sample of 35 families attending a child psychiatric clinic in Melbourne.2 A set of 13 bipolar personal constructs formed the basis for self and other ratings by the patient child, a sibling close in age, and both parents. A comparison between two methods of analysis-ANOVA and INGRID -sho wed the latter to be more useful in allowing the simultaneous display of judges, targets, and attributes in one geometric space. Two components were obtained by applying INGRID to a deviation matrix generated by SERIES and these were defined in terms of expressive and control behaviors. In relation to these components family members were split in two ways-first with the patients and then with the fathers located in negatively valued positions. These data were seen to accord with clinical observations that marital tension and scapegoating both occur in families with disturbed individuals.

Title: Organizational Psychology: Good Intentions and False Promises
Author-Name: Frank Blackler
Author-Name: Colin A. Brown
Abstract: Theory and practice within organizational psychology have been greatly influenced by humanistic psychology in general and theories of self-actualization in particular. Yet the concept of self-actualization is problematic, and may encourage a misguided view of people as exploiting each other and their environments in a hedonistic quest for satisfaction. Applied in an organizational context such an interpretation of the human condition would demean human interactions. Further, organizational psychologists have employed the humanistic paradigm in a search for effective ways of managing organizations while giving insufficient attention to a study of the wider effects that organizations have upon people in society. Coupled with an inadequate model of man such limited horizons may have led them to play an essentially conservative role in their work and to support institutional structures which could be seriously debilitating psychologically. A review of implicit assumptions within the discipline is required.

Title: A Constructive Method of Developing Complex Applied Models
Author-Name: A. M. Levi
Author-Name: A. Benjamin
Abstract: This article describes a research method for developing complex applied models which does not sacrifice the high degree of flexibility that such development requires. The method involves a detailed and concrete description of one's intervention model, followed by a carefully documented and measured application. The model is then evaluated and modified in the light of the data, and reapplied. This cycle is repeated many times. The requirements and problems of this method are discussed, particularly in relation to Campbell and Stanley's factors of external and internal validity.

Title: Maintaining Relationships Openly: Case Study of "Total Openness" in a                 Communal Organization
Author-Name: Robert E. Kaplan
Abstract: The subject of this paper is the open handling of face-to-face human relationships. The term used here is "maintenance-by-expression," meaning that relationships are discussed explicitly among the parties concerned. Despite the popularity of openness (or, stated otherwise, the analysis of group process) for therapeutic and training purposes and despite the interest in applying this approach to organizations, it has not been successfully introduced into entire organizations. The commune studied here is a notable exception. The case study provides an opportunity to consider the organizational conditions evidently necessary for the adoption and perpetuation of expressive maintenance. The paper qlso examines the particular form of expressive maintenance employed at the commune in an attempt to expand understanding of this unconventional social practice.

Title: Towards a Theory of Changing: A Means-Ends Model of the Organizational                 Improvement Process
Author-Name: Robert E. Quinn
Abstract: This study is based on a nationwide sample of top administrators in state government organizations. Using a critical incident approach, each administrator was asked to select the one change that he or she considered to be his or her most outstanding management improvement action. In describing the change the respondents were asked about their change strategies and resulting outcomes. Using a factor analysis and answers to open-ended questions, eight types of administrative change strategies (Work MethodsTechnology, Information Dissemination, Structural Reorganization, Retraining-Replacement, Authority System, Objective Setting-Measurement, Work Flow, Programs) and six types of outcomes (Improved Output Process, Motivational Climate, Resource Acquisition, Coordination, Savings, Equilibrium) were identified. Using a repeated multiple regression analysis, the relationships between the means and ends were explored. The findings illustrate the necessity for a precise definition of effectiveness and the need fo...

Title: Stages of Organization and Development
Author-Name: Dina Lavoie
Author-Name: Samuel A. Culbert
Abstract: This paper describes our belief that organization development (OD), to be effective, should link with the progressively mature reasoning processes which characterize managers working within increasingly higher stages in the evolution of an organization. The paper uses the models of Torbert (1973) and Kohlberg (1969) to examine the scope of influence of popular OD approaches and concludes that OD theories have probably appealed principally to individuals and organizations functioning at relatively high levels of development. It also points up the need for theories which guide developmental energies at lower levels of orientation and which provide additional understanding of the transitional events individuals and organizations have to experience in order to pass from one stage of development to the next.

Title: Successful Projects in New Careers Programs: An Empirical Study
Author-Name: Sam Alley
Author-Name: Judith Blanton
Abstract: This paper describes variables related to the successful achievement of goals in eleven New Careers projects. These programs were funded by the National Institute of Mental Health as an effort to improve mental health delivery services through more effective training and career development of nonprofessional staff. Correlations, path analysis and case study data were used to develop models of successful program functioning. Both the techniques of study and the findings might be applicable to other human service programs. Among factors which appear to affect success were (a) the use of a system of program planning and self-assessment; (b) the ability of the staff to influence relevant outside agencies and groups informally; and (c) the employment of staff or consultants who have capacity in all critical areas. One hazard was overallocation of resources to the most salient goals and the neglect of less immediately pressing but important goals.

Title: Accepting Help from Teachers-When the Teachers are Children
Author-Name: Bella M. DePaulo
Abstract: Two studies examined adults' willingness to accept help from children. In Study I adults were less willing to accept free art lessons from competent children than from competent adults. Help-acceptance from children was not increased by suggesting to subjects that by accepting the lessons they would help the children to become better teachers of art. Study 2 replicated the latter finding, and also examined certain personality correlates of helpaccepting, including self-esteem, need for approval, and sex-typing. Women were more likely to accept help than men, and subjects scoring high on the femininity scale of Spence's Personal Attributes Questionnaire accepted help more than subjects scoring low on that scale. Self-esteem and need for approval were useful moderator variables. Often, different relationships between help-accepting and other variables were obtained for subjects scoring high on self-esteem or need for approval than for subjects scoring low on those variables. Social implications of adults' r...

Title: Intergroup Conflict: A Rethink
Author-Name: Peter Goodge
Abstract: It is argued that the "classical" formulations of intergroup conflict have conceptual inadequacies and that they make assumptions which are disconfirmed by the research literature and by common experience. An alternative approach to intergroup conflict based on an analysis of the information needs of groups in conflict is proposed and supported by questionnaire results. Conflict resolution, socialprejudice, and the future development of intergroup theory are discussed in the light of the new perspective.

Title: Cultural Variation in Amari, Papua New Guinea

Author-Name: Brian W. Carss
Abstract: An area of continuing debate in anthropology is that of the conceptual distinction between culture and observable behavior. This paper accepts the distinction between culture as an ideational system and behavior and an attempt is made to show how the ideational system may be elaborated. Using a data collection technique developed by Dawson and his colleagues, the culture of a rural population in Papua New Guinea is analyzedfor differences between and within village samples. Hierarchies of cultural elements, arrived at by Warfield's structural modeling procedures, indicate how cultural systems change unevenly and at different rates.

Title: Relations of Discretionary and Nondiscretionary Leadership to Performance and                 Satisfaction in a Complex Organization
Author-Name: J. G. Hunt
Author-Name: R. N. Osborn
Author-Name: R. S. Schuler
Abstract: Leadership was conceptualized as consisting of a discretionary and nondiscretionary component. Discretionary leadership was that under control of the leader. Nondiscretionary leadership was that invoked by the organizational setting in which the leader operated. The setting was conceptualized in terms of twelve dimensions of the Organizational Practices Questionnaire. Leadership consisted of two reward and two sanctions dimensions. Interactive and noninteractive relationships of these leadership components with performance and satisfaction were investigated. With one exception, all relationships with the criteria were noninteractive. Results were discussed in terms of theoretical significance and their implications for management training and organizational design approaches. Suggestions for further research were included.

Title: Multivariate Analyses of Factors Affecting Work Role Centrality of                 Occupational Categories
Author-Name: Bilha Mannheim
Author-Name: Ayala Cohen
Abstract: This paper presents a theory concerning work-role centrality and its relationship with a number of variables related to the individual's background, orientation, role strains, job rewards, and career characteristics. It is examined empiricallyfor seven occupational categories in Israel. Occupations are found to vary in their work-role centrality and in the variables hypothesized to relate to it, and the general validity of our model is supported by the results. Stepwise multiple regressions of the independent variables upon work-role centrality explained between 30 and 70% of the variance within the occupational categories. Job reward variables, especially intrinsic rewards, have strongest explanatory weight, but in each occupational category a somewhat different configuration of independent variables emerges.

Title: Interpersonal and Interparty Exchange: An Experimental Study of the Effect of                 Seating Position on the Outcome of Negotiations Between Teams Representing Parties                 in Dispute
Author-Name: Geoffrey M. Stephenson
Author-Name: Bromley K. Kniveton
Abstract: The experiment reported here examines the effect of opposite and mixed seating positions on the performance of negotiating teams in a role-playing debate where one team is given a markedly stronger case than the other. In line with Morley and Stephenson's previous findings, it was proposed that the greater visual accessibility of the other in the opposite condition would increase the salience of interpersonal as against interparty exchange. It was predicted and found that this could cause the side with the stronger case to be more successful in the mixed than in the opposite condition. In addition there was some evidence that the interaction between seating position and strength of case was particularly marked when participants were instructed to concentrate first on those issues which divided them. The results are discussed with reference to the importance of the balance between interpersonal and interparty factors in bargaining relationships.

Title: The Psychological Climate and Reported Well-Being of Underground Miners: An                 Exploratory Study
Author-Name: James F. Gavin
Author-Name: Robert E. Kelley
Abstract: This study explored the dimensions of underground miners' work-environment perceptions, how these dimensions related to measures of well-being, and to what extent such factors as age, seniority, and work assignment accountedfor perceptions of the environment and one's well-being. Four hundred sixty-nine nonmanagement employees participated in this investigation. Results indicated that the dimensions of work-environment perceptions were, to a large extent, similar to dimensions found in other occupational groups. Further, perceptions of the interpersonal behaviors of supervisors and of promotion practices in the mine seemed to have greatest significance for the miners' reports of well-being. Analyses of the effects of age, seniority, and work assignment yielded few statistically meaningful associations with selfand environmental perceptions, thereby suggesting that other variables may be more salient determinants of miners' attitudes. It was also noted that perceptions of the environment as well as indices...

Abstract: An attempt was made to assess the role of medium of communication on leadership differentiation in discussion groups. Groups of undergraduates met on five different occasions to solve human relations problems, either in face-to-face discussion situations or over video conferencing networks. In face-to-face conditions development of leadership took almost a classic form, with sociometric measures systematically related to behavioral indexes; in the video (teleconference) conditions, role differentiation tendencies were sharply curtailed, and the relationship of sociometric indexes with indexes of verbal output were greatly diminished. Speculations about how mediated communication may affect differentiation processes are offered.

Title: Personnel Practices and Employee Attitudes: A Study of Japaneseand                 American-Managed Firms in the United States
Author-Name: Richard Tanner Pascale
Abstract: There has been considerable speculation as to the applicability of Japanese employment practices in industrial settings outside of Japan. This paper reports on a 3 year study of Japanese managed companies in the United States and investigates (1) the extent to which the employment practices of these firms differ from those of matched American firms and (2) whether these differences, if any, contribute to different employee attitudes and behavior as measured by job satisfaction and worker attendance patterns. The findings suggest that Japanese firms in the United States expend more resources per employee on nonpayroll benefits and that employees of Japanese firms in the United States perceive themselves as more satisfied and productive. These perceptions are not supported by worker attendance patterns which found no significant differences between workers at Japanese and American companies.

Title: Generalized Self-Management: The Position of Henri Lefebvre
Author-Name: Ed Rose
Abstract: The intention of this paper is to introduce and analyze the concept of generalized self-management with particular reference to the work of Henri Lefebvre, and to offer a definition of self-management which is contrasted with existing usages of the concept in the social and behavioral sciences. It is argued that current practices and concepts of self-management, while useful within the specific contexts in which they operate, such as industrial organizations, are limited in theoretical scope and practical applicability. What is needed is a less partial view of self-management which is generalizable to the entire social structure, and which involves a recognition of the constraints upon the exercise of self-management which operate in the wider contexts of everyday life. Finally, it is suggested that generalized selfmanagement, asLefebvre views it, would involve the transformation of the entire life of a complex society, its organizations, institutions, cultures, and classes.

Title: A Systems-Resource Approach for Evaluating Organizational Effectiveness
Author-Name: J. Barton Cunningham
Abstract: Systems theorists maintain that all organizations, in order to survive, must be able to fulfill certain basic needs. In this article, these needs relate to: (1) the organization's ability to search out and respond to the properties of the external environment; (2) the organization's ability to use its resources to produce outputs and to maintain and restore the system; and (3) the organization's ability to bargain and optimize its use of resources in an environment with a number of decision-makers, each with different objectives. These criteria are used to evaluate the effectiveness of seven local government organizations.

Title: Operational Research and Organization Development
Author-Name: Colin Eden
Abstract: A large research program concerned with the contribution of operational research (OR) to the design of organizations led indirectly to an OR project concerned with constructing a man-computer interactive simulation model for a department in local government. The simulation model was to map the decision-making activities of the department and their influence on critical features of the environment which were of interest. The most difficult part of this project was the application of new methodologies for eliciting the values, norms, objectives, goals, and views of the environment in order that the model of decision-making could be constructed. The key concepts underlying the method were drawn from the psychology of personal constructs and the sociology of defining situations. The data analysis resulting from an application of these concepts led to the organization wishing to become involved in an organization development (OD) exercise. How this request evolved, the conceptual basis of the OR, and some of t...

Title: The Capacity of Families to Cope with Transitions: A Theoretical Essay
Author-Name: Alastair Bain
Abstract: This paper develops a theory of "family capacity" which integrates at the level of the family knowledge concerning the effects of change on individuals generated by psychosocial transitions, with hypotheses as to how these changes are likely to be differently experienced depending on the nature of the social relationships within which the transition takes place. "Family capacity" will vary at times of transition as a function of the relationship between (1) the magnitude of role changes experienced by family members over a period of time, generated by changes in the primary task of the family system, or in its role configuration, and changes in roles in other social systems; and (2) the nature of the "social container" within which the transition is experienced, which is determined by the primary tasks of the institutions at the boundary of the transition, and the relationships that are formed with the family, and the size of the family's social network and its relevance to the transition.

Author-Name: M. M. Bakr
Abstract: This paper examines reactions to actual redesign of a clerical, information-processing task. The moderating effects of individual work values are noted along with "novelty effects. " Workers with intrinsic work orientations held more favorable attitudes toward task redesign, although favorableness was negatively related to actual experience with the new task. Workers with extrinsic work orientations had less favorable attitudes toward change, but these attitudes were positively correlated with experience. These results suggest that response to task redesign is contingent upon individual differences.

Title: The Influence of Job Longevity on Employee Reactions to Task Characteristics
Author-Name: Ralph Katz
Abstract: The present study investigated the moderating influence of job longevity and growth-need strength on the relationships between overall job satisfaction and the five task dimensions of skill variety, identity, significance, autonomy, and feedback. Basically, it was found that the strength of the task dimension-job satisfaction relationships are significantly affected by job longevity regardless of age and growth-need strength. More specifically, three separate stages of job longevity are deduced, i.e., a learning, a responsive, and an unresponsive stage. Only during the responsive stage were the satisfaction reactions of employees significantly correlated with all of the task characteristics. Furthermore, satisfaction was related most significantly to the outcomes of performance and turnover during the responsive stage. Individual differences, as measured by growth-need strength, were also investigated within the job longevity framework. Survey data from 3,085 public sector employees belonging to four diff...

Abstract: The present study investigates the utility of employing an interdisciplinary set of variables to predict labor force decisions. Comparisons of demographic, economic, high school experience, and psychological-motivational variables indicated that the best prediction of the post-high school plans of 1,074 high school seniors resulted from high school experience variables. However, a combination of the four sets of variables resulted in substantial improvement over any single set of predictors. It is suggested that laborforce behavior can be better understood and predicted if a multidisciplinary approach is utilized.

Abstract: Experimentally composed 5-member groups completed an initial problemsolving exercise. In the status-threat condition, members then received negative evaluative feedback regarding their group performance. In the control condition, members received relatively favorable feedback. Groups then discussed and reached consensual judgments on a set of Dogmatism Scale items. As hypothesized, the groups subjected to status threat adopted significantly more dogmatic beliefs than groups in the control condition. In addition, it was found that group dogmatism scores were consistently lower than the average individual pretreatment dogmatism scores within the group, suggesting that the groups tended to be more flexible than their component members.

Title: The Relative Effects of Share Ownership vs. Control on Job Attitudes in an                 Employee-Owned Company
Author-Name: Richard J. Long
Abstract: Studies on the effects of employee share ownership or employee participation in decisions (or control) have tended to focus on one or the other of the two variables or have assumed that they covary. Using data from an employee-owned company, this study attempts to empirically separate and assess the relative effects of each of these on a set of dependent variables (job attitudes) which they are both thought to affect. Results indicated that employee share ownership and participation each had significant and independent effects on some job attitudes. However, little evidence of interaction effects between the two variables, which had been predicted, was found. Implications and limitations of the findings are discussed, and possible directions for future research are suggested.

Title: Minimal Social Categorization, Political Categorization, and Power Change
Author-Name: Sik Hung Ng
Abstract: A theory has been proposed by Mulder that the tendency to take over superordinate power varies inversely with the power distance between ego and the target. As compared to the person who occupies the middle rank, an individual who is on the bottom rank has been shown to be less inclined to take over the top position. What will happen, however, if the latter individual had to act in terms of group instead of self? Will the induction of social categorization activate him to take over superordinate power? Three experimental conditions were set up by means of Mulder's cognitive representational method, using secondary school boys as subjects (N = 54). It was found that minimal social categorization did not enhance the tendency of the bottom member to take overpower. Enhancement effect was observed only in the condition of political categorization where the bottom member belonged to a majority group which had ingroup affinity to the source of power (p < .05). No such effect was found in the political categoriz...

Abstract: The application of the signal detection model to person recognition is discussed, emphasizing the significance of the decision criteria parameters. A recognition experiment is reported which suggests that the discriminability ofpersons is within the range in which shifts in decision criteria are of considerable importance. The results also show that there is much greater intersubject variability in decision criterion placement than in the discriminability of this material. The remainder of the article discusses the role of the two components of decision criteria of person recognition, namely, subjective probability and the payoff matrix.

Title: Objectifiability and Calling Rights Into Play: An Empirical Study
Author-Name: John P. Sabini
Author-Name: Maury Silver
Abstract: This paper is an investigation of the relation between the difficulty actors have in demonstrating the "objectivity" of the wrongness of a putative offense and the inhibition that actors experience in attempting to make a moral reproach; that is, according to the theory tested, an individual needs to be able to make patent to himself and others that a concrete action of another is the sort of thing that "everyone would see as wrong" as a prerequisite to reproaching another. The notion of "objectivity" is a central element in a theory in which making a moral reproach is related to moral drift-the erosion of group norms. This theory, more fully reported elsewhere, is briefly sketched out. A laboratory experiment was carried out in which the "objectivity" of an offense was varied, and the rate of subjects' intervention against the offender was counted. The results support the analysis. Further analysis of the interventions as to whether they were or were not "moral reproaches" indicated that whether asubject...

Abstract: Several current theories predict the psychological effect of a discrepancy between the reward persons receive from their job and the reward they would like to receive. Data from 1, 750 persons in 52 industrialplants of five countries are analyzed to explore some conflicting implications of these theories. For example, researchers dispute the assertion that obtaining more than one wants can be as dissatisfying as obtaining less than one wants. The analyses reported here suggest aformula that helps to explain the conditions under which overcompensation may or may not be dissatisfying.

Title: Analyzing Social Systems:
Author-Name: Albert B. Cherns
Author-Name: Gerald J. Wacker
Abstract: An analysis of a social system requires, in addition to data-collection instruments, an organizing paradigm by which the data can be made to depict the system as a unified, functioning entity. The Parsonian model of social systems is applied to organizations. Four basic social subsystemsgoal attainment, adaptation, latency, and integration-are discussed along with data-collection techniques. Some data can be obtained with formal instruments, others only with more casual techniques. The technology employed by an organization affects all four subsystems; it should not be looked upon as a monolithic subsystem by itself. There is a particular sequence of interaction among the four subsystems, beginning with goal attainment and ending with integration. This has implications for organizational diagnosis, design, and development.

Title: Toward the Study of Society in Microcosm: Critical Problems of Group                 Relations Conferences
Author-Name: James P. Gustafson
Author-Name: Lowell Cooper
Abstract: In the first half of this article, the authors consider the basic structure, culture, and technique developed for the Group Relations Conference, which aims to be an open institution for studying in microcosm the working problems of society. They argue that the traditional culture and technique are nondevelopmental, hence can do very little about societal dynamics simply being replayed in conferences, which in turn lowers the morale of these events seriously. They believed that the inherent development thrust of conference members could be as powerful as the regressive instincts and class interests that ordinarily overrun conferences, if the interferences with group development were carefully attended to by consultants. Two experimental conferences have confirmed the hypothesis and, furthermore, shown the phases of the critical second-stage development, in which group members make prominent and master the inherent aggression in groups about differences.

Title: Problem-Solving Performance Inside a Publicly-Owned Corporation
Author-Name: D. J. Chambers
Author-Name: M. A. Lehmann
Abstract: This study was aimed at evaluating aspects of a publicly owned corporation 'sperformance in terms of process rather than in terms of financial outcomes. An episode was chosen where performance in dealing with relatively well-defined problems might be appraised through specifying the task environment and identifying the problem representation and search processes employed. The use made of formal systems modeling and analysis in the study is to specify a task environment against which performance can be appraised. Criteria are introduced for identifying better or worse search processes, varying degrees of problem difficulty, and more or less comprehensive representations of task environment. The evidence is used to support evaluative statements on managers' problem-solving performance. Further work which would strengthen such evaluation is indicated together with lines for future comparative research.

Title: Contingency Theory, Values, and Change
Author-Name: J. A. Millar
Abstract: This paper represents a critique of the increasingly fashionable contingency theories, relating to such areas as organization, structure, management style, and orientation to work. Certain aspects of contingency theory represent a backlash effect against neohuman relations. The claim of contingency theorists that their approach is less value-laden than that of human relations appears doubtful. Only the contrast in values, rather than the absence, is apparent.

Title: Folie A Deux: Acting Out Your Superior's Fantasies
Author-Name: Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries
Abstract: The phenomenon known from psychiatric literature as folie 'a deux is discussed from an organizational perspective. It is suggested that folie 'a deux is a regular occurrence in organizations. The psychodynamic processes which play a role in folie 'a deux, the determining variables, and related behavior patterns are examined. Analogies are drawn with other group processes. A model of folie 'a deux in organizations is presented, emphasizing particularly superior-subordinate relationships. Some of the consequences of folie 'a deux in organizations are indicated. Finally, possible ways of recognizing and dealing with this interpersonal process are explored.

Title: Patterns of Gaze in Cooperative and Competitive Negotiation
Author-Name: Margaret Foddy
Abstract: On the basis of theoretical assumptions about the information needs of cooperative and competitive negotiators, it was predicted that experimental manipulation of motivational orientation should produce different patterns of gaze and mutual gaze. The frequency and duration of gaze and mutual gaze of naive subjects in 28 dyads was monitored by video cameras. As predicted, the average length of gaze and mutual gaze was greater for cooperators, while frequency of gaze and mutual gaze were the same in both cooperation and competition. This pattern is consistent with the claim that length of gaze indexes the affective function of eye contact, while frequency is an index of the monitoring function. Analysis of frequency and duration of speech showed that the gaze patterns held even when allowance was made for the coordinating function of gaze in conversation. Females were found to engage in longer gaze and mutual gaze than males, in both cooperation and competition.

Title: Group Cohesion, Task Performance, and the Experimenter Expectancy Effect
Author-Name: Johan Hoogstraten
Author-Name: Harrie C. M. Vorst
Abstract: Three laboratory experiments were done to study the effects of cohesion on task fulfillment and to explore the influence of task fulfillment on the initial level of cohesion. Within four-person groups of freshmen psychology students, cohesion was manipulated successfully by a triple procedure. The level of cohesion was ascertained directly after the induction treatment and again after task fulfillment. Group and individual ability tasks were used in the first and second experiment, while individual learning tasks were used in the third experiment. The hypothesis that cohesion facilitates task performance was partly supported for both individual and group tasks. All eight comparisons of the means favoured the high-cohesion condition; only four of the differences, however, were statistically significant. Performing a group task tended to raise cohesion, whereas individual task performance lowered liking for the group. There were no indications that the findings were a function of a pretest effect of the coh...

Title: A Structure for Change
Author-Name: S. G. Goldstein
Abstract: The boundary of the planning process of a hospital department of diagnostic radiology that had formed around the dominant coalition in the traditional way had been maintained even though the process had become less effective as a result of changes in boundary conditions. Through an intervention program new boundaries were created to enable all staff to participate in the planning process. It was shown that for the effective and durable participation of staff in change the boundary conditions of the planning system had to be substantially different from those of the resource-conversion system. Tested over a period of more than S years, the new design appears to have many advantages and may also have wider application.

Title: The Study of Institutions
Author-Name: Peter Mortimorel
Abstract: Six studies of different types of institutions are described and their main findings reported. It is argued that two important features of this research are that real differences in organization, aims, and climate have been found between units that are ostensibly fulfilling the same function, and that these differences have been shown to have an important influence on the inmates. This second point is developed in a discussion of the different types of outcome measures that are available for evaluation, and the effect this choice has on the results. Finally the implications of these studies for both teachers and educational researchers are briefly discussed.

Title: Organizational Effects of Managerial Turnover in Kibbutz Production Branches
Author-Name: Uri Leviatan
Abstract: The phenomenon of institutionalized general turnover and internal rotation of managerial personnel and its effects upon the conduct of the organizations involved is examined with data from production branches of Israeli kibbutzim. Arguments for and against the effectiveness of such a norm are presented. Four specific hypotheses are formulated. About 60 productive organizations were involved: 33 farm branches and 27 industrial plants. Data were collected by way of questionnaires to all workers at each organization and by way of documents and interviews with informants. The major findings are the following: The potential for managerial positions is larger than needed for a given time; in the branches studied the median time in office was about 2-3 years. Organizations that practice rotation are not less (and maybe more) effective than those that do not practice rotation. This is because their workers are more involved, knowledgable, and creative than those in the latter. Length of time in office sometimes a...

Title: Measures of Job Facets Satisfaction as Predictors of the Tendency to Leave or                 the Tendency to Stay with an Organization
Author-Name: Zvi Maimon

Abstract: This study evaluates the relative influence various aspects of job satisfaction have on an employee's tendency to stay with or leave an organization. The significance of restrictions on the pay range and fringe benefits is considered as afactor in establishing the relative effect of extrinsic and intrinsic aspects ofjob satisfaction on mobility tendencies. The study is based on a sample of 683 college graduates employed in public and private sector businesses in Israel. Thefindings suggest that: (a) Intrinsic aspects of job satisfaction are far better predictors of turnover than extrinsic aspects; (b) overall job satisfaction has a meaning above and beyond satisfaction with various aspects of the job; (c) satisfaction with intrinsic rewards and overall job satisfaction are reasonably good predictors of both the tendency to stay with and the tendency to leave an organization; (d) the tendency to stay with and the tendency to leave an organization have common causes which are not accounted for by the level ...

Title: Is There a Motive to Avoid Success in Women?
Author-Name: Colleen Ward
Abstract: The motive to avoid success (M-S) is a stable personality disposition acquired early in life in conjunction with sex-role standards and acts as an inhibiting factor in achievement motivation. Horner postulates that many women experience anxiety in competitive situations and learn to fear success because of its incongruence with the traditional female role. M-s is conceived of within the Expectancy-Value theory and is only one factor in the overall assessment of achievement motivation. To explain M-s in terms of this theory, the assessment and measurement of fear of success and its role in predicting behavior are presented in conjunction with earlier research on achievement motivation. The paper concentrates on three areas: (1) methodological and theoretical criticisms of M-s research (validity and reliability of measurement, fear of success as a situational variable, M-s as a reflection of sex-role stereotypes), (2) explanation of M-5 within the Expectancy-Value theory of motivation and supporting researc...

Title: A Reappraisal of Sociotechnical Systems Theory
Author-Name: John E. Kelly
Abstract: The major purpose of this article is to reassess the adequacy of the major principles of sociotechnical systems theory by means of a detailed reexamination of the case studies from which they are partly derived. It is shown, as a result, that the notion of a single, homogeneous sociotechnical school is a misleading oversimplification, since two streams of sociotechnical theory can in fact be identified. It is suggested that the autonomy granted to autonomous work groups is limited, and subordinate to particular economic objectives. Further, it is argued that the concept of joint optimization has little connection with the reality of sociotechnical practice and that it should be replaced with the notion of intensification of labor. The role of pay incentives is also shown to have been seriously underestimated in the causation of economic and psychological changes. And finally, the idea of organizational choice is also shown to be inadequate on the grounds that the case studies have demonstrated the superio...

Title: Buying Your Job: Factors Affecting the Success or Failure of Employee                 Acquisition Attempts
Author-Name: Robert N. Stern
Author-Name: Tove Helland Hammer
Abstract: Until recently, North American producers' cooperatives (employee-owned firms) have received scant attention relative to their more numerous European counterparts. While the existing literature on this subject has covered historical description as well as the critical issues of the emergence, political basis, operation, and success of producers' cooperatives, there is considerable disagreement on the circumstances under which some form of worker ownership emerges and little information available on the factors which make worker ownership possible. This paper identifies a number of variables important to the successful acquisition by workers of their own firm and delineates the functions of each variable as a contributor to success. The paper is based on a study of six firms in which the complex process of transferring the ownership of an enterprise to its employees has been attempted.

Author-Name: Kathryn T. Molohon
Author-Name: Richard Paton
Author-Name: Michael Lambert
Abstract: This paper extends Barth's concept of ethnic boundaries and boundary strength to include boundaries maintained by other groups, and to propose that various types of human groups may be related on a continuum through the quality or strength of their boundaries. Three different types of groups "simple" groups, subcultural groups, and ethnic groups-are used to examine this concept in greater detail. It is further suggested that the concept of a continuum of boundary strength may be used to identify various stages of ethnic development, and that the notion of boundary has important implications for studies of urban ethnicity and human identity processes.

Abstract: This research examines and compares patterns of coordination among clusters of organizations which are all members of a larger network of human service agencies. The blockmodeling procedure developed by Breiger et al. was used to analyze the data collected, and three tightly connected clusters of agencies werefound to exist in the network. By evaluating the reasons why organizations reported being involved with others, it was found that the three interorganizational clusters existed for three predominantly different reasons: resource transactions, direct services, and planning and coordination. The three clusters were then compared on a number of dimensions of interorganizational coordination, and it was found there were significantly different patterns of relationships among these clusters of agencies while no significant differences among the clusters were found on perceived effectiveness and the degree of impact of the relationships. A theoretical explanation for the observed results is developed. The ...

Title: Another Look at the Conformity Explanation of Group-Induced Shifts in Choice
Author-Name: Royce Singleton, Jr.
Abstract: A conformity explanation of group-induced shifts in individual choice has never received careful examination. For conformity to account for groupinduced shifts, it must be shown that (a) movement toward the group produces shifts in predictable directions on given decision problems, and (b) the motive force behind individual changes is group pressure. This article reviews the evidence bearing upon these two propositions and compares conformity with other currently popular explanations of the choice shift. The conclusion drawn is that conformity cannot account for the full choice shift effect, but that it does explain a significant portion of the variance in individual shifts.

Title: Attributing Responsibility to the Victim of Rape: Influence of Information                 Regarding Past Sexual Experience
Author-Name: Arnie Cann
Author-Name: Lawrence G. Calhoun
Author-Name: James W. Selby
Abstract: Information regarding a rape victim's past sexual behaviors was presented to college students in specially constructed newspaper stories describing testimony at the trial. In two conditions the sexual experience information was explicit, indicating an active or an inactive past. In three other conditions no explicit information was presented, but the reason was varied: The victim refused to testify, the judge refused to allow testimony, or no mention was made of sexual experience. The results indicate that the victim who refuses to discuss her sexual experience is perceived as sexually active, and as more responsible for the rape than in other conditions. When the judge prohibits testimony, the victim is held less responsible for the rape than the sexually inactive and no-information victims. The findings are discussed in reference to attribution theory predictions and recent interest in laws regarding rape.

Title: Attitudes of Blacks and Whites Toward Native American Revolutionary Tactics                 for Social Change
Author-Name: Robert Panzarella
Author-Name: Ansley LaMar
Abstract: Seventy-five male Blacks and Whites in New York City responded to a questionnaire concerning the militant Native American seizure of Wounded Knee, South Dakota while the events were occurring. Despite extensive news coverage, subjects had little specific knowledge of the Native Americans' demands. Younger people and Blacks had more favorable attitudes toward the militants and their tactics. Poorer Whites also favored militant tactics. Wealthier Whites placed more blame on the government. Little good was expected to come from militant tactics, but younger Whites expected more favorable outcomes for the militants themselves, and there was a tendency to predict more favorable outcomes for the militants when the investigator was Black. Revolutionary tactics may not be expected to alter economic conditions yet may be espoused for their psychological impact on alienated members of the society.

Title: Managerial Achievement: The Personal Side of Behavioral Theory
Author-Name: Jay Hall
Author-Name: Susan M. Donnell
Abstract: Five separate studies involving over 12,000 managers were conducted to explore the relationship between personal applications of behavioral science principles and managerial achievement. Managers, categorized as High, Average, or Low Achievers according to an objective achievement formula, were asked to respond to several standardized survey instruments based on the theories of Argyris, Blake and Mouton, Herzberg, Marrow, Maslow, and McGregor. Subordinate assessments of their manager's practices were also obtained from companion instruments. Multivariate analyses revealed that High, Average, and Low Achieving managers differed significantlyin terms of both self-reports and subordinate appraisals-in those practices circumscribed by our more prominent applied theorists. Moreover, High Achievers were found to behave in ways essentially consistent with the normative thrust of the models cited while Average and LowAchievers violated critical tenets of those models. Results are discussed in terms of the persona...

The same series of 11 trials was then repeated (the apparatus having allegedly been repaired), with the subject answering in one of three conditions: (1) unanimous pressure: during both presentations of the 11 trials all group members gave extremely incorrect or unpopular answers on all critical trials; (2) present social support: during both presentations one person in the group always gave correct or popular answers on critical trials in disagreement with the group; (3) absent social support: during the first presentation one group member always gave correct answers on critical trials, but left the experiment before the second presentation. Results showed that both the physically prese...

Author-Name: William A. Westley
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of the type of problems generated by the factory system and the types of modern remedies proposed for those problems. The problems faced by people at work are classified into four types: political (insecurity), economic (inequity), psychological (alienation), and sociological (anomie). Individual remedies such as: worker directors, profit sharing, job enrichment, and sociotechnical design are then examined in terms of their capacity to solve these problems. A distinction between job enrichment and sociotechnical design is made in terms of the first meeting psychosocial expectations, and the latter providing a cultural or normative environment for work.

Title: Role Shock: A Tool for Conceptualizing Stresses Accompanying Disruptive Role Transitions
Author-Name: Meredith Minkler
Author-Name: Robert P. Biller
Abstract: This paper attempts to develop the concept of role shock by describing its theoreticalproperties and exploring its relationship to relevant existing concepts in the social sciences. Role shock is defined as the stresses accompanying either major discrepancies between anticipated and encountered roles or the sudden and significant departure from familiar roles which are "'played differently" in the new setting or replaced altogether by new and unfamiliar roles. Its sources and manifest forms are described, with particular attention paid to the distinctions between role shock and the related concepts of culture shock, identity crisis, and such sociological constructs as role loss and role discontinuity. The usefulness of this concept is discussed in terms of its value in clarifying, and thus helping us deal more effectively with, a particularform of maladaptive role-related stress. Role shock thus is seen to underscore the value of such ameliorative modes as the "mutual help groups" of recent origin, which ...

Title: Commitment to Self-Identification: A Sociopsychological Approach to Personality
Author-Name: Richard T. Santee
Author-Name: Susan E. Jackson
Abstract: This paper describes a self-systemic approach to the study of personality structure and process. Personality is conceptualized as organized around the ways one is committed to identifying oneself. Central to personality structure are those social roles the person is committed to performing. These role identities are the fundamental criteria by which goals, activities, and situations are selected by the person. Associated with role identities are identity goals, self-attributed characteristics that the person is motivated to exemplify when he or she is performing a particular role identity. Normative expectations are the person's beliefs as to which behaviors will express his or her identity goals. Data from a longitudinal and a cross-sectional sample of students supported this conceptualization. The theory is contrasted with the traditional self-concept approach, and is applied to an analysis of personality consistency; development, and adaptability.

Abstract: This research deals with an investigation of the factor structure of the Job Diagnostic Survey. Textile operatives (n = 114) in a southeastern textile plant completed the JDS. Factor analyses produced substantially different results than have appeared in the literature. Further correlational analyses revealed that the format used in collecting the data may be partially responsible for the different factor structures which have been found for the various types of workers. The researchers conclude that a simplification of the format may be needed.

Title: The Effects of Job Enrichment on Employee Satisfaction, Motivation,                 Involvement, and Performance: A Field Experiment
Author-Name: Christopher Orpen
Abstract: The effect of job enrichment on employee responses was investigated in a field experiment conducted in a federal agency among clerical employees, who were randomly assigned to either an enriched or unenriched condition. In the enriched condition, a systematic attempt was made to increase the extent to which the jobs of the employees possessed each of the dimensions of skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback. In the unenriched condition, the employees performed their original duties and tasks. After a 6-month experimental period, the effect of enrichment was examined. The results showed that: (1) Employees in the enriched condition perceived their jobs as more enriched than before; (2) enrichment caused significant increases in employee job satisfaction, job involvement, and internal motivation; (3) enrichment led to significant decreases in absenteeism and turnover; but (4) enrichment had little impact on performance, whether assessed by superiors' ratings or by actual outp...

Abstract: An archival study of aggression using a refined definition based upon certain types of norm violations in ice hockey was conducted to explore whether aggressive responses can be generalized over time and place. While differences for an entire team's performance over 7years found trends but no significant differences, more refined analysis reported differences. When subgroups of low versus high aggressive players were compared, significant differences were found. Aggression increased over time and was more evident at home than away. An exception occurred when initial aggression was high and a postulated self-regulatory control decreased subsequent aggression.

Title: Environmental Scanning and Problem Recognition by Governing Boards: The                 Response of Hospitals to Declining Birth Rates
Author-Name: Roger A. Ritvo
Author-Name: Paul Salipante, Jr.
Author-Name: William W. Notz
Abstract: This study investigates the problem of organizational adaptation to environmental change, focusing on the variables of information sources and governing board structures. The overall findings strongly suggest that early problem recognition can be enhanced by the structures and the sources of data used in the decision-making process. An additional hypothesis growing out of a pilot study and supported by the main study concerned the positive impact of a new administrator on early problem recognition. The implications of thesefindingsfor the process of problem recognition are discussed.

Title: Manning Levels, Organizational Effectiveness, and Health

Author-Name: E. K. Eric Gunderson
Abstract: The relationships of manning levels to division performance ratings and illness and injury rates were investigated aboard 18 U.S. Navy ships (N = 1,634). Sources of variance in crew members' ratings of adequacy of manning were analyzed at the individual level, and specific components of this variance were used to predict ratings of performance and the illness criteria at the division (work group) level. A scale measuring efficiency of manpower utilization had superior predictive validities with respect to the performance and illness criteria compared to actual manning levels. It was concluded that manpower utilization perceptions of the efficiency of human resources should be monitored as closely as manning level in order to optimize organizational performance and health and safety.

Title: The Effect of Significant Other's Job Complexity on Employee Reactions to Work
Author-Name: Greg R. Oldham
Author-Name: Howard E. Miller
Abstract: This research examines the interaction of individual employee job complexity with the job complexity of significant others in determining employee reactions to work. Procedures and hypotheses are based on principles of equity theory. For each employee, a composite significant other's job complexity index was formed by averaging the job complexity scores of all individuals within the focal employee'sjob classification who were of the same sex as the focal. Results show significant interactions between this "comparison other"job complexity measure and the job complexity of the focal employee. Specifically, results show that employees who work on jobs of greater complexity than their colleagues have lower satisfaction and higher productivity than employees who work on jobs comparable in complexity to those of comparison others. Employees who work on jobs of lesser complexity than their co-workers have slightly lower satisfaction and productivity than employees who work on jobs comparable in complexity to tho...

Title: Action and Contingency Postulates in Organization-Environment Relations
Author-Name: David F. Gillespie
Author-Name: Dennis S. Mileti
Abstract: Two models of organization-environment relations are examined. One postulates organizational structure or behavior as contingent on environments; organizations are viewed as adapting to environmental changes. Conversely, the second model postulates environments as dependent upon organizations; organizations are viewed as actively manipulating environments. The two alternative models are empirically assessed and compared on a heterogeneous sample of 27 business corporations. In the contingency model, environmental manipulation is used to predict different dimensions of organizational technology. In the action model, the causal order is reversed; technology is used to predict environmental manipulation. Organizational assets are controlled in both models to eliminate the possible bias of differential resources. We find similar predictive power for both models. Explained variance was about equal, and standardized regression coefficients were similar across the models as well. It is thus concluded that a full...

Title: Group, Task, and Personality Correlates of Boundary-Spanning Activities
Author-Name: Robert C. Dailey
Abstract: Boundary-spanning activities were studied in 15 organizations engaged in basic and applied research. Included in the study were 281 scientists and engineers. Contrary to prior theory and research, this study found bound-ary-spanning activities to be unrelated to job satisfaction. It was strongly related to perceptions of research and development team collaboration, job motivation, task uncertainty, locus of control, team cohesiveness, and individualproductivity. The research reported here makes a strong case for including group processes and characteristics in future studies involving boundary-spanning activities. The results also give increased impetus to re-search which examines the relationships between boundary-spanning activi-ties and individual productivity.

Title: Examining an Illusion: The Role of Deceptive Behaviors In Organizations
Author-Name: Virginia E. Schein
Abstract: Viewing organizations as political environments, the paper examines the nature and function of deceptive behaviors in organizations. Key concepts presented are the personal and work-related power acquisition behaviors of individuals and the differential exhibition of these behaviors within highand low-slack organizational systems. Within the framework of deceptive behaviors as a function of the form of power acquisition behaviors and nature of the organization, the underlying basis of deceptive behaviors, the benefits of deception to organizational members, and the benefits of deception to the organization are discussed.

Title: The Acquisition of Political Orientations by College Students: A Theoretical Model
Author-Name: Harvey E. Rich
Abstract: This paper suggests a multidimensional model by which the acquisition of political attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge may be investigated. Three hypotheses were examined by use of data on college students and a control group of town cohorts. The first hypothesis, that political socialization is not uniform across levels, was confirmed. The second hypothesis, that political affect remains relatively stable throughout the college years while political cognition changes, was also confirmed. Finally, the third hypothesis, that present structural variables have a greater effect on cognition while background variables are more likely to have an impact on affect, was verified for the students and partly verified for the town cohorts. The verification of these hypotheses demonstrates the utility of a complex differentiated model such as the one that has been postulated. One fruitful use of this typology lies in the possibility that researchers could develop linkages between it and a developmental model of politica...

Title: A Psychosocial Model of Stress and Its Application to Managerial Unemployment
Author-Name: Stephen Fineman
Abstract: This paper describes a model of psychosocial stress attempting to explain the psychological response state of stress and physical disease (strain) related to stress, from the consequences of an individual's failure to master self-threatening problems. The model is phenomenological, focusing on an individual's perceived organizational and nonorganizational demands, and how these are modified by personality factors. Behavioral approaches for dealing with threat, and the effectiveness of such approaches, are discussed. The model is used as a framework to analyze qualitative and quantitative data derived from a study of unemployed managers. The themes which characterize the highand the low-stress managers are delineated, and the overall implications of the findings are discussed, with particular focus on the management of stress in organizations.

Title: Effect of National Status on Delegate Participation and Influence in an                 International Organization
Author-Name: Yung-mei Tsai
Abstract: The effect of an individual's social status upon behavior in group setting i.e., the status generalization phenomenon-is a recurrent theme in socialpsychological and sociological studies. The present study examines the effect of status (of national status) upon delegate behavior in an international organization, the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations. It concludes that: (1) delegates from high status nations tend to be more influential and active than delegates from low status nations; (2) high national status per se is not sufficient to generate delegate influence; to be influential, delegates need to be active; (3) of three national status indicators-diplomatic status, size of delegation, and budgetary contribution-the latter one is the most important; and (4) a high frequency of participation is sufficient to generate influence.

Title: Some Problems in the Analysis of Semantic Differential Data
Author-Name: John Bynner
Author-Name: Peter Coxhead
Abstract: Applications of the semantic differential technique, involving small numbers of concepts and scales and eliciting descriptions of the concepts rather than metaphoric meanings, present special problems of analysis, especially in accommodating "concept-scale interaction." In considering possible analysis strategies, Maguire's analysis of variance model of SD responses is examined. In this model, an individual's score on a scale for a particular concept can be attributed to various sources, including a concept by scale interaction effect, different from concept-scale interaction as generally understood in SD research. Maguire's model is valuable in identifying response sets in SD data, but fails to solve the problem of concept-scale interaction encountered in the reduction of scales to a set of dimensions common to all concepts by factor analytic methods. Comparison of concepts in terms of these dimensions is often the main aim of SD research. For this purpose, the model requires extension to the formation o...

Abstract: The relationship between hierarchicalposition in the work organization and job satisfaction was examined in a national probability sample of working adults. A significant curvilinear relation was found, even when the covariates of age, income, and occupational prestige were considered. These results differ from findings in a recent multination study of selected work organizations. Discussion suggests that general population samples may be more appropriate for testing theories about work attitudes than are samples within work organizations.

Title: The Organization-Client Relationship as an Aspect of Interorganizational Analysis
Author-Name: Giorgio Inzerillil
Abstract: The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania This paper presents an argument for viewing the relationship between organizations and their clients as a specific case of interorganizational relationship. Following a proposition related to interorganizational analysis suggested by Litwak and Hylton (1962), the paper argues that the organization-client relationship is characterized by interests that arepartly shared and partly conflicting. It is suggested that Litwak and Hylton's hypothesis on the need for mechanisms that preserve both cooperation and conflict between organizations can be applied to the relationship between the organization and its clients. When mechanisms for conflict maintenance are missing the equilibrium of this relationship may be altered in favor of the organization, by a process of overbureaucratization, or of the clients, by a process of debureaucratization. The discussion focuses on the second alternative with an analysis, illustrated by a case study, of the causes and consequences...

Title: Nature of Size-Structure Relationship: Some Further Evidence
Author-Name: Naresh C. Agarwal
Abstract: Faculty of Business, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario The present study of size-structure relationship is based on a sample of 168 United States life insurance companies. Data were collected on three measures of organization size and four measures of structure. In view of the high intercorrelations among the three size measures (r> .87), only one was used in subsequent analysis of size-structure relationship. The results indicate the relationship to be highly significant but nonlinear. In general, the structure differentiation tends to increase with size but at a decreasing rate. The study also compares the size-structure relationship across small, medium, and large organizations. These results point to a varying dimensionality of organization structure at different size levels.

Title: Conflict Between Major Life Roles: Women and Men in Dual Career Couples
Author-Name: Carole K. Holahan
Author-Name: Lucia A. Gilbert
Abstract: An investigation of the newly emerging pattern of career aspirations in women, in which both a demanding profession and family life are assumed, was conducted within a framework of interrole conflict among major life roles and its correlates. Subjects were 28 dual career couples who responded to an anonymous questionnaire. Of specific interest were the areas and degree of interrole conflict, in addition to their relationship to gender, parent hood, level of career aspirations, spouse's emotional support of career pursuit, and attitudes toward the roles of women. Surprisingly, the prediction of gender differences in regard to areas and correlates of interrole conflict were not supported. The one exception was level of career aspiration, where high aspirations were negatively related to role conflict for men but positively related to role conflict for women. Strikingly different patterns of conflict, however, were found as a function of the presence or absence of children.

Title: The Generality of Attitude to Authority
Author-Name: Ken Rigby
Author-Name: Eric E. Rump
Abstract: Previous research on attitude to authority has not adequately examined the generality of attitudes across different institutional authorities. This problem is distinct from "authoritarianism " and its purported concomitants. In this study, five scales were developed, relating to the Police, the Army, the Law, Teachers, and Symbolic Authority. The five scales showed a high degree of internal consistency on cross-validation. The intercorrelations among the scales, and with a Radicalism measure, demonstrated a high degree of generality in attitude towards institutional authorities. Moderate validity correlations were found with relevant reported activities: church attendance, participation in political demonstrations, and having been in conflict with teachers.

Title: Interaction Effects of Power Equalization and Subordinate Personality on Job                 Satisfaction and Performance
Author-Name: Ahmed A. Abdel-Halim
Abstract: This study examines the interaction effects of employees' perceptions of actual and desired power equalization (PE), in terms of the power differential between their own level and their superiors' and of the egalitarian nature of their personality on their job satisfaction and performance. Data were collected from a sample of 222 managerial and nonmanagerial personnel in a large retail drug company in the Midwest. Results show that the more egalitarian the subordinate, the stronger the relationship between their perceptions of PE and satisfaction with work or supervisor. Significant relationships are also obtained between desired PE and job satisfaction. There are no significant relationships, however, between PE and job performance. Implications of these findings concerning the use of power with-in organizations are discussed.

Title: Information Use: A Professional Strategy
Author-Name: Alfred W. Clark
Abstract: A sample of 100 psychologists and 30 sociologists completed a questionnaire about the pressure on them to use information, the strategies they use in response to this pressure, and their role effectiveness. It was found that (1) high pressure to use the literature was associated with high use of information. Service types were found not only to be exposed to less pressure but also to be lower users of information than nonservice types; (2) high users of information evaluated the literature more positively, were more open to it, and made a greater effort to keep up with it than lower users. Service types adopted a strategy of being less open to new information and of making less effort to keep up with it than nonservice types; (3) high information use was not associated with effective job performance. High information use, however, was seen as being associated with potential contribution to afield. Service types assessed their potential contribution less highly than did nonservice types.

Title: Exchange Rules and Goal Structures
Author-Name: Barbara Foley Meeker
Abstract: This paper presents an experiment derived from social exchange theory, designed to explore the question of howpeople deal with multiple and possibly conflicting sources of information about rewards and costs. Twenty female and 20 male dyads participated in a binary choice two-person game that was cooperative in nature but required coordination. Independent variables were: goal structure (established by two different payoff matrices); exchange rules (established by six different "bonus rules "); order of presentation of exchange rules; sex; and subject position (subjects were randomly assigned to "table 1" or "table 2"). Dependent variables were the choices made by the subjects in the game and their responses on questionnaires that tested their attitudes and intentions. The general theoretical assumption was that the less certain (that is, more ambiguous, difficult to coordinate, or contradictory to social expectations) a source of information is, the less it will affect behavior. Several hypotheses drawn ...

Abstract: A differential association model of unethical behavior was utilized to predict unethical behavior among marketing practitioners. The data were collected through a systematic random sample of 280 marketing managers selected from the 1975 American Marketing Association roster. Newstrom and Ruch 's 17-item ethics scale was used to develop six types of predictors of unethical behavior, "What I do, " among marketers. These six types of variables included (1) the marketer's beliefs, "What I believe"; (2) what the marketer thought his peers believed, "Peer beliefs"; (3) what the marketer thought top management believed, "What top management believes"; (4) what the marketer thought his peers did, "What my peers do"; (5) the opportunity the marketer thought his peers had to become involved in un-ethical behavior, "Opportunity for peers"; and finally (6) the opportunity the marketer himself had to become involved in unethical behavior, "Individual opportunity." In the case of these marketing practitioners, their pe...

Abstract: Attribution theory and symbolic interactionism have developed independently of each another, although both are concerned with the processes employed by ordinary people to make sense of their everyday world. It was inevitable that developments in the one should at last collide with certain well-established tenets of the other. Recent developments in attribution theory respecting differential attributions by Ego of the causes of his own and Alter's behaviors seem to collide with Mead's notion of the Generalized Other. The authors seek to define the current impasse, which they see as further confounding the problem of intersubjectivity.

Title: Compatibility and Task Group Performance

Author-Name: J. Stephen Heinen
Abstract: The study examines whether Schutz's aggregate index for measuring compatibility is useful for the formation of work teams, and whether compatibility is more relevant to socioemotional aspects of a group rather than task achievement aspects. Nine subcompatibilities for each subject were determined using the FIRO-B survey. Subcompatibilities were subsequently correlated to dependent measures of team member effectiveness, competence, and friendliness. Results indicate that Schutz's aggregate compatibility index conceals the different degree and kind of relationship between subcompatibilities and the dependent variables. Additionally, relationships between subcompatibilities and socio-emotional dependent measures were more often significant than relationships with task achievement measures but the effect was not pronounced. Consequently there appears to be little utility in seriously examining compatibility when forming a work group. Further theorizing is done concerning the underlying static nature of Schutz...

Title: Sophomores, Rats, and Referees: How Social Psychologists View Their World
Author-Name: Ian I. Mitroff
Author-Name: Thomas V. Bonoma
Abstract: A random sample of 123 social psychologists at all levels of professional distinction completed a mail questionnaire assessing their cognitive and affective judgments of 10 "role concepts" encountered as part of their professional environment. Clinical, educational, experimental, and social psychologists were all rated on the 17 scales, as were the rat, the college sophomore, the research subject, the graduate research assistant, the APA journal referee, and the externalfunding agency. The results showed strong differences between social psychologists' responses to each role concept. Factor and discriminant analyses were applied to the data in order to provide a preliminary cognitive and affective map of the social psychologist's "implicit psychology" concerning his colleagues, objects of study, and interactive mechanisms (e.g., journal referees) encountered in the study of social science. The results were compared and contrasted to a previous study of physical scientists working on the Apollo moon missions.

Title: Parkinson Revisited: A Component Analysis of the Use of Staff Specialists in                 Manufacturing Organizations
Author-Name: Bernard C. Reimann
Abstract: The substantial body of research on the correlates of the size of the support staff in organizations has produced highly inconsistent results. One reason for this may be that most researchers have focused on a single aggregate measure of support staff. A study of 20 manufacturing concerns confirmed a suspicion that the total size of support staff may be a very heterogeneous trait, and that treating it as one homogeneous variable may have resulted in oversimplified or even misleading conclusions. This study found support staff to consist of four relatively independent components, each of which was related to different organizational and situational variables (such as process technology and technological change), while aggregate staff was related only to organization size. These results suggest that future research should not be confined to a simple aggregate measure of the number of staff specialists in organizations, but should, rather, focus on each of the staff components or specialties separately.

Title: Scientific Autonomy East and West: A Comparison of the Perceptions of Soviet                 and United States Scientists
Author-Name: Nina Toren
Abstract: This study examines the effects of nationality on scientific autonomy. It compares Soviet and United States natural scientists who have recently immigrated to Israel, with respect to the autonomy that they had in their countries of origin, that they have at present, and that they aspire to have in the future. Autonomy is examined in four areas of the scientific role: project selection, methods selection, budget allocation, and selection of coworkers. The main findings are the following: (1) Both Soviet and United States scientists have high aspirations for freedom in their scientific role, although the latter want more autonomy in most role areas than the former; (2) the Russian scientists report that they have had considerably less scientific freedom in the past, and have somewhat less at present, than the United States scientists; (3) the discrepancy between the present and the desired levels of autonomy is larger concerning the Soviet scientists, but the United States scientists have lost more autonomy...

Title: Mapping Personal Value Space: A Study of Managers in Four Organizations
Author-Name: Donald A. Clare
Author-Name: Donald G. Sanford
Abstract: The concept of personal values is a much referenced but little documented one in the organization behavior literature. In this study, a modified version of the Rokeach Value Survey is used to generate data on the personal values of 132 managers from four different organizations. Comparisons are made by level and by organization, and the value space of each organization is partially mapped, by combining the value data of the managers themselves with the values attributed by them to relevant and nonrelevant others. The results indicate the existence of by-level, by-organization differences hither-to undetected by other, more general measures of personal values. Suggestions for expanded research and diagnostic use of the Value Survey are made.

Title: An Empirical Test of the Configurational Theory of Organizations
Author-Name: Howard L. Smith
Author-Name: Stephen M. Shortell
Author-Name: Borje O. Saxberg
Abstract: The configurational theory of organizations was used to analyze the relationships among organization environment, structure, and performance in proprietary nursing homes. This theory extends previous contingency theory research and conceptualization by including performance as the main focus behind organization design activities. Thirty proprietary nursing homes in the state of Washington responded to comprehensive interviews and survey questionnaires designed to measure variables specified in the configurational theory. The results of this study suggest partial support for the configurational theory; most notably in explaining differences in efficiency among nursing homes operating in low intensity environments.

Author-Name: Shoshana Sharni
Abstract: This study presents the problems, dynamics and developmental stages that group leaders face while working with culturally deprived mothers. The data was derivedfrom process recorded sessions of two groups of leaders (N = 30) who met regularly in order to work out the problems they encountered in their work. Clinical analysis of the data pointed to three simultaneous processes that took place: (1) characteristic of groups participants; (2) characteristic of group leaders' working with diverse populations; (3) a developmentalprocess specific to leaders activating groups of culturally deprived mothers. Each process was discussed and conclusions were drawn.

Author-Name: S. R. Ganesh
Abstract: This paper reports one set of contributions from an exploratory study of management education institutions in India to ground the Institution Building (IB) theory. It develops empirically a general processual model of institution building using five concepts: context; capability development, innovative thrust, and penetration (performance); and process mechanisms. The paper outlines the various process mechanisms affecting institutional development. Implications for planned change at macrosystem (social change) and microsystem (organizational change) levels are highlighted.

Author-Name: Richard T. Barth
Author-Name: Patricia Vertinsky
Author-Name: Chung-fang Yang
Abstract: Various aspects of compliance behavior were investigated in connection with a genetic screening clinic designed to rest for the Tay-Sachs gene in a specified target population. Selected antecedents of compliance were combined into an integrativeframework based on data obtainedfrom 392 members of the Jewish community in Vancouver, Canada. Drawing on and extending several "health belief models" proposed in the literature, it was hypothesized that compliance would be a function of several endogenous (social responsibility, susceptibility, family planning, family discussion, and objective knowledge of the disease) and exogenous (age, education, sex, and exposure to a carrier) variables. A path-analytic investigation of the hypothesized linkages suggested that a more parsimonious model of compliance determinants may be adequate.

Abstract: The authors undertake the task of developing a theoretical model derived from new concepts in individual psychoanalytic theory and technique. These ideas emphasize the unconscious organization of behavior and people's planful way of working with the therapist in the treatment setting. The model is applied to the basic assumptions of Bion, reanalyzing them in particular ways to bring out the treatment goals which they are seen to rep- resent for the group members. The model is also exemplified by clinical material.

Title: Broken Frame and Emergent Meaning: The Case of Student Evaluation of Teaching
Author-Name: Larry C. Ingram
Abstract: Symbolic interaction stresses the personal definition of the situation, while frame analysis seeks to uncover the background assumptions within which interaction takes place. Although some see these as opposing approaches, the argument here is that they are complementary, particularly where social change undermines previous rules for interacting. The argument is illustrated by focusing on the emergence of student evaluation of teaching as an institutionalized method of increasing accountability, and the meaning of these evaluations for administrator-, faculty, and students is considered against the background rules of relationship among the three categories. The closing section examines the impact of social position on selfexpression using Mead's "I" and "me" concepts.

Specific goals and feedback from management were associated with significant improvements in group cohesion and goal commitment in addition to improvements in product quality. However, overallsatisfaction and intrinsic job satisfaction decreased. These findings, together with decreases in turnover, are examined within a longitudinal comparison group design. Results are discussed with reference to theoretical and practical issues in field research and work systems redesign.

Abstract: An original, systematic way of viewing the process-structure of intensive groups is presented. An analysis and portrayal of the interior "ecology" of groups is given, focusing on the various forms, interconnection, and magnitude of interactional-relational subsystems that comprise the channels for interpersonal learning. Group size, composition, and leadership are critical determinants of the numerical and qualitative range of dyads, triads, quadrals, and other subsystem forms and processes considered. This schema suggests additions to practice and points to new directions in the comparative study of process in groups.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the interfirm mobility of managers in British industry. Its aim is both to provide much-needed documentation of the mobility of these managers and to clarify in relation to this occupational group certain explanatory propositions put forward by theorists of interorganizational mobility. Data were derived from a national sample of managers in manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors of industry. The analysis introduces both variables related to individual managers, such as age, education and specialization, and variables related to context, such as size of organization and type of technology.

Title: Compliance and Assistance to an Authority Figure in Perceived Equitable or                 Nonequitable Situations
Author-Name: Joseph Schwarzwald
Author-Name: Judith Goldenberg
Abstract: A derivation of Adams' theory of inequity is that intradepartmental promotion might disproportionately reward a peer, thereby creating feelings of dissatisfaction among nonpromoted co-workers. Subjects were presented with either a hypothetically equitable situation in which a more qualified person is promoted as an authority to the subjects, or a hypothetically inequitable situation in which an equally qualified person is promoted to the same position. The effect of two additional contextual variables was examined: (a) level of acquaintance with the newly promoted authority; and (b) subjects' score on the Rotter's I-E Reinforcement Scale. Mode of inequity resolution was tested by having subjects rate their willingness to comply with work-related and personal requests made by the superior, as well as their inclination to initiate work-related or personal assistance. As predicted, internalists granted a significantly narrower range of authority to the superior in work-related requests when the situation was...

Title: A Causal Analysis of Attitudes Toward Leadership Training in a Classroom Setting
Author-Name: John E. Hunter
Author-Name: Ronda F. Hunter
Author-Name: John E. Lopis
Abstract: This paper presents a longitudinally replicated and cross-validated path analysis of the relations between students' attitudes in a leadership training program. Attitude toward thefacilitator as a person affects attitude toward the facilitator as a teacher and as a role model, and affects the student's sense of belonging in the group. Acceptance of others affects sense of belonging and feelings of self-acceptance. Attitude toward the class is affected by attitudes toward the facilitator as a role model and by sense of belonging. Willingness to speak out in class is affected by sense of belonging and by feelings of self-acceptance. The use of skills outside of class depends on attitude toward the course. Feelings of mastery depend on the willingness to speak out in the group and on the use of the skills outside of the class.

Title: A Framework for Understanding the Definition and Formulation of Problems in Teams
Author-Name: David Sims
Abstract: This paper proposes that, in order to understand how teams work with issues, we need to consider less the question "How does this team deal with its problems?" and ask instead "How does this team come by the problems it works on?" A framework is offered which is intended to facilitate the understanding of, rather than to make "truthful" statements about, problem finding in teams. It considers the nature of problems in teams, the alternative approaches implicit in the terms problem diagnosis and problem finding, the organizational politics of problem finding in teams, and some of the implications these factors have for those who wish to make things happen differently. While the framework was developed through research on the definition and formulation of problems in some Health Care Planning Teams, it is argued that it is likely to have wide heuristic applicability.

Title: Network Analysis in Organizational Settings
Author-Name: Noel Tichy
Author-Name: Charles Fombrun
Abstract: This article sets out to reinforce andfurther develop an emerging paradigm: social network analysis, which represents social structure in terms of relationships (ties) between social objects. Not all the social objects are directly linked, and objects may be connected by multiple relationships of affect, influence, information, or goods and services. Network analysis deals with the types and patterns of relationships, and the causes and consequences of these patterns. The article applies the paradigm to the study of organizational structure by both developing theoretical constructs and presenting methodology for carrying out social network analysis in organizations. An analysis of three organizations from the Aston Study is presented using social network analysis to test propositions about differences between mechanistic and organic structures.

Based on our prior work in developing the control-mastery theory approach to individual psychotherapy, we have attempted to show how individual and group processes in the therapy group can be integrated. This integration offers an understanding of individuals' needs and plans in relation to efforts that emerge from the collective. A clinical example of the principles is offered.

Title: The Mediation of Attitudes by Speech in Dyadic Conversations
Author-Name: Erland Hjelmquist
Author-Name: Sten-Olof Brenner
Abstract: In this study, the relationships among personality characteristics, speech characteristics, and evaluative attitudes were investigated in dyadic conversations between peers. In previous research, it has been proposed that long utterances from a speaker in a conversation is perceived by the listener as expressing a positive attitude. Furthermore, a positive relationship between cognitive variables and utterance length has been found. While the latter finding was replicated, the former was not. It was proposed that the failure to replicate previous results in this respect was due to differences in the definitions of utterance, but also to restrictions in situations used in previous research. It was suggested that the definition of utterance used in this study is appropriate, if a good account of the speech process in everyday conversations is to be sought.

Abstract: This paper argues that conceptual frameworks of the process of job redesign are needed, for both practical and theoretical purposes. In particular, they would enable change agents to systematically document and analyze their experiences, as well as encourage the generation of theory-based propositions about the change process. A tentative framework is presented in an attempt to satisfy three principal criteria. It comprises a number of elements which are interrelated using the notion of cycles, and expanded to include some perspectives on the process of change. Use of the framework is then illustrated through consideration of a detailed case study.

Abstract: Using National Opinion Research Center data from 1973 and 1974 samples representative of the full-time employed United States population, this study investigates the relative importance and patterns of interaction among individual, job, and community predictors of life satisfaction and alienation attitudes. Automatic Interaction Detector (AID) analyses indicate the importance of job satisfaction and marital status to life satisfaction and the prominence of education and need for accomplishment in explaining alienation. An eclectic view of life satisfaction is suggested, and the desirability of adding need for accomplishment as a moderating variable to the traditional socialization/stratification model of alienation is discussed.

Title: Unconscious Planning in Small Groups
Author-Name: James P. Gustafson
Author-Name: Lowell Cooper
Abstract: The authors offer a new hypothesis to solve the general theoretical and practical problem of how collaborative groups evolve: Namely, that these small groups engage in unconscious planning to solve their own problems, and that consultants work best by augmenting this group planning. This hypothesis borrows the concept of individual unconscious planning propounded by Weiss (unpublished) and furthered by Weiss et al. (1977) and Sampson (1976) from the context of individual psychoanalysis and explains group development as the coordinating of individual planning, i.e., as group planning. This involves making prominent in early meetings what general problem the group wishes to control and master, as well as a logical sequence of the order in which difficulties need to be confronted. After introducing the problem, the authors consider four major aspects of the group planning theory: First, the presentation of the theory itself, compared to previous theories of group development; second, exemplification of the t...

This is done formally, and a taxonomy of adaptive behavior is constructed. This taxonomy is related to Ackoff's typology of planning postures. The usefulness of the taxonomy is illustrated by a discussion of types of information-retrieval systems.

Abstract: The paper develops a framework which extends Kelly 's theory of personal constructs so that it can incorporate concepts of consciousness and of structure. It shows both how this extension makes it possible to explore the dynamics of structures as they are apparent in managers' use of language and how the extension can be operationalized so that a manager cannot only think about the theory, but also think through it. It concludes that this operational form of the theory enables the manager to have a new kind of learning experience: reflective learning.

Abstract: The paper focuses on the emergence of the organization sets of three ecumenical disaster recovery organizations. After outlining a model of the emergence of organization sets, it is demonstrated that the three phases in the model-crystallization, recognition, and institutionalization-are associated with specific changes in the characteristics of all three organization sets studied. The changes exhibited concern the size of the organization set, the hierarchical level of boundary personnel, the standardization of interorganizational contacts, and the specialization of boundary positions. The consistency of the model with the open systems perspective on organizations is discussed.

Title: Status Concordance, Coordination, and Success in Interdisciplinary Research Terms
Author-Name: David F. Gillespie
Author-Name: Philip H. Birmbaum
Abstract: The dynamics of status concordance theory are explored in a heterogeneous sample of 67 ongoing interdisciplinary research teams in universities. This theory implies positive relationships between concordance and coordination, coordination and success, and a positive but spurious correlation between concordance and success. Our findings show coordination posi-tively related to success at all stages of team development; concordance positively related to coordination only during early phases of team develop-ment; concordance positively related to success for young teams, unrelated for middle-aged teams, and negatively related for older teams. These patterns remain with coordination statistically controlled. We conclude that status concordance can depress as well as elevate a team's overall success, and that external status criteria play a decreasingly important role in the co-ordination of interdisciplinary teams.

Title: Retirement and Life Significance: A Study of the Adjustment to Retirement of a Sample of Men at Management Level
Author-Name: W. E. Beveridge
Abstract: An analysis of the content of a number of preretirement courses held by work organizations showed evidence of only limited concern with personal adjustment and the discovery of a meaning for retirement. Following a series of interviews and discussions, a questionnaire was therefore devised to test the relevance of course content by identifying the variables most closely associated with retirement satisfaction. The questionnaire was completed by a random sample of 185 retired male managers from seven work organizations in the United Kingdom. A concept termed "life significance" was found to discriminate most effectively between those most satisfied and those least satisfied with their retirement. The implications for preretirement education are indicated. It seems important to give emphasis to the life significance concept and not concentrate only on environmental issues.

Abstract: A socioeconomically diverse set of 20 families presenting themselves for treatment at a child psychiatric clinic in Melbourne were tested at the commencement and end of therapy. Judgements of self and others were obtained on 13 provided constructs. The present report is based on a subsystem offourfamily members consisting of the patient child, a sibling close in age, and both parents. Using the program SERIES, two consensus grids were obtained which were then submitted to principal components analysis using the INGRID program. Changes in judgments over the period of therapy were then assessed by means of the DELTA program. This showed that, after therapy, the patients were being positively perceived by all judges, while their siblings were perceived less positively. However, the parents were rating each other more positively but were judged more negatively by the children. These changes suggest that the therapeutic procedure had effects beyond the resolution of the presenting problem to the whole pattern ...

Title: Spillover Versus Compensation: A Review of the Literature on the Relationship Between Work and Nonwork
Author-Name: Graham L. Staines
Abstract: This paper reviews the evidence concerning the relationship between workers' experiences on and off the job. Of particular interest is the debate over two rival hypotheses: the "spillover" hypothesis and the "compensation" hypothesis. The former argues that workers' experiences on the job carry over into the nonwork arena, and possibly vice versa, such that there develops a similarity in the patterning of work and nonwork life. The latter marshals several arguments for a negative association between work and nonwork, for example, the contention that the work situation is likely to be deficient in needfulfillment, at least in some respects, for most workers and that they will compensate for these deficiencies in their choices of leisure and family activities. Data from relevant studies support the notions of spillover and compensation under different conditions but, overall, offer more evidence of spillover than compensation. Support for spillover, for example, is reflected in the positive correlations bet...

Title: The Etiology of Encounter Group Casualties: "Second Facts"
Author-Name: Robert E. Kaplan
Author-Name: Steven L. Obert
Author-Name: William R. Van Buskirk
Abstract: This paper has two purposes. First, it conceptualizes the process by which encounter group casualties occur. Primary attention in the literature on encounter group casualties has been trained upon the rate of injury and upon the more or less discrete events which give rise to injury. For example, Lieberman, Yalom, & Miles (1973), the major study thus far, made a rather piecemeal analysis of the causes, listing such discrete factors as attack (by the group or leader), rejection, coercive expectation, and unrealistically high hopes of gain. This paper will attempt a more integrated conception of the etiology of encounter group casualties, with a central explanatory concept being the mismanagement of conflict. The second purpose is to replicate the Lieberman et al. (1973) study of encounter group casualties. Procedure for diagnosing injury was essentially the same, the type of encounter group somewhat different, and the incidence of psychological injury considerably lower.

Title: Spirit Possession and Mental Health: A Psycho-Anthropological Perspective
Author-Name: Colleen Ward
Abstract: This paper offers a psycho-anthropological perspective on spirit possession and mental health in a variety of cultures and communities. Its prime focus is the distinction between two forms of possession: ritual and peripheral. The former is displayed in a ceremonial context and includes the social function of reinforcing cultural morality and established power. The latter, by contrast, represents a more long-term state in which the individual believes that he is unwillingly possessed by intruding spirits andfunctions as an indirect form of social protest. While both are reactions to stress, ritual possession operates as a socially sanctioned psychological defense mechanism, while peripheral possession constitutes a pathological reaction to individual conflict.

Title: Life Domain Predictors of Satisfaction with Personal Efficacy
Author-Name: Lakshmi K. Bharadwaj
Author-Name: Eugene A. Wilkening
Abstract: Data from a sample of northwestern Wisconsin residents reveal that satisfaction with personal efficacy is tied to satisfaction with the activity domains of spare time activities, work, family, and spiritual life, with the resource domain of health, and in some cases, of income and education, and with the consumption domain of standard of living. Sex differences in the domain predictors reflect the primacy of work-related factors for men and of family-related considerations for women. Age differences relate to the primacy of family and work satisfactions in the active years of life, and of satisfactions with health and spiritual life in maturity. Satisfaction with the ascribed resource of health is the prime predictor for the lower income groups, while satisfactions with the achieved resources of education and income, and with organizational involvement, contribute significantly to the highest income group only. In general, satisfaction with personal efficacy is derived most from domains in which the self ...

Title: Measuring Unemployment: Family Considerations
Author-Name: Phyllis Moen
Abstract: Unemployment statistics are based on aggregates of individuals, not families, yet the family as a unit suffers from unemployment-especially of the major wage earner. This paper explores the ramifications of using the individual rather than the family as the unit of analysis. Two issues in particular are discussed: the tendency to equate employment/unemployment with family economic well-being and the narrow operationalization of the term "unemployed." Policy implications in the form of additional indicators are discussed.

Title: A Typology for Integrating Technology, Organization, and Job Design
Author-Name: John W. Slocum, Jr.
Author-Name: Henry P. Sims, Jr.
Abstract: This paper proposes a theoretical model of technology that consists of three elements: workflow predictability, task predictability, and job interdependence. Various configurations of these three elements can be formed into "cells" that describe different technologies. The different modes of managerial control and self-regulation associated with each cell are discussed. The paper then combines the technology model with Hackman and Oldham's model of job redesign to form an integrated technology/job redesign model. Various relationships between technology and job characteristics are explored. A major conclusion develops from this discussion: in order to change the job characteristics that are associated with a target work system, the unavoidable introduction of uncertainty is necessary. The amount of self-regulation and the perceived degree of autonomy are shown to be critical variables that link technology and job redesign principles.

Title: Adaptors and Innovators in Organizations
Author-Name: Michael Kirton
Abstract: It is theoretically safe to expect that collective decision-making at the managerial level, in most organizations, will be adaptor-dominated to ensure, e.g., stability and continuity; however, the organizations themselves need not necessarily be adaptor-weighted, i.e., contain more adaptors than innovators. Specific hypotheses about particular subgroups within organizations are advanced, which predict variations in the proportions of adaptors and innovators within given organizational structures. Studies are presented supporting these hypotheses. The variations examined are derived from the adaptor/innovator means of managers in: (a) different departments of a company; (b) different companies; and (c) different management courses. These variations suggest that there may even be differences between the means of practitioners of particular occupations.

Title: Developmental Changes in the Conceptual Friendship Expectations Associated with Children's Friendship Preferences
Author-Name: Brian John Bigelow
Abstract: The relationship between friendship preferences for a hypothetical age-mate and the developmental levels of the dyadic friendship expectations (FEs) were obtainedfrom two samples (ages 9 to 10 and 11 to 12) of both sexes (N = 80). Two experiments were conducted, one for each sample. Subjects were first interviewed and classified into their dominant FE levels on a developmental scale. Subjects then rank-ordered preferences for tape recordings of four hypothetical age-mates, each representing alternative FE level statements. These four conditions were one FE level below (1), same level, one level above (+1) and two levels above (+2) the subject's dominant FE level. Sociometric choices were also observed on the 9and 10-year-olds. There was a successive age-shift of first choices from a random distribution over conditions to a -1, + I bifurcation, followed by a predominance of + 1. These changes were accompanied by increased FE interview responses at adjacent FE levels and better recall of condition most pref...

Author-Name: Richard E. DuWors, Jr.
Abstract: This field study investigated the relationship of work demands experienced by 85 male senior administrators of correctional institutions and the well-being of their spouses. Data were collected by means of questionnaires completed independently by the husbands and their wives. The results indicated that wives whose husbands reported greater occupational demands reported (1) less marital and life satisfaction, (2) decreased social participation, and (3) increased psychosomatic symptoms and negative feeling states. In no case was wives' well-being enhanced as a function of increased occupational demands on husbands. Job demands thus had an influence beyond the workplace and into the lives of their spouses. The interaction between work and nonwork experiences for the quality of individual's lives and the interdependence of husband and wife in this regard require further consideration.

Title: An Exploratory Investigation Into the Nature of the Part-Time MBA Student
Author-Name: Theodore T. Herbert
Abstract: The California Psychological Inventory (CPI) was administered to 123 non-minority male graduate students enrolled in a part-time MBA program, in order to assess patterns of sample-group personality scale similarity or dissimilarity with selected criterion groups. Personality comparisons were felt to offer implications of programmatic and vocational significance. Criterion groups selected were the CPI norm sample, two student samples, and two business samples. The MBA student sample displayed attributes broadly evocative of managerial success when compared with the large norm sample. Yet broad patterns of significant differences emerged when the MBA profile was compared with the profiles of the criterion groups. MBA student deficiencies include the attributes of responsibility, capacity for status, self-control, achievement via conformance, and intellectual efficiency. MBA student strengths include the attributes of dominance, self-acceptance, and psychological-mindedness. Questions are raised about the im...

Title: Effects of Changes in Job Characteristics on Some Theory-Specific Attitudinal Outcomes: Results from a Naturally Occurring Quasi-Experiment
Author-Name: Rabi S. Bhagat
Author-Name: Marilyn B. Chassie
Abstract: The present research examined changes in motivational properties of jobs as measured in the theoretical context of Hackman and Oldham's [19761 job characteristics model through a quasi-experimental design. In an effort to reduce utility costs, a manufacturing organization underwent a planned change from a 5-to a 4-day work week. Changes in characteristics ofjobs in the organization which resulted from the shortened work week were introduced without regard for the motivational consequences of the new schedule. Neither "expectation levels" (King, 1974) nor organizational policies pertaining to the reward system were changed when the 4-day work week was implemented. The overall design of the planned change resembled that of a quasi-experiment, permitting examination of the causal impact of changes in core job dimensions on employee attitudinal outcomes. Measures of core job dimensions and outcome variables were collected before and after the change. Results showed that the group characterized by an increase ...

Title: Interorganizational Relations Among Hospitals: A Strategy, Structure, and Performance Model
Author-Name: William M. Evan
Author-Name: R. Christopher Klemm
Abstract: Contrasting theories of organization-environment relationships are used to consider current trends in relations among health care organizations in the United States. Chandler's well-known thesis is used to bridge the contrasting organization-environment theories. Revising and extending Chandler's thesis results in a recursive model of strategy, structure, and performance. Interviews, organizational documents, and administratively collected data were examined to determine the extent to which strategy, structure, and performance are linked in four different types of interorganizational structures known as multi-hospital systems: a consortium, a joint venture, a merger, and a corporate management system. Using Kendall's W measure of concordance, strategy and structure are found to be closely related; and strategy, structure, and performance are found to be generally interrelated in the four multi-hospital systems considered. While the relationship of strategy and structure is not one-to-one as in the industr...

Title: An Empirical Test of the Theory of Job Design Using Multiple Job Ratings
Author-Name: Moses N. Kiggundu
Abstract: This study investigated the reliability and validity of the Job Diagnostic Survey [JDS] using ratings of the job incumbents, their immediate supervisors, and informed nominated coworkers. It also provides a partial test of the Hackman and Oldham (1976) theory of job design using these multiple job ratings. Results show that previously found psychometric addequacy of the JDS and empirical support of the theory using only job incumbents can be generalized to nonincumbent job ratings. However, the magnitude of the relationships declines as one moves from the incumbents' job ratings.

Title: Theories of Aggression: A Critique and Possible Reformulation
Author-Name: Michael A. Milburn
Abstract: Several models of aggression and aggressive behavior are discussed, ranging from neurological, ethological, experimental social-psychological, and historical analyses. Distinctions are suggested between two different levels of analysis for examining aggressive behavior-individual-level aggression and systemic-level aggression-and between two primary characteristics of aggression (spontaneous/planned). The limitations of using one level of analysis for examining behavior occurring at a different level are suggested. This proposed conceptual scheme incorporates in a two-dimensional framework approaches as varied as E. 0. Wilson's Sociobiology and J. T. Tedeschi's reinterpretation of research on aggression. The shift from motivational models to more cognitive information-processing models in the social-psychological literature is examined.

Abstract: This study develops the Burns and Stalker (1961) concept of organic structure, in operational terms, applying it to small work groups. A core dimension emerges, called "organicity, " which correlates strongly with the innovativeness of a group's task. The concept and the instruments for its measurement could find applications in studying the relation between individuals and their organizational work roles.

Abstract: Taking the position that member satisfaction is an important outcome of organizational activity, this paper reports a field study of the relationships between a group structural variable (organicity), higher-order need satisfaction, and individual differences in personality traits. Satisfaction is positively associated with organicity. The responses of individuals to group structures higher or lower in organicity are mediated by trait type and trait strength. Organic group structure is a potential "motivator" of people with strong assertive needs.

Title: When Individual Dispositions and Social Pressure Conflict: A Catastrophe
Author-Name: Abraham Tesser
Abstract: When a personal dispositional variable is in conflict with social pressure, the resulting behavior is hypothesized to follow a cusp catastrophe. The catastrophe model allows'for discontinuities and bimodality in behavior. Specifically, when social pressure is low, behavior is expected to be a smooth, monotonic function of disposition. When social pressure is high and disposition is low, behavior will be low; when social pressure is high and disposition is high, relevant behavior will be bimodal-some people engaging in low levels of behavior and some engaging in high levels of behavior. In dynamic terms, shifts in dispositions at high levels of social pressure will result in discontinuous, i.e., "catastrophic" changes in behavior. Increments in social pressure at high levels of disposition will result in divergence, i.e., bimodality.

Title: A Function of Friendship: Social Comparisons as a Frame of Reference for Marriage
Author-Name: Sandra L. Titus
Abstract: This is a descriptive study that examines the perceptions couples have about their interactions with friends and whether these interactions were believed to influence their own marriages. The possible influence of friends on marriage was analyzed in terms of the concept "social comparison." Social comparison is a process whereby people seek out information about other people's responses, feelings, abilities, and expectations and then derive or evaluate their own behavior, goals, feelings, and expectations. In over half of the couples, at least one member of the couple makes comparisons of their own marriage to a friend's marriage. Making a social comparison appears to provide a frame of reference that yields more realistic expectations about marriage.

The competing theoretical models underlying these comparisons are those of cultural diversity and sociology of organizations/convergence. Survey and organizational data from thirty-seven companies in ten industries were analyzed in testing hypotheses concerning differences in work environment, style of supervision, job satisfaction, and attendance. More support was received for a modified convergence argument than for cultural diversity.

Abstract: The effects of social influence, as represented by work-group membership, on perceptions of job dimensions, manifest needs, and job attitudes are examined in a study of 113 engineers. There is evidence for a statistically significant effect of group membership on both needs and job dimensions. In turn, job dimensions, group membership, and job behaviors affect the development of job attitudes. The data provide support for a social information processing approach to analyzing attitudes and other personal constructs in work organizations.

Title: The Experience of Tedium in Life and Work
Author-Name: Ditsa Kafry
Author-Name: Ayala Pines
Abstract: Tedium, the experience of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion, was introduced. It was assumed to stem from chronic daily pressures. Tedium was predicted to be related to: (1) internal features which include pressures inherent in the individual's roles and imposed on the cognitive capacity and the need for meaningfulness and achievement; and (2) external features which include pressures imposed on the individual by the physical, organizational, and social environment. A trilogy of studies designed to develop a tedium measure, to test its reliability and validity, and to study its relationships to internal and external life and work features was presented. It was concluded that tedium is a highly relevant psychological construct, experienced in its extreme form by 6% of the people studied (N = 1187). Tedium was found to be a significant correlate of both internal and external life and work features. The comparison between life and work features showed that the former are more highly related to tedium...

Title: Multinational Corporations and Host Governments' Relationships: Comparative Study of Conflict and Conflicting Issues
Author-Name: Anant R. Negandhi
Abstract: The main purpose of this study was to examine analytically the conflicting issues and causes of conflict between multinational corporations (MNCs) and host governments and MNCs and other publics in six countries (Brazil, India, Malaysia, Peru, Singapore, and Thailand). Though the nature and intensity of conflict was conceptually the central focus of our study, it was intended to serve as a springboard to examine broader intra-and interorganizational practices and behavior of the multinationals. Data for this study were collected through interviews with senior executives of 124 MNCs and governmental officials and other knowledgeable persons in these six countries. Analysis of the data indicates that the ownership or national origin of MNC, the expectational differences between MNCs and host governments, and prevailing market conditions were related to the nature and intensity of conflict between the MNCs and the host governments. Surprisingly, the relative size, level of technology employed, level of diver...

The formal management organizational blueprint for mine and compound is compared with the actual social structure of the mine. The article concludes that the black miner's experience of domination in the South African gold mines is a complex combination of management-ordained authority and personal power on the part of a series of overlapping, sometimes conflicting, sometimes complementary, black fiefdoms; namely those of the Team Leader [boss boy], Personnel Assistant, Induna, and the clerks.

Author-Name: Agnes N. O'Connell
Abstract: Using the California Psychological Inventory, the Inventory of Women's Life Styles, and the Inventory of Women's Role Concept and Attitudes, three separate life-style patterns were delineated for women leading Traditional, Neotraditional, and Nontraditional life styles. These women differed significantly in personality; role concepts; attitudes; choices of college majors and occupations; motivation; quality of employment experiences; parents' life styles; perceptions of husbands' preferred life styles and attitudes toward male/female roles; own and husbands' education; and family size. Influence of parents' life style, the single most potent variable, contributed .64 of the variance to the daughter's choice of life style. Personal and professional variables which remained significant when influence of parents' life style was controlled were attitude towards college training, educational level, and choice of occupation.

Title: Strategies of Dismissal: Ways and Means of Avoiding Personal Abuse
Author-Name: Jon Wagner
Abstract: This paper describes the mechanisms by which individuals "dismiss" or render ineffective the symbolic attacks to which they are subjected. Among the strategies useful to this protection of the self are those which focus on the situation of the attack, the nature of the self, and the nature of the attacker. Characteristic of many of these individual approaches to defense is an underlying concept of the "real self, " a symbolic identity, the manifestation of which the individual can influence, if not control. The implications of this discussion of "dismissal strategies" are threefold: (1) structures of dismissal are differentiated by use and consequence with reference to the characteristic features of social organization; (2) contemporary social problems and the "legitimation crisis" of social welfare institutions can be seen as one expression of dismissal strategies; and (3) the importance of strategies of dismissals to ongoing social life suggests that social order is made possible by selective disengagem...

Author-Name: Barbara Quigley-Fernandez
Abstract: The impact of first impressions, norms, and opponent's use of power on a target's behavior in a conflict situation was investigated. A simulated opponent was perceived as either good and impotent or bad and potent in a mixed motive situation where the rule of interaction was given as a cooperative or competitive one, and the opponent's exercise of unilateral coercive power was either highly credible or not credible. All three factors affected the responses of the subjects. The general principle underlying the results appears to be one of cooperating when first impressions or a salient norm leads to positive expectations for the interaction, but to respond in the most prudent manner possible and according to how the opponent responds when a negative expectation exists for the interaction.

Title: The Effect of Facial Deformity on Petitioning
Author-Name: William C. Shaw
Author-Name: Simone Humphreys
Author-Name: Judith M. McLoughlin,
Author-Name: Peter C. Shimmin
Abstract: In a natural setting, the influence of facial deformity on the response to a petition request was investigated. Seventy-two hundred adult members of the general public were confronted by four Actors who presented themselves normally for one-half of the experiment and exhibited a facial de-formity (burn scar, birthmark or protruding teeth) for the other half. The experiment was designed in order that the influence offacial appearance (4) x sex of Actor (2) x sex of passerby (2) x strength of petition (2) could be examined. Although the results confirm that the petition model is sensitive to variables of interpersonal perception, the principal finding was the non-effect of facial deformity with regard to the number of evasions, signings, and refusals obtained. It is suggested that aversion to the deformed petitioner may be tempered by other reactions such as curiosity and sympathy.

Author-Name: Traudl Füchsle
Abstract: This experiment concerned the generality of the discussion-induced shift toward pessimism found in some previous studies but not found in others. Male university students (N = 95) were presented with one of two fictitious situations in which a protagonist wanted to gain compliance from another person (an employee wants a promotion; a parent wants his child to study more). For each of 16 compliance-gaining behaviors (e.g., promise, warning, invocation of need) the subjects had to indicate, on a 7-point scale, the likelihood that the protagonist would be successful ("objective response mode') or they had to indicate how well they personally could perform the respective influencing behavior ("subjective response mode'). All subjects first made a success-expectancy estimate. In the group condition (24 triads) participants discussed the judgmental issue and then again made a private estimate on each of the 16 items in turn. For the subjects in the control condition (N = 23) group discussion was replaced by fur...

Title: Contingency Severity and Individual Performance in a Probabilistic Game Setting
Author-Name: Shiori Sakamoto
Abstract: Contingency Severity, a construct which describes the impact of environmental and system variables upon individuals, is operationally defined in this study. The measure of Contingency Severity employed was Raynolds' difference score, R, calculated between nonverbal Projective Differential and verbal Semantic Differential data. A probabilistic game was devised to permit relatively precise control over the predictability of a relevant environment. The principal game parameters-"predictability" and "eucity/noxity of feedback "-were distinct in three versions of the game. A repeated measures, balanced Latin Squares design was used to control for differences in game situations, order of play, and decision style. Nonparametric analyses supported the hypotheses that (1) Raynolds' measure of Contingency Severity, R, did vary inversely with performance; (2) performance was positively related to the game's objective degree of situation predictability; and (3) R did vary inversely with and could be explained by situ...

Title: Problem Solving, Planning, and Innovation. Part I. Test of the Program Planning Model
Author-Name: Andrew H. Van de Ven
Abstract: This longitudinal research compares the Program Planning Model (PPM) with a conventional (non-PPM) planning model in the context of creating 14 new child care programs in local Texas communities. The programs planned according to the PPM are found to have more efficient services and greater community acceptance during their first year of implementation than the programs that were developed with the conventional planning process. Due to the absence of random assignments, it is not demonstrated that these results are due to planning processes alone. However, evidence is presented that suggests the PPM projects outperformed the non-PPM projects because implementation success correlates with five key dimensions of planning behavior. Implementation success increases with: (1) participation of citizens, experts, and community interest groups; (2) involvement of a policy board representing partisan interests; (3) greater and more equal distribution of planning team effort; (4) process consultation in early plann...

Title: Between Service and Servility: Role Conflict in Subordinate Service Roles
Author-Name: Boas Shamir
Abstract: The concept Subordinate Service Roles (SSRs) is introduced to denote organizational boundary roles in which an organization member performs direct service to a nonmember whose status is higher than that of the service giver. The relative inattention of Industrial/Organizational Psychology and Organizational Sociology to such roles is pointed out. Various types of role conflict in SSRs are discussed. Some factors affecting the level of conflict in SSRs are proposed, and typical responses of SSRs occupants to role conflict are presented and illustrated. The discussion is based on a review of the literature and on critical incidents of service collected from service givers and clients in two areas: hotels and public transport in Israel.

Author-Name: Andrew H. Van de Ven
Abstract: This paper argues that the Program Planning Model (PPM) provides a normative strategy of collective action for coping with complex problems. The argument is based on seven propositions which explain how the PPM guides complex problem solving in turbulent settings and avoids several basic limitations of alternative models of collfctive problem solving and decision making. The propositions represent new insights and speculative impressions that developed while conducting and reflecting on the longitudinal test of the PPM described in Part I of this paper (Van de Ven, 1980).

Title: Dyadic Bargaining Outcomes Under Individualistic and Competitive Orientations

Abstract: Using forty-eight manufacturing managers as subjects, this experiment tested the outcomes of bargaining sessions held under all the possible combinations of two subject orientations (individualistic and competitive) and four conditions of communication (oral and written in face-to-face and remote situations). The results failed to show any significant main effects of orientation or communication on outcomes or bargaining times, but did show a significant interaction between orientation and remote vs. face-to-face bargaining. Under remote conditions a competitive orientation yielded slightly greater joint outcomes, but, under face-to-face conditions, an individualistic orientation yielded markedly greater joint outcomes. There was a correlation between outcomes and some measures of communication, but the pattern of the experimental effects on communication was not congruent with the pattern of effects on outcome. The findings imply that some visual signals interfere with bargaining under competitive, face-...

Title: Interpersonal Trust: A Comparison of Attitudinal and Situational Factors
Author-Name: Cuthbert L. Scott, III
Abstract: Three existing models of interpersonal trust are tested: (1) attitudinal, (2) situational, and (3) combined. Forty-four subjects were divided into five test groups and a control group. Interpersonal trust scores collected before and after a trust-building t group were analyzed by two-way ANO VA and F ratio. There was a significant increase in trust, measured by t test, in all test groups (p < .05), but no significant change in the control group. The ANO VA findings confirmed the existence of both attitudinal and situationalfactors present in interpersonal trust scores (p < .001) in all test groups. The F ratio demonstrated the situationalfactor as more important in explaining variations in interpersonal trust scores both before and after training (p < .01). Implications of these findings are discussed for traditional attitude theory and more recent contingency (situational) theory.

Title: Performance-Contingent Rewards and Satisfaction: An Initial Analysis
Author-Name: Nina Gupta
Abstract: This study argues that a positive relationship will exist between employee satisfaction and performance-contingent intrinsic rewards and pay. A rationale is offered for expecting this relationship, and an empirical examination conducted among 649 employees of 5 Midwestern organizations. Consistent relationships were found to exist between the two sets of variables, even when the effects of actual reward level were partialled out. Results were, however, inconsistent with predictions regarding the interactions of performance-contingent rewards with (a) locus of control, (b) equity, and (c) tolerance of ambiguity. Some implications of these results are discussed.

Title: Targeting and the Humorous Episode in Group Process
Author-Name: Forrest R. Scogin, Jr.
Author-Name: Howard R. Pollio
Abstract: The present experiment concerned an evaluation of the number, nature, and pattern of targeted and nontargeted humorous remarks produced by individuals in six different group settings. Results indicated that humorous targeting occurred in about two-thirds of the cases except for short-term problem-solving groups where only 36%l'o of humorous remarks were directed. For all six groups, however, the ratio of appreciative to deprecating targeted remarks was about 2:1 or 3:1. Humorous remarks often occurred in episodes of from two to five remarks, with enduring groups producing more and longer episodes. Single item and more extended episodes contained a greater number of appreciative and neutral remarks while episodes of intermediate length contained more deprecating remarks. For groups in which cross-person targeting was evaluated, there was a reasonably strong correlation between targeting and being targeted by others. Present results were interpreted to suggest that the meaning and function of a humorous eve...

Title: The Causation of Strikes: A Review of Theoretical Approaches and the Potential Contribution of Social Psychology
Author-Name: John E. Kelly
Author-Name: Nigel Nicholson
Abstract: This paper reviews four approaches to the study of strikes, centered on organizational environments, industrial relations institutions, collective interests and consciousness, and approaches from within psychology which have looked at employee needs, or attitudes, in relation to job dissatisfaction, and hence industrial conflict. Despite their identification of salient features of strike causation, none of these approaches has drawn on insights from social psychology, and all have focused on strike causes to the virtual exclusion of strike processes. The paper proceeds to analyze significant dimensions of strike processes, viz. industrial relations climate; the distinctions between triggers, issues, and demands; strike content and context; and transitional and final strike outputs. These and other features are combined into an integrated model supported by evidence from the strikes literature.

Title: The Evaluation of Work Organization Change
Author-Name: C. A. Carnall
Abstract: In this paper we argue that evaluation is a social activity, and as a consequence we must take account of different frames of reference in evaluation. Following a review of the organizational effectiveness literature a new approach to evaluation based upon the notion of exchange is proposed. This approach is used to analyze the results of two case studies. We conclude that the approach allows us to develop an understanding of the results of work organization change but that it remains provisional in form and requires further elaboration.

Abstract: Upward communication in industry means sending information up the chain of command. This laboratory experiment tested three factors thought to affect the passing and distorting of upward-bound communications in two industrial organizations. Independent variables were job situation (problem or routine), trust in the immediate superior, and personal ambition. Multiple regression analysis produced statistical significance regarding distortion but not transmission of written messages.

Abstract: A community survey which involved 771 rural/urban respondents in Nigeria was undertaken in order to investigate the knowledge and opinion about descriptions which are prototypic of mentally ill persons. This report focuses on the relationship between levels of education and opinion as well as tolerance of the respondents for persons who might fit the descriptions. The findings indicate that substantial proportions among the literate and nonliterate are unable to associate the descriptions with mental illness.

Title: The Development of Professional Role Commitment Among Graduate Students
Author-Name: Carin S. Weiss
Abstract: This paper focuses on one aspect of the socialization process in graduate and professional schools. Specifically, it examines salient aspects of the socialization experience fostering or inhibiting the development of professional role commitment. The study is based on two indices of professional role commitment, a productivity index and a self-concept index. The results suggest that the frequency and nature of contact with faculty members is significantly related to the amount of professional role commitment. Surprisingly, contact with graduate students in one's discipline does not affect a student's level of professional role commitment. The length of time in graduate school, academic discipline, and prestige of the institution do not alter the relationships suggested. Furthermore, the relationships reported remain and some additional findings are suggested when the influence of sex is examined.

Title: Perception of an Aggressor and His Victim in Relation to Age and Retaliation

Abstract: Evaluation of an aggressor and a victim of aggression was obtained in two separate studies in both of which a small paragraph describing an instance of aggression and its consequence was read by subjects who were college students in Bombay. In the first study, which had a 2 (sex of subject) X 2 (age of aggressor) X 2 (age of victim) X 2 (retaliation versus nonretaliation by victim) factorial design, with 21 subjects per cell, the victim was rated on intelligence, morality, adjustment, and likeability. The second study had exactly the same design and procedure except that it was the aggressor, instead of the victim, that was rated by the subjects, 20 per cell. The nonretaliating victim was evaluated more positively than the retaliating victim and the aggressor received a more negative evaluation, in some conditions, with the nonretaliating rather than retaliating victim. The younger victim was evaluated more negatively with the older rather than younger aggressor and the younger aggressor received a more n...

This paper suggests that a framework for organizing the recent research may assist in consolidating the field and providing an understanding of where we are, what is left to be done and, therefore, direction for future role conflict and ambiguity research.

Title: Personality and Task Moderators of Subordinate Responses to Perceived Leader Behavior
Author-Name: Ahmed A. Abdel-Halim
Abstract: This study examines the moderating effects of two task variables-role ambiguity and job complexity-and subordinate locus of control on the relationship of leader initiating structure and consideration to subordinate intrinsic satisfaction and job involvement. Data were collected from a sample of 89 middle-lower level managers of a large, heavy-equipment manufacturing firm in the Midwest. Moderated regression analysis was performed on the data. Significant interactions were obtained between leader consideration and each of role ambiguity, job complexity, and locus of control. Leader initiating structure has a significant interaction with locus of control, but the direction is opposite that predicted. Implications of the findings for the path-goal theory of leadership, future research, and leadertask design match are discussed.

Abstract: Current theories of social comparison processes deriving from Festinger lack predictive validity largely because the central construct (social comparison) has been left undefined. This paper offers a definition of social comparison which implies that people can compare their abilities in numerous different ways. An experiment is described which varied interpersonal similarity in ability and measured three forms of ability comparison-competition, cooperation, and conformity. Both competition and cooperation were found to vary as a function of interpersonal similarity. Some suggestions are tendered for a reformulated theory of social comparison processes.

Title: The Double Bind and Social Change in Communal Amana
Author-Name: Jonathan G. Andelson
Abstract: The sectarian Amana Society of Iowa existed for 89 years as a communal enterprise. In 1932, for a combination of reasons, the Society abandoned communalism and reorganized as a joint-stock corporation. The reasons for the change are discussed in terms of double-bind theory. It is argued that all members faced a conflict between the demands of the sect's plan for salvation and the group's economic dependence on external markets. In addition, the elders experienced a second bind between preserving the community and upholding its rules. The stresses in the Society were resolved through reorganization.

Title: Towards a Bilateral Model of Sexism
Author-Name: Betty J. Collier
Author-Name: Louis N. Williams
Abstract: Since the mid-sixties, a large body of literature has emerged in this country in the area of women's studies. Although such literature exemplifies considerable diversity relative to methods and contention, several paradigmatic assumptions unify the majority of existing literature: (1) the concept that women both in America and elsewhere have been consistently and comprehensively exploited; (2) the notion that men are both the source and the beneficiary of the exploitation of women; (3) the assumption that the liberation of females from sexist exploitation will have, as a byproduct, a liberatory effects upon males' lives; and (4) a primary focus upon the means by which the effects of sexual role models upon the female personality can be resolved. Such assumptions are asserted to pervade contemporary research on the phenomenon of sexism as to constitute a unilateral social conflict model of the phenomenon. This paper introduces a bilateral psychosocial conflict model of sexism which (1) traces the mechanism...

Abstract: The paper reports a study carried out in South Wales to further evaluate one of the more specific propositions derivedfrom the generalframework of the structural contingency theory of organizations. This relates the extent of centralization of decision-making in an organization to organizational effectiveness under different conditions of market competition. Both behavioral and financial measures of effectiveness are examined. The results obtained differ substantially from those obtained in previous studies carried out in India and Mexico. While it is accepted that such differences could be due to variations in cultural and economic conditions it is suggested that they may indicate significant weaknesses in contingency theory as it is presently stated.

Author-Name: William Burgos
Author-Name: James Schmeidler
Abstract: Reflecting the need to construct more inclusive, socially and culturally relevant conceptions of drug use than currently exist, this paper investigates the determinants of drug involvement among inner-city youths within the context of a causal model. The drug involvement of the Black and Puerto Rican junior high school girls and boys studied is hypothesized to result from their home composition, felt relationships with parents, attitudes toward school, machismo values, and identification with drug involved peers. The results show few socialization into drug-use differences to exist between the Puerto Rican and Black youths surveyed. However, the girls' drug use is somewhat better explained by the intrapersonal and interpersonal socialization variables in the model than that of the boys. At the same time, the socialization variables examined have limited predictive power in regard to the drug involvement of the four groups (R2s from .177 to .220). Peer-oriented attitudes and behavior that more closely refl...

Title: The Effects of Disagreement on the Continuation of an Interpersonal Relationship
Author-Name: Jan Yoder
Abstract: A laboratory procedure for developing a positive relationship between strangers is introduced for the purpose of examining the effects of a cost, in the form of a disagreement, on the continuation of that relationship. It is hypothesized that after a disagreement subjects will select fewer and less intimate topics to discuss with their partner and speak for a shorter duration than subjects who agree. Furthermore, subjects disagreeing on an intimate issue will withdraw more than subjects disagreeing on a superficial issue. Sixty female undergraduates and a female confederate exchanged information about themselves over eight trials that became increasingly intimate. The confederate then agreed or disagreed with the subject on a superficial or intimate issue. The subject again selected topics to discuss with the confederate. Disagreeing subjects selected significantly fewer topics than did agreeing subjects. No other significant effects were found.

Title: Adaptation, Survival, and Growth of the Family Business: An Integrated Systems Perspective
Author-Name: Peter Davis
Author-Name: Douglas Stern
Abstract: Family ownership and control are still significant in the majority of business enterprises in the United States. A high percentage of these companies face special problems particularly related to corporate development and transition from an enterpreneurial to a professional management structure. The dual criteria for corporate membership (family and professional competence) require special management efforts. Without these efforts, organizational rigidities develop which undermine the corporation's ability to function effectively. While the relevance of the interaction between family relationships and the working environment of organizational effectiveness has been recognized, family systems and organization approaches have never been simultaneously applied in the study of family-dominated businesses. In this paper we develop a scheme that is derived from principles of organizational and family-systems theory. We describe a set of processes and mechanisms that define and regulate the interaction between t...

Abstract: This study investigated the influence of individual differences in attributional tendencies on the perception of a rape victim's causal role in her own vicitmization. Respondents'general tendency to attribute cause of events in another person's life to either personal, internal reasons or external, environmental ones was assessed, as were their attitudes to a variety of items on the subject of rape. Factor analysis of the rape questionnaire produced four factors: victim precipitation-responsibility, negative evaluation, sexual motivation, and power motivation. With the victim precipitation-responsibility factor serving as a measure of attributed responsibility, a factorial design was created with sex of subject and attributional propensity serving as independent measures. Males perceived significantly greater precipitation-responsibility on the part of a rape victim than did female respondents. There was also a significant overall trend for attributional orientation with "personals" indicating greater vic...

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between the invasion of personal space and stress in an interview situation. Fifty-three subjects were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions. The first condition served as a control group in which no spatial manipulation was made. In condition two, the interviewer (experimental confederate) unobtrusively moved toward the subject (interviewee) approximately one-third of the way through the interview. The third condition involved invasions at one-third and again at two-thirds of the way through the interview. From video-tapes made of each inteview, trained raters assessed the subjects' stress using a ratio-scaled direct observational measurement procedure. Paralleling the findings of previous research, the results of this study provide evidence demonstrating that spatial invasions are stress producing.

Abstract: First-time encounters pose a number of difficulties for participants. Then subsequent analysis is also problematic. The view is taken here that in order to understand the dynamics of the situation and its subsequent development it is necessary to focus on the various aspects of role imputation and its expressive counterparts of altercasting, role modification, presentation of self, and fantasy. These are applied to tourist-beachboy encounters in the Barbadian context of an overriding framework of Third World dependency on the metropolis. The ensuring relationships are characterized by qualities of assymetry, difference and mixed exchange. It is hoped that by investigating an extreme case of role disparity in terms of class, sex, race, and cultural differences a greater appreciation can be obtained of encounters with which we are more familiar.

Title: Teacher Education as a Framework for Reducing Authoritarianism
Author-Name: Nathir G. Sara
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a special program on the level of authoritarianism of subjects with high scores on the California F scale. The subjects were graduate students of education, mostly from developing countries. The design called for measuring gain in two equivalent groups one of which received a specially constructed counter-authoritarian treatment while the other was used as a control group. The method of pooling variances was used for data processing, and the results showed a significant reduction in post-test F scores in the experimental group. While the findings demonstrate feasibility of introducing counter-authoritarian influences into teacher training programs, certain issues are raised and discussed, especially in regarding to permanence of such changes as those obtained in this experiment, and the need for support elements in the teaching environment for the purpose of reinforcement.

Title: Scapegoating in Small Groups: An Organizational Approach
Author-Name: Jeffrey Eagle
Author-Name: Peter M. Newton
Abstract: We present findings from a videotape study of naturally occurring scapegoating incidents in a Tavistock Group Relations Training Conference. Videotape recordings of three successive sessions from each of four study groups revealed nine scapegoating incidents. We offer an empirical description of the incidents together with a sociopsychological theoretical analysis. Aspects of the tasks, social structure, and culture of the group-relations training conference as a temporary organization led to a reliance upon the projective identification of work difficulties into individuals who were then scapegoated. We identify the phenomenon of task displacement in which groups whose task performance is inherently hard to measure unwittingly shift their emphasis from achievement to conformity. This may be a general phenomenon in HEW-type organizations of which the group-relations training conference is one.

Title: Encounter Groups: Positive Change or Deterioration? More Data and a Partial Replication
Author-Name: Carl A. Bramlette
Author-Name: Jeffrey H. Tucker
Abstract: Several recent articles have concluded that 8% to 10% of participants in encounter groups can be classified as casualties and up to 50% reap a negative benefit. However, these articles investigate negative benefit. Using the Lieberman, Yalom, and Miles criteria of two peer nominations or a self-nomination for identifying a participant's experience, 10% of 327 participants in 39 trainerless T groups were classified as negatively affected and 54% as positively affected. Of the 10% classified as having a negative experience, 7% were also classified as having had a positive experience, leaving only 3% with solely a negative experience. It may be that some discomfort is inherent in the growth process. Future research on encounter groups might investigate the positive as well as the negative aspects and how these experiences aid in overall growth.

Abstract: Exploitation is as old as our knowledge of society and recurs continually in almost every social organization that we know, while cooperation is less common, more private, and continually breaking down. The authors are interested in routes that small groups discover for running against this exploitative current of history. The ordinary danger in new small groups is that divergent interests will be neither recognized nor balanced. Members will have contradictory plans for the use of the group situation, often unconscious, which are managed by ignoring or negating one or both parties. The authors have found, however, that groups are also capable of unconcious collective planning to handle these collisions. They describe five major principles of unconscious group planning, illustrate these principles in the narratives of two contrasting small groups, and compare this new theory with the classical perspectives on small-group dynamics.

Title: A New Look at Job Satisfaction in the Small Firm
Author-Name: James Curran
Author-Name: John Stanworth
Abstract: The widely accepted view that job satisfaction is higher among workers in small firms than their large-firm counterparts, especially in terms of non-monetary and expressive aspects of work, is critically examined. Workers employed in small and large firms in the printing and electronics industries were surveyed using a semistructured interview strategy. Job satisfaction was related to work environment and also nonwork influences such as family life-cycle position. The findings show that when such factors as the specific characteristics of the industry and age and marital status of respondents are taken into account, size of firm is not, in itself, an important factor in explaining differences in levels of job satisfaction. It merely interacts with these other influences, sometimes to raise and sometimes to lower, perceived levels of satisfaction.

Title: An Assessment of the Deemed Appropriateness of Participative Decision Making for High and Low Hierarchical Levels
Author-Name: Arthur G. Jago
Abstract: Addressing questions concerning the dependence of leadership style on hierarchical position, this investigation employs an instrument offering greater internal validity than similar instruments used in previous research. Middle-level managers from three organizations (N = 167) were asked to indicate the degree of subordinate involvement they would permit in hypothetical decision situations occurring at different hierarchical levels. For that subset of problems for which selection of high-quality solution was required (i.e., problems possessing a quality requirement), the degree of participation deemed appropriate for low-level situations did not differ significantly from the degree of participation deemed appropriate for high-level situations. However, for the subset of problems for which all possible alternatives were equally suitable (i.e., problems lacking a quality requirement), substantially greater participation was judged appropriate for low-level situations than for otherwise comparable high-level...

Title: A Longitudinal Study of the Distribution of Control in Yugoslav Organizations
Author-Name: Bogdan Kavčič
Author-Name: Arnold S. Tannenbaum
Abstract: The legal system of workers' self-management in Yugoslavia provides to all of the employees of each enterprise ultimate authority over basic policy, personnel, and technical issues of the firm. This study explores the "actual" and the "ideal" distribution of control in Yugoslav industrial organizations as reported by members during a five-year period, from 1969 through 1973. The data are based on questions administered at yearly intervals (excepting one year) to a probability sample of more than 3,000 persons in 100 organizations. Because important legal changes in the direction of greater participation in the governance of Yugoslav organizations were introduced immediately prior to and during this period, we expected to find some change in the distribution of control during the five years of the study. The data fit a pattern that has been found in other countries, thus illustrating principles that may transcend culture and political system. The data also differ in degree from those of other places thus a...

Title: Job Involvement of Intrinsically and Extrinsically Motivated Indian Managers: To Each According to His Need
Author-Name: Sasi Misra
Author-Name: Amar Kalro
Abstract: This study tests the notion that the attitude of job involvement is a function of the degree of satisfaction with one's salient needs, be they intrinsic or extrinsic. Data from 33 primarily intrinsically motivated and 43 primarily extrinsically motivated managers, selected from a sample of 215 Indian managers, were analyzed to test two hypotheses: (1) the attitude of job involvement will be positively correlated with the satisfaction of salient needs only; and (2) both intrinsically and extrinsically motivated managers will be equally job involved provided their salient needs are met and more job involved than those whose salient needs are not met. Hypothesis 1 was supported. Due to meager data only partial support for hypothesis 2 was obtained. Implications for job designs to promote employee involvement are discussed.

Title: Ethno-Cultural Identity and Self-Esteem: A Reapplication of Self-Attitude Formation Theories
Author-Name: Ralph Alan Rovner
Abstract: Traditional application of self-attitude formation theories to members of ethnocultural minority groups has postulated that they will internalize the dominant social group's negative evaluations of them and thus suffer from low self-esteem. Therefore, members of ethnocultural minority groups have been said to be in need of interventions designed to increase their self-esteem through enhancement of their ethnic identity. However, empirical findings fail to support the proposition that ethnocultural minority group members in general suffer from low self-esteem. It is suggested that these empirical findings are entirely consistent with self-attitude formation theories and that those theories actually predict that only a specific subset of ethnocultural minority group members will tend to internalize negative evaluations from out-groups. That subset consists of those ethnocultural minority group members who are immersed in a dissonant ethnocultural context. Conclusions are drawn about the appropriate role whi...

Title: The Way of the Warrior: The Effects of Traditional Martial Arts Training on Aggressiveness
Author-Name: T. A. Nosanchuk
Abstract: This study examines aggressive fantasy of students in traditional karate dojos. These data are of both theoretical and humanistic interest. The theoretical interest derives from the conventional wisdom that perceives such training as leading to a decrease in aggressiveness, in contrast to current theory which would expect such training to increase aggressiveness. Such an inquiry is of humanistic interest because it offers practitioners of nonviolence the option of acquiring defensive competences without at the same time becoming more aggressive. Interviews with 42 students at various belt levels found that longer training is associated with lower aggressiveness, in contrast to the theoretical predictions. Four plausible mechanisms of such a change were examined: self-control, self-assertiveness, self-esteem, and self-confidence. None of these was found to qualify as an intervening variable, though one subscale of self-assertiveness, "constructiveness," was found, like training, to be associated with lower...

Title: Holocaust as Public Policy: The Third Reich
Author-Name: Donald J. Dietrich
Abstract: Genocide as public policy appears directly connected to the maintenance of the nation-state, but the Holocaust is a specifically German phenomenon. The Nazis defined the Jews as nonhuman and proceeded in their highly industrialized state to liquidate nearly this entire group. The features relevant to the German case are: an extended history of anti Semitism, an extremely stressful situation during the Weimar years, resulting in increased aggression coupled with a documented virulent prejudice, and, finally, the metamorphosis of the state founded on legally defined rights and duties into a state based upon Hitler's personal will. Psychological and bureaucratic dynamics served as the foundation for this transition.

Title: Overall Job Satisfaction: Is It a Linear Function of Facet Satisfaction?
Author-Name: Thomas W. Ferratt
Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between overall job satisfaction and satisfaction with various job facets. Linear and nonlinear models for combining facets are examined. The results provide marginal support for an hypothesis that overall job satisfaction is a linear function of satisfaction with various job facets. Specifically, satisfaction with job facets explains 50%-60%o of overall job satisfaction based on a linear combination of facet satisfactions. The results also indicate that facetbased instruments used individually are not sufficient measures of overall job satisfaction. When facets from multiple facet-based instruments are combined, a marginally sufficient measure is obtained.

Title: An Application of Turquet's Basic-Assumption Oneness to the Analysis of a Group in Search of Utopia
Author-Name: Susan D. McMillan
Abstract: This article examines Turquet's basic-assumption oneness as it applies to the large group setting. Oneness is seen as a group myth serving the major function of avoiding membership schisms, and allows members to avoid the anxiety attendant upon the identity problems that emerge in a large group. One particular group is examined. Here a myth of oneness is supported by the members' institutionalized assumption that they cannot arrive at wrong, bad, or unwise decisions. The unity provided by the myth enables the group to pursue a course that members believe will lead to a utopian society. The myth however prevents members from acting in an independent manner and from examining their beliefs. The dynamics of one particular group session are examined in detail.

Title: Effects of an Organizational Control System on Managerial Satisfaction and Performance
Author-Name: John C. Anderson
Author-Name: Charles A. O'Reilly, III
Abstract: Previous research on goal setting and feedback is placed in the context of an organizational control system model. Using a sample of 100 managers, the independent impacts of three components of a control system (goal setting, measurement, and corrective actions) on managerial satisfaction and performance are examined. Results show that aspects of each of the three model components are independently related to performance but not to satisfaction. Respondents' perceptions of top management's support for the performance-appraisal system, a factor not considered in most research on feedback and goal setting, emerges as an important correlate of high performance.

Title: Technology as a Moderator of the Relationship Between Perceived Work Environment and Subunit Effectiveness
Author-Name: R. Dennis Middlemist
Author-Name: Michael A. Hitt
Abstract: The present study examined the role of technological complexity as a moderator in the relationship between perceived work environment and subunit effectiveness. Empirically derived subunit effectiveness scores, subunit technology scores, and aggregated subunit employee perceptions of their work environment were used to test the research hypothesis. Moderated regression analysis suggested that technology does operate as a moderating variable. The addition of technology increases the explanation in the variance of subunit effectiveness over the use of work environment factors alone as predictors. Furthermore, the analysis showed that perceived work environments associated with effectiveness vary between technological groupings of subunits. Since such variation in effective work environments was found, it suggests that organization development programs should be multifaceted and based on substantial research in the organization to determine appropriate work environments in the various subunits.

Title: Conversation and Social Exchange: Managing Identities in Old Age
Author-Name: James J. Dowd
Abstract: It has been argued previously that, due to industrial development and the related ideology of modernity, old people in contemporary society are less able to negotiate favorable or, even, equitable exchange rates. This structural analysis, however, leaves unanswered important issues concerning the "working out" of the terms of the exchange agreement. The focus of this paper is the negotiation and maintenance of exchange relationships. How, for example, does the individual old person and his or her exchange partner(s) decide such issues as the relative "social worth" of the partners, the resources each possesses and is willing to exchange, the value of the resources to be exchanged, or the rate at which resources are to be exchanged. While such terms may occasionally be submitted in written form for the approval of each partner, in most cases such issues are resolved in a much more informal manner. Approval or consent to an exchange agreement is generally reached through a process of informal negotiation wh...

Title: The Coch and French Study: A Critique and Reinterpretation
Author-Name: Carleton S. Bartlem
Author-Name: Edwin A. Locke
Abstract: Coch and French's interpretation of their classic (1948) study of worker participation in decision-making is questioned. It is argued that the superiority of the combined experimental groups to the control group could have been due to differences in: the way in which the job changes were explained; the manner in which the time studies were conducted; and/or the amount of additional training given. Similarly, the superiority of experimental Groups II and III to Group I could have been an artifact of differences in the amount of work available, or of differences in group size. In addition, the failure to find a difference within Group I between direct and indirect participants would seem to argue against a participation interpretation of the findings. It is suggested that the perceived fairness of the pay rates was probably the key factor in this and in some similar studies. The wider issue involved may have been organizational trust.

Results failed to replicate the finding in a 1974 national sample that position and job satisfaction are significantly associated when occupational prestige, income, and age are controlled. The importance of replicating large survey results across independent samples is emphasized.

Title: Direct, Indirect, and Trace Effects of Personality Variables on Role Adjustment
Author-Name: Dennis W. Organ
Abstract: A three-month study examined the effects of personality on role adjustment processes among 102 entering MBA students. Path analysis showed that indirect effects, and the concept of trace effects, of initially measured neuroticism and external locus of control accounted for more variance in later role ambiguity and role-related stress than did a major source of environmental variation. One of the important indirect effects was the path from initial role ambiguity to initial emotional stress to subsequent role ambiguity. However, specific behaviors identified as instrumental to role definition were not predictable from personality variables, raising the possibility that personality effects on role adjustment may be mediated more by cognitive rather than overt behavioral processes.

Title: Defectors, Vulnerability, and Relative Power: Some Causes and Effects of Leaving a Stable Coalition
Author-Name: J. Keith Murnighan
Abstract: This study explored the causes and effects of defecting from a stable coalition. Vulnerability and the relative power of the defectors were the primary independent variables. Results showed that defectors were obtaining higher payoffs than nondefectors prior to their defection. Defection from stable coalitions in the four coalition games studied here led to reduced benefits for both the defectors and the nondefectors. At the same time defectors fared better than nondefectors, with vulnerability reducing the defectors' benefits. Relative power, over all conditions, led to significantly more positive outcomes than relative equality or weakness. The data also suggested that vulnerable defectors may fare more poorly than their nondefecting partners. The use of coalitions as models of a variety of interactions and the social contexts that facilitate or block defections are also discussed.

Title: The Means and End of Work
Author-Name: Neal Q. Herrick
Abstract: This paper offers a teleological perspective on efforts to improve the quality of working life. Our view of working arrangements and what they "should" be is often confused by contradictory ideas of "what we are pursuing" when we seek to alter the present arrangements. At the enterprise level, there is disagreement among the workplace interest groups (e.g., supervisors, the top manager, local-wide union officers, rank-and-file workers, middle managers, etc.) on which are the means and what is the end of work. There is less disagreement at the societal level about what constitutes the "bottom line": in general, there is an implicit acceptance of the view that the end of work is economic. The schemata presented here recognizes the economic value of work, but only as one means toward a higher end: human well-being.

Title: Verbal Aggressiveness in Spectators at Professional Hockey Games: The Effects of Tolerance of Violence and Amount of Exposure to Hockey
Author-Name: W. Andrew Harrell
Abstract: Cross sections of male spectators (N = 391) at 14 professional hockey games were interviewed prior to the game and after the first and second periods. Subjects who were tolerant of violence in hockey showed signifi-cantly higher levels of irritability on the Buss-Durkee inventory of verbal aggressiveness than did subjects who were intolerant of violence. Subjects tolerant of violence were also angrier over the prospect of their favorite team losing. Over the course of the game, subjects who were both tolerant of violence and frequently exposed to hockey showed a significant increase in verbal hostility on the Buss-Durkee inventory. Subjects who were fre-quently exposed to hockey but who were intolerant of violence showed a reduction in hostility. This differential effect is explained in terms of the motives these two groups of spectators may have for attending hockey games.

Besides the moderating effect of a number of contingency variables on the relation between participation and outcome variables is researched. The results lead to questioning the usefulness of a contingency model in research on the effects of participation.

Title: Toward the Anthropological Study of Cognitive Performance
Author-Name: Robert A. Rubinstein
Abstract: This paper examines the logical and empirical basis for cognitive analysis in anthropology. A review of the assumptions that cognitive anthropology makes about the nature of human cognition and behavior is followed by a critical discussion focusing on four problems: (1) the psychological reality of analyses, (2) the competence versus performance dichotomy, (3) the sharedness of cognitive systems, and (4) explanatory perspective in cognitive anthropology. This discussion concludes that as presently constituted, cognitive anthropology does not take us toward the goal of producing an adequate account of cognitive performance. Evolutionary structuralism, which appears to be a viable approach toward this goal is outlined, its major points are discussed, and its implications for continued research are elaborated.

Abstract: In the past 15 years there has been a growing interest in the Tavistock group relations approach to group and organizational behavior. To begin to ex-amine and evaluate the current status of training and education in Tavistock group relations work in America, this paper describes one comprehensive group relations training program. We then describe four critical character-istics that affect the learning environment in group relations training pro-grams: the person, role, the capacity to accept ambiguity, and the oppor-tunity to integrate learning. These factors are discussed in relationship to the goals of group relations training and methodological implications for group relations training and education.

Title: The Task Field Model Of Organization Analysis and Design
Author-Name: Johannes U. Stoelwinder
Author-Name: Martin P. Charns
Abstract: Although complex organizations have multiple goals and many times these cannot be prioritized, no framework of organization design explicitly ac-knowledges these facts or handles the inherent organization design con-flicts. The task field model of organization proposed in this paper provides a framework for handling the multiple goals and their associated organi-zational requirements. It can be used in organization analysis, design, and change programs. To demonstrate its use in a difficult design problem, the model is applied in this paper to analysis of a teaching hospital.

Title: Innovations in Organizations: Appropriateness of Perspectives From Small Group Studies for Strategy Formulation
Author-Name: Richard J. Butler
Abstract: Some dimensions of innovations appropriate to processes have been closely examined in the small group, mainly experimental, literature for the purpose of illuminating the process of innovation in organizations. The processes selected are learning, communication, deviance, risk taking, creativity and brainstorming, leadership, and cohesiveness. It is argued that small group processes can offer much to the understanding of organi-zational processes, for example, innovation and strategy formulation.

Title: Psychological Sense of Community: Measurement and Application
Author-Name: Thomas J. Glynn
Abstract: The development and testing of an instrument designed to measure '"psy-chological sense of community" (PSC) is described. A discussion of the historical background of the PSC concept is presented and results of the use of the instrument in three U.S. and Israeli communities are described. Specific attention is given to the relationship of PSC and the variables of community satisfaction and competence as well as to applications of the PSC instrument. Since results suggest that certain manipulable variables may be associated with PSC, and that PSC itself may have the properties of a construct, suggestions for further research, and the potential im-portance of PSC for community development and maintenance are given.

Title: Contextual Factors in the Selection of Strategic Decision Methods
Author-Name: Jorge Stein
Abstract: The approach followed by top managers when dealing with strategic decisions is shown to be related to contextual conditions. Three areas of potential influence on the determination of the decision method are studied: (1) the organizational environment; (2) the nature of the specific problem; and (3) the leadership style. Knowledge about the first two areas allows a significant improvement in the ability to predict the use of a decision approach, while the dimensions chosen to represent leadership style do not seem to have an important influence on the selection of a method.

Title: A Lognormal Model for Divorce by Marriage Cohort
Author-Name: G. K. Agrafiotis
Abstract: In this paper a model to predict the cumulative divorce trajectory of marriage cohorts has been developed on the assumption that the distribution of the lengths of exposure to marriage of a marriage cohort is lognormal. It is found that on the basis of recently published data the model provides a good fit to cohort divorce trajectories and compares favorably with previously published models on the same subject.

Title: The Effects of Formal Employee Participation in Ownership and Decision Making on Perceived and Desired Patterns of Organizational Influence: A Longitudinal Study
Author-Name: Richard J. Long
Abstract: This paper examines possible effects of introduction of formal employee participation in ownership and decision making on patterns of organizational influence, using longitudinal data obtained before and after conversion of an electronics firm to partial employee ownership. Although numerous formal participation mechanisms were introduced, including employee board representation, an employee council, and quarterly shareholder meetings, little change was found in perceived worker participation at any decision level. Employee ownership did not seem to increase desires for worker influence among either managers or nonmanagers, nor did it appear to significantly affect the total amount and distribution of influence within the organization.

Title: Conflict, Power, and Organization in a Changing Community
Author-Name: Barbara Gray Gricar
Author-Name: L. Dave Brown
Abstract: This paper analyzes a case study of conflict among groups of differing power in a community, drawing upon two distinct traditions of conflict theory: integrative and adversarial. The paper examines the evolution of organization within and among groups over a two-year period and the impacts of that evolution on conflict among them. Essentially, a new organization, composed of representatives of the groups in conflict, was created, and mechanisms for regulating information exchange and for handling differences were evolved that reduced the conflict among them. The evolution of the Committee on Residential Lending (CORL) as an institution is examined from the vantage points of level of organization and balancing unequal power relations, and implications for joint use of integrative and adversarial conflict traditions are considered. Three propositions for guiding the joint use of the two traditions are articulated and illustrated.

Title: The Influences of Eye-Gaze, Style of Dress, and Locality on the Amounts of Money Donated to a Charity
Author-Name: Ray Bull
Author-Name: Elizabeth Gibson-Robinson
Abstract: A number of studies have examined in the laboratory the effects of an individual's eye-gaze upon the behavior of another. In this study the effects of gaze were investigated in a real-life setting in which a collector of money for a charity either looked a possible donor in the eye when asking for money or looked at the collecting tin. Significantly more money was donated in the former condition. While neither the style of dress of the collector nor the locality in which the collections were made had an overall effect, significant interactive effects were noted for gaze and style of dress, for style of dress and locality, and for gaze and locality. Gaze was a more potent factor when the collector was dressed casually than smartly, and when the collections were made in high-rise flats as opposed to terraced houses.

Title: Training/Job Fit and Worker Satisfaction
Author-Name: John A. Drexler, Jr.
Author-Name: Michael K. Lindell
Abstract: The importance of having a job different from the one for which one is trained was investigated. A measure of training/job fit was presented and its relationship to satisfaction was tested. Also assessed was whether training/job fit moderated the relationship between social properties of work environments and satisfaction. The data used were from a survey administered to 2,286 military personnel working in 3 7 different United States Army units. The respondents held a wide variety of jobs, and the units were geographically dispersed. Training/job fit was related to satisfaction. Individuals who had jobs which fit their training reported higher levels of satisfaction, however, the relationship accounted for less than 1% of the variance in satisfaction. More substantial differences resulted from the tests of the moderator effects. The explainable variance in satisfaction associated with peer behaviors and group process was substantially higher for individuals not working in jobs which fit their training tha...

Title: Strategic Decision Methods
Author-Name: Jorge Stein
Abstract: Frequently, major strategic problems cannot be solved using objective, quantitative approaches alone. This paper addresses the methods with which top managers search for solutions, analyze alternatives, and share the authority to make decisions. Several decision models, in addition to the classic rational model, are examined. Variables that differentiate these models are identified and evaluated. Four dimensions emerge as the most important ones: analysis of alternatives, search for possible solutions, flexibility in the problem definition, and group behavior displayed by the advisory or decision-making group. Based on combinations of these four dimensions, sixteen modes of decision processes are identified.

Title: Situational and Behavioral Moderators of Subordinate Satisfaction with Supervision
Author-Name: Robert P. Vecchio
Abstract: The additive and interactive relationships of supervisor behaviors (con-sideration, initiation of structure) and work-setting attributes (role clarity, role conflict) relative to criteria of individual job satisfaction were investi-gated with bivariate and multivariate regression analyses. For a sample of 107 supervisor-subordinate dyads, results indicated that situational attributes moderated the influence of supervisor behaviors on satisfaction with supervision, but these attributes did not moderate the influence of supervisor behaviors on other satisfaction criteria. The evidence is inter-preted as underscoring the validity of contingency approaches to the study of leadership and pointing to the need for specifying "relevant" (i.e., con-ceptually proximal) criteria for theoretical networks.

Title: Is Ignorance Bliss? A Reconsideration of the Folk Wisdom
Author-Name: Lee Sigelman
Abstract: The validity of the proverb that "ignorance is bliss" is tested via analysis of data from the 1974 and 1976 General Social Surveys. A shortened version of a previously validated indicator of general intelligence, when correlated with measures of happiness, life satisfaction, and anomia, is found to be significantly related to all three; only the correlation with anomia, however, is of an impressive magnitude. Intelligence is then used as one predictor of psychological well-being in a series of multivariate models. The multiple regression and partial correlation results indicate that intelligence has no independent impact on either happiness or life satisfaction, but that it is a good predictor of anomia. But the impact of intelligence on anomia is negative, indicating that even when the effects of all the other variables in the analysis are controlled, more intelligent people tend to be less anomic. Overall, these results point toward rejection of the maxim that "ignorance is bliss.."

Title: A Path Analytic Model of Human Capital and Organizational Job Characteristics on Female Job Satisfaction
Author-Name: Thomas N. Martin
Abstract: This study attempts to integrate human capital theory (predominantly an economic theory) with the traditional organizational job characteristics found in the behavioral job satisfaction literature. Four human capital variables-formal education, marital status, length of service, and alternative job information-are posited to have direct influence on seven organizational job characteristics-pay, co-worker integration, promo-tional opportunities, job communications, equitable treatment, routiniza-tion, and centralization. These seven variables are then posited to have direct influences on job satisfaction. Human capital theory is found to be a powerful addition to the understanding of job satisfaction among female employees. The multiple relationships posited between human capital resources and job characteristics are quite evident in the path analytic test of the model. Furthermore, increased co-worker integration and reduced routinization were found to directly increase job satisfaction. Implications for ...

Title: Quasiexperimental Research in Organizations: A Critique and Proposed Typology
Author-Name: W. Jack Duncan
Abstract: The experiment has been the hallmark of empirical science. In recent years, the impracticality and sometimes impossibility of conducting ex-periments in real organizations has led to the increased use of quasiex-perimental research designs. This paper begins with a review of the ad-vantages and disadvantages of traditional experiments. Two major categories of quasiexperimental designs are then presented. Constructive techniques are evolutionary and make improvements on the basis of prior experience. Accommodative techniques adjust to the demands of the research situation. The paper is concluded with a method of classifying and selecting quasiexperimental designs on the basis of the purpose of the research.

Abstract: The perspectives and research data on labor turnover and occupational choice have not been integrated meaningfully. In fact, each area has tended to develop independent of the other. Essentially, each job entrance and each job e-xit has been treated as a unique occurrence, and not as part of a work history. This paper suggests and integrates several concepts which make it possible for the phenomena considered by labor turnover and occupational choice to be treated as aspects of a larger process of job selection.

Title: Conventional vs. Worker-Owned Organizations
Author-Name: Susan R. Rhodes
Author-Name: Richard M. Steers
Abstract: Based on a sample of worker-owners in a producer cooperative and employees in a conventional organization, this study empirically tests portions of a theoretical model explaining the relationship between worker ownership and control and work attitudes and behaviors. According to the model, worker-owners in the cooperative are hypothesized to have higher perceptions of particiption in decision-making, pay equity, performance-reward contingencies, and group work norms than are employees in the conventional organization. These perceptions, in turn, are expected to lead to an increased commitment to the organization and lower levels of absenteeism, tardiness, accidents, grievances, and turnover. Results partially support the model with members of the cooperative being more committed to their organization, while at the same time having higher absenteeism and tardiness levels than employees in the conventional firm. Implications of results are presented, and directionsforfuture research are discussed.

Author-Name: Dale E. Rude
Abstract: For a sample of police personnel, a longitudinal design was employed to examine the relationships between leader role clarification behaviors and subordinate job satisfaction and attitudes toward citizenry as well as the role of perceived skill variety as a potential moderator of those relationships. Further, both the relationships of perceived skill variety to employee responses and the potential moderating role of job longevity on those relationships were considered. Only weak support was provided for the contention that leader role clarification behaviors are favorably associated with subordinate responses. Contrary to the findings of previous studies, relationships of skill variety to responses were weak and inconsistent and neither perceived skill variety nor job longevity played a meaningful moderating role on focal relationships. Relevant differences between the current and past studies, implications of findings of the current study, and suggestions for future research are presented.

Title: Job Change: A Naturally Occurring Field Experiment
Author-Name: Robert T. Keller
Author-Name: Winford E. Holland
Abstract: A naturally occurring field experiment of job change was conducted over a one-year period in three applied research and development organizations. The experimental group (n = 42) were those employees who had been promoted or assigned to a different job. Employees who had maintained the same job made up the nonequivalent control group (n = 166). Standardized change score analysis showed the job change group to have greater increases in performance, innovativeness, and job satisfaction, as well as a greater reduction in role ambiguity when compared to the nonequivalent control group. In addition, the job change group reported greater increases in the job characteristics of variety and task autonomy, as well as in the role requirements of integration and boundary-spanning activities. The importance of the results and the role of field experimentation are discussed.

Title: Leardership, Job Perceptions, and Influence: A Conceptual Integration
Author-Name: Gerald R. Ferris
Author-Name: Kendrith M. Rowland
Abstract: A fundamental assumption adopted by most approaches to the study of leadership is that leaders somehow influence subordinate attitudes and behavior. Unfortunately, few systematic attempts have been made to address specifically how the influence process operates. Thus, we have been left with a large amount of research reflecting relationships between leadership and subordinate outcomes, but little in the way of explanation as to how or why such results come about. This paper reviews the effects of leadership on subordinate attitudes and behavior by incorporating subordinate perceptions of the job. A perspective is offered which more clearly articulates the operation of the leadership influence process, viewing it as a contextual influence that impacts on behavior and attitudes of subordinates through their perceptions of job characteristics. This alternative perspective thus casts the integration of leadership and job perceptions in a different conceptual framework. Suggestions for testing the proposed mod...

Title: Inter-Relationships Between Organizational Commitment and Job Characteristics, Job Satisfaction, Professional Behavior, and Organizational Climate
Author-Name: Harold P. Welsch
Author-Name: Helen LaVan
Abstract: Commitment to the organization is an important behavioral dimension which can be utilized to evaluate employees' strength of attachment. Keeping employees highly committed is important, especially in not-forprofit firms whose salary scales may not be as competitive as industrial firms. Management is concerned with identifying those variables that are related to organizational commitment in order that they may design organizational strategies to maximize commitment levels. Results in a healthcare institution indicate that role conflict and role ambiguity are detrimental to commitment, while a participative climate, power, teamwork, reading professional journals, satisfaction with work and promotion opportunities, age, GS level, tenure, and length of professional employment are positively related to organizational commitment.

Title: The Impact of Task-Related Information on Performance Variability
Author-Name: Jack F. McKenna
Author-Name: Robert Dubin
Abstract: The focus of this study was regulation/control. One hundred and fifty subjects participated in a laboratory experiment in which they were given varying amounts of task-related information, in the form of instructions, on how to complete an assembly procedure. This resulted in the subjects completing the experimental task with a low, moderate, or high degree of task information prescribed for them. Generally, the findings of the study demonstrated that subjects in the less-controlled experimental groups have considerably greater variability of performance times, while participants given maximum task information had only a minimum degree of variability in completion times. The findings suggest that as the amount and appropriate timing of task information is optimized, variability among individuals completing the task decreases.

Title: Communication-Conflict Predisposition: Development of a Theory and an Instrument
Author-Name: Charles T. Brown
Author-Name: Paul Yelsma
Author-Name: Paul W. Keller
Abstract: This paper has two objectives. First, it presents a brief informal statement of a theory of the dynamic constructs of personality bearing upon conflicts within and between people. The six dynamics (range of feelings, task energy, respect for community, respect for others, desire for control, and concern for one's own self-uniqueness) are based on the concept-free research of Osgood et al. and Bales. Second, it reports the reliability and validity of an instrument which, using scales for the six dynamics, is designed to measure the degree to which one is predisposed to handle conflict constructively (win-win) or destructively (win-lose). Internal and test-retest reliability of the instrument are acceptable for basic research. Several field studies suggest criterion validity. Construct validity was examined by comparison with three other instruments, which were supportive.

Abstract: The relationship between "formal" decision-making structure and "informal" supervisory style and their joint effects on organization member outcomes is examined in a sample of 1000 organization members in a matched sample of ten formally participative organizations and ten matched counterparts of conventional hierarchical design. Both style and structure are found to have significant effects on member outcomes. Style has a more powerful effect on member outcomes than structure. The relationship between supervisory style and decision-making structure is discussed and the implications for organizational development are examined.

Abstract: Career theory, like the phenomena it describes, has grown and developed over the past century. During that time, four main types of theory have emerged. This paper examines the contributions and limitations of each type, starting with the oldest, and identifies the most fundamental trends in the evolution of this theory. The key trend identified is a continuous shift from a relatively static to a relatively dynamic theory. The paper offers a synthesis of this literature, and concludes by suggesting what types of research and theoretical development are now needed if career theory is to continue to mature.

Abstract: Most psychological research on expository writing is conducted within a purely cognitive paradigm. Writing provides a test case of its generality because the claims which writers make about their experience are incompatible with any purely cognitive model. We maintain that the fundamental problem of writing is affective, concerned specifically with the attitudes of openness and trust. A method of writing is presented which we conjecture induces such attitudes. Its efficacy may be tested on individuals suffering from writing difficulties.

Title: Human Migration and the Acculturation of Minorities
Author-Name: Robert Smither
Abstract: Majority-minority relations have historically taken the forms of elimination, segregation, fusion, assimilation, or pluralism. Cultural pluralism, which is the dominant ideology in the world today, is based upon the assumptions of tolerance on the part of the majority and a willingness to learn on the part of the minority. This process of learning is called acculturation. Modern theories of acculturation have tended to neglect the importance of individual differences in the process of adaptation. The socioanalytic model, based upon psychological role theory and studies of natural language, offers a model of acculturation which accounts for individual differences as well as situational factors which affect acculturation.

Abstract: Research on the dual-career family is identifying strains and costs particular to women who are attempting to balance the two roles of career and family. Counseling and associated research have not, as yet, provided knowledge that would lead to the more effective counseling of women in dual career families. Using wives in the second phase of a longitudinal study of 53 dual career couples, this study inductively derives a set of dual-career scales useful for counseling: family and career interface, personal satisfaction with trend setting, career support of the traditional wife-mother role, trend breaking, trend maintenance, and compensatory factors. All met stringent reliability analyses and S form Guttman scales that allow for the internal ordering of subareas from least difficult to most difficult. These subareas in the Guttman scales provide a quantitative base for identifying in detail areas to counsel and which areas must be counseled first before other diagnosed problem areas can be coped with.

Title: Concerns of the Israeli: Change and Stability from 1962 to 1975
Author-Name: Rachel Kats
Abstract: Change and stability in human concerns over time was studied, using questions developed by Hadley Cantril and based on data from two Israeli surveys, conducted, respectively, in 1961 and 1975. The questionnaire contained open-ended questions, to which the respondent described either his personal or his country 's future in a positive (hopes) or negative (fears) response and a Self-Anchoring Rating Scale, by which the respondent ranked himself and his nation in various time perspectives against a future described in his own terms. A basic hypothesis was that in the more than 10-year interval between surveys, concerns and their salience would have changed in response to major social changes (primarily, two wars) which occurred in Israeli society during this period. Nevertheless, basic concerns were expected to remain stable. Shifts in concerns were found, both on the personal and the national level. There was a drop in the general mood, and topics related to war and economy changed in salience. Issues direc...

Title: Background, Personality, Job Characteristics, and Satisfaction with Work in a National Sample
Author-Name: Michael King
Author-Name: Michael A. Murray
Author-Name: Tom Atkinson
Abstract: The impact on job satisfaction of job attributes, biographic characteristics, and personality is examined. Data from a 1977 national survey of 3288 adult Canadians revealed that personality and job characteristics have strong, independent associations with a multidimensional job satisfaction index. Personal alienation and internal-external control had sizable correlations with the index when job characteristics and personal background were controlled. All variables considered together account for 30% of the variance in job satisfaction. The reciprocal nature of cause and effect in the association between personality and job satisfaction is discussed in light of other recent analyses of panel data on response to work.

Title: A Unified Model of Turnover from Organizations
Author-Name: Allen C. Bluedorn
Abstract: A model of the turnover process is developed by synthesizing three turnover models: those of Price and Mobley and the model which has developed around the organizational commitment variable. This model is tested via path analysis and is generally supported. An attempt to cross-validate the new model also provided reasonable support Jor it.

Title: Image Congruence and the Treatment of Difference Scores in Organizational Choice Research
Author-Name: Thomas L. Keon

Author-Name: John P. Wanous
Abstract: This study examined how the perceived congruence between self-and organizational images affects one's choice of a graduate school of business. Applicants with a positive self-image (N = 64) select schools most like their self-image, whereas applicants with a negative self-image (N = 18) select schools least like their self-image. The retention of directionality in difference scores is shown to be a useful data analysis technique when testing congruence hypotheses.

Title: Climate: A Reconceptualization and Proposed Model
Author-Name: R. H. George Field
Author-Name: Michael A. Abelson
Abstract: Climate is presented as a perceptual attribute on an organizational, group, and individual level. The climate construct is defined and key issues concerning climate, which have been identified by past research, are addressed. These issues are level of analysis, measurement, validity, redundancy and usefulness. A model which represents the traditional conceptualization of climate is given. This model is later revised by integrating aspects from the discussion of the key issues. The paper concludes with recommendations for future climate research.

Title: Top Managers' Beliefs and Rationales for Participation
Author-Name: John W. Dickson
Abstract: Top managers' beliefs about work were found to vary with rationales for the use of and the outcomes from participation. Endorsers of humanistic beliefs saw participation principally as a means of communication. Endorsers of the organization belief (value of group working) saw decision acceptance as a primary use. Individuals who considered their employees subject to some alienation and exploitation (Marxist-related belief), emphasized participation as a moral right of employees and as a means of increasing employee morale. Endorsers of the work ethic generally attributed less value to participation. As an overall group, the top managers saw decision acceptance, decision quality, and communication between themselves and their employees as prime rationales for participation.

Title: The Relative Contribution of Perceived Skill-Utilization and Other Perceived Job Attributes to the Prediction of Job Satisfaction: A Cross-Validation Study
Author-Name: Gordon E. O'Brien
Abstract: With a representative sample of 1383 Adelaide employees it was found, using simple multiple regression, that job satisfaction was significantly predicted by the perceived job attributes of skill-utilization, influence, variety, pressure, and interaction. For the total sample, skill-utilization was the strongest predictor of job satisfaction. In order to measure the degree of over-estimation of R2, a double cross-validation of the data was conducted. The R2 varied from .47 to .51 and the beta coefficient for skill-utilization remained the highest and varied from .48 to .50. The effects of multi-collinearity were measured using principle components analysis and measures of the variance inflation factor for each beta coefficient. It was concluded that multicollinearity was not a significant problem for these data. The degree to which the observed association between job satisfaction and skill-utilization was due to content similarity of the scale was assessed by deleting ability items from the job-satisfacti...

Title: Work Group Flexibility: Development and Construct Validation of a Measure
Author-Name: Kamil Kozan
Abstract: This paper develops and tests a measure of flexibility of work groups in steady-state functioning. The measure incorporates two different problems of adjustment in work groups, namely rigidity and disorganization, within aflexibility-inflexibility continuumn. The measure was aplied to three areas of work group activity in which environmental variations call for adjustment: allocation of tasks to members, use of rules and procedures, and communication patterns. The composite flexibility scale and the component rigidity and disorganization scales were found to have satisfactory internal consistency. Construct validity was investigated by relating the flexibility measure and its components to selected group variables which were theoretically expected to predict flexibility. Partial support was obtained for the hypothesized relationships in the present sample of groups. The integration of rigidity and disorganization within a composite flexibility scale is justified on the basis of thesefindings. Suggestions ...

Title: Sociotechnical Theory: Managing Boundaries to Enhance Student Learning
Author-Name: Robert H. Davis
Abstract: This article examines some of the implications of sociotechnical theory for instructors and administrators in higher education. Concepts that have been used in the past primarily to describe and explain behavior in business, hospitals, and similar organizations, are applied to educational settings and problems. Among the concepts developed and applied in this analysis are those of boundary maintenance and control, defense against anxiety, the effects of uncertainty on instructional design, and "quality of life" issues in the classroom. The function of instructors is described as defining boundaries and regulating transactions across them. The major responsibility of students is posited to be learning, a responsibility which they must accept if the system is to accomplish its primary task.

Title: The Relationships of Observer Characteristics to Beliefs in the Causal Responsibility of Victims of Sexual Assault

Author-Name: Michael A. Robbins
Abstract: Whereas much of the previous research has focused on the influence of victim characteristics on attributions of responsibility to a rape victim, the present study sought to assess the relative effectiveness of individual differences among observers in predicting perceptions of a rape victim's responsibility in her own victimization. Specifically, observers' sex, their attitudes toward women, and their degree of dogmatism significantly contributed to the prediction of victim responsibility in a multiple regression analysis. Observers' locus of control orientation, personal-environmental attributional tendency, and belief in a just world, however, failed to be of predictive utility.

Title: The Management Science of the Management Sciences
Author-Name: Tony Tinker
Author-Name: Tony Lowe
Abstract: This paper questions the present allocation of research effort in management science: the extensive concern with "technical" and computational intricacies and the relative neglect of the subject's overall intellectual structure. We argue that management science is in danger of stagnating in a technical morass and we illustrate this point by using the current editorial practices of the journal Management Science and the college structure of The Institute of Management Science (TIMS). The reluctance to challenge and question the "departments" of knowledge underlying management science ensures that certain issues are precluded from academic discussion. These include the nature of the subject's social role; the kinds of social conflicts in which the management scientist participates; the identity of the subject's patrons and their impact on the subject's direction and contents; the interest groups who are best served by the way the subject is currently conceived, and the (inevitably) partisan role played by t...

Title: Predictors of Faculty Intent to Exit the Organization: Potential Turnover in a Large University
Author-Name: Mary Zey-Ferrell
Abstract: A comprehensive model of intent to exit (leave) the employing organization was developed to include personal traits, early childhood socialization, higher education socialization, occupational status, personal values, general attitudes, professionalism, dissatisfaction, and support for collective bargaining variables. A representative stratified random sample yielded a 69.7% return rate of university faculty of a major state university in the midwest. The findings of the regression analysis of all variables in the model demonstrated that attitudinal support for collective bargaining, job dissatisfaction variables, personal traits of age and sex, and selected measures of professionalism were the major predictors of intent to exit the organization. This analysis further demonstrated the need for a more comprehensive model of intent to exit which includes not only the more often used psychological variables but also structural variables and alternative methods of modifying the employing organization which ma...

Author-Name: James Y. Greene
Author-Name: Joseph J. Mamlin
Abstract: A holistic theoretical model is presented which attempts to integrate various perspectives and findings in order to research questions related to the provision of high-quality, patient-sensitive, primary care. The model is divided into three broad components: the patient world, the provider world, and their interaction. "World" refers to the background, attitudes, and social support systems of each group. Following a detailed description of the paradigm and its underlying rationale, specific methodologies to better understand patient and provider satisfaction, patient compliance, and medical outcome are described. Hypotheses are proposed which are currently under investigation at a university-based municipal hospital. Initial findings and proposed strategies for later investigation are discussed, along with broader, nonmedical implications of this research.

Title: Job Difficulty as Interpreted by Incumbents: A Study of Nurses and Engineers
Author-Name: John M. Ivancevich
Author-Name: Samuel V. Smith
Abstract: Job difficulty is a concept that can play a prominent role in the application of management implemented job redesign, training, performance appraisal, and goal setting programs in organizations. Interviews, card sorting, and categorization procedures were used with randomly selected nurses and engineers to develop occupation specific job difficulty scales. The scales were then administered to 130 nurses and 159 engineers. Separate factor analyses revealed three job difficulty dimensions for nurses and three for engineers. ANOVA and stepwise multiple regression were used to examine the relationships between the dimensions and such outcomes as satisfaction, job tension, summated performance ratings, and objective performance measures. It was determined that the various job difficulty dimensions were differentially related to the outcome measures in both groups.

Title: Participation in Organizational Change: A Longitudinal Field Study
Author-Name: Aaron J. Nurick
Abstract: This study was carried out as part of a long-term Quality of Work Life experiment in one division of a utility. The experiment is part of a national effort to examine collaborative union-management problem-solving and change implementation. The purpose of the study was to determine the impact of a formal participative process of implementing change established as part of the experiment. Participation occurred in two levels or intensities: (1) direct via membership on either a joint committee or on one of several task forces, and (2) indirect or nonmembership. Subjects were measured at three points in time on a variety of perceptual and attitudinal measures. An analysis of covariance revealed that when job level and pretest scores were held constant, direct participants increased in their perceptions of influence in decision-making and in organizational attitudes in comparison to indirect participants. A second analysis indicated that the changes persisted during an additional time interval. It was conclud...

Title: Personality Determinants of Leadership and Participation in a Sociotherapy Program
Author-Name: Bruce L. Smith
Author-Name: M. Gerard Fromm
Abstract: The present study explores the relationship between personality and the differing modes of participation in a sociotherapy program set in an open, voluntary, long-term psychiatric hospital, in order to further our understanding of the relationship between sociotherapy and psychotherapy. Three groups of patients were defined from the recent population of the hospital: leaders, workers, and nonworkers, and clinical and psychometric data were compared across the groups. Mode of participation, as expected, was found to be unrelated to diagnosis or severity of disturbance. TAT stories were rated for power and affiliation motivation and power motivation was found to be positively correlated with leadership for female subjects, and strongly negatively correlated with leadership for males. Affiliation needs were found to be slightly negatively correlated with the adoption of a worker role. These findings were interpreted both in terms of the psychodynamics of the individual patient and in terms of the group and i...

Author-Name: Robert P. Vecchio
Abstract: In order to determine whether contingent compensation has a detrimental effect on worker performance relative to noncontingent compensation (Deci, 1972b), 43 undergraduates were hired for a part-time interviewing job. A test of a proposed resolution of the noncontingent-contingent controversy (in terms of work quality enhancement under contingent compensation and work quality enhancement under noncontingent compensation) yielded support for only the prediction of quantity enhancement under contingent compensation. Moderating effects of individual differences variables (need for achievement and moral maturity) on the relationships of compensation contingency with performance indices were also evidenced.

Title: Perceptions of the Policy-Making Environment: Cognitive Differences Among Administrators in Five Federal Agencies
Author-Name: Stephen H. Linder
Abstract: The bureaucratic environment is widely recognized as an important influence on administrative behavior. Nonetheless, few studies of public agencies have attempted to measure the significance of administrators' perceptions of this environment; perception shapes the understanding and interpretation of the information that premises policy decisions. This study examines the nature of the subjective environment, based on perceptions and beliefs about the influential actors who occupy the objective one. The purpose of this work is to extend the efforts of the cognitive process theorists by developing an empirical representation of the subjective environment that accommodates individual differences, assessing its relation to other beliefs and to organization activitities, and evaluating its impact on the initiation of policy changes. Evidence supporting suspected impact calls for an extension of bureaucratic theory to account for the contribution of perceptual biases to administrative behavior.

Title: Fear of Success and Women Employees
Author-Name: Gary E. Popp
Author-Name: William F. Muhs
Abstract: Fear of success in 214 male and female employees was tested utilizing an objective, self-report measure. Higher fear of success in females was not supported. However, significant differences were found in terms of age, ethnic background, pay levels, and years with the organization. Results indicate that the focus of future research should be on important workrelated variables which may provide more illumination than simplistic sex stereotyping in terms of "fear of success." Suggesting that women as a group suffer higher fear of success than men, given research evidence to date, is unwarranted. It seems likely and logical that success, a difficult term to define and one which is probably unique to each of us, is affected by a host of areas in our work environment, not just a fear of success. Past studies have identified many of the relevant variables, some of which were used in this study. Fear of success, while highly popular, is unable at its present stage of development to contribute much to the underst...

Title: Cybernetics and Organization Theory: Epistemology or Technique?
Author-Name: Gareth Morgan
Abstract: Based on the view that theorizing is metaphorical, this paper examines the impact of cybernetic imagery on the study of organizations. Imagery treating organizations as "black boxes," "thermostats," "decision-makers," "morphogenic systems," "learning systems," and the concept of "organizational ecology" is explored. Developing the distinction between "cybernetics as technique" and "cybernetics as epistemology, " it is suggested that organization theory has for the most part used cybernetics in the former sense. The paper develops the view that the major challenge cybernetics poses conventional organization theory rests in its epistemological implications. Systematically developed, these have fundamental consequences for the way we view organizations and their mode of operation.

Author-Name: Ted Joseph
Abstract: This study attempted to assess the attitudes of American city and county daily newspaper reporters and editors toward reporter decision-making, and to determine existing decision-making practices. A national sample demonstrated that reporters want, in general, to be consulted by management before management makes decisions. On several work-related decisions, however, reporters want to control the decision-making process; on other issues, they have relatively little participation interest. Editors want less reporter participation than reporters, and the difference is substantial on many work-related issues. Female editors would allow slightly more reporter decision-making than male editors. These reporters also want more participation than exists. Smaller newspaper organizations allow more reporter decision-making than larger news organizations.

Title: Perceived Feminine Role Orientation and Self-Concept
Author-Name: Elwin C. Nielsen
Author-Name: Jeanne Edwards
Abstract: This study was designed to explore the relationships between perceived feminine role orientation and positive self-concept, as measured by scores attained on the Inventory of Feminine Values (IFV) and the Total Positive Scale of the Tennessee Self Concept Scale (TSCS). Analysis of variance computation on a sample of 87 women indicated that there was no difference in positive self-concept for women who perceived their feminine roles as liberal, those who saw their roles as traditional, and those who had a neutral orientation. All three groups had Total Positive Self scores, of the TSCS, above the norm mean. Marital status and religious background were correlated with role orientation. The authors interpreted the results as providing a basis for questioning previous writers' assumptions that a neutral or androgynous role orientation is the most helpful one for women to assume, and suggest that primary effort be directed at encouraging and helping women to make their own role choice.

Abstract: A simulation of a supervisor-worker conflict was performed with fourperson groups in either a face-to-face or a television-mediated communication setting. Face-to-face groups were more likely to reach solutions indicative of high intragroup conflict. Although mean values did not differ, there was more variability among face-to-face groups in discussion time and measures of supervisor dominance. These results were interpreted as suggesting that electronic mediation serves to weaken the forces of emergent leadership.

Author-Name: D. S. Smyth
Abstract: The paper gives the main results of studies on the size-performance relatio ship of mail sorting offices in two of the developed countries. A distinct optimum size was found at about 450 total operatives and the major factors causing the declining performance of larger offices were identified as deteriorating motivation, increasing specialization in work method, and a poorer industrial relations climate. The performance of small offices is believed to be adversely affected by the minimum number of operatives needed to guarantee service during periods of low demand but who cannot be fully occupied. Special attention was paid to the definition of terms and to statistical technique as these matters have been noted as weaknesses of some previous studies on the effects of size in organizations.

Title: Role-Set Configuration and Opportunity as Predictors of Unethical Behavior in Organizations
Author-Name: Mary Zey-Ferrell
Author-Name: O. C. Ferrell
Abstract: Role-set configuration is examined as a predictor of ethical/unethical behavior among two random samples of advertisers [corporate clients and ad agency account executives]. The specific reported behaviors analyzed are intraorganizational behaviors available to most employees. The conceptual framework is based on differential association theory and role set configuration analysis. The three dimensions of role-set configuration used to predict ethical/unethical behavior are organizational location, relative authority and referent others' beliefs and behaviors as perceived by the focal person. The focal person's opportunity to participate in unethical behavior is also a predictor variable. Eighty-nine corporate clients and 136 agency advertisers responded to a questionnaire [a 33% return rate] consisting of a slightly revised version of Newstrom and Ruch's ethics scale. Seven types of predictors of ethical/unethical behavior, "What I do," are developed through principal component factor analysis. These seve...

Author-Name: Jiska Cohen
Abstract: The implications of cooperative and competitive styles of individuals have been studied. One hundred thirty-two undergraduate students participated in the experiment. In the first part of the experiment they were asked about their preference to study competitively or cooperatively. In the second part they were randomly assigned to competitive, cooperative, or tutorial learning situations. It was hypothesized that interpersonal relations of cooperative individuals would be superior to those of subjects who preferred competition. It was also hypothesized that interpersonal attitudes would be more positive in the cooperative and tutorial situations than in the competitive one. Both hypotheses were confirmed by the results. The construct of cooperative and competitive personal styles is discussed as well as some implications of the findings.

Title: Conflicts Between Student/Professional, Parental, and Self-Development Roles:                 A Comparison of High and Low Effective Copers
Author-Name: Lucia A. Gilbert
Author-Name: Carole K. Holahan
Abstract: This study investigated the coping strategies used by returning university students in dealing with conflicts between the demands of their students/professional role and their parental role or their student/professional role and their "self" as a self-actualized person. The 57 female and 28 male subjects used nine scales developed by the authors to describe their typical strategies for coping with their role conflict in one of these two areas. Subjects also rated the degree of role conflict experienced and the effectiveness of their coping strategies. As predicted, subjects rating their characteristic ways of coping as highly effective [High Effective Copers] reported less conflict and endorsed different coping strategies than subjects rating their characteristic strategies as less effective [Low Effective Copers]. High Effective Copers of both genders used Perspective Taking to a greater extent, and Depression and Calling Time Out to a lesser extent, than did Low Effective Copers. Recognition of Societal...

Title: Personality and the Preference for Modes of Conflict Resolution
Author-Name: Robert E. Jones
Author-Name: Bonita H. Melcher
Abstract: This article reports the research findings of the relationships of personality variables and preferences for modes of conflict resolution. Eleven hypotheses were developed relating nine personality variables-achievement, dominance, aggression, affiliation, deference, succorance, nurturance, dogmatism, and Machiavellianism-to the preference for smoothing, forcing and confronting. These hypotheses were tested using a sample of 136 MBA students and support was found for eight hypotheses. As hypothesized positive correlations were found between the following variables: affiliation-smoothing, deference-forcing, succorance-smoothing, nurturance-smoothing, dogmatism-confronting, and Machiavellianism-confronting. Support was also found for two hypothesized negative correlations: affiliation-forcing and Machiavellianism-smoothing. No support was found for the hypotheses relating achievement to confronting, dominance to forcing, and aggression to forcing.

Title: Social Exchange and Moral Development: Dimensions of Self, Self-Image, and Identity
Author-Name: Eileen L. McDonagh
Abstract: This paper argues that the exchange theories of sociological utilitarianism should be combined with ethical theories premised on the intrinsic value of human life in order to understand more completely the components of human interaction. This is necessary because each theory relies on a distinct social-psychological dimension of human behavior: ethical theories explicate the concept of the "self," which psychologically functions as evidence that the individual "exists," whereas social exchange theories explicate the narcissistic concept of "self-image," defined as the pleasure and/or pain of existence. It is further argued that a particularized combination of self and self-image produces an individual's concept of "identity." The value of integrating these concepts into an analysis of human interaction is most easily seen when applied to traumatic human interaction. Here the resulting psychological damage can be effectively analyzed and better understood by reference to these three dimensions: self, base...

Title: Problem-Solving Adequacy in Hospital Subunits
Author-Name: Robert I. Sutton
Author-Name: Larry H. Ford
Abstract: The problem-solving framework developed by Georgopoulos and his associates was used in the present investigation to explore the relationships among problem-solving adequacy, the appropriateness of organizational structures, and effectiveness in 52 subunits of a large, general hospital. Evidence obtained from interviews with subunit managers or directors, interviews with hospital executives, and aggregated responses of unit members are used to explore these relationships. Following most closely from Georgopoulos and Cooke's (1979) version of the problem-solving framework, hypotheses were derived from the following two propositions: (1) organizational subunits are problem-facing open systems that must solve a set of generic problems to be effective and (2) organizational structures are problem-solving mechanisms. Drawing from this theoretical perspective, it was hypothesized that subunit structural appropriateness would be positively related to problem-solving adequacy and to effectiveness. Subunit problem-...

Title: Human Needs and Job Satisfaction: A Multidimensional Approach
Author-Name: Thomas F. Cawsey
Author-Name: Philip L. Reed
Author-Name: John R. Reddon
Abstract: Francophone (n = 90) and Anglophone (n = 106) managers for a national consumer lending company in Canada responded to measures of human needs (Personality Research Form) and Job Satisfaction (Job Descriptive Index). Needs are transformed to remove multicollinearity and a multivariate model developed to account for variation in job satisfaction. A considerable amount of the variance in job satisfaction is accounted for by human needs that are highly independent of social desirability responding. There are differences in the explanatory variables of the two samples. Implications regarding job redesign are discussed. In particular, the normative orientation in the literature regarding appropriate needs for organizational research is questioned, and the importance of considering the multidimensional nature of need structure is stressed.

Title: An Examination of the Affective Consequences of Assigned and Self-Set Goals
Author-Name: Thomas I. Chacko
Abstract: This study attempts to provide some insights into the goal-setting process and to explain the inconsistent findings in the literature concerning the effect of different goal-setting modes on subsequent affective reactions. This examination was conducted within an attribution theory framework. The subjects were 92 undergraduate business students and the experimental task consisted of proofreading a manuscript. The subjects were randomly assigned to two goal-setting modes-self-set and assigned. Subjects causal attributions to performance reports of success and failure as well as their affective reactions were measured. The results suggest that one's affective reactions may not be influenced by goal-setting modes but may be moderated by the causal attributions one makes in response to performance cues.

Title: Social Identity and the Readiness for Social Relations Between Jews and Arabs in Israel
Author-Name: John E. Hofman
Abstract: This paper examines the social identity of Arabs and Jews in Israel and its relationship to the readiness for establishing and maintaining intergroup contact. Social identity is defined in terms of self-esteem and the national, civic, religious, familial, residential, and vocational subidentities. The structural coherence of the indentity system was demonstrated for both Jews and Arabs, but while subidentities among Jewish subjects tend to be positively interrelated, there is strain within the Arab system, revealed by a negative correlation between the national and civic subidentities, among others. Readiness for relations with members of the other group is higher for Arabs than for Jews and also more clearly related to several subidentities. Jewish readiness for social relations with Arabs is weakly related to the identity system. Identity variables may be promising mediators between situational antecedents and intergroup attitudes, but mainly for members of the minority.

Title: QWL Development: Three Trajectories
Author-Name: Robert W. Keidel
Abstract: This paper describes three contrasting trajectories of quality of working life (QWL) development which appear to match contrasting sets of organizational conditions. The trajectories, while made up of similar components, differ in terms of component order. Based on the sequence of organizational climate improvement, individual commitment, and structural change, "planned, " "evolved, " and "induced" QWL patterns are distinguished. These patterns are derived from a comparative, longitudinal analysis of QWL in six established manufacturing facilities in the United States. Three organizations are used to illustrate the different paths: Polaroid Corporation's ABC plant, Corry Jamestown, and Donnelly Mirrors. The paper discusses the fit between trajectory and organizational properties prior to start-up, early on, and over the course of change. A preliminary integration is made in terms of the need for organizational change and management ability to produce change. Common aspects across the change trajectories t...

Title: The Work-Leisure Relationship: Evidence for the Compensatory Hypothesis
Author-Name: Lynn E. Miller
Author-Name: Richard M. Weiss
Abstract: Research has generally found positive relationships between work and leisure, such that people choose leisure activities involving the same psychological, social, and behavioral skills as their work. The present study argues, however, that negative relationships may also occur, with individuals sometimes compensating for work deficiencies through leisure activities. Evidence is presented showing that individuals with low occupational status are more likely to stress the importance of prize winning in leisure than individuals with high status. Since low- and high-status individuals did not differ in their abilities actually to win prizes, the results are attributed to the desire of low-status individuals to compensate for lack of occupational status through leisure achievement.

Author-Name: Henry P. Sims, Jr.
Abstract: As a result of current problems facing modern organizations a number of strategies have been implemented. The introduction of a work system based on autonomous work groups is one such strategy. A danger to the effectiveness of autonomous work groups is the potential for "groupthink." "Groupthink" is described and suggested to provide a useful observational behavioral category system for studying autonomous work group decision processes. Actual autonomous work group cases are presented to illustrate the relevance and the usefulness of the groupthink framework.

Title: Psychiatric Versus Social Factors: An Attempt at Integration
Author-Name: John Marshall Townsend
Abstract: This paper attempts to resolve the controversy between the proponents of clinical psychiatry and their critics who favor sociocultural explanations of mental disorders. The validity and the limitations of both approaches are analyzed. The labeling and societal reaction approaches are differentiated from more general sociological explanations and, depending on which of their tenets is under evaluation, are shown to have varying degrees of validity. Similarly, empirical research in psychiatry suggests that levels of reliability and validity are low compared to other branches of medicine. The problems of validity and reliability are compounded in psychiatry due to the lack of demonstrable organic pathology for the functional mental disorders and the lack of convergent but independent diagnostic indices. The question of whether psychiatry's primary function is medical or one of social control is discussed. Finally, an interactional framework is presented. This framework encompasses major research findings fro...

Title: Unconscious Planning in a Natural Work Group: A Case Study in Process Consultation
Author-Name: Larry Hirschhorn
Author-Name: James Krantz
Abstract: Gustafson and Cooper have developed a theory of "unconscious group planning" based on the work of Weiss and Sampson. Up to now they have used and developed the theory to clarify and modify the practice and study of Tavistock Self-Study Groups. The authors believe that the theory can be applied to natural work groups as well. They examine the protocol of a day's meeting of the management team of a social service organization. By examining the latent and manifest content of the protocol and by studying the impact of their own interventions as consultants to the team, they show how the group was unconsciously struggling to solve a developmental problem. Most importantly, the group was trying to discover how to criticize their beloved leader in the face of his fear that if they did he might abandon them. The authors suggest that the theory of unconscious group planning may enable theorists and consultants to better understand the problem-solving processes of natural work groups.

Title: Unemployment Rates as a Moderator of the Job Dissatisfaction-Turnover Relation
Author-Name: Richard Shikiar
Author-Name: Rodney Freudenberg
Abstract: The moderating effect of opportunity for alternative employment on the relationship of job dissatisfaction and turnover was examined in an archival study correlating unemployment rates with the results of past studies examining the strength of the dissatisfaction-turnover relationship. A positive correlation (r = .39) was found indicating that the strength of the relationship between dissatisfaction and turnover is greater during periods of relatively high unemployment (i.e., low opportunity) than during periods of low unemployment (i.e., high opportunity). This finding contradicts what has been predicted by theories of turnover proposed by many social scientists, but it is in line with what might be expected from a general push-and-pull model of labor mobility.

Title: Limiting Case Models in the Behavioral Sciences: Perfect Competition, Perfect Benevolence, and Perfect Malevolence
Author-Name: Bruce Busching
Author-Name: Murray Milner, Jr.
Abstract: By isolating key variables and limiting their value, limiting case models portray processes that are empirically rare or nonexistent. Such models, however, have often been extremely useful in the analysis of events in the real world. The perfect competition model, borrowed from economics, has been useful in analysis of social behavior, but many social phenomena appear rather far removedfrom the limited assumptions of this model. This paper proposes two additional limiting case models-perfect benevolence and perfect malevolence-as alternative ideal descriptions. Insights from the three ideal models are then used to develop a more general model with less restrictive assumptions based on four variables: degree of monopoly, degree of explicitness, identification, and terms of exchange. Several empirical applications are discussed.

Abstract: The present study is focused on the relationships between personal and contextual characteristics of the employer organization and the goals and tactics of influence used by the respondents. Participants were 125 middle-level managers and assistant managers. Kipnis, Schmidt, and Wilkinson's questionnaire for measuring goals and tactics of influence was used in addition to background data such as: ownership of the organization, size, and position. Results indicate that goals and tactics of influence were significantly related to four contextual variables: ownership, size, number of subordinates, and the professional discipline.

Title: The Action Learning Model of Experiential Learning for Developing Managers
Author-Name: M. MacNamara
Author-Name: W. H. Weekes
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to collate a theoretical background for the action learning model of management education. The paper relates the learning processes that occur in the action learning model to the basic concepts of group dynamics proposed by Bion. Many writers consider that management education should be active and experienced-based, problemoriented, continuous, supportive, and modified by feedback. Students should have a high level of motivation. The action learning model meets all these criteria. In addition, it has the ability to harness unconscious forces that can be generated in group work if the group is properlyformed and led. Bion identified these forces as the proto-mental system, which derives from the potential valency of each member of the group. The interchange of new learning experiences between the members of the group has been likened to symbiosis by Revans. The potential valency of each member of the group-and hence the symbiotic effect-can be reinforced by the group leader or ...

Title: Meditation Program and Modern Youth: Dynamics of Initiation
Author-Name: H. C. Ganguli
Abstract: A group of 230 young men and women from the American continent, members of an organized meditation program group, has been studied. The aim of the study was to analyze the motivational factors that led them to join the group. The method used was the Critical Incident Technique, responses to which have been content analyzed and appropriately coded and scored. Ten broad motivational themes have been isolated-Situational Stress of Diverse Types, Social Isolation and Lack of Meaningful Relationship, Drug Abuse, Disturbance of Affect, Disturbed Life Style, Problems of Identity and Anomie, Cognitive Needs, Conative-Affective Needs, Incidental Motivation, and Friends and Relatives as Motivators. Each of these themes has been further subdivided into subcategories or codes. It was found that the major specific motivational factors were: Curiosity about Occult and Parapsychic Phenomena, 16%; Depression, 15%; Need to Understand Problems of Human Existence, 12%o; Disturbed Life Style, 9%; Drug Abuse, 8%; Anxiety and ...

Title: Perceived Task Characteristics and Employee Productivity and Satisfaction
Author-Name: Ricky W. Griffin
Abstract: This study tests the relationships among employee perceptions of task attributes and long-term productivity and job and overall satisfaction. Measures of perceived task attributes, individual growth need strength, and job and overall satisfaction were obtained by questionnaire from 100 randomly selected employees of a manufacturing firm. Productivity was computed as the average daily output (quantity adjustedfor quality) of each employee for a one-year period of time. Strong positive correlations were found between certain task attributes and productivity and job satisfaction. Overall satisfaction was unrelated to task attributes. Further, growth need strength was found to moderate the task attribute-job satisfaction relationships. This moderating effect was demonstrated by both subgroup and moderated regression analyses. No moderating effects were detected for either of the other two relationships. Finally, implications for future task design research are discussed.

Abstract: An experiment was conducted to investigate attitudes toward punishment in relation to beliefs in free will and determinism. College students responded to two questionnaires; one designed to assess attitudes toward punishment and one designed to assess strength of belief in free will or determinism. It was found that subjects who scored higher in belief in determinism recommended more punitive measures for behavioral deviations than those who scored higher in belief in free will. A possible explanation for these results emphasized the burdensome moral responsibility which punishment may represent to those who believe in free will. Such responsibility would demand that punishment be administered with scrupulous attention to fairness and justice.

Abstract: Most climate research has emphasized either psychological or organizational climate without addressing the conceptual and empirical relationships between these concepts. This research e-xamined the performance and satisfaction correlates of discrepancies between individuals' psychological climates and the multiple aggregate organizational climates present in their work settings. Climate discrepancy was found to be the better predictor of work satisfaction, whereas membership in aggregate organization climates was the better predictor of job performance. Organization climates were identified on the basis of similarity of multidimensional psychological climate scores using hierarchical and nonhierarchical clustering methods. The implications of thesefindingsfor refining the concepts of psychological and organizational climate are discussed.

Abstract: This research investigated the role of 12 personal characteristics as they predisposed 33 first-line supervisors to change their interactions with employees in accordance with a behavioral modeling training program. Questionnaires were administered to groups of trained and control supervisors both before and after a 10-week training period. These instruments measured perceptions of behavioral change as well as a variety of personal characteristics including self-actualization, regard for others and the self, role clarity, role ambiguity, role conflict, stress, control, competence, education level, job tenure, and company tenure. Eight of these twelve characteristics proved significantly predictive of change for trained supervisors while none were predictive for control supervisors. The pattern of predictive characteristics indicated that feelings of well-being may be more conducive to acceptance of organizational training programs than feelings of need. The results are discussed insofar as they shed light...

Title: Reversal in Preference Responses to Two Types of Injustice Situations: A Methodological Contribution to Equity Theory
Author-Name: Kjell Y. Tornblom
Abstract: Equity theorists have frequently attempted to rank order situations of injustice in terms of preference, motivation to redress justice, and/or overt behavioral responses. The present paper deals with some difficulties facing those efforts and proposes a basis for more precise predictions. It is shown, through a structural specification of their various component types (socalled minor types), why a situation which is less preferred than others in one case may be more preferred than those in another, i.e., the preferential order reversed. This is demonstrated empirically in the present study. Two major types of injustice situations (Under/Over and Under/Just) were involved, one more unjust than the other. Each one encompassed, and was represented by three structurally different minor types. According to the predictions, subjects' preferences for either one of the two major types of injustice situations varied with the particular minor type presented in the study as representing the underlying major types.

Title: The Organizational Dynamics of Service Provision in a Machine and a Reform County Agency
Author-Name: Sharon Tucker
Abstract: The political environment of a tax-supported agency is a potentially critical variable affecting the organization's structure and processes. Internal organizational dynamics in turn affect the efficiency and innovativeness of service delivery. Machine and reform governments are very different political environments for public agencies. In particular, machines have highly concentrated power over agencies and use the agencies for placement of patronage workers. Reform governments have much more diffuse power and a general policy of noninterference with public agencies. This research examines the organization's response to political control of its budget and to patronage placements. The method was a case study of two county health departments using long-term observation and formal and informal interviewing. Important differences were found between the machine and reform county health departments. Hypotheses are developed that will explain the differences based on the interaction of budget constraints, the le...

Title: A Participative Design for Dispersed Employees in Turbulent Environments
Author-Name: Trevor A. Williams
Abstract: Approaches to sociotechnical redesign of work organization have concentrated on developing self-managing teams, using direct task interdependences as the basis for redesign. However, situations exist where it is extremely difficult to redesign work organization in this way. They arise when individuals are linked only indirectly through their separate contributions to organizational performance. Hence, in order to increase organizational effectiveness and employee satisfaction in turbulent environments, new designs for participation and collaboration must be found which do not depend on creating self-managing work teams. The experience reported here suggests that the "core management group" concept is an effective mechanism not only for employee participation in management decision-making, but also for increasing their ability to respond to change and uncertainly affecting their immediate work situations.

Title: Social Choice in the Development of Advanced Information Technology
Author-Name: Richard E. Walton
Abstract: Application of advanced information technology willprofoundly effect the nature of clerical, professional and managerial work. When these consequences are unplanned, they sometimes are positive and sometimes negative, in human and organizational terms. Referring to the range and importance of these impacts, the author argues why social criteria should be employed in the design and implementation of this new technology. Then, based on the increasingly flexible nature of the technology and its cost profile, he argues why social criteria can be applied without economic sacrifice. Turning to trends in social values, theories of management, and interests of trade unions, the author concludes that social criteria probably will be applied increasingly in the development of information technology in the United States. Finally, the paper reviews some of the methodological issues which will arise in the process.

Title: Work-School-Family-Towards a New Career Pattern?
Author-Name: Einar Thorsrud
Abstract: The author analyzes the basic nature of changes in the traditional career of seamen in Norway, from a mono-role to a multi-role system, from a life long career to a multi-phase career system. The transition which has begun among sailors depends on a corresponding change in the school system. A model is outlined to explain how a closed uniform school system is about to change by increasing the autonomy and participation in a learning and development process inside schools, and between schools and other institutions. Some early signs of change in the family pattern of seamen indicate the interdependence between work, school andfamily.

Title: An Empirical Study Measuring Conflict in Problem-Solving Groups Which are Assigned Different Decision Rules
Author-Name: Gideon Falk
Abstract: The paper has two goals. First, to find out whether majority rule or a unanimous decision rule would facilitate more task conflict. Second, to develop several operational measures of task conflict. The study used an experimental design using 18 groups. The group discussions were tape recorded and coded using the valence coding system (Hoffman & Maier, 1964, 1967). Eight operational measures of task conflict are presented and used to test the main hypothesis. The results indicate that in unequal power groups an assigned majority rule facilitates more task conflict than an assigned unanimous rule or no assigned decision rule. The eight measures of task conflict are shown to be useful but require additional refinement.

Title: The Personal Orientation-Organizational Climate Fit and Managerial Success
Author-Name: Mahfooz A. Ansari
Author-Name: Howard Baumgartel
Author-Name: George Sullivan
Abstract: Traditional research on factors predicting to managerial success has typically employed correlational methods designed to assess how individual characteristics of one kind or another or in combination influence success. This study is based on a social psychological contingency perspective and was designed to test the hypothesis that the interaction or fit between personal work orientations and organizational climate makes a significant contribution to the variance in career success among managers. Questionnaire survey data collected from a population of 310 middle managers and 101 top managers in 28 different company environments in British and American firms were used for the study. Four paired orientation-climate variables were investigated: achievement, risk-taking, relationships, and conventionality-structure. Success was measured by a salary progression-age ratio. The findings support the fit hypothesis in the particular case of the achievement pair for middle managers with meaningful support in the ...

Title: Sociotechnical Systems: A North American Reflection on Empirical Studies of the Seventies
Author-Name: William Pasmore

Author-Name: Abraham Shani
Abstract: This paper reviews the development of sociotechnical systems theory and research over the past 30 years, paying particular attention to the evolution of the paradigm in North America during the past decade. Elements of sociotechnical systems theory discussed here include the conceptualization of social systems, technical systems, and open systems, joint optimization, organizational choice, variance control, boundary location, support congruence, quality of work life, and continuous learning. A review of 134 experiments is then summarized, indicating which features of sociotechnical systems design are used most frequently, and which in turn are associated with reported success on a number of critical outcome dimensions such as productivity, costs, quality, and satisfaction. An unexpected finding of this review was that while sociotechnical system experiments have been extremely successful overall, the number of experiments involving technological innovation or change is relatively small; moreover, from the...

Title: A Dialectical Approach to Formulating and Testing Social Science Theories:                 Assumptional Analysis
Author-Name: Ralph H. Kilmann
Abstract: It is argued that the necessary step in the formulation of “good” theories and their subsequent testing and refinement is uncovering the relevant underlying assumptions that different scientists make concerning the nature of human behavior, social environments, and the interactions between these. Since assumptions are, by definition, implicit, unconscious, or even obscure, an explicit process is needed to examine this hidden domain. This paper presents such a process and illustrates how this dialectical approach can be utilized to facilitate advances in social science research.

Abstract: We studied the characteristics of space and meaning in the cognition of the city-center shown by the inhabitants of a large city, in relation to their socio-physical positions in the urban environment. We found that the spatial attributes of the city-center cognition become more stereotyped when the “subjective marginality” and the “objective marginality” of the inhabitants increase.

Title: Developmental Patterns of Organizational Task Groups: A Preliminary Study
Author-Name: Steven L. Obert
Abstract: The lack of research on organizational task group development is considered in the light of methodological difficulties, including group availability, threats to internal and external validity, and limitations of the existing research technology. Possible benefits from such research are compared to the difficulties. From this discussion a design for preliminary research more closely approaching the conditions of the organizational task group is developed and executed. This research tests and confirms a previously published model of task group development through the use of a Developmental Rating Scale. Clinical observations of the groups are used to supplement the conclusion of the study. The need for continued research in successive approximations of organizational task groups is suggested.

Title: Back-Home Environment and Within-Group Relationships as Determinants of                 Personal Change
Author-Name: Peter B. Smith
Abstract: The persistence of change after 1-week sensitivity training groups was studied, using data from 163 British and American trainees. An own-control design was used, in which subjects evaluated change occurring prior to training and five months later. Two criteria of change were employed: subjects' evaluation of their own change, and evaluations of changes in their six most salient relationships. Subjects were also asked to characterize those who most influenced them both within the' group and in back-home settings. The persistence of change was found to be best predicted neither by the quality of relationships within the group, nor by back-home relationships, but by the degree of matching between the two environments. Own-benefit scores were greatest with high matching, whereas relationship-benefit scores were higher where the two environments contrasted. It is concluded that theories of personal change must take greater note of the relation between the T-group setting and the back-home environment than has...

Title: Research-Based Projects as a Learning Strategy in Business Schools
Author-Name: Pat Joynt
Abstract: This article presents a summary of a new learning strategy for practicing managers who attend courses in business schools. Experimental experiential learning combines the research process (experimentation) with the practical managers' everyday life (experiences in organization behavior). The theoretical foundations are reviewed in the first section, followed by a short presentation of the experimental model used in a specific management course. The result has been the formulation of more complex theories of administration, namely contingency theories. Finally, the experimental experiential strategy is compared with the more universal textbook-exam strategies, and the author suggests that this type of learning strategy may help to close the gap between the researcher and the practicing manager.

Author-Name: Barry D. Jones
Abstract: Cohesion continues to remain a popular concept among group therapists and leaders of experientially based learning groups despite persistent confusion about its meaning. The present study provided an empirical basis for clarification of the concept of cohesion. Forty-five participants from nine experientially based learning groups provided self-report and behavioral data concerning a number of aspects of cohesion. Factor analyses of the self-report data generated three sets of factors that dealt with the participant's perception of the other participants, the leader, and the group as a whole. One of the factors concerned the participant's commitment to the group. It was significantly related to remaining in the group and physical distance to others but not to perceptions of learning. It was regarded as a good representation of cohesion as defined as a basic bond or uniting force in a group. The advantages of restricting oneself to a circumscribed definition of cohesion were emphasized as well as maintaini...

Title: Desire: A Structural Model of Motivation
Author-Name: Phil Leather
Abstract: Current approaches to the psychology of human motivation are criticized for being too concerned with “individual satisfactions” and “instrumental performance.”An alternative view of motivation which is based on social relationships mediated by symbolic structures is offered. The essence of this approach is the concept of “desire” which is expressed in terms of a mutually defining relationship between one individual and another. The individual desires the recognition of another individual in order to know himself. It is argued that what we call human needs are not just demands for food, sex, love, etc., but become, through the medium of language, calls to other individuals for their recognition or valuing.

Title: Marital Relationships as a Cause of Death: An Analysis of Occupational                 Mortality and the Hidden Consequences of Marriage—Some U.K. Data
Author-Name: Ben (C.) Fletcher
Abstract: There are very large and specific effects of employees' occupations on their life expectancy or mortality rates. In addition, there is an astonishingly close association between the mortality rates of men classified by their own occupation and married women classified by their husband's occupation. The implication of this finding is that a married woman's life expectancy is significantly affected by the occupation her husband is engaged in. It is argued that these two findings cannot be explained by marital partners sharing similar socioeconomic-environmental circumstances; nor by the psychological effects of bereavement; or the transfer of chemical/physical substances and diseases between partners. It is suggested that while each of these factors may have an additive effect on the association reported, they cannot collectively account for its magnitude and occupational specificity. An explanation of the association must center on the occupational risks that males are exposed to at work (particularly the ...

Title: Attitudes Toward the Unemployed Receiving Social Security Benefits
Author-Name: Adrian Furnham
Abstract: Though there appear to have been a number of psychological studies done in the 1930s and 1970s on the consequence of unemployment, there seem to be very few studies on attitudes toward the unemployed receiving social security benefits or attitudes toward welfare in general. This study examined the effect of sex, education, and voting pattern of over 170 subjects on their attitudes toward people receiving social security benefits. Both education and vote appeared to be important factors in predicting people's attitudes, though there were few sex or interaction effects. A factor analysis of the attitude items revealed three factors indicating that the attitudes centered around the difficulty of coping with the amount of benefit provided; beliefs about people being dishonest about their needs and abusing benefit payments; and the loss of self-esteem and stigma associated with being on social security. Results are discussed in terms of the psychology of explanations, and the implications for social change wer...

Author-Name: Terry A. Beehr
Author-Name: Kevin G. Love
Abstract: Recent literature reviews have attempted to link goal-setting processes with other traditional human relations topics, possibly in a search for explanations of the inconsistent results among some empirical studies. The present reformulation builds upon the models developed in these literature reviews by offering more specific propositions regarding the variables in these models and by integrating these variables with three other organizational themes: participative management, job design and role theory. The model offered here is a meta-model because it is an integration of variables and concepts from several other models. Eleven propositions regarding the direct effects of goal characteristics, feedback, and role characteristics and eleven corollaries regarding the moderating effects of personal and job characteristics are presented.

Abstract: Supervisory interaction, peer-group interaction, and organizational work facilitation were examined as moderators of relationships among facets of role ambiguity and role conflict and the outcomes, job performance, job satisfaction, and propensity to leave for 193 respondents at 5 levels in the nursing service of a large medical center. Supervisory interaction was found to moderate the relationships between (i) intersender-role conflict and job performance, (ii) person-role conflict and job satisfaction, and (iii) ambiguity concerning behavioral outcomes and propensity to leave. Moderator effects for peer-group interaction involved the relationships of (i) intersender-role conflict with job performance and (ii) ambiguity regarding behavioral consequences with propensity to leave. Finally, organizational work facilitation was found to moderate the relationships among intersender-role conflict and the outcome variables, job performance, and propensity to leave, as well as the relationships between person-ro...

Title: The Role of Personal Risk-Taking in Effective Leadership
Author-Name: Dean E. Frost

Author-Name: Jeff W. Anderson
Abstract: Three studies address the role of personal risk-taking in effective leadership. The first study analyzed questionnaire data which detailed behavior of both effective and ineffective military combat leaders. This study indicates that effective combat leaders were judged to demonstrate more personally endangering acts than were ineffective combat leaders. The second study investigated personal risk-taking in leadership within a large urban fire department. Using interview techniques similar to those used in the first study, results obtained indicate that-effective leaders in fire combat were judged to show more personal bravery (i.e., physical risk-taking) than ineffective leaders. Thus, results for fire combat leaders were nearly identical to the results for military combat leaders. The third study included a separate set of data for current fire service leaders' judged fire combat leadership performance and their rated personal risk-taking. Results obtained in this study indicate that leaders judged by th...

Abstract: A methodology for the detection of emerging paradigms is developed through the analysis of implicit and explicit criticisms. The search for the systems' paradigm reveals a set of systems frames at different stages of development. Four basic assumptions that underlie most systems frames and limit their use in the research, design, planning, and management of social systems are identified. A set of frames that may advance the systems movement are proposed. They are enclosed under the name of systemic-netfields and provide a link between systems and networks, aggregates, and fields.

Title: Strategy and the Tactics of Mediation
Author-Name: Deborah M. Kolb
Abstract: Labor mediators see the achievement of a settlement as their objective. From this point of convergence, mediators will differ on the strategy to be used to achieve this end. Tactics refer to the specific actions mediators take in the service of these strategic ends. Based on a participant observation of 10 mediators on 16 cases, the strategies and tactics of mediators from a state agency are contrasted with those used by mediators from a federal agency. The state mediators use a building strategy and emphasize directive tactics to gather information, assess priorities, and encourage parties to move the parties on discrete issues. In contrast, the federal mediators favor a narrowing strategy and emphasize tactics to encourage the parties to continue to meet and progressively refine their proposals in order for an acceptable package to emerge. Mediators from both agencies see their strategic approach as responsive to the parties they serve.

Title: Referent Organizations and the Development of Inter-Organizational Domains
Author-Name: Eric Trist
Abstract: Complex societies in fast-changing environments give rise to sets or systems of problems (meta-problems) rather than discrete problems. These are beyond the capacity of single organizations to meet. Inter-organizational collaboration is required by groups of organizations at what is called the “domain” level. The required capability at this level is mediated by “referent organizations. ” Key aspects of domain formation are discussed in relation to the functions and types of referent organization, of which there are several varieties. Four processes of domain development are identified which compose a sequence.

Title: Assessing Children's Friendship Expectations: Supplementing the                 Semistructured Interview with Picture Sequence Tasks
Author-Name: Brian Bigelow
Abstract: Seventy-five subjects from Grades 2 and 4 were given two tasks to determine their developmental friendship expectation (FE) levels. The first task employed a semistructured FE interview and the second was a picture sequence task similar in format to the Picture Arrangement (PA) subtest of the WISC-R. To control for sequencing ability on the pictorial task, a modification of PA was also administered. Nine FE picture sequences, corresponding to an extant eight-level developmental sequence, were administered to the children. Interviews were coded along the same dimensions. FE levels based on the interview task were marginally more advanced for both grades: 11 subjects were markedly competent and 8 markedly better on the interview; 11 subjects were markedly competent and 10 markedly better on the visual task. Interview FEs showed no significant relationship to age, whereas picture sequence FEs did. This difference was due to the Type II errors on the visual task at Grade 2 and the interview task at Grade 4. P...

Title: Ethnic Preferences in Young Children and in Their Adolescence in Three London Districts
Author-Name: Isidore Pushkin
Author-Name: Veronica Norburn
Abstract: Two Black/White doll-choice tests and a houses distance test using line drawings and photographs, designed to allow assessment of preference intensities, were administered to White children, aged 3-7, in schools in three London districts, two equal in White/West Indian contact, but one tense, the other relatively harmonious in race relations, the third district with few Black residents. Mothers were also interviewed. Significant inter-test correlation and associations were found. Own-race preference, rising in an age trend to peak with significant increase around age 6, was not influenced by sex, father's status, or mother's child-control attitude, however, hostility in a mother's ethnic attitude was significantly associated with houses test distance for Blacks and (when strong) with consistent own-race doll preference. Resemblance of ethnic attitude pattern of children and mothers generally in each district indicated extra family influences and significant district differences in both reflected the quali...

Abstract: This paper offers a view of corporate strategy guided by the insights of cybernetics. The approach challenges the conventional wisdom of rational planning and instrumental control which stresses the importance of goal-oriented adaption of organization to environment. In its place an alternative strategy of systemic wisdom is developed. This is based on: (a) an understanding of contexts; (b) an orientation of action away from noxiants; (c) finding value in system relations rather than instrumental ends; and (d) fostering joint rather than individual action. The paper is concerned to understand the requirements and consequences of strategy formulation in turbulent environments.

Abstract: After a brief account of the importance, and neglect, of the psychological study of names, the role of familiarity in liking for names is investigated. Some empirical research on first names and surnames is set in the context of two opposing theories in experimental aesthetics: the “mere exposure” and “inverted-U” hypotheses. A preference-feedback hypothesis that enables us to resolve some apparently contradictory results from the experiments, and to account for the existence of cyclical vogues in first names and other cultural items, is proposed.

Title: Control of Workflow in Organizations: Perspectives from Markets, Hierarchies,                 and Collectives
Author-Name: Richard Butler
Abstract: Three types of control bases, namely, dependence, routinization, and collaboration, are identified as means of controlling workflow in organizations. These bases are seen to reflect the dominant methods of control used in market, bureaucratic, and collective organizations, respectively. It is hypothesized that the total amount of control bases available will lead to effective control, but as organizations will tend to economize upon control costs, it is also hypothesized that these three bases tend to be mutually exclusive. Other hypotheses suggest that the greater the complexity of a transaction the less likely that routinization, but the more likely collaboration, is used as a control base. These hypotheses are investigated in the setting of an aerospace research establishment where users of equipment have to link their activities with providers of technical services.

Title: Periods in the Adult Development of the Faculty Member
Author-Name: Peter M. Newton
Abstract: A life-span developmental theory of the evolution of the individual life structure through age-linked eras and periods2 is applied to the lives of faculty members. Two fictional cases of professors who do not wish to do academic work of any kind- one at the beginning of his career, the other near the end-are analyzed. It is argued that the meaning of the professor's work-his or her teaching, research, administration, and relations with students, younger faculty, peers, and superordinates- is a function of the developmental period the faculty member is in, as well as of the cumulative effects of previous -developmental success and failure in adulthood. To understand the demise of the motivation to work requires us to understand the professor's original career dream, his or her experiences, or lack of them, with mentors, as well as the current developmental tasks with which the professor struggles.

Title: The Interrelationship of Power and Control
Author-Name: Charles C. Manz
Author-Name: Dennis A. Gioia
Abstract: This paper addresses the interrelationship of power and control. A model is developed suggesting that (a) control of organizational resources (resource control) is the primary source of interpersonal power; (b) interpersonal power is the driving force for controlling individuals (personal control); the type of power used to exercise personal control will influence the controlled/controller relationship; and (d) personal control fosters resource control and thus affects the distribution of intraorganizational power. Several questions and issues relevant to research and practice are raised. Overall, it is argued that to increase our understanding of power and control, greater effort is needed aimed at uncovering their interdependent relationship rather than the usual independent treatment given these two elusive concepts.

Title: Comparison of Group and Family Dynamics
Author-Name: J. Paul Sorrels
Author-Name: Bettye Myers
Abstract: In an attempt to apply the concept of group dynamics to family dynamics, entire families performed a quality solution type task. The process utilized by these families was evaluated by a jury trained in group dynamics on the criteria used to evaluate nonfamily group functioning. A panel of family experts ranked the family solutions on the task. This ranking was correlated with group process ranking on 11 group dynamics characteristics derived from the literature. Analysis indicated four summary characteristics are unimportant or unobservable, two influenced families and groups oppositely, and the remaining characteristics were detrimental to both. The characteristics are examined by virtue of the literature supporting them in both family and group functioning. Explanations compatible with current family thought are offered for the results. Suggestions for future research are included.

Title: Attributions of Power Across a Social Network
Author-Name: Charles J. Fombrun
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between individual and structural explanations of attributions of power across two domains: administrative decisions and technical decisions. An assessment is made of the relative importance of member level variates against contextual variates as determinants of perceived power. The results suggest that contextual effects are far stronger than member level variates. Among member level characteristics, an incumbent's formal status is found to be a primary determinant of his perceived administrative power, while his expertise is a better predictor of his perceived technical power. The formal structure outweighs the interaction network as a context for understanding attributions of power.

Title: The Psychodynamics of Organization Development Consultants
Author-Name: David Tranfield
Abstract: Preliminary interviewing of organization development consultants suggested that, first, they tended to have a strongly developed ability to idealize, and second, they tended to see themselves as being shy individuals with considerable interpersonal difficulties. Such findings, along with an analysis of organization development values taken from -the literature, were interpreted from an object relations viewpoint. From this a hypothesis regarding the psychodynamics of organization development consultants was developed. Operational measures were devised and data collected using the Object Relations Technique (Phillipson, 1973). Some indicative findings are reported from fieldwork and comparisons made with clinical groups. Discussion of the difficulties of interpretation and implications for practice of this explanatory work conclude the paper.

Title: A Typology of Organization Typologies: Toward Parsimony and Integration in                 the Organizational Sciences
Author-Name: Ralph H. Kilmann
Abstract: Numerous typologies have been offered for sorting the major contingencies of organizational functioning. Types of effectiveness, environments, technologies, structures, controls, strategies, goals, decision-making processes, leadership styles, job designs, and cognitive preferences, are just some examples. This paper proposes that the variations in each typology tend to follow a pattern, and that this pattern can be captured by the broader dimensions of closed versus open systems and technical versus social systems. It is argued that greater parsimony and integration of the organizational sciences are achieved by defining, sorting, and researching contingency variations according to the four resulting categories: closed-technical system, closed-social system, open-technical system, and open-social system. This paper concludes with suggestions for new research directions that follow from this metatypology.

Title: The Influence of a Rape Victim's Physical Attractiveness on Observers'                 Attributions of Responsibility
Author-Name: Bill Thornton
Author-Name: Richard M. Ryckman
Abstract: Research has provided conflicting results as to the impact of a rape victim's physical attractiveness on observers' attributions of responsibility, attributed in part to methodological considerations. The present study, employing multiple exemplars of attractiveness and multiple dependent measures of responsibility, revealed consistent evidence of an attractiveness bias among observers, with an unattractive victim being assigned greater responsibility in general for her own victimization, as well as specific behavioral and characterological blame, than an attractive victim. The un-attractive victim was also considered to have contributed to her assault by presenting a more provocative appearance than her more attractive counter-part. These biases were stronger for male observers than for females. Although the attractiveness factor differentially influenced the perceived responsibility of a victim, it did not affect attributions toward the assailant.

Title: Modernity Change of Core and Periphery Values of Factory Workers
Author-Name: Ran Lachman
Abstract: This study examines the proposition that late socialization processes may bring “traditional” people to a level of modernity equal to that of people who had the benefit of modern early socialization. The study suggests that a differentiation should be made between modernity changes in value orientations which are at the core and those at the periphery of the personality system. Its basic proposition is that early socialization influences will affect modernity of both core and periphery value orientations, while late socialization influences will affect modernity of periphery values only. Data analysis indicates that early socialization directly influences modernity of core values and indirectly influences modernity of periphery ones. Late socialization was found to have an effect mainly on periphery values, and even this effect was found to be mostly an indirect effect of early socialization. Late socialization was found to have no independent effect on modernity.

Title: Toward a Typology of Employee Ownership
Author-Name: David J. Toscanol
Abstract: Employee ownership has received considerable attention in recent years, in part due to claims that it enhances work satisfaction, increases productivity and profitability, and brings some measure of workers' control to the production process. Research in the field, however, indicates that such links are not inevitable and that different forms of employee ownership have different effects on companies and their workforces. Without this recognition, subsequent research and policy recommendations will suffer. The author argues the need to resolve a number of terminological and definitional problems in the field, and contributes to this task through the development of a typology of employee ownership. Three general types of employee ownership-direct ownership, employee stock ownership plans, and producer cooperatives-are isolated and compared according to eight classificatory factors. Subtypes of each of these categories are also advanced. Recognizing the wide variation in employee ownership forms will allow s...

Title: Leader Influence Through Operant Principles: A Theoretical and Methodological Framework
Author-Name: Ahmed Sakr Ashour
Author-Name: Gary Johns
Abstract: Leader influence is analyzed in terms of operant theory. The characteristics of leader-mediated stimuli and the way they are tied to the subordinate's newly exhibited and already acquired behavior are proposed as critical determinants of leader influence. Dependent parameters of leader influence on subordinate motivation and behavior acquisition are identified. The relevant literature on learning and leadership is reviewed and a number of hypotheses are suggested. Constraints on leader influence through the manipulation of reinforcement and punishment are discussed. Requirements of the operant methodology are examined. These suggest that future research on the effects of leader reinforcement should use rigorous experimentation and the procedures of behavior observation.

Author-Name: Terry Leap
Author-Name: Terence A. Oliva
Abstract: Human resources/personnel management, a subdiscipline of business administration, is examined as a metadiscipline. Support for the metadisciplinary treatment is found in an evolutionary analysis of the field, drawing from system precursors theory. Extensions of this viewpoint are made and indications of likely future developments in the HR/PM area are discussed. An analysis of the advantages of the treatment of academic sub-disciplines as metadisciplines over traditional “phase-oriented” approach is presented and directions for future research are suggested.

Title: Evaluation of the Impact of Feedback on Performance and Motivation
Author-Name: Cynthia M. Pavett
Abstract: The present research was designed to use an expectancy-theory framework to determine the role of performance feedback in the prediction of motivation and job performance. The frequency of positive and negative feedback from supervisors, co-workers, and clients was hypothesized to make a significant independent contribution to the prediction of supervisory-rated performance. The relationships among feedback, the components of motivation, and performance were examined in a sample of staff nurses. Results of moderated regression analysis indicated that positive feedback served as an independent predictor of performance. Positive feedback from coworkers, clients, and the supervisor were differentially related to the instrumentality, motivation, role perceptions, and performance. Implications for management are discussed.

Abstract: Studies concerned with variables involving an individual's decision to leave an organization are categorized into process and content aspects. Variations in previous tests of causal content models are discussed. It was hypothesized that job type acts as a moderating factor affecting the variables indicated as important in the intention-to-leave decision. The results of this study support the hypothesis. Implications of the findings are discussed.

Title: Power Equalization, Participative Decision-Making, and Individual Differences
Author-Name: Ahmed A. Abdel-Halim
Abstract: This study examines the hypotheses that (a) subordinates' perceptions of participation in decision-making (PDM) is positively related to their perceived and desired power equalization (PE), in terms of hierarchical power differentials (HPD) between subordinates and superiors; (b) low-level participants' perceptions of the distribution of power within the organizational hierarchy reflect a zero-sum notion of power; and (c) subordinates' desire for participation and ability (in terms of education) moderate the relationship between PE and PDM. A sample of three hierarchical groups was selected from 40 stores of a large, retail drug company in the midwest: 40 store managers, 59 assistant managers, and 153 nonmanagerial employees. The results provide support for all three hypotheses. Implications of the findings for the exercise of power and effective management styles are discussed.

Title: The Impact of Technology and Functional Unit on Centralization in Organizations
Author-Name: John R. Montanar
Author-Name: Cyril P. Morgan
Abstract: Prior organization theory literature has proposed that either organization size, technology, or environment is the exclusive determinant of an organization `s structural configuration. Weaknesses in these existing structural determination models as regards the centralization structure dimension are discussed. Next, managerial discretion factors based on Child's strategic choice concept are added to the model. Last, methodology used and results obtained in an empirical investigation of the predictors for the centralization structure dimension in three process-oriented industries are reported. The explanatory power of the predictive model for centralization was enhanced substantially by inclusion of the functional unit as a moderator. However, only one of the three industries analyzed displayed evidence that the most commonly referenced antecedents of structure mentioned above were strong predictors of the centralization structure dimension.

Title: Some Remarks on Theoretical Individualism, Alienation, and Work
Author-Name: Robert Cooper
Abstract: This paper offers some comments on the relationship between the “individualistic” bias in social scientific conceptions of human behavior and studies of work and organization. It is claimed that such bias suppresses the real nature of the work process which is “communicative” or dialectical and produces an “alienated” conception of social life. Two models of work -the rational and natural models, derived from the writings of Gouldner and Habermas - are then briefly discussed.

Title: Action Learning: A Strategic Approach for Organizations Facing Turbulent Conditions
Author-Name: Rafael Ramirez
Abstract: This paper presents an overview of a generic strategic approach which organizations can utilize to meet the rapid, complex, interrelated change encountered in turbulent conditions more effectively. The present approach is arrived at by “distilling” the principles embodied in leading edge planning and management strategies. These principles are integrated theoretically within the action learning approach, which considers learning rooted in action to be a most helpful guiding metaphor to enable effective strategies under such conditions. An exploration is then made of the relationship among action learning and other more traditional organizational modes by comparing this relationship with Kuhn's theory of scientific revolutions.

Title: Toward a Theory of Organization Development Interventions in Unionized Work Settings
Author-Name: Arie Shirom
Abstract: In unionized work settings, any organization development (OD) work which does not limit itself before its inception to interpersonal relations among top executives must necessarily include union-management relations in its “client system, ” at least for the phases of entrance and diagnosis. Nonetheless, since Kochan and Dyer's pioneering conceptualization in 1976, the theory of OD intervention in unionized work settings has not been significantly advanced. We contribute toward this theory by (i) developing a system-theory-based conceptual framework of union-management relations -a prerequisite for a diagnosis of, and an intervention in, these relations; and (ii) describing and discussing an entry model of OD consultants. The relevance of each of the proposed theoretical models for OD work is illustrated. Finally, on the basis of the two models, potentially fruitful theoretical paths are delineated for prospective theory builders.

Title: Organizational Change in the Shipping Industry: Issues in the Transformation                 of Basic Assumptions
Author-Name: J. Roggema
Author-Name: M. H. Smith
Abstract: The shipping industries of Northern Europe have undergone major technical, economic, and social changes in their environment since the mid 1960's. The organizational structures in shipping have strong historical traditions and extensive institutional protection. There have been many experiments in new forms of organization and the four main directions of these changes are analyzed in relation to the underlying “basic assumptions” of the traditional forms of organization. The evolution of change strategy from sheltered field experiments to participative design strategies and the linking of innovating centers is discussed in relation to resistances to change at occupational, corporate, and institutional levels. Sufficient diffusion of these changes to offset the major threats in the shipping environment is viewed as unlikely because of the inertia and opposition to change of institutional bodies.

Title: Stages in the Development of Economic Concepts
Author-Name: Val Burris
Abstract: This paper examines the development of economic concepts from a Piagetian cognitive-developmental perspective. Clinical interviews are used to investigate the economic concepts of children between the ages of 4 and 12. The main objective of the research is to determine the extent to which conceptual development in this area is compatible with the Piagetian hypothesis of discrete stages in the formation of social consciousness. The findings of the study are generally consistent with the Piagetian view that knowledge develops through a sequence of qualitative cognitive stages. The existence of these stages suggests that the development of social knowledge must be viewed as a process in which the child is actively engaged in the construction of social meanings, rather than being the passive recipient of meanings presented through immediate experience or the instruction of adults.

Title: Job Attitudes, Intentions, and Turnover: An Analysis of Effects Using Latent Variables
Author-Name: James M. LaRocco
Abstract: The effect of attitudes on behavior, intention to perform a behavior on actual behavior, and the simultaneous effects of attitudes and intention on each other, were examined within a sample of U. S. Navy enlisted men. A three-wave longitudinal design was employed in which measures of job satisfaction, organization satisfaction, and intention to reenlist were obtained at two time periods 6 months apart. Approximately 2 years after the initial data were collected, archival records were examined to identify participants whose enlistment had expired. Two hundred sixty such men were identified and their reenlistment decision noted. These men constituted the sample under study. Extending the general model proposed by Alwin, a structural equation analysis was employed. It was shown that the effect of intention on attitude was greater than the effect of attitude on intention. Situational constraints that might override preferences in determining actual behaviors were discussed.

Title: Japanese-Style American Management: Primary Relations and Social Organization
Author-Name: Subhash Durlabhji
Abstract: Management methods that are said to make American companies “Japanese in style” are examined. The notion that Japanese organizational performance can be duplicated by adopting Japanese management methods is disputed. It is suggested that management methods operate through their influence on the nature of the employee-organization relationship. Since this relationship is influenced by many factors other than management methods, it is suggested that a more productive approach to enhance organizational effectiveness would focus on the employee-organization relationship. An empirical investigation reveals that employee emotional well-being and the employee-organization relationship are associated; no relationship between management methods and employee emotional well-being was found.

Title: Race, Class, and Conflict in a Custodial Setting: Toward the Development of a                 Theory of Minority-Group Politicalization
Author-Name: Robert G. Leger
Abstract: This paper proposes a theory of minority-group politicalization in an attempt to link the politicalization process to conflict with authority in prison. Using path-analytic procedures, moderate-to-high support was provided the proposed theory of politicalization. It was determined that the “best” model of politicalization was the one using “importation” variables as exogenous and “race consciousness” as the endogenous politicalization variable. It was suggested that not only is politicalization a determinant of conflict with authority in prison, this attitude set may be related to various indices of conflict with authority in society such as crime rates and assaults on whites and police. With respect to the amount of variance explained in the two politicalization variables, race consciousness and class consciousness, importation variables again emerge as most important, collectively explaining over twice the amount of variance in both types of consciousness as the set of deprivation variables. Finally, ra...

Title: Job Longevity and Growth Need Strength as Joint Moderators of the Task                 Design-Job Satisfaction Relationship
Author-Name: Nigel J. Kemp
Author-Name: John D. Cook
Abstract: This paper examines job longevity and growth need strength as moderators of the job complexity-job satisfaction relationship. Data from two studies of blue-collar employees (n = 390 and n = 406) were examined using moderated regression analysis and subgroup correlation analytic techniques. The findings show, contrary to previously reported results, that job longevity is not a significant moderator of the job complexity-job satisfaction relationship. Similarly, the direct moderator effect of growth need strength did not replicate across studies. A consistent finding was obtained, however, suggesting that growth need strength moderates the job complexity-job satisfaction relationship only for employees with short job tenure. It is concluded that specifying the conditions within which moderators are important, rather than expecting consistent individual differences across all circumstances, may yet have important implications for both organizational theory and practice.

Title: Toward a Theory of Burnout
Author-Name: Scott T. Meier
Abstract: The burnout phenomenon, while widely acknowledged as an important issue among people-helping professionals, has to date been treated chiefly in anecdotal or descriptive reports that lack both precise theoretical foundations and substantial empirical support. Einsiedel and Tully criticize burnout research, maintaining that conceptual and operational definitions vary widely and that little effort has been expended to draw on more established literature to explain burnout. This paper proposes a new model of burnout, largely based on the work of Bandura. Burnout is defined as a state in which individuals expect little reward and considerable punishment from work because of a lack of valued reinforcement, controllable outcomes, or personal competence. The burnout literature is briefly reviewed and grouped according to the categories of the proposed burnout model.

Title: Beliefs About Work and Rationales for Participation
Author-Name: John W. Dickson
Abstract: The relation of beliefs about work to rationales for participation were examined in a Scottish and an Arizona sample. Evidence was found for both similarities and differences in cognitive sets. Humanistic beliefs were associated with beneficial outcomes (such as decision quality and acceptance) and an educative process. Marxist beliefs were associated with a moral purpose, beneficial outcomes, and a lack of inhibition of management. Organization beliefs (value of group working) were related to an educative process. Some belief-rationale relations were found only in the Scottish sample and some only in the Arizona sample. These indicate potential differences in the way participation is used as a managerial technique in the two countries. U.S. managers possess a more differentiated cognitive set and an appreciation of participation as a social technology.

Abstract: This study shows that some of the factors that influence Queensland Teachers' Union members' attitudes toward union militancy do not necessarily operate in the same way as those that influence commitment to union membership, nor are these factors equally important in shaping attitudes toward union solidarity, or opinions on the use of sanctions against nonunionists. The particular factors whose influence is examined are those of age, gender, tertiary training, promotion, commitment to teaching, and the type of school in which a teacher works. Reasons for the observed differences are discussed.

Title: Task Procrastination in Organizations: A Framework for Research
Author-Name: Nancy N. Harris
Author-Name: Robert I. Sutton
Abstract: Procrastination in organizations may have adverse effects on both individual well-being and system effectiveness, yet studies on this topic are sparse and theoretical development appears to be nonexistent. Procrastination is viewed here as the act of putting off a task that either the focal person or other role-senders expect should be done at the present time. Hence, the emphasis here is upon aspects of the work environment that give rise to procrastination rather than on habits and personality characteristics. Three categories of situational variables are proposed as predictors of task procrastination: characteristics of the task, the relationship between the focal task and other tasks, and attributes of the organization. Furthermore, task discretion is hypothesized to moderate the relationships between these sets of predictors and procrastination. The ways in which this framework may be useful for empirical research and as a starting point for subsequent theory generation are discussed. Finally, it is ...

Title: The Effects of Context on Attitude Measurement: The Case of Job Satisfaction
Author-Name: Mary Ann Maguire
Abstract: With data collected from nonmanagerial employees of four companies during the recession of 1975, this paper attempts to utilize the unemployment context as a contextual variable in explaining individual job satisfaction. It was expected that area unemployment rate would affect job satisfaction less strongly than would a more subjective measure of context perceived by each respondent. It was also expected that when no referents were provided the respondent in evaluating job satisfaction, this evaluation would be affected by local employment conditions. Our findings show that while unemployment rate has no direct relationship with job satisfaction, when used as a measure of context it influences the ability to predict job satisfaction. When the rate is high, variables that have usually been found to be good predictors predict less well or not at all. The perceived context measure was not as good a predictor as we had expected. Finally, the more global measure of the dependent variable, general job satisfact...

Author-Name: Thomas A. DeCotiis
Abstract: This study looks at the issue of geographic mobility of working couples from the employer's perspective. As part of a larger study conducted by the first author, a national sample of 425 American managers was asked to make a simulated decision of geographic transfer involving a member of a working couple. In the study, a differentiation was made among a dual-career, a dual-earner, and a single-career couple. It was found that (a) being a member of a dual-career couple had a significant negative effect on the decision, and (b) the effect was moderated by some characteristics of both the decision-maker and the organization. After having noted the limitations of the study, the authors recommend the study of other aspects of organizational life that may be influenced by working couples.

Title: Systematic Appraisal of Leadership Effectiveness of Consultants
Author-Name: Mauk Mulder
Author-Name: Din Binkhorst
Author-Name: Theo van Oers
Abstract: The aim of this study was to develop an evaluation system for a firm of organization consultants, avoiding the bottlenecks in such a system, such as subjectivity, one-way judgment by superiors, and minimal participation of the judged persons in the judgment process. Leadership theory was applied to analyze the behavior of organizational consultants. Three questionnaires were used: a self-generated list of items (SGL) contributed by the members of the organization themselves, the influence analysis questionnaire (IA Q), and an overall evaluation (OE). The results suggest that, depending upon the situation, two leadership patterns are operating in the practice of consultants, to wit, a mild, personal, “good chap” leadership and a tough, more powerful leadership. The method is of practical use to increase participation; it can be a useful instrument in organizational programs.

Title: Cognitive and Organizational Structures: A Conceptual Analysis of Implicit                 Organizing Theories
Author-Name: Arthur P. Brief
Author-Name: H. Kirk Downey
Abstract: The concept of implicit theories is used to explain how the ideas of organization designers are translated into organizational structures. The concept is also used to explain how organization members respond to structural characteristics. Research strategies for measuring the implicit theories of organizing on which these explanations are based are also discussed.

Title: Attitudes of New Immigrants Toward White-Collar Crime: A Cross-Cultural Exploration
Author-Name: Leslie Sebba
Abstract: This study was designed to determine how far new immigrants to Israel from diverse cultures and economic systems-the Soviet Union and the United States-would differ in their attitudes to crime, in particular white-collar crime. Respondents were asked to rate various deviant acts in terms of their seriousness and to express their views on certain other questions related mainly to criminal justice. A sample of veteran Israelis was also questioned for the sake of comparison. While the relative offence weighting for most offences attributed by the different groups did not differ substantially, there was a general tendency, for the veteran Israelis to be the most punitive and the Russians the most lenient. Various explanations for this were considered, as well as the implications of the findings for multi-cultural societies and legal systems.

Title: Cooperative and Competitive Relationships Between Leaders and Subordinates
Author-Name: Dean Tjosvold
Author-Name: Robert Andrews
Author-Name: Hales Jones
Abstract: It has been argued that leadership research questionnaires should be based upon a theoretical position that has considerable experimental support for its causal relationships. This study drew upon the experimentally supported theory of cooperation and competition to develop measures of three different kinds of leader orientation: cooperative, competitive, and individualistic. These measures were used by 310 medical laboratory technicians from 10 different hospitals to describe the specific job behaviors of their immediate supervisor. The leaders' orientation scores derived from these behavior descriptions were then correlated with measures of overall job satisfaction, satisfaction with supervision, the desire to perform well, and the desire to stay on the job. As predicted by theory, the correlations with dependent measures were strongly positive for a cooperative orientation and strongly negative for a competitive orientation. The correlations for an individualistic orientation were negative and larger t...

Title: Marginality and the Organizational Socialization of Female Managers
Author-Name: Anthony F. Buono
Author-Name: Judith B. Kamm
Abstract: Although social movements and legislation have provided the impetus for women to enter the managerial ranks, relatively few females have become top-level managers. Using the sociological theory of marginality, the paper explores this phenomenon and suggests that women are still caught between emerging corporate and traditional roles. Implications of this marginal status are then examined in the context of the multistaged process of organizational socialization.

Title: Organizational Crisis. Part I: Definition and Conceptualization
Author-Name: Thomas W. Milburn
Author-Name: Randall S. Schuler
Author-Name: Kenneth H. Watman
Abstract: Initially, a two part definition of organizational crisis is presented, related to their significance and prevalence and reflecting either (a) opportunities to meet organizational goals or (b) demands or threats that may prevent an organization from attaining its goals or limiting its abilities to meet them and (c) which the organization seeks to resolve because outcome stakes are important and the ideal resolution strategy uncertain. Thus, crises have both objective and subjective aspects. A number of elements of the definition are discussed in terms of their implications for organizations and their subsystems. Finally, three major aspects of our conceptualization are described in terms of empirical examples from our investigations followed by a typology of eight kinds of organizational crisis based upon three dimensions, (1) control, (2) opportunity-threat, and (3) organizational susceptibility and vulnerability to crisis. Part II will deal with strategies and responses to crisis.

Title: Organizational Crisis. Part II: Strategies and Responses
Author-Name: Thomas W. Milburn
Author-Name: Randall S. Schuler
Author-Name: Kenneth H. Watman
Abstract: The ways organizations respond to crisis can be described in terms of the level of the individual-short, intermediate, and long term-and the level of the organization as a whole-also short, intermediate, and long range. Different kinds of response have disparate implications for organizational effectiveness and survival. Some of the most effective responses can be counterintuitive and are not especially likely to occur, e.g., decentralization in crisis situations. Based upon these considerations and empirical examples of them, several examples of both preventive and management action strategies are described as means to organizational survival and growth.

Title: An Examination of Organizational Commitment in Six Workers' Cooperatives in Scotland
Author-Name: Nick Oliver
Abstract: This paper describes an exploratory study into organizational commitment in six workers' cooperatives in Scotland. Data was collected using questionnaires and semistructured interviews. The questionnaire was used to gather information about attitudes toward work, social attitudes, and demographic characteristics of the cooperatives' members. The interviews produced more detailed data about motivations for joining cooperatives, and about perceptions of the cooperative environment. The members of the cooperatives appeared to form a highly self-selected group, and produced scores on the scales of organizational commitment that were significantly higher than population norms. The data are interpreted as indicating a close match between the values and goals of the members of the cooperatives and what the cooperatives provided as work organizations. It is argued that this may account for the high organizational commitment scores, using a contingency model of organizational commitment.

Title: Relationships Between Interview Selection Decisions and Perceptions of                 Applicant Similarity to an Ideal Employee and Self: A Field Study
Author-Name: Anthony Dalessio
Author-Name: Andrew S. Imada
Abstract: Previous research has shown that interviewers' final decisions were related to: [a] the degree of similarity between the interviewers' perception of the ideal employee and the applicant, and [b] the degree of similarity between the interviewers' self-perception and the applicant. The purpose of the present field study was to determine which variable (similarity to the ideal or similarity to the self) was more highly related to the interviewers' final decision. Thirty-seven applicants were interviewed by five interviewers in structured board interviews. The results indicated that final decisions were related more to the ideal-applicant match than to the self-applicant match. The implications of these results for interviewer training and future research were discussed.

Author-Name: Louis E. Davis
Abstract: This paper presents the results of a step-by-step Delphi analysis used to develop a definition and measure of quality of working life [QWL] in a case specific setting. A representative panel of 64 employees from the headquarters of a large insurance company constituted the Delphi panel that engaged in defining QWL utilizing a six-phase Delphi methodology. The results of a 34-item QWL questionnaire developed from that definition were tested with a sizable [n = 450] sample of the company's employees. Those results identified the following seven significant predictors of QWL, four of which extended beyond specific job content: [a] degree to which my superiors treat me with respect and have confidence in my abilities, [b] variety in my daily work routine, [c] challenge of my work, [d] my present work leads to good future work opportunities, [e] self-esteem, [/l extent to which my life outside of work affects my life at work, and [g] the extent to which the work I do contributes to society.

Title: Group Fantasies and Organizational Functioning
Author-Name: Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries
Author-Name: Danny Miller
Abstract: Using the framework of Bion, this paper will argue that groups in organizations are often likely to demonstrate one of three predominant shared fantasies or basic assumptions that determine organizational culture. It will postulate how these different cultures may vitally influence organizational climate, decision-making, strategy, and structure. Our theme is that it may sometimes be useful to discover the fantasies of the organization's dominant coalition in order to understand organizational functioning and facilitate organizational change.

Title: Sociotechnical Design in a Third World Country: The Railway Maintenance Depot                 at Sennar in the Sudan
Author-Name: Lyman Ketchum
Abstract: A World Bank-sponsored study team was directed to employ sociotechnical methodology in designing a new locomotive repair shop in Sennar, Sudan. The team, comprised of Sudanese and expatriates, found that despite cultural differences, despairing Sudan Railway workers' and managers' feelings and reactions to a bureaucratic enterprise were similar to those of their counterparts in industrialized countries. Because a design along these old principles was certain to yield low commitment and performance now evident throughout the Sudan Railways, a state-of-the-art design was indicated. Overcoming effects of brain and skill drain to nearby oil-rich countries required emphasis on human development equal to that of locomotive repair. This dual emphasis was accomplished in a set of minishops which were self-reliant, semi-autonomous entities coupled with on-site comprehensive formal training resources and facilities. Up-front stakeholder involvement and resource commitment was essential to success. The value of the ...

Abstract: A peer group discussion and decision method was used to change young drivers' attitudes toward road safety. An experimental group exposed to this experience shifted their attitudes, becoming more favorable toward the road law, the rights of other road-users, and less inclined to take risks induced by peers, than a control group not exposed to the experience. No shifts occurred, however, in drinking patterns.

Title: Rationality and Social Justice
Author-Name: Julian J. Edney
Abstract: Modern ideas of justice stress the social qualities of equity and fairness; on the other hand, modern ideas of rational behavior stress individual, self-serving choices that are basically unconcerned with equity. In these forms, justice and rationality conflict in social situations as it appears they have done since Hobbes' analysis of human nature in the 17th century. Two more recent theories are reviewed here, both concerning this social dilemma: Santayana's Reason in Society, which finds solutions in social inequality (as meritocracy); and Rawls' Theory of Justice which finds solutions in social fairness and which tries to constrain social inequality. Rawls' theory is the more democratic, but at heart it is deliberately nonrational. It appears both theories are actually only partial solutions; Rawls in particular, includes unrealistic assumptions ruling out competition and envy in society. This analysis indicates that Santayana's approach has merit, pointing out that there are functional justifications...

Title: Argot and the Creation of Social Types in a Young Gay Community
Author-Name: Diane E. Taub
Author-Name: Robert G. Leger
Abstract: This study investigates the existence of various social types in a young gay community (I 7-24 age group) located in the southeastern United States. The social types are identified “emically” through the use of a specific domain of knowledge, gay argot. Gay terms and expressions are grouped using a method similar to factor analysis to locate specific dimensions of behavior in this community. A central concern of this paper is to determine how the concept of “binary opposition” operates among the resulting social types. Binary opposition, which has been identified in studies constructing other folk taxonomies (classification schemes created from the participants' perspective), means that for every entity created in the taxonomy there must be an opposite to that entity (an example would be the “butch-femme” distinction among lesbians). Next, through interviews we investigate the specific attributes that define each of the resulting social types. Finally, we employ componential analysis to determine if there...

Title: Integration of Organizational Behavior Within Higher Education: Four Levels                 of Needed Involvement for Upperclass and Graduate Curricula
Author-Name: Charles M. Vance
Abstract: There is an increasing amount of evidence, based upon curriculum reevaluation efforts, indicating the practical value of allowing the field of organizational behavior and related disciplines to step beyond their traditional academic boundaries and be integrated into other curricula, particularly in upperclass and graduate study. This paper describes four levels of instruction in organizational behavior which may be, all or in part, extremely valuable to the future professional success of students in programs outside of organizational behavior. This four-level instructional paradigm provides a conceptual framework for prescribing various kinds of learning experiences to enhance student development and professional preparation. General suggestions and guidelines for each level of the paradigm are given with documented cases and examples.

Abstract: Organizations are viewed as systems of governance. A distinction is made between formal structure and governance structure, and a network perspective is adopted to investigate the correspondence between them. This paper reports on an exploratory investigation of governance in an R&D laboratory in which decision-making power is found to be concentrated in an elite cadre of managers and experts who are also centrally located in the interaction network. The article discusses the utility of the concept of governance in enriching our perspective on organizational structuring.

Title: Cooperative Orientation, Trust, and Reciprocity
Author-Name: Barbara F. Meeker
Abstract: Two related processes are hypothesized to mediate the effect of cooperative orientation on cooperative behavior in a conflict situation: development of trust and development of positive reciprocity. Hypotheses derived from assumptions about these processes are tested in two experiments using a two-person game situation with one-way feedback. Independent variables are: orientation (to group vs. to individual outcomes): level of cooperative feedback (high vs. low); gender (male vs. female dyads; and, in one experiment, risk (Prisoner's Dilemma vs. No Risk goal structure); and, in the other experiment, order (behavior occurring early in the experiment vs. behavior occurring later). Dependent variables are choices and guesses about other's next choice. In one experiment, all subjects saw all conditions while in the other, only level of feedback changed for each subject. Results show a significant main effect of orientation, feedback, and risk on choices and correlation between guesses and choices in some but ...

Title: Specifying External Relations: Definition of and Actors in an Organization's Environment
Author-Name: Dave Ulrich
Abstract: Organization-environment concerns have become an increasingly important topic for both academic researchers and organizational practitioners. Unfortunately, some of the academic perspectives on organization-environment relations have emphasized the study of constructs within an organization's environment more than specific activities that an organization may adopt with actors in its environment. This paper proposes a three-step process for bridging academic research and organizational practice around organization-environment relations. First, distinctions between environments as nonmanipulable elements and niches as manipulable elements can be made. Resource dependence, efficiency, and uncertainty perspectives on environments have particular application at organization-niche interfaces. Ecology and uncertainty perspectives have relevance at the organization-environment interface. Second, niches can be at least partially identified through methods used to define strategic groups or populations. Classificat...

Abstract: The reliability and validity of the control graph approach to measuring organizational control structure and individual perceptions of control are examined through a review of previous studies and new data from managers, supervisors, and employees in six offices of a government agency. The results suggest that the approach has significant problems with reliability when used to measure organizational structure and problems with validity as a measure of individual perceptions of control structure. A theoretical account of the diversity of control mechanisms operating in organizations is developed to help explain why these problems exist.

Title: Intervention Against Loneliness in a Group of Elderly Women: A Process Evaluation
Author-Name: Lars Andersson
Abstract: This article describes a method (the CCC design) for undertaking social work with the elderly. The presenting symptom is the experience of loneliness. Also examined is how far the sample was representative of elderly people who had shown interest in institutional living and among whom the experience of loneliness could be expected, and also whether the intervention efforts were undertaken as specified. The results indicate that when subjects are randomly assigned to a treatment they have not sought, the participants, as compared to nonparticipants, seem to be somewhat higher in socioeconomic status and some of its correlates, but lower in self-esteem. On the whole the proposed method seems easy enough to execute and can accordingly be applied to other populations.

Title: Two Models for Conceptualizing the Attitude-Behavior Relationship
Author-Name: Chris L. Kleinke
Abstract: Two models were outlined for conceptualizing the relationship between attitudes and behaviors. Model I describes the process of influencing attitudes and predicting behaviors. Model II describes the process of influencing behaviors and predicting attitudes. Conclusions from research on the enhancement of the attitude-behavior relationship were integrated into the frameworks of the two models. Researchers interested in influencing attitudes were challenged to complete the link between attitude change -attitude measure - behavior. Researchers interested in influencing behaviors were challenged to complete the link between behavior change -attitude measure - future behavior. A paradigm shift was noted from attribution theories to the use of causal models for elucidating the attitude-behavior relationship.

Title: Interorganizational Conflict: A Review of an Emerging Field
Author-Name: Thomas DiStefano
Abstract: The sociology of conflict has remained outside the mainstream of scholarly inquiry throughout most of this century. Within the relatively new field of interorganizational relations, the study of conflict has suffered from a similar neglect. Assuming a structural-functional approach has informed most of the research thus far, this paper argues for a more unified and broader theoretical analysis as a step towards a general theory of interorganizational conflict. Examples from the research literature are shown to characterize an absence of empirical testing and a lack of consensus over key terms and objectives. Cross-national continuities in the study of interorganizational conflict are also discussed. Finally, some future directions for the development of the interorganizational study of conflict are discussed.

Title: A Sociobiological Examination of Management Theory Z
Author-Name: Robert B. Glassman
Abstract: A premise of theory Z is that learning is the only significant source of human socialization, however, the theory's aims of individual worker fulfillment and increased aggregate productivity in a pluralistic society may be enhanced if possible instinctual contributions to behavior patterns are considered. Ideological snares in “genetic determinism” and “cultural determinism”are described and an attempt is made to depolarize these alternatives. Basic ideas about evolution and inheritance are explained briefly, with evidences from familial studies, interspecies studies, and brain research. Because societies as pluralistic as the United States are historically unusual, achieving a dynamic equilibrium of multiethnic integration that spans generations requires an unusually creative and predictive effort. Ouchi's notion of the natural mentoring relationship is a possible seed of such creative evolutionary change, suggesting a need for greater general dissemination of occupational information, to help individual...

Title: A Symbolic Exchange Framework for the Development of Intimate Relationships
Author-Name: Timothy D. Stephen
Abstract: It is argued that a synthesis of social exchange theory and symbolic interactionism may provide a useful framework for understanding and predicting the development of intimate relationships. A study was conducted to test a central proposition from this synthetic, “symbolic exchange” framework. Evidence was found to support predictions that couples in progressed relationships will show greater symbolic interdependence and that symbolic inter dependence associates positively with relationship commitment and with relationship satisfaction. Findings from the study provided support for the symbolic exchange framework against competing predictions from filter theories of relationship development and provide justification for a program of research investigating the symbolic exchange model.

Title: Searching for the “Unleader”: Organizational Member Views                 on Leading Self-Managed Groups
Author-Name: Charles C. Manz
Author-Name: Henry P. Sims, Jr.
Abstract: The increasing adoption of the self-managed work group approach in organizations has created apuzzling paradox for leadership practice: How does one lead those that are supposed to lead themselves? Employee views at several organizational levels within a production plant that uses a self-managed work system are presented. The data were obtained from direct observation combined with another rather unique methodological approach (a variation of the nominal group technique; see Delbecq, Van de Ven, & Gustafson, 1975). This method of collection enabled each employee participating in the research to identify the specific behaviors he/she felt were important. Furthermore, employees rated, according to importance, a combined list of behaviors identified by a number of participating employees. Implications and conclusions are offered concerning the unique type of leader required in this new type of work system-the “unleader.”

Title: Spillover from Family to Work: The Neglected Side of the Work-Family Interface
Author-Name: Ann C. Crouter
Abstract: It is argued that while researchers have emphasized work's impact on the family, the family exerts important influences on the workplace that have been generally overlooked. This article draws upon evidence of family-to-work spillover from a recent exploratory field study in a large manufacturing plant. Semistructured interviews with 55 employees, both on the job and at home, revealed that most employees recognized that their family lives influenced them at work. Analyses of variance examining positive and negative spillover from home to work suggested that women with young children at home are most likely to report high levels of spillover, in contrast to mothers of older children and to fathers regardless of their position in the family life cycle.

Title: Perspectives on Intrafamily Violence
Author-Name: Peter C. Kratcoski
Abstract: This research involves a self-report study of youths who were victims, perpetrators, or observers of violence within the family. The sample includes students attending a senior high school, youths referred to a juvenile court but not incarcerated, and youths residing in juvenile institutions. Each young person completed a questionnaire which included demographic data, family functioning information, school data, and questions on the frequency of specific violent occurrences in the family setting during the past year. The research focuses on self-reported violent behavior these youths directed toward significant others and on violent behavior of adults toward those youths and other children in the family. The relationship between levels of family functioning and intrafamily violence was explored. Such occurrences as spouse-to-spouse violence, sibling-to-sibling violence, and child abuse were examined in terms of their relationship to the amount and direction of youth violence. The characteristics of famili...

Title: Continuity in Poverty Along Family Lines: A Reexamination of the                 Intergenerational Cycle of Poverty
Author-Name: Hagith R. Shlonsky
Abstract: The phrase “cycle of poverty” conveys the idea that the persistence of poverty generation after generation is a consequence of the transmission of poverty from poor parents to their children. This paper challenges this idea and indicates, instead, that intergenerational continuity in poverty occurs selectively, both among and within poor families. It is suggested that there are identifiable principles of selection into poverty along family lines. We present data on the socioeconomic positions of parents and all their adult offspring in a sample of poor and near-poor families in Jerusalem. Inter- and intragenerational continuity in low social positions is examined with respect to the four variables of education, occupation, welfare, and housing. The different patterns of continuity demonstrated in each of the four variables we examine illustrate two principles of selection into low social positions along family lines.

Title: Once More unto the System
Author-Name: S. Glaser
Abstract: It is argued that the concept of “system” is poorly conceptualized largely because of its definitional roots in set theory. Starting from the viewpoint of dimensional analysis, several heuristics to guide the identification and mapping of systems are presented and a theoretical solution to determining system boundaries is outlined.

Title: A Type A-B Person-Work Environment Interaction Model for Examining                 Occupational Stress and Consequences
Author-Name: John M. Ivancevich
Author-Name: Michael T. Matteson
Abstract: The physiological, psychological, and organizational effects of occupational stress are not only costly to individual employees and managers, but also to the organization, society, and family. This paper examines the notion of interaction between the employee and the work environment. Stress is defined in terms of a relationship between a person and the work environment. Instead of using a global model of person-environment interaction, a more specific approach incorporating the notion of Type A-B behavior pattern and Type A-B work environment is developed. The paper examines the theory, research, and implications of a person-environment model as an explanation of occupational stress and various behavioral, psychological, and organizational consequences. The model is suggested as a formulation of a dynamic-interactional view that emphasizes the reciprocal person-environment processes found in the workplace. It is proposed that the interaction between Type A-B behavior patterns and Type A-B work environmen...

Title: The Attenuating Function of Myth in Human Understanding
Author-Name: N. V. Jackson
Author-Name: P. Carter
Abstract: Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety demands the insertion of a variety attenuator in any homeostatic system to regulate the relationship between the high variety environment and the low variety monitor. We argue that, in the system which is constituted by man and his environment, this function is performed by myth, i.e., that myth is a variety attenuator. The nature of the concept of myth is explored, and a relationship traced between the functions of classical myth and contemporary modes of understanding. Some implications follow, in particular, that serious dysfunctions inevitably occur as a result of overattenuation where the environmental variety increases at a greater rate than man's ability to understand it, as in the present technological age.

Title: Determinants of Attitudes toward Taxation in Britain
Author-Name: Adrian Furnham
Abstract: This study sets out to investigate the relationship between demographic variables (age, sex, education, vote, and income), psychological beliefs (alienation, Protestant work ethic, and conservatism) and attitudes toward taxation. Over 250 people from a variety of backgrounds completed a number of standardized self-report measures. A factor analysis of the scale revealed five clearly interpretable factors which were later computed into five subscale scores. Analysis of variance showed that the psychological belief variables most differentiated subjects' attitudes toward taxation. A canonical correlational analysis revealed that education, vote, alienation, and Protestant work ethic were most clearly related to the various taxation attitudes. These results are discussed in terms of the previous literature in this area and various suggestions for future research are considered.

Title: Group Identification: The Same Thing to All People?
Author-Name: Rupert Brown
Author-Name: Jennifer Williams
Abstract: The hypothesis derived from Social Identity Theory that strength of group identification would be positively correlated with intergroup differentiation is tested. Data was obtained from 55 workers in a bakery using semistructured interviews. Analysis showed clear differentiation between the factory departments by subgroups of workers along dimensions of perceived contribution to the running of the factory and expressed friendliness towards out-groups. However, multiple regression analyses revealed that the relationship between group identification and intergroup differentiation was not consistently positive but varied between subgroup and between attitude dimensions. The most reliable predictor of differentiation, consistent with Realistic Conflict Theory, was perceived conflict between ingroup and outgroups.

Title: A Methodological Inquiry of Organizational Noise in Sociotechnical Systems
Author-Name: C. Ciborra
Author-Name: P. Migliarese
Author-Name: P. Romano
Abstract: Organizational noise concerns the character and consequences of out-of-the-norm events which occur in organizations. The paper defines organizational noise as the unexpected variety which operators of the technical system have to face. The investigation of organizational noise is of twofold importance. First, it helps the analyst to understand how the work organization really functions. Second, it points out the existence of or the possibilities for implementing alternative organizational forms. New organizational forms may emerge from the organized behavior of members facing fluctuations. Two distinctive work-related phenomena are also investigated: self-regulative behavior which absorbs noise and self-organization, for which noise is exploited as a source of new configurations rather then being eliminated. Finally, some implications for methods of organizational analysis are developed.

Title: A Skills Exchange for Unemployed People
Author-Name: Barbara Senior
Author-Name: John B. Naylor
Abstract: This paper reports the results of a study of a voluntary skills exchange for unemployed adults in Liverpool. It combines investigation at the organizational level with an interview survey of satisfactions gained by 60 members. Questions posed are how far a skills exchange might go in alleviating the adverse effects of unemployment and then how effective the particular organization was at achieving its potential. Results showed that members attached high importance to the satisfaction of social and psychological needs either within the exchange or in employment. The average satisfaction gained from membership fell short of this. For the small group who were active in the exchange, members were engaged in the equivalent of part-time work. But the broad ideals of the organization and the unfamiliarity of the decision-making setting made it difficult to recruit and retain new members and, hence, increase the organization's impact.

Title: Perceived Job Attributes, Job Satisfaction, and Psychological Distress: A                 Comparison of Working Men and Women
Author-Name: Carl D'Arcy
Author-Name: John Syrotuik
Author-Name: C. M. Siddique
Abstract: This paper evaluates the importance of perceived job attributes in accounting for previously observed sex differences in job satisfaction and psychological distress. This study sample consisted of 854 males and 272 females who were working full time. The results indicated that male ratings of job satisfaction were equivalent to those of females, while women scored higher than men on a measure of psychological distress. However, when job attribute perceptions were held constant, female job satisfaction was significantly higher than that of males and there were no sex differences in levels of psychololgical distress. Only marginally significant sex-by-job attribute interactions were found for job satisfaction and psychological distress, suggesting similar bases of satisfaction and mental health across sex. The results are discussed in terms of female expectations regarding employment and the importance of role-related stress in accounting for sex differences in psychological morbidity.

Title: Upward Information Flow in Organizations: Review and Conceptual Analysis
Author-Name: Michael J. Glauser
Abstract: This paper reviews the upward communication literature and identifies factors which facilitate or impede upward information flow in organizations. Studies are classified into the following categories: (1) subordinate characteristics, (2) superior characteristics, (3) the superior/subordinate relationship, (4) message characteristics, and (5) structural characteristics. A model is presented to summarize factors associated with the frequency, accuracy, and utility of upward communication. The model is integrated into a broader information processing framework which emphasizes the role of upward communication in managerial and unit effectiveness. A number of directions for future research on upward information flow are suggested.

Title: A Research Synthesis of Gender and Social Class as Correlates of Subjective Well-Being
Author-Name: Marilyn J. Haring
Author-Name: William A. Stock
Author-Name: Morris A. Okun
Abstract: Meta-analytic techniques were used to synthesize findings from the extant empirical literature on gender and social class as predictors of subjective well-being among U.S. adults. Based upon Rubin's (1979) research, we tested a family of hypotheses that gender, relative to social class, accounted for more variation in subjective well-being. Examination of zero-order and first-order effect sizes revealed that men have slightly higher subjective well-being than women and that, while gender is a statistically significant predictor of subjective well-being, it accounts for little variance. Three measures of social class, composite socioeconomic status, occupational status, and income also are significantly related to subjective well-being on the zero-order level; but that relation is reduced when gender is used as a covariate. Overall, across the studies we synthesized, gender does not transcend social class as a major determinant of subjective well-being.

Abstract: Longitudinal data were collected to explore the relationships among loss of commitment, absenteeism, and employee turnover. Using a median-based approach to investigate the structure of withdrawal among 52 nurses and 36 accountants, it was found that both loss of commitment and increased absenteeism preceded turnover. Decreases in commitment were better predictors of turnover than increases in absenteeism, although stayers in both occupational groups were distinguished by unchanging patterns of zero median days absent. Implications for the progression theory of job withdrawal are discussed.

Abstract: An examination of the limits to the cultural awareness of immigrant therapists raises questions about the context and boundaries of “professional” knowledge. The paper examines alternative models of the therapeutic encounter available to therapists and the influence of personal background and experience on the therapists' actual views of that encounter. Concentrating on verbal expressions as reflections of the therapists' conceptualizations of themselves within the therapeutic encounter, the study finds that most of the therapists seem to ignore or gloss cultural differences in talking about their work, while referring frequently to these same differences in talking about their personal experiences as immigrants.

Title: Social Behavior of Field Independents and Dependents in an Organic Group

Abstract: This study hypothesized that the social behavioral of field independent-dependent (Witkin, 1978) subjects in a noncontrived organic group will differ along the task emotionally-expressive dimensions identified by Bales and Cohen (1979). In addition, the study sought to establish discriminant validity for the field independent-cognitive style variable by contrasting it with apparently similar but conceptually different variables, i.e., dogmatism and sociability. Behaviors of field independents and dependents were observed over 25 1 ½-hr sessions, spread over a 4-month period. Social behaviors of participants were rated by both participating and nonparticipating observers at the middle and at the end of sessions by Bales' Interpersonal Rating Forms. Field independence and dependence was found not related to dogmatism or sociability. As hypothesized, field dependents behaved in a responsive, task-oriented, problem-solving mode while field independents behaved in a social-emotional rebellious and resistant mo...

Title: Cooperation Theory and Organizations
Author-Name: Dean Tjosvold
Abstract: Organizational researchers have largely ignored cooperation theory in their analyses of social interaction in organizations. Considerable experimental and field research by social and educational psychologists indicates the dynamics of cooperatively (positively), competitively (negatively), and individualistically (independently) linked goals and suggests their consequences on relationships and productivity. Results overall indicate that cooperation facilitates social interaction and productivity. However, studies done in organizational contexts with representative tasks are needed to generalize confidently to organizational practice. Organizational researchers can extend cooperation theory to understand the dynamics between superiors and subordinates and the relationships among departments. To make cooperation theory useful, knowledge is needed to identify conditions that affect how organizational members perceive their goal interdependence.

Title: The Experience of Interpersonal Touch During a Personal Growth Program: A                 Factor Analytic Approach
Author-Name: David J. A. Edwards
Abstract: Twenty male and 16 female psychology students who participated in a personal growth program in which structures involving interpersonal touch were used filled out a questionnaire evaluating their experience of touching and being touched. Factor analysis yielded five factors. The first, taking up 50% of the variance was labeled “openness to exploration of self-expression and intimacy through touch” and measured the extent to which participants experienced touch as nurturant, celebratory, ludic, and cathartic. The second factor was “perception of touch as threatening” and was independent of the first. Factor 3 was a sexual arousal factor, Factor 4 measured a “serious, caring stance,” and Factor 5 measured perceptionn of oneself as threatening when touching.” Males had higher scores on Factor 3 and females on Factor 1. Correlations between the touch factors and the scales of the Personal Orientation Inventory and the Howarth Personality Questionnaire were also computed and the significant correlations are pr...

Abstract: This paper examines circumstances under which managers exercise upward influence in order to achieve individual and organizational goals. One hundred and thirteen managers completed a questionnaire describing the frequency with which they influenced their superiors for individual and organizational reasons. Managers also provided information about their own abilities and power in their organizations. Finally, managers described the strategies used to influence their superiors. Principal findings were that (a) managers who exercised upward influence to achieve organizational goals evaluated their own work favorably, directed nonroutinized work units, and had power in their organizations; (b) staff managers exercised upward influence to achieve individual goals more often than line managers; and (c) influence strategies used by managers varied as a function of goals sought from superiors.

Title: Political Interest, Political Information Search, and Ideological Homogeneity                 as a Function of Sociopolitical Ideology: A Tale of Three Theories
Author-Name: Jim Sidanius
Abstract: The relative plausibilities of three theories concerning the relationship between sociopolitical ideology and certain personality variables were examined using 783 Swedish high school students: authoritarian personality theory, extremism theory, and context theory. The three theories were compared by examining degree of information search and interest in politics as a function of sociopolitical ideology and ideological homogeneity as a function of parental educational level. The main results showed that: (1) The relationships between degree of information search and political interest on the one hand, and sociopolitical ideology on the other, were primarily curvilinear indicating greater interest in politics and greater information search for both “left” and “right extremists” as compared to moderates on a number of ideological dimensions. (2) Subjects with well-educated parents were more ideologically heterogeneous than subjects with poorly educated parents. These differences were more marked for males t...

Abstract: The conclusion by Mann (1970) that unidimensionality of political liberalism exists among groups who are very interested and/or active in the sociopolitical processes was investigated. Two national samples of clergy for the years 1972 and 1978 from six Protestant denominations revealed a high degree of interrelationship among items pertaining to topical issues. In factor analysis, only one significant factor emerged. Unidimensionality of political liberalism-conservatism appears as a reasonable assessment of the positions of these clergy concerning sociopolitical issues.

Abstract: This study investigated potential personality predispositions to interpersonal conflict-handling behavior. The design of the study represents an advancement over previous research as both males and females were studied in a controlled context of conflict introduced via a business simulation game. Jungian personality dimensions and conflict-handling modes were assessed and a significant relationship was found between subjects' decision-making preference (thinking-feeling) and their choice of conflict-handling behavior. Some sex differences in conflict-handing behavior were also found. The findings of this study have implications for conflict management, personnel selection, and placement of individuals in organizations.

Title: The Politics of Problems: Intersubjectivity in Defining Powerful Others
Author-Name: Sue Jones
Abstract: This paper is concerned with how persons in organizations, tackling what they define as complex problems, define others as significant in terms of their perceived power. Using a particular case as an illustration, the author argues for attending to the complex intersubjectivity of definitions of; powerful others, involving not only patterns and consensualities but also significant diversity in the theories and values different individuals bring to understanding and predicting their political environments and the key actors within them. She will also argue that such a perspective has significant practical implications for OD consultants, whose effectiveness in the client-consultant relationship often crucially depends on understanding and negotiating with the internal political concerns and theorizing of their clients.

Title: Perceived Humor and Social Network Patterns in a Sample of Task-Oriented                 Groups: A Reexamination of Prior Research
Author-Name: W. Jack Duncan
Abstract: Nine diverse, task-oriented groups were studied in an effort to relate humor networks and interpersonal relations. Data were collected by means of a self-administered, structured questionnaire. The results did not confirm the assumption that rank-and-file employees are more actively involved in the humor network than are managers. However, in cases where managers were included, they were first accepted as friends. Unlike prior studies, this analysis revealed that when managers were accepted as friends and “admitted” to the humor network they were frequently overchosen as initiators and foci of work-related joking. There was strong evidence that cohesive and noncohesive work groups possess different humor patterns. Interpersonally, overchosen members relative to one criterion of interpersonal relations were overchosen relative to several criteria. Also, in many cases, group members who occupied key humor roles were overchosen on one or more criteria of social interaction. Humor networks were identified as ...

Title: A Comparison of the Quality of Work Experience in Government and Private Organizations

Author-Name: Philip Mock
Abstract: A total of 5979 employees from a number of Australian government and private sector organizations participated in a survey measuring the quality of their work experience. This article examines the differences found between government and private sector employees' ratings of their work experience. The results of this study indicate that the government employees rate the quality of their work experience significantly below the level of their private sector counterparts. The most significant difference in the ratings was between high status government vs. high status private employees, with high status private employees rating their work experience well above the equivalent government group. An association was also found between the type of organization and employees' motivation for work. People working in public organizations were motivated more by factors such as providing a service or product that helps other people or self-development/self-fulfillment than private sector employees. Those in private organ...

Abstract: The nature of the relationship between labor force participation and fertility is examined for 172 families comprising a marriage cohort. The results show that labor force participation and fertility are spuriously related in that they are under the common influence of sex-role norms, attitudes toward the wife working, and the value or importance of children for the spouses. Comparisons are made among social psychological models, wherein either the husband or wife provides information as they perceive their relationship, and a sociological model wherein group constructs are formed with the husband and wife acting as informants on the pattern of norms guiding their relation. A structural equation methodology is employed to better model measurement error and errors in equations simultaneously.

Author-Name: Thomas N. Martin
Abstract: A new source of job stress, inability to leave, was investigated with role over-load, role ambiguity, participation in decision making, equity, and group cohesiveness and support for their predictive impact on acute and chronic mental health problems. Canonical correlation analysis was performed on this predictor-criteria framework across two hospitals consisting of 140 and 95 respondents, respectively. One significant canonical variate was derived for each hospital. Inability to leave one's job and role overload predicted acute and chronic mental health problems in both hospitals. Role ambiguity and lower group cohesiveness and support also predicted both health phenomenon in the smaller hospital. Discussion focused on the implications, limitations, and conclusions of these findings.

Title: Education and Work Satisfaction
Author-Name: Clifford Mottaz
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between education and overall work satisfaction. Data from 1385 workers representing a variety of different occupational groups are analyzed. Basically, the findings indicate that education has an indirect positive effect, but a direct negative effect on overall work satisfaction. More specifically, the data suggests that education may increase work satisfaction by increasing work rewards. Moreover, it appears that most of the educational payoff is in terms of intrinsic rewards, e.g., task autonomy, task significance, and task involvement. On the other hand, the findings also indicate that education which does not lead to greater intrinsic rewards may significantly reduce work satisfaction. Thus, for workers who report equal levels of intrinsic rewards, work satisfaction tends to be considerably lower among the better educated workers. This effect appears to be due to the higher aspirations or work values associated with increased education.

Title: Sex Discrimination and Rewards in a Public Comprehensive University
Author-Name: Delbert Ervin
Author-Name: Barbara J. Thomas
Author-Name: Mary Zey-Ferrell
Abstract: Baldridge, Cutis, Ecker, and Riley (1978) posit that differences in academic rewards for men and women faculty are largely due to differences in the type of employing institution, with males being employed in more prestigious institutions than females. To examine their hypothesis that sex differences do not exist in a single type of institution, we construct four regression models, one each for the rewards of type of appointment, tenure, rank, and salary. Twenty-three background characteristics including sex, work activities, and productivity variables are used as predictors. Reward variables which theoretically precede in time the reward being analyzed are also included as predictors of that reward. Data were collected from personnel files, institutional records, interviews with administrators, and faculty questionnaires. The analyses produced four strong but heterogeneous models of faculty rewards. Thus, there is no single academic reward structure; rather, four different reward structures exist. The he...

Title: Do Legitimacy of Supervisor and Reward Contingency Interact in Prediction of                 Work Behavior?
Author-Name: Catherine B. Smith
Abstract: The study examined the importance of different bases of legitimacy of authority upon conformity and performance of temporary employees engaged in a realistic technical task. Task supervisors varied in apparent technical and administrative expertise. The contingency of rewards upon performance was systematically varied to separate the impact of expected reward contingency from variations in bases of legitimacy. Subjects were hired as temporary workers in a laboratory experiment to test these propositions, and to build upon an earlier laboratory study by Evan and Zelditch.

Title: Organizational/Managerial Control Processes: A Reconceptualization of the                 Linkage between Technology and Performance
Author-Name: Nestor K. Ovalle, II
Abstract: Literature pertaining to the definition and delineation of managerial control is reviewed. In addition, literature positing a potential link between technology and the process of control is assessed. It is evident that there is wide variability in how managerial control has been defined and delineated; however, it appears that there is common agreement on several key underlying components. There is also evidence that control may be an important link between technology and behavior/performance. A conceptual frame-work for this linkage is presented and discussed.

Title: Job Satisfaction among Australian Nurses
Author-Name: David E. Gray
Abstract: This study examines job satisfaction among a sample of Australian nurses. Job satisfaction is considered in the context of nursing's position in the medical division of labor and the various political strategies that the occupation has pursued to improve its status. Examination of the data reveals that seniority, rank, sex, and type of basic training have the strongest effects on job satisfaction. Job technology and interactions between job technology, education, and postbasic training are also significant. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of the political strategies nursing has used to improve the status of the occupation and the satisfaction of nursing work.

Title: The Hidden Face of Shyness: A Message from the Shy for Researchers and Practitioners
Author-Name: Peter R. Harris
Abstract: In employing techniques designed to facilitate the representation of responses in purely numerical form, psychologists run the risk of overlooking certain aspects of the phenomenon they are investigating. Letters writtenin response to a recent television program on shyness were examined with this in mind, and it is argued that this correspondence reveals a belief among the correspondents that shyness is not taken seriously by others, an aspect of the problem that has indeed been overlooked by psychologists working in the area. Moreover, this belief appears to heavily influence the responses of the correspondents to their difficulties, limiting the extent to which they are prepared to seek the advice and help of others, and trapping them in a spiral of isolation and ignorance that apparently serves to exacerbate their difficulties. It also contrasts sharply with their own accounts of the problems shyness brings. As well as adding substance to the more rarefied numerical accounts that characterize the psych...

Title: Social Identity in Northern Ireland
Author-Name: Ed Cairns
Author-Name: G. W. Mercer
Abstract: In an attempt to explore the importance of various religious ethnic and political social identities in Northern Ireland, 991 young people (60% Protestants, 40% Catholics) were asked to choose among various bipolar adjectives and then to rank order the terms chosen. The results indicated that the Catholic-Protestant dimension was the most frequently chosen and most highly rated ethnopolitical category but that some cross-cutting occurred on all categories. Further, it was suggested that while the term Catholic may carry surplus meaning from the religious domain, the label Protestant may be rather more clearly thought of as a purely ethnopolitical term.

Title: Cooperativeness and Advancement of Managers: An International Perspective
Author-Name: Eliezer Rosenstein
Abstract: This article examines the relationship between cooperative tendencies of middle managers and their rate of advancement in organizational settings. Data was collected by means of three independent simulation exercises, which were administered in 12 national groups. Altogether, 700-2000 managers participated, depending on the specific exercise. The results indicate that, on a global basis, organizations seem to reward their managers more for noncooperativeness than for cooperativeness, but national differences are important. In Scandinavia and Japan positive correlations between cooperativeness and rate of advancement outnumber the negative ones, and in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands they are equal. It is suggested in the conclusions that probably cooperative managers as such are often not considered most effective by their superiors. However, there is need for further elaboration of the contingency perspective which focuses on critical circumstances that influence the outcome of the cooperative beh...

Abstract: A model of the relationship between feedback obstruction and employee turnover intent is proposed and tested. Eighty-nine pharmaceutical sales representatives completed questionnaires measuring the value of feedback, feedback obstruction across five sources of information, anxiety, (dis)satisfaction, and turnover intent. Results demonstrate that the obstruction of several feedback sources is significantly correlated with anxiety, (dis)satisfaction, and turnover intentions. A regression analysis reveals that self- and supervisory feedback obstruction bear the strongest relationships to turnover intent. Interestingly, the self-feedback obstruction relationship is not in the predicted direction.

Title: A Comparison of Four Information Processing Models of Leadership and Social Perceptions
Author-Name: Robert G. Lord
Author-Name: George M. Alliger
Abstract: This study examined the validity of four alternative information processing models which specify how interaction behavior related to social perceptions in a small group problem-solving experiment. Results indicated that leadership and social power perceptions were based on relative, as opposed to absolute, frequency of behaviors and that this relationship was eliminated when behavior conflicted with experimenter provided behavioral norms. Limited support was found for the expectations that leadership perceptions depended on the prototypicality of behavior and on how well behaviors matched the interdependence requirements of experimental tasks. Results further suggested that raters' causal ascriptions to ratees may have been derived from leadership perceptions rather than being crucial in forming leadership perceptions, which supports a categorization model of leadership.

Title: Women in a Man's World: Sexual Harassment
Author-Name: Heather Hemming
Abstract: Sexual harassment is defined and surveys used to establish its extent, consequences, and most prevalent characteristics of harassers and victims. The psychodynamics of sexual harassment maintains an unequal power structure between the sexes, forcing women into compliance with nurturant or sexual aspects of the traditional sex role. Resistance to group pressure gives a woman the role of deviant. Characteristic group responses to a deviant result in isolation or severe sexual harassment. Refusal to comply with sexual harassment elicits aggression and denigration of the woman. Group responses to a victim create a hostile environment with an increase in the likelihood of further sexual harassment and denigration. ft is possible for work groups to develop sexual equality and integration by changing the male task directive/female nurturant or courting repertoires to express equal power and affiliation between the sexes. Organizational policies to encourage integration are suggested.

Title: Male and Female Students' Perceptions of Their Academic Environment and                 Future Career Plans: Implications for Higher Education
Author-Name: Sharlene Hesse-Biber
Abstract: A total of 298 male and 634 female students completed a study questionnaire in 1981. Some important gender differences were found regarding students' career goals and their perceptions of the academic environment. Female respondents selected careers traditionally defined as acceptable for women and expressed less confidence that they would be successful in their work. Students' work and life style goals were shaped primarily by family and peers. While most students held positive views of college life, they credited the academic environment with little influence upon their career goals. Women and men differed in their perceptions of academic life. Women enjoyed their classes more and they claimed better study habits and a greater involvement with their courses. Despite these advantages, women consistently perceived themselves as more reluctant than men to participate in class discussions, less willing to speak out and question their teachers, and less likely to feel they could “hold their own” in discussio...

Title: Coping with Work-Related Stress

Author-Name: A. Keenan
Abstract: This study examined the coping behavior of a sample of young professional engineers in response to stress “incidents” experienced at work. Subjects were specifically asked to limit their recall to an incident occurring within the preceding 14 days. A primary analysis was made of the coping behavior exhibited, from which five classes of coping behavior were derived. Coping behavior was then examined in relation to the subjective appraisal of the stress encountered, and to characteristics of both the individual experiencing the stress and of the work environment in which it occurred. Analysis indicated that all three predictor groups (stress appraisal, individual, and envrionmental characteristics) were important in relation to the coping behaivor reported. Evidence also emerged suggesting that certain types of coping response are behavior correlates of particular individual characteristics, whereas others were more likely to be related to differences in the environmental context and to the way in which the...

Abstract: By counting publications in the American Education Research Journal (1968-1977) and the Journal of Educational Psychology (1958-1977) 62 prolific scholars were identified. These scholars provided information by questionnaire about their communication patterns, academic background, their paradigms, shifts in research focus, time spent on various professional activities, age, and years of training. These scholars also provided information as to persons who had been influential in their research and persons with whom they had interacted frequently about their research. Data about the persons listed and citation data were used to test the invisible college hypothesis. This hypothesis was not robustly supported.

Title: Aging and Identity Management in a Norwegian Elderly Home
Author-Name: Anne Karen Bjelland
Abstract: In this paper, I present some aspects of the residents' situation in an elderly home in Norway. The aim is to give an empirical example of how a group of aged people, living in a setting dominated by the consequences of advanced age, try to make sense of their lives through continued efforts to establish a positive self-image and personal identity, in face of both their own and their co-residents' declining health and death. In spite of the objectives set forth by the Ministry of Social Affairs, the life in an elderly home poses various restraints on the residents' adaptation patterns and identity management. However, the residents do not passively accept their situation, but continuously seek solutions to the dilemmas with which they are confronted. They do this by both adapting in special ways and constantly producing justifications for and interpretations of their own behavior and that of others. Within the constraints posed by the institutional setting, the physical and social environment, they establ...

Title: Psychological Theory as Intergroup Perspective: A Comparative Analysis of                 “Scientific” and “Lay” Accounts of Crowd Events
Author-Name: Stephen Reicher
Author-Name: Jonathan Potter
Abstract: The central argument of this paper is that the popular success of crowd psychology is in part due to its correspondence with the perspective of outgroup members. This is supported by a comparative analysis of traditional crowd psychology and lay accounts of crowd events drawn from street disturbances in St. Pauls, Bristol, in 1980. Five basic types of error are identified in crowd psychology past and present. These are: (1) the abstraction of crowd episodes from their intergroup conflicts, (2) the failure to deal with underlying dynamic processes, (3) exaggeration of the anonymity of crowd members, (4) failure to understand the motives of crowd members, and (5) an overwhelming emphasis on the negativity of crowd events. Analysis of accounts of the St. Pauls disturbance reveals the centrality of these forms of error in outgroup members' versions of events. In contrast, crowd members tended to draw upon very different accounts which stress the meaningfulness of crowd action, solidarity, and positive emotion...

Title: Evaluation and the Impact of Information Technologies on People in Organizations
Author-Name: Frank Blackler
Author-Name: Colin Brown
Abstract: Micro-electronic-based technologies will have profound effects on the relationships between people, machines, work, and productivity. Present policies towards them, however, place an overwhelming emphasis on technological and economic considerations. An “innovation approach” to the diffusion of technology predominates, linked to a unitary concept of organization, an antagonistic view of participation and efficiency, and a short-term “cost substitution” approach to evaluation. One alternative is suggested by the emphasis in the organization theory literature that organizations are social rather than rational systems containing a plurality of interest groups. On this view, it is as unrealistic to attempt to segregate technical and economic considerations from social and psychological ones, as it is to separate short-term effects from long-term outcomes. Evaluation is seen as a central part of a complex and incremental planning process. Yet this approach is often presented as little more than a strategy to m...

Abstract: Researchers lack adequate feedback on the utilization of their findings at the local level. Following an earlier study of farmers' markets with dual objectives of contributing to theory and practice, a 4-year follow-up was undertaken to document the flow of information that occurred and if and how the results were used. The follow-up indicated that the research was utilized far more at the local level than was known to the researchers, and that much of the usage involved public relations and promotion activities, rather than policy formation and guidance.

Author-Name: Peter J. Zucker
Author-Name: Everett L. Worthington, Jr.
Author-Name: Donelson R. Forsyth
Abstract: Increases in empathy produced by participation in a short-term empathy skills training group were assessed by contrasting trained and untrained individuals' attributions about salient and nonsalient stimulus persons. Although previous evidence suggests that empathy limits the observer's tendency to over-attribute behavior to personal rather than situational causes, trained subjects underestimated the impact of situational determinants on behavior, especially when observing salient actors. These findings suggest that the early stages of empathy training in structured groups may be characterized by losses in empathic orientation, perhaps as a result of increases in listening skills.

Title: A Subculture of Parasuicide?
Author-Name: Stephen D. Platt
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to devise an empirical test of the hypothesis that geographical areas with high parasuicide rates (HRAs) are characterized by a distinctive subculture which is expected to facilitate parasuicidal behavior to a considerable degree. A secondary hypothesis states that cultural differences (“cultural distance”) between parasuicides and the general population will be relatively more pronounced in areas with low parasuicide rates (LRAs) than in HRAs. Data were gathered on four separate samples in Edinburgh: two groups of parasuicides, one from an HRA, the other from three LRAs, and two groups of population controls matched pairwise with each parasuicide by sex, age, and area of residence. Four instruments, of which three were specially designed for the study, were used to test middle-order hypotheses relating to specific elements of the cultural system. These instruments are fully described. Empirical evidence undoubtedly supports the prediction of a meaning system in the HRA which...

Title: Security and Autonomy within Marriage
Author-Name: Tamara Kotler
Abstract: Intensive interviews with 60 men and women in their first marriages provide data for an examination of propositions derived from attachment theory. The cases were drawn from the Melbourne subsample of an Australian national sample and were equally divided between men and women respondents and the first three stages of the family life cycle. A series of regression analyses, based on respondents' accounts of their parental families, supports the expectation that appropriate parental care contributes to healthy personality development in children and, in turn, to satisfactory marital relationships. These data suggest that respondents construe the patterning of their lives in terms which accord with attachment theory. Furthermore, strong marital relations are indicated as being therapeutic for a partner whose early experiences of care were less than optimal.

Title: A Retrospective View of a Hospital-Wide Group Relations Training Program:                 Costs, Consequences, and Conclusions
Author-Name: Roy W. Menninger
Abstract: This article retrospectively examines the impact of an organization-wide group relations conference experience for professional staff training in a private mental hospital. More than a decade later, the residual assessment of the experience by a large majority of participants is strongly positive, both in regard to personal and professional benefits, and the impact on the organization itself. The conferences provided the organization with an approach to the trials of transition through a difficult period, and led to the development of several important new programs. The experience, however, was not entirely positive. Enthusiasm for the new knowledge of group dynamics led to an inappropriate use of groups as a procrustean method for managing hospital administrative issues, solving personal and professional problems, and treating psychiatric patients. These problems were intensified by the simultaneous introduction of a therapeutic community concept into the hospital. The indiscriminate application of confe...

Title: Culture and Conformity: An Essay on Individual Adaptation in Centralized Bureaucracy
Author-Name: Steven P. Feldman
Abstract: The cultural aspects of organizations have been mostly overlooked in the study of management. This is particularly important because the Protestant ethic which organized the sociopsychological matrix for the industrial revolution no longer commands enough authority to continue organizing individual motivation and societal needs. Thus, local solutions have evolved to deal with cultural ambiguity and they have evolved with little thought as to their implications. In this essay, the cultural aspects of interpersonal relations in a telephone company are analyzed. This analysis was carried out during a year long full-time fieldwork period which employed participant observation, structured and semi-structured interviews, and document analysis for data collection purposes. Strong demands for conformity were found to dominate interpersonal relations. Three types of response to these demands were discovered: acceptance based on conscious suppression of personal interests, acceptance based on unconscious distortion...

Abstract: This paper argues that factory layouts have social functions over and above the purely technical ones and that such functions can be described with accuracy. It relates the fundamental design choices that are identified by the analysis to the spatial requirements of organizations. Thus, it suggests that the design olfactory space has strategic effects on the culture of workplaces. Spatial variables are based on the theory of space syntax developed at the Unit for Architectural Studies, University College London. Measures of interaction are based on network theory. The analysis rests on evidence from six case studies of factories located in England and in Greece.

Title: A Balanced Distance: Aspects of Marital Quality
Author-Name: Tamara Kotler
Abstract: The present study is concerned with changes in marital satisfaction associated with the family career. It is based on a cross-sectional sample of 60 cases, equally divided between men and women respondents and the first three stages of the family life cycle. Factor analysis of several questionnaire measures of aspects of the marital relationship resulted in a general factor of marital quality with interpersonal features yielding the highest loadings. Two-way analysis of variance was applied to scores on this factor resulting in a significant stage effect (F = 3.23, p < 0.05) which was largely due to differences between stages within the sit of women respondents. Further interpretations drew on representative cases drawn from two extremes of the evaluative dimension. The findings accord with previous studies in emphasizing the importance of companionship and role sharing for marital quality. The value of establishing a balance of closeness and distance is noted.

Title: Relationship of Job Stress to Job Performance: A Study of Managers and                 Blue-Collar Workers
Author-Name: Muhammad Jamal
Abstract: Four types of relationships were proposed between job stress and performance: curvilinear/U-shaped, negative linear, positive linear, and no relationship between the two. Data were collected from middle managers (N = 227) and blue-collar workers (N = 283) employed in a large Canadian organization. Bivariate multiple regression and hierarchical multiple regression analyses generally supported the prevalence of a negative linear relationship between job stress and supervisory ratings of performance. Employees' organizational commitment significantly moderated over 50% of the relationships between job stress and measures of job performance in both managerial and blue-collar samples. Implications of the findings are discussed for future research in the area of job stress.

Title: Work Design and Supervisory Practice: A Model
Author-Name: John L. Cordery
Author-Name: Toby D. Wall
Abstract: In this paper it is argued that contemporary theoretical approaches to work design and redesign neglect the role played by supervision, and that this has been an impediment to both research and practice. From an examination of the literature in the area, relevant aspects of supervisory behavior are identified and a model presented which relates job characteristics to supervisory practices. Finally, the model is discussed in the context of leadership research.

Title: An Exploration of the Relationship between Performance, Decision Making, and Structure
Author-Name: Conrad J. Kasperson
Abstract: A management simulation exercise plus a field study were used to analyze the relationship between performance, decision-making processes, and emergent organizational structure. It was found that lower performing organizations relied more on “inspired” decisions, took less time for the process, and were more formally structured. However, the increase in structure and lowered satisfaction tended to follow performance changes rather than cause them.

Title: Probing Behavioral Patterns of Structuring Daily Life
Author-Name: Mary Dean Lee
Abstract: The development of a methodology for accurate observation, identification, and representation of characteristic patterns of structuring work and personal life is described. The results of two studies are used to test the reliability and validity of the methodology. Different types and subtypes of life space structure are proposed on the basis of observations of similar configurations of subject scores on behavioral dimensions of movement through time and space, engagement in activity, and involvement in social interaction. Demographic and life satisfaction characteristics of subjects in the various pattern types and structure types are examined for trends.

Abstract: An extended case study of a recent merger between two mutual savings banks is studied from the perspective of organizational culture. Data on organizational culture and organizational climate are analyzed from pre- and post-merger interviews, observations, archival information, and survey questionnaires. Results suggest that even within the same industry, there are major difficulties in trying to merge two different though viable organizational cultures.

Author-Name: Elmar A. Stuhler
Abstract: This paper extends the motivational formulation and measurement of job and work involvement constructs (Kanungo, 1982b) and tests its cross-cultural implications by reporting on two studies conducted in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and India. Results pertaining to the empirical properties (reliability and validity) of the new job and work involvement measures obtained in the FRG and Indian contexts generally support results reported by Kanungo in the Canadian context. The cross-national generalizability of predictions derived from the motivational formulation is supported. Usefulness of the motivational framework for future research on involvement in relation to certain desired outcomes is indicated.

Title: Factors Differentiating Grievants and Nongrievants
Author-Name: Robert E. Allen
Author-Name: Timothy J. Keaveny
Abstract: Previous attempts at identifying factors differentiating individuals who file grievances from those who do not have focused on demographic and job-related variables. These efforts have yielded inconsistent results and have not explained much of the variance in grievance-filing behavior. This line of research is extended in this study by presenting a model of individual grievance-filing behavior that includes a number of variables measuring attitudes toward work and unions. Such factors have been found associated with other forms of union-related behavior such as the decision to unionize. The objectives were to replicate the earlier studies, examine the relationships between attitudinal variables and grievance-filing behavior, and identify the factors most effectively discriminating between grievants and nongrievants. The results indicate that age is the only demographic factor differentiating the criterion groups. However, the subsamples differed significantly with respect to several attitudinal variables.

Title: Androgyny and the Perception of Television Violence as Perpetrated by Males                 and Females
Author-Name: Barrie Gunter
Author-Name: Adrian Furnham
Abstract: This study examined British viewers' perceptual judgments of violent TV scenes from three categories of programming: British crime detective series, American crime detective series, and science fiction series in which either a male assailant attacked a female victim or a female assailant attacked a male victim. Violence took the form either of a shooting or a fist fight/physical struggle which were balanced equally across male and female violence. Each scene was rated by a panel of viewers for the perceived seriousness of its content along eight evaluative scales. Respondents also filled out the Bem (1974) Sex Role Inventory (BSRI). Results showed that male violence on a female victim was rated as more serious than female violence on a male victim, but only in a contemporary British crime drama context. In contemporary American crime or futuristic, science fiction contexts, the reverse was true. High masculinity scores on the BSRI were associated with the belief that male victimization by a female assaila...

Title: The Measurement of Work Autonomy
Author-Name: James A. Breaugh
Abstract: The importance of autonomy has been asserted by numerous writers in a variety of research domains, e.g., leadership, organizational climate, professionalism, and job design. In this paper, it is argued that research on job autonomy has been hindered by the way it has been conceptualized and operationalized by recent researchers. More specifically, it is suggested that the most commonly used measures of job autonomy operationally confound job autonomy with a conceptually distinct job characteristic (job interdependence/independence). Furthermore, it is suggested that for both theory development and improved organizational interventions it is important to distinguish separate areas (facets) of autonomy. This paper presents the development of a new instrument capable of tapping three distinct types, i.e., “Method A utonoly,” “Scheduling Autonomy,” and “Criteria Autonomy,” of work autonomy. Data relevant to the reliability and the validity of the instrument were gathered in two organizations. The results of s...

Title: Social Interaction and the Perception of Job Characteristics in an Organization
Author-Name: James W. Dean, Jr.
Author-Name: Daniel J. Brass
Abstract: This research investigates the relationship between the extent of employees' social interaction and their perceptions of job characteristics. Employees' perceptions were compared with the perceptions of task characteristics made by an outside observer, whose perceptions were not subject to the same social influence processes. The results indicated that the perceptions of employees who were more central to communication networks, boundary-spanning employees, and employees close to the organization's boundaries were more similar to the perceptions of the outside observer. These results were interpreted as support for the hypothesis that increased social interaction leads to a convergence of perceptions, such that the perceptions are more similar to observable reality. The hypotheses and results are discussed in terms of social information-processing models and previous laboratory findings.

Title: Narcissism and Leadership: An Object Relations Perspective
Author-Name: Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries
Author-Name: Danny Miller
Abstract: Having been largely unknown as a clinical entity, the narcissistic personality has recently come into the limelight. It is argued that one critical component in the orientation of leaders is the quality and intensity of their narcissistic development. In this paper, the relationship between narcissism and leadership is explored. Using concepts taken from psychoanalytic object relations theory, three narcissistic configurations found among leaders are presented: reactive, self-deceptive, and constructive. Their etiology, symptomatology, and defensive structure is discussed. The influence of each configuration on interpersonal relations and decision-making is examined in a managerial context.

Title: Technological Development and the Meaning of Work: A Cross-Cultural Perspective
Author-Name: Ephraim Yuchtman-Yaar
Author-Name: Avi Gottlieb
Abstract: This paper reports the perceptions of the extent of technological change and its subjective impact among workers in five industrialized nations. We find that perceived technological change varies significantly among the surveyed publics, probably due to both the actual pace of technological change and sociocultural differences. Perceived change also varied between males and females and between blue and white-collar workers-both these variations being traceable to the structural differentiation of the labor market. The reported impacts of technological change are generally positive, with the important exception of Japanese workers, who report more job-related alienation. Here again, differences related to sex and type of job (blue vs. white collar) tend to reflect structural attributes of the occupational structure. The implications of these findings are discussed.

Abstract: The concept of life space structure described elsewhere is developed and explored as a means of representing and explaining the effectiveness of individuals' characteristic behavioral patterns of arranging work and personal life. Common problems and opportunities of work and personal life coordination are described and analyzed from the perspective of four types of life space structure: home-based nuclear, work-based nuclear, conjoint, and diffuse. Hypotheses are proposed about the conditions under which certain types of life space structure are likely to be more effective than others.

Title: Procedural Justice and Participation
Author-Name: Ronald L. Cohen
Abstract: Recent social psychological work on procedural justice suggests that people given the opportunity to participate in a decision are more likely to see that decision as just than those given no such opportunity. The operation of this “fair process effect” in legal settings contributes to the legitimacy of those settings and to the stability of their structure over time. A similar, limited opportunity for participation by experimental subjects playing the role of employee in situations designed to model hierarchical, profit-oriented business enterprises produces a similar effect in some cases, but a 'frustration” effect in others. In this latter case, limited participation leads people to see the decision as less just than when no participation is allowed. Previous interpretations of these data neglect the possibility that those in the role of employees recognize a basic conflict of interest with employers in such enterprises and see limited participation as a strategic device to induce loyalty and commitmen...

Abstract: As a step in generating consistent guidelines, principles, and tools to assist American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) practitioners in designing organizations, a panel of 19 authorities on organizational principles identified, prioritized, and scaled 28 design factors considered generally important in driving effectiveness outcomes. Ready consensus was achieved by the panel with respect to factor names, narrative definitions, verbal anchors for BARS-like rating scales, and premises indicating the normative (desirable/undesirable) polarities of the scales. The factor definitions are believed to afford a useful checklist for organization planning, management auditing, and organizational effectiveness consulting, as well as an embryonic common language for organizational modeling and research.

Title: An Ethnographic Study of the Influence of a Mobile Home Community on Suburban                 High School Students
Author-Name: Steven I. Miller
Author-Name: Beverly Evko
Abstract: This study provides an ethnographic account of a mobile home park with specific attention upon the lives of adolescents living in the park and attending a local suburban high school. A symbolic interactionist perspective is utilized. Historical factors leading to the mobile home experience, as well as present policies at the local, state, and federal levels, perpetuate the outsider status of the mobile home park dweller. The mobile home unit and the mobile home park defy conventional categories and are thus “polluted”; an extension of this attitude comes to attach to the consumer of the mobile home experience as likewise being polluted or undesirable. Furthermore, the park dweller appears in the eyes of the American “mainstreamer” to fail to uphold an important symbolic value: the sacred site-built house. Park students are shunned in the school and, when at home, tolerate an adversary relationship with park management. An aura of fear in the park is reflected in the passivity on the part of the tenants. M...

Abstract: This paper describes the effects on a task force team of the application of information feedback concerning the task performance and socio-emotional climate of that team. A distinctive feature of the application is the use of individual team members' perceptions, suitably combined, to provide the feedback information automatically on dials with sweep hands. An analysis of the experiment suggests that the feedback was having a strong effect on certain aspects of the team's task-related behavior. Implications of the finding for improving the effectiveness of managerial teams undertaking decision-making tasks are discussed.

Abstract: Relationships between the cognitive structures of organizational members and the structures of the organizations to which they belong have been the subject of considerable theoretical speculation. Limited empirical evidence suggests the two structures are related but the issue of directionality has not been investigated. The study reported here adopts an attribution theory perspective to test the causal nature of this relationship in an experimental setting. The findings in this initial investigation of the causal linkages between cognitive and organizational structures support the view that the cognitive structures of strategic decision makers are largely irrelevant.

Title: An Empirical Validation of Relative Deprivation
Author-Name: Michel Alain
Abstract: The present study was an attempt to validate empirically the concept of relative deprivation. According to this concept, feelings of satisfaction or dissatisfaction depend more on relative rather than absolute criteria. Depending on one's environment, one could feel relatively satisfied or relatively deprived. Some theorists attempted to further specify the conditions leading to feelings of relative deprivation. At least five theoretical models now exist in the literature which specify various pre-conditions leading to feelings of relative deprivation. In the present study, these various pre-conditions were operationalized and applied to the working environment. Subjects, blue collar and clerical workers (n = 198) from three different organizations, were asked to fill out a questionnaire specifically designed for that purpose. Pearson correlations and multiple regression analyses favored Crosby's (1976) model over all other models examined. Relative deprivation feelings were positively correlated with wan...

Title: A Dissipative Structure Model of Organization Transformation
Author-Name: Gary Gemmill
Author-Name: Charles Smith
Abstract: Modern organizations must transform amidst the internal and external complexity and turbulence they face. Transformation processes are not understandable through the equilibrium models we most often use to describe system dynamics. More applicable system models, recently emerging within the physical sciences, incorporate disorder, uncertainty, and complexity and provide insight into the process of transformation, its characteristics and dynamics. One such model put forth by the Belgian physicist, Ilya Prigogine, is offered here as an explanatory theory of organization transformation. The model postulates that “inherent stabilities” make more probable a system's successful transition through highly unstable conditions. These same stabilities offer a point of convergence of current theories of organizational learning, of self-organizing systems, and of high performance teams. Summary propositions and some directions for future research are discussed.

Title: Decision Procedure Models and Empirical Research: The Japanese Experience
Author-Name: Nobuo Takahashi
Author-Name: Satoru Takayanagi
Abstract: This paper considers a new typology of decision procedures, the “fixed-size procedure” and the “sequential procedure,” associated with the way of discovering new alternatives. We discuss simple decision process models of these decision procedures, and hypothesize that decision makers with the sequential procedure search the smaller number of alternatives than ones with the fixed-size procedure. Our empirical research on Japanese firms supports this hypothesis, and we report the findings; when faced with greater uncertainty, the fixed-size procedure firms take organizing modes to increase information-processing capacity, and the sequential procedure firms take ones to decrease the need for information; the fixed-size procedure firms take “Japanese” conflict resolution modes but the sequential procedure firms do not. Thus, we provide a new point of view for the study on decision processes and Japanese management methods.

Abstract: The relationship of age to job satisfaction was investigated. Subjects were 1707 public employees in the United States who responded to questionnaires. The results showed that job satisfaction increased with age. Younger employees were less satisfied overall with their jobs, but especially with the intrinsic characteristics of the work. Older employees were more satisfied with the extrinsic characteristics than were the two younger groups of employees. When the effects of salary, job tenure, and education were removed independently as well as simultaneously, the same differences were found. However, when the effect of job characteristics was added to the combination and partialled out, the intrinsic characteristics factor was no longer significant.

A Q sort forced distributions research instrument containing 37 attitudinal statements was administered to a group of 167 teachers of a medium-sized city in Oklahoma. The survey netted 135 usable questionnaires (76%). The data were R factor analyzed producing six clear factors, which dealt with: social variables and collegial support; positive supervisor relations; gratification from intrinsic work elements and dissatisfaction with extrinsic elements such as pay and benefits; interesting work and appropriate responsibility levels; opportunities for learning and development combined with negative attitudes about day-to-day duties; and job security, clear expectations, and excessive workloads. The study concluded that teacher motivation is base...

Title: Distortion in Unemployment Research: The Early Studies of Bakke and Their                 Implications for Current Research on Employment and Unemployment
Author-Name: Gordon E. O'Brien
Abstract: Contemporary research on unemployment has neglected the early writings of Bakke in preference to the psychological deprivation model first outlined by Jahoda, Lazarsfeld, and Zeisel (1933) and elaborated later by Jahoda (1979, 1981, 1982). Furthermore, Bakke has been inaccurately classified as a writer who maintained that unemployment led to an inevitable decline in the personal adjustment of the unemployed. A brief review of Bakke's writings indicates that he did not find that the loss of job activities decreased self-reliance. The unemployed, as a group, showed resilience in an environment marked by poverty. He also showed that many of the characteristics commonly attributed to the unemployed such as apathy, depression, and external control were often due to the combined effects of past work experiences and economic deprivation. The implications of Bakke's views for current research on employment and unemployment are discussed.

Title: Clique Formation in a Regional Health Planning Agency
Author-Name: Leonard Fontana
Abstract: This paper presents findings on the pattern of social relations among consumers and providers in a health planning agency in the United States. The data consisted of a survey of policy-making members of the planning body that yielded background information about respondents, their views on a range of social and health policy issues, and sociometric data. Cliques within the organization appeared to be influenced by the organizational “careers” of individuals. These data suggest that policy cohesion may be a more important factor for clique formation than social ties. The significance of the findings is that interdependency may be the hallmark of health planning decision-making. Those who “act” on a particular issue may well constitute a decision network at that point in time.

Title: Conditions Facilitating Interorganizational Collaboration
Author-Name: Barbara Gray
Abstract: There is a growing need to promote collaborative problem solving across various sectors of society, e.g., among business, government, labor, and communities. Organizing such collaborative efforts requires focusing on the interorganizational domain or set of interdependencies which link various stakeholders rather than on the actions of any single organization. Moreover, effective collaboration at the domain level is predicated on several preconditions. This paper synthesizes research findings from organization theory, policy analysis, and organization development, and proposes conditions that are essential to achieving collaboration during each of three successive phases of the process. Designing optimum conditions for collaboration depends on the presence and strength of these factors at appropriate points during the collaborative process.

Title: The Mythic Structure of Bion's Groups
Author-Name: Philip Wells Shambaugh
Abstract: Despite its continuing influence, Bion's theory of small groups remains obscure. This paper hypothesizes that his basic assumption groups are shared fantasies, explicated by certain widespread societal myths and by recent studies of religious symbolism. The dependency group is homologous to the myth of the primordial earthly paradise and the dependency fight-flight group to three mythical versions of the fall of man. Similar to all sacred symbolisms, the basic assumption groups synthesize the members' images of the group with certain emotional states, give philosophical meaning to the existential crises through which the group must pass, and interpret and shape the ongoing working group.

Title: Meditation Subculture and Drug Use
Author-Name: H. C. Ganguli
Abstract: The present study reports into the effectiveness of an organized meditation program in controlling drug use among its members. Subjects were 230 young men and women from Canada. A ten-page self-report questionnaire *was used and only the data relating to drug use are presented here. It is seen that within 3 months of joining this group, 82% of cannabis users and 61% of psychedelic users stopped taking drugs. Very substantial reduction in use of alcohol and tobacco also took place. It has been hypothesized that the group meditation program, which possesses characteristics of a subculture rather than meditation practice per se, is responsible for this reduction in drug use.

Title: Parallel Organizations in Unionized Settings: Implications for Organizational Research
Author-Name: Neal Q. Herrick
Abstract: Sociotechnical systems theory focuses on the mutual adjustment of an organization's social and technical systems. This mutual adjustment aims at achieving “joint optimization, “ that is, it aims at producing conditions which are favorable to both the organization's members and to its productive capability. Until recently, this joint optimization has, in practice, occurred mainly at the work group level. Beginning in the early 1970's, however, a number of North American labor unions, acting jointly with the managements of the organizations involved, have created experiments aimed at increasing productivity and improving the quality of working life for the members of the organizations. These experiments, largely due to the influence of organized labor, have applied sociotechnical systems principles to the governance of total organizations as well as to the arrangement of tasks in work groups. This organization-wide application distinguishes parallel organizations in unionized settings from worker participat...

Title: Confronting the Teenage Pregnancy Issue: Social Marketing as an                 Interdisciplinary Approach
Author-Name: William Marsiglio
Abstract: Social marketing is advocated here as a viable approach for increasing responsible teenage contraception. The innovative field is reviewed and the major issues dealing with the adoption and implementation of a social marketing approach to teenage contraception are discussed. Research on teenagers' sexual and contraceptive attitudes and behaviors is also reviewed. The discussion emphasizes that the use and adoption of effective contraceptive methods requires both individual level decision-making and interpersonal negotiation with contraceptive providers. Some of the key individual level considerations are presented here within the context of a problem-solving framework for contraceptive use. It is concluded that interdisciplinary efforts are needed to expand and integrate our knowledge of teenagers' fertility-related attitudes and behaviors to facilitate effective social marketing strategies. Particular emphasis is placed on improving our understanding of the social psychological processes underlying how t...

Title: A Systematic Comparison of Travel-Related Roles
Author-Name: Philip L. Pearce
Abstract: Academic and professional studies of tourists and tourism both need a sound emic or experiential definition of the tourist role. In this study, a comparison of a number of travel-related roles was conducted using a 100-person student sample, and the data were analyzed with fuzzy set theory and multidimensional scaling analysis. The findings indicated that there were clear and highly interpretible differences among 15 travel-related roles. It was also demonstrated that such an approach to defining the tourist role was useful for understanding previous perspectives in the social science literature on tourism.

Title: Visual Display Technology, Worker Disablement, and Work Organization
Author-Name: Trevor A. Williams
Abstract: The rapid and widespread introduction of visual display technology in Australia has been accompanied by a large increase in disablement among operators of visual display units (VDUs). The prevalent belief in the society is that working with VDUs is largely responsible for the disablement and that work organization is an important factor affecting the occurrence of injury. A review of present and emerging knowledge about the association between visual display technology and worker disablement suggests that there are factors inherent in the technology itself which also account for injury but that work organization design does play a central part. The most common approach is to adopt visual display technology while retaining bureaucratic work organization designs. This increases the repetitiveness of work and the amount of control imposed on workers. The retention of bureaucratic work organization also increases the risk of disablement and limits the effectiveness of attempts to prevent disablement. Two case...

Abstract: This study investigates the effect of task uncertainty on the initiating and search behavior of managers. Competing theoretical arguments are assessed empirically using data collected by sampling randomly the work activities of 50 managers. The findings show that different arguments hold for upper level managers than hold for lower level managers, suggesting that explanations for managerial behavior solely in terms of manager-task interaction or solely in terms of hierarchic position will be incomplete or misleading.

Title: Childhood Cruelty toward Animals among Criminals and Noncriminals
Author-Name: Stephen R. Kellert
Author-Name: Alan R. Felthous
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between childhood cruelty toward animals and aggressive behavior among criminals and noncriminals in adulthood.Data were derived from personal interviews with 152 criminals and noncriminals in Kansas and Connecticut. A standardized, closed, and open-ended interview, requiring approximately 1-2 hours to complete, was administered to all subjects. Aggressiveness was defined by behavioral criteria rather than by reason for incarceration.Childhood cruelty toward animals occurred to a significantly greater degree among aggressive criminals than among nonaggressive criminals or noncriminals. Additionally, the occurrence of more than 40 cases of extreme animal crielty facilitated the development of a preliminary classification of nine distinct motivations for animal cruelty. Finally, family violence, particularly paternal abuse and alcoholism, were significantly more common among aggressive criminals with a history of childhood cruelty toward animals.

Title: Projective Identification in the Consulting Relationship: Exploring the                 Unconscious Dimensions of a Client System
Author-Name: Thomas N. Gilmore
Author-Name: James Krantz
Abstract: This paper explores the impact of projective identification on consulting relationships. The concept of projective identification, drawn from psychoanalytic literature, is used to elucidate the ways in which the dynamics within consulting teams comes to mirror important and unconscious aspects of the client system. Attention to this process thus provides opportunities for understanding important dynamics of the client system which are often inaccessible through more traditional modes of social science inquiry. It is often that these unrecognized, implicit forces can emerge in the course of an intervention and undermine attempts at collaborative social change. Three case examples illustrate the operation of this process, and finally a discussion of the practical implications of attending to it is offered.

Abstract: Three world views or paradigms-Industrial (I), De-Industrial (D), and Symbiotic (S) -are compared in their expression in 12 selected key institutions of Advanced Western Industrial Societies at four levels: at the macro level, the nation state, the market economy, the pattern of Advanced country-Lesser developed country relations, the Welfare State and representative political democracy; at the meso or intermediate level, the private corporation and the metropolitan city; at the micro level, the nuclear family and the autonomous individual; at the socio-cultural level, classical science, the pattern of technological choice, and continuous formative education. The "whole-brained"processes associated with Paradigm S are adjusted to be increasingly more suitable for our present and future turbulent society and provide the basis for a paradigm for societal transition.

Abstract: This study set out to examine the application of the locus of control concept to economic behavior and devise a scale to measure these beliefs. Based on other applied locus of control scales, a questionnaire was devised to examine these beliefs which was investigated psychometrically. The scale yieldedfour interpretable factors which were related to established scales. The scale that discriminated most concerned chance economic locus of control beliefs which was related to sex, age, and income. The use of the economic locus of control scale for investigating aspects of organizational and occupational behavior is discussed.

Author-Name: Caryl E. Rusbult
Author-Name: Dennis J. Johnson
Author-Name: Gregory D. Morrow
Abstract: A survey of adult romantic involvements was conducted to test hypotheses regarding the determinants and consequences of four characteristic responses to dissatisfaction: exit, voice, loyalty, and neglect. In general, greater prior satisfaction with relationships and greater investment of resources in relationships were associated with stronger tendencies to react to problems constructively, with voice and loyalty, and lesser tendencies to react destructively, with exit and neglect. Higher quality alternatives promoted exit and inhibited loyalty. Greater problem severity encouraged exit and voice and discouraged loyalty. Voice and loyalty resulted in more favorable outcomes, better immediate consequences and greater later satisfaction and commitment, whereas exit and neglect produced less favorable consequences. The relationship between a variety of demographic characteristics and each category of response were also examined.

Title: Distributed Leadership and Skilled Performance as Successful Organization in Social Movements
Author-Name: M. H. Brown
Author-Name: D. M. Hosking
Abstract: This paper adopts a social psychological perspective to the study of social organization analyzed in terms of the skills of organizing. The arguments are intended to be general but discussion is grounded in research on womens' centers in Britain. Drawing on Hosking's work on small groups, leadership, and organization, and Brown's doctoral research on womens' centers, we focus on interlocking cognitive and social orders and the manner of their achievement. "Order" is found to be negotiated more or less successfully, the degree of success achieved depending on skilled performance in four main areas. These are outlined and illustrated. In the case of the womens' organization, a core value was found to be that of "distributed" leadership; they are argued to be successful to the degree that this is achieved.

Title: The Design of Conferences and the Evolving Role of Democratic Dialogue in Changing Working Life
Author-Name: Bjirn Gustavsen
Author-Name: Per H. Engelstad
Abstract: The use of encounters of various types, such as workshops and conferences is, today, very common in organizational change projects. The design of encounters can be guided by different types of theory. In Norway, a development has occurred which implies the application of democratic theory to encounters. They are used for the explicit purpose of training the participants in democratic procedures. Such training is crucial as the concept of workplace democracy is no longer defined in terms of specific patterns of organization but in terms of how the patterns are created. The use of democratic dialogue for the purpose of changing working life implies a new role for democratic dialogue because, contrary to what was the case in the emergent phase of the liberal democracies, work experience must be the basis for participation.

Abstract: The information-seeking process is explored. We present positive evidence that people follow discernable patterns when searching for a solution to a problem. The experimental task was a management game designed to explore the information choices people make when seeking a solution to a problem. This research has strong positive evidence that: (1) it is possible to observe patterns of information use during decision making and (2) characteristics of a user of information systems do not appear to be linked to the information-gathering process. It provides the first step toward the possible improvement of the analysis of management information system requirements. Future research into the efficacy of the method is needed to build upon the current findings.

Abstract: Election study panelsfrom Sweden (1979-1982) and the U.S. (1972-1976 and 1956-1960) were analyzed to see whether prior behavior (as implied by behaviorism) or recalled behavior (as implied by field theory) would better predict subsequent voting behavior. Although the results were mixed, data from each panel tended to support field theory somewhat more than behaviorism.

Author-Name: Leonard H. Chusmir
Abstract: Nonmanagerial and professional women subjects have significantly higher socialized power (s Pwr) needs than their men colleagues but similar needs for power (n Pwr) and personalized power (p Pwr). Although s Pwr and n Pwr correlate negatively with degree of job commitment, age, and number of children for the total sample and for the male subset, the same is not true for the females. The level of sex-role conflict and family pressure is higher for the women, however, and possible job commitment implications are discussed.

Title: How Managers Really Communicate
Author-Name: Fred Luthans
Author-Name: Janet K. Larsen
Abstract: In contrast to other studies of managerial communication, this investigation combined direct observation of managers in the natural setting with self-report measures to try to determine how managers really communicate. More specifically, the canonical correlation technique was used to analyze the relationships between communication behavior and managerial activities. A two dimensional managerial communicator model emerged. The first dimension represents a continuum from Humanistic Interactor (who interacts more frequently both upward and downward and exhibits more staffing and training/developing activities) to Mechanistic Isolate (who communicates very little but frequently engages in conflict management activities). The second relationship reveals a continuum from Informal Developer (who communicates spontaneously and is involved in training/developing activities) to Formal Controller (who uses scheduled communication interaction and exhibits monitoring/controlling activities). This model provides an em...

Title: Values as Predictors of Social Activist Behavior
Author-Name: Charles B. Thomas, Jr.
Abstract: This study investigates values as correlates of social activist behavior. A stratified random sample of 75 black and white, Protestant and Catholic male clergy in mainline denominations in Boston and in the first ring of suburbs surrounding Boston were interviewed between July-December, 1975, during the midst of the major Boston school desegregation controversy. Respondents completed the terminal values section of the Rokeach Value Survey, and answered questions about the extent of their participation in activities to support the peaceful implementation of the school desegregation process. Zero-order correlations between social activism and specific values were computed for the clergy sample and compared to previous research with student populations. Partial correlations between social activism and specific values (controlling for the effects of intercorrelations among the values) reveal that "equality" and ':freedom" are the two values which are significantly (p < .05) and positively correlated with soci...

Title: Social Interaction in Blind People: An Experimental Analysis
Author-Name: Nigel J. Kemp
Author-Name: Derek R. Rutter
Abstract: Although a considerable amount of research has been conducted on social interaction in blind people, two main weaknesses may be identified in the literature; very few of the reports have been based on controlled, experimental analyses, and little attempt has been made to relate the findings to social psychological theory. The purpose of the present paper is to try to redress the balance, and there are two main objectives: to offer a description of how blind people behave in conversations, and to use that description to reexamine our own model, the model of cuelessness. Ten blind-blind, ten blind-sighted, and ten sighted-sighted pairs were observed in a series of laboratory discussions, and measures were taken of the content of what was said, the style which was used, and the impressions the subjects formed of their partners and of their own behavior. Blind people, it emerged, behaved perfectly normally for the most part, and the pattern confirmed our model; the fewer the social cues the greater the psycho...

Title: Culture, Charisma, and the CEO: An Essay on the Meaning of High Office
Author-Name: Steven P. Feldman
Abstract: The collective attribution of meaning to offices of authority and the constraints this attribution imposes on the. individuals who occupy these offices is little understood in the study of bureaucratic organization. In this essay, the relationship between the CEO and the vice-presidents in a Bell Telephone operating company is analyzed with regard to this phenomenon. An interpretive concept of culture is employed to gain access to the locally constructed system of symbols that these managers used to guide their behavior. The concept of institutional charisma is utilized to bring into focus the part of the cultural system that was used to attribute meaning to relationships of authority. My approach is contrasted with the management as symbolic action approach and the historical-interpretive approach to the study of culture in organizations. The former is found to be based on a false dichotomy between expressive and substantive levels of reality which limits its range of applicability. The latter is found t...

Title: Paths to Turnover: A Re-analysis and Review of Existing Data on the Mobley, Horner, and Hollingsworth Turnover Model
Author-Name: Anthony Dalessio
Author-Name: William H. Silverman
Author-Name: John R. Schuck
Abstract: Several data sets collected on the Mobley, Horner, and Hollingsworth (1978) model of turnover were re-analyzed with path analytic techniques. Data analyses revealed support for three general hypotheses proposed by Mobley et al. These were: (1) that age has an indirect effect on turnover through job satisfaction, (2) that job satisfaction has an indirect effect on turnover through withdrawal cognitions, and (3) that intention to quit is the immediate precursor of turnover. Although the data supported these hypotheses, inconsistencies were apparent in the data for many specific linkages proposed by Mobley et al. Possible reasons for these inconsistencies include: (1) diversity of samples studied, (2) the unmeasured variables problem, and (3) construct measurement problems. The use of a causal modeling approach developed by Joreskog & Sorborm (1978) is proposed as a possible solution to some of these problems in future research.

Title: Intimacy, Violence, and the Police
Author-Name: Edna Erez
Abstract: Past research on domestic violence has concentrated on violence between married couples and concluded that "the marriage license is a hitting license." The present study questions this link and demonstrates that violence reported to the police is not restricted to married couples but is also prevalent among unmarried or dating couples as well as divorced ones. A link between intimacy and violence is suggested. Violence among couples with ongoing relationships is similar in its intensity, time, and place of occurrence compared with violence patterns among divorcees. Divorcees tend to resort to the police to settle less serious incidents. The legal definitions of the violent incidents reflect different degrees of liberty that intimates with different marital status may take with each other. The proportion of arrest are similar for all categories of intimates.

Title: Signwork
Author-Name: P. K. Manning
Abstract: Research literature contains a number of definitions of organizations. Organizations are defined here as communication processing systems which transform diverse information into culturally patterned and constrained messages. Organizations encode and decode messages and thus create social realities. The paper investigates the utility of semiotics, the science of signs, to uncover the precise modalities of symbolic communication characteristics of complex organizations that produce enstructured and bounded systems of meaning. Semiotics argues tht signs convert sound and image into communication; insofar as organizations do much the same, they produce sign work. The paper investigates a police communications system (PCS) in a very large British urban constabulary by means of ethnographic field work: observation, written records, and tapes of calls to the police. Message form and content (syntagms and paradigms) are described, the application of these paradigms or associative contexts is shown in one segment...

Author-Name: Geoffrey R. Mallory
Abstract: This paper examines the exercise of power in organizational decision making. Four case studies are presented in the text and are analyzed in terms of the power plays of senior managers who were centrally involved in the decision-making process. In particular, the analysis distinguishes between bounded and unbounded decisions. In the former case the power plays of interests are constrained by preestablished organizational rules and procedures, while in the latter case unbounded decisions are relatively free from such organizational parameters and allow actors to exercise power selectively to secure their own interests. The data suggest that decisions may become unbounded in four ways: through unaccustomed forms of data, individual conflict, and novel topics for decision and where the problem is initiated from an unexpected or unusual source. Where decisions become unbounded the data suggest that those actors who are existing power holders through the control of critical contingencies are also able to take ...

Title: Equity Perception in Multiple Comparisons: A Field Study
Author-Name: Simcha Ronen
Abstract: Data from a survey of all 721 employees in a light manufacturing firm (553 workers and 168 managers) were used to investigate the role of reference groups inside and outside the organization within the framework of equity theory. Attitude toward pay was used as the basis for comparison. The results indicated that the outside reference group is more important than the inside reference group in explaining job attitudes and behavioral propensities. The results also indicated that the contributions of outside and inside pay components are similar for both managers and workers in evaluating pay satisfaction. The relationship between pay components was different for the two groups on overall job satisfaction, however, and may, in fact, be nonlinear for managers.

Abstract: Popular and professional wisdom argues that rapid social change results in a search for genealogical roots. Indeed, interest in genealogy followed the industrial revolution of the nineteeth century, World War I, and World War I. The same notion can be applied to the individual level. Individuals who experience social dislocation such as geographical or social class mobility, it is posited, would be more interested in genealogy than those who do not experience such changes. Family size or changes in family size from one generation to another and birth order may also be related to interest in the study of one's genealogical roots. Finally, ethnicity may be related to genealogical interest. To test these hypotheses, a sample of genealogists and a sample of other hobbyists were compared. Information about their geographical and social backgrounds and a variety of other topics was obtained in a survey. In general, the social dislocation hypotheses are not supported. Stayers rather than movers, and older immigr...

Title: Gender Differences in Work Satisfaction, Work-Related Rewards and Values, and the Determinants of Work Satisfaction
Author-Name: Clifford MottazI
Abstract: This study investigates possible gender-related differences in perceptions of work rewards, work values, overall work satisfaction, and the determinants of work satisfaction. Data from 1385 workers representing a variety of occupations are analyzed. Basically, the analysis identifies a number of similarities as well as differences between male and female workers regarding their perceptions and attitudes about work. Additionally, two explanations of the gender-work satisfaction relationship are examined. They are the expectancy and value explanations. The available data provides conditional support for the value explanation. The implications of these findings are subsequently discussed.

Title: Love Styles Revisited: A Cross-National Comparison with Particular Reference to South Africa
Author-Name: Christopher R. Stones
Abstract: Previous research has shown that distinct attitude profiles toward love exist in North America and Uganda, as a representative of an African culture. Given the social upheaval currently occurring in South Africa and the particular nature of its official policy toward ethnic relations, the present paper aimed to compare and contrast the attitudes toward love in South Africa with those prevalent in the other two cultures. The data suggest that although the notion of Romantic Power appeared to be cross-culturally equivalent, there were distinct international differences in Romantic Idealism and Conjugal Love attitudes. The policy of Apartheid served as an explanatory vehicle.

Title: Fusing Goal Integration
Author-Name: Joseph G. P. Paolillo

Author-Name: Peter Lorenzi
Abstract: Several mechanisms have been proposed to understand and deal with differences between individual and organizational goals, including the socialization, accommodation, and exchange processes. A model which fuses these processes with the control-compliance framework is presented. This model suggests alternative strategies for gaining individual-organization goal integration. Research implications regarding the model are discussed.

Title: An Empirical Investigation of the Groupthink Phenomenon
Author-Name: Gregory Moorhead
Author-Name: John R. Montanari
Abstract: This paper reports results of an empirical investigation of the groupthink theoreticalframework presented in Janis'second edition of Groupthink. Factor analysis was used to develop scales to measure the aspects of groupthink proposed by Janis (1982). Results supported some, but not all, of the symptoms and defects postulated by Janis. Next, a path analytic procedure was utilized to test the implied causal ordering of the Groupthink model (Janis, 1982, p. 244). This study provides limited support for the causal sequence specified in the model. However, the relationship between groupthink-induced decision defects and outcomes were not as strong as Janis suggests. These results prompt the authors to agree with Courtright (1978) that many intervening and/or moderating factors not included in the Janis framework influence decision outcomes.

Title: Toward an Heuristic Theory of Diffusion
Author-Name: Merrelyn Emery
Abstract: Diffusion is re-examined within an open systems model which takes into account the causal texture of the extended social field as well as the more traditional theoretical concerns. It focuses on methods developed to help people learn to participate in, and exercise more control over, their workplaces and communities. Diffusion is increased as the design and management of these learning events become congruent with their purposes and environmental trends. Structures and processes which encourage learning through working participatively are a precondition for the appearance of the motivation to diffuse. Behind these factors lies the affect system, and it is argued that the key to effective diffusion is the generation of the positive affects of excitement and joy. "The joy of learning" which produces diffusion contrasts with group assumptions and a "hatred of learning" which is often the result of traditional teaching.

Abstract: The paper analyzes the organizational commitment of North American male andfemale accountants working in professional organizations. Unlike others, the present study controlledfor the critical variables of type of occupation, level and subject of higher education, and type of organization. The independent variables were age, gender, tenure, organizational level, cognitive affective orientation to the job, professional commitment, overalljob satisfaction, and intrinsic and e-xtrinsic need satisfaction. It was found by an analysis of covariance that women tended to have lower levels of organizational commitment than men. However, an hierarchical regression analysis indicated that sex did not significantly explain the variance beyond the demographic and cognitive-affective variables. Women were also less satisfied than men in terms of overall job satisfaction and extrinsic satisfaction.

Title: Evaluation Research on Quality Circles: Technical and Analytical Implications
Author-Name: Robert P. Steel
Author-Name: Guy S. Shane
Abstract: The unprecedented rapidity with which quality circle principles and techniques have caught on in U.S. and European industry belies the fact that a dearth of evaluation research exists documenting quality circle program outcomes. A review of the available studies constituting this literature revealed that this research has frequently been susceptible to a common set of methodological deficiencies. However, even the results of well-designed quality circle evaluation studies may be misleading if relevant organizational circumstances are not given due consideration when a change agent selects quality circles from his or her repertoire of organizational development (OD) interventions. The effectiveness of quality circles, and for that matter organizational intervention procedures in general, depends upon the compatibility of the intervention and attributes of the organization's situation, the demand placed upon tangible and intangible resources, and the type of response desired from participants.

Author-Name: Larry C. Ingram
Abstract: Although Goffman advocated comparative study of underlife at the time that he wrote Asylums, little work has been done by students of organization. The present paper offers a comparison of underlife in three different types of establishment by focusing on "crawlspace," those symbolic dimensions of organization which allow or compel participants to engage in secondary adjustment. The important dimensions are assumptions about self, normative patterns, sactions, and general meaning of membership/participation in the organization.

Author-Name: Ronald J. Burke
Author-Name: Eugene Deszca
Abstract: This investigation examined the usefulness of a phase model of burnout. Eight hundred and twenty-eight men and women in police work provided data using a questionnaire completed anonymously. Eight progressive phases of burnout were created using high and low divisions on the three subscales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Measures of work setting, experienced stress, and emotional and physical well-being were significantly related to progressive phases of burnout. Work and personal experience grew worse as burnout progressed through more advanced phases. Comparisons with other data revealed potential occupational and organizational differences in numbers of respondents in various phases of burnout.

Title: Getting a Better Job: Antecedents and Effects
Author-Name: Juhani Kirjonen
Author-Name: Vilma Hänninen
Abstract: The effect of improvement of working conditions on symptoms of mental distress was examined in a longitudinal study of metal industry employees. The aim was to investigate the changes in working conditions, job satisfaction, and indices of mental health among the employees who were promoted or changed employer compared to those who had stayed in the same job during the 5-year follow-up period. Results show that work content and physical work environment had significantly improved in the job change groups compared to the control group. Job dissatisfaction, life dissatisfaction, and stress symptoms had decreased significantly in the job change groups only among the male blue-collar workers. The most powerful predictors of changes in job stress and general distress were changes in work content and changes in the quality of physical work environment. The multiple correlations obtained in the regression analyses ranged between 0.29-0.36.

Title: The Dynamics of Interdependence in Organizations
Author-Name: Dean Tjosvold
Abstract: A model is developed that stipulates that task, roles, and reward distribution of organizational structure, perceived goal interdependence, patterns of behavior, and corporate values and interpersonal attitudes form causal loops, and mutually reinforce and sustain each other. Positive and negative goal interdependencies and independence have been identified and result in much different dynamics and outcomes. Studies overall indicate that positive interdependence promotes coordination and productivity. Research is needed to determine generalizability of these findings and to identify the purposes and. situations when negative interdependence and independence are appropriate.

Title: Employee Ownership and Older Workers
Author-Name: Cherlyn Skromme Granrose
Abstract: This paper examines the response of older workers to an employee ownership alternative when A&P shut down all supermarkets in one geographic area of the United States. Older workers lost more benefits and were more dissatisfied with the contract negotiations that resulted in employee ownership but this dissatisfaction was not related to willingness to pledge money to become an employee owner. Older workers who were not old enough to retire, who were willing to take risks, and who believed in entrpreneurism were most likely to want to become employee owners, but, in general, employee ownership does not appear to be a particularly desirable solution to problems of unemployment among older workers.

Title: The Job Characteristics Model and Growth Satisfaction: Main Effects of Assimilation of Work Experience and Context Satisfaction
Author-Name: Preston C. Bottger
Author-Name: Irene K-H. Chew
Abstract: This article argues that behaviors which predict individual variance in satisfaction do not necessarily co-exist with the need for activities which lead to satisfaction. Specifically, we examine the effect of sensitivity to performance variations on growth satisfaction. We label this sensitivity "assimilation of work experience" (A WE). In contrast to growth need strength (GNS), A WE is shown to have a main effect on growth satisfaction independent of job scope and context satisfaction. In addition, the claim that the job scope/growth satisfaction relationship is stronger for low than high context satisfaction is examined. We contend that the theory also predicts a main effect of context satisfaction on growth satisfaction. Three samples comprising middle level managers, lower level managers, and sales representatives are studied. Total sample size is 1702. Multiple regression is the primary analytical method.

Title: The Factorial Structure of the Meaning of Working
Author-Name: Itzhak Harpaz
Abstract: The structure of the Meaning of Working (MO W) was empirically analyzed through factor analysis. Interviews were conducted with samples from ten occupational groups, as well as a representative sample of the labor force, to determine the dimensions constituting the structure of work meanings. The original 39 variables resulted in 13 interpretable factors which were categorized into the following work domains: centrality of work as a life role, societal norms about working, valued work outcomes, importance of work goals, and work role identification. An unexpected domain, consisting of nonwork areas of life, also emerged as significant.

Title: New Strategies of Systems Change: Reclaiming Nonsynoptic Methods
Author-Name: Calvin Pava
Abstract: Ill-defined, complex problems often require systematic change in behavior and values. However, the uncertainty of such issues polarizes different stakeholders and impedes collaborative solutions. Traditional approaches to managing change are unable to deal with these situations, where both complexity and conflict are intensified. A new category of planning and change methods, nonsynoptic systems change, is emerging that better deals with such conditions. Despite its haphazard appearance, an underlying order exists within this type of systems change. Normative incrementalism, one specific change strategy within this type, is examined in detail. A variety of applications for the nonsynoptic approach is also considered.

Title: Temporality and Reflexivity: Toward the Creative Engagement of Consciousness
Author-Name: Heather Hopkins
Abstract: All experience is located in consciousness in some temporal order. This is assigned meaning through reflexivity and integrated into an enduring concept of self. However, experiences which are inconsistent with the individual's self-concept will constitute a threat creating division between those experiences which are under the control of the self and those which are not. In this way, work imposes a distinction between time which the individual can control and time which is assigned to the control of another. This paper considers the role of radical reflexivity in reuniting subjective experience with perceived "objective" reality in the synthetic creative act.

Title: A Changing Health Care Decision-Making Environment
Author-Name: Joan L. Weiner
Author-Name: E. G. Boyer
Author-Name: Neil J. Farber
Abstract: The increasing pressure to contain costs is bringing a new member to the "traditional" health delivery team, the professionally(and nonmedically-) trained administrator. In this paper, we examine the root differences in attitudes of physicians and this emerging administrative group exhibited in response to simulated life-threatening scenarios. When cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is indicated, physicians in our sample focus on the future "worth" (or quality) of the patient's life; administrators, however, are more likely to focus on the existing "worthiness" of the patient. These differences lead us to conclude that equitable health care delivery programs in the United States, balancing quality, availabity, and cost efficiency, will require new broader-based management systems both at the macrosystem as well as at the single institution levels.

Author-Name: Peter Akinsola Okebukola
Abstract: The intention of this paper is to determine the effects ofa prolonged period of cooperative and competitive relationships among students on their performance in science. Among the results obtained using 131 class one (seventh grade) students were the following. (1) No significant difference was found to exist in the performance of students in the experimental (those exposed to cooperative and competitive situations) and the control conditions before the end of the first 4 weeks of treatment. (2) After the first 4 weeks, students who carried out intragroup cooperation with intergroup competition achieved significantly better than students who engaged in "pure" cooperation and 'pure" competition. The significance of these and other results of the study for the research on peer relationships and for improved performance of students are discussed.

Title: The Emergence of the Egalitarian Organization
Author-Name: Suresh Srivastval
Author-Name: David L. Cooperrider
Abstract: This paper develops an egalitarian theory of organizing, a theory which is premised on the emergence of an interhuman logic that transcends instrumental or techno-economic rationality as a basis for collective action. An interhuman logic, it is proposed, is one that seeks to create and maintain social-organizational arrangements that heighten or maximize the ideal membership situation for all members of a given organization. Through an “appreciative” analysis of field data collected from a world-reknowned medical group practice, propositions are developed which seek to explain and extend the implications of an interhuman logic for understanding the potential of participatory systems.

Title: Programming Common Sense: Analytic Consequences of Heider's Naive Analysis of Action
Author-Name: A. M. Burton
Abstract: Following recent claims in social psychology, it is suggested that many hypotheses in the discipline do not lend themselves to empirical investigation. Certain studies in attribution theory are particularly vulnerable to this criticism. From this perspective, it is claimed that Heider's naive analysis of action should be taken as an a priori explication of common sense accounting practices, rather than as a basis for experimental study. A computer model, NANA CT, of the naive analysis of action is presented and this is used to demonstrate that several attribution theory results follow logically from Heider's analysis. It is argued that analytic investigation into such a system is preferable to the empirical investigation currently fashionable. Furthermore, the increasing availability of computers and modeling software means there is now an appropriate representational technology within which to carry out such investigations.

Title: Intergroup Relations in a Hospital Setting: A Further Test of Social Identity Theory
Author-Name: Gillian Oaker
Author-Name: Rupert Brown
Abstract: A study is reported in which the intergroup relationship between nurses in various fields of nursing is investigated. From social identity theory, it was predicted that strength of identification with the nursing subgroup would be positively correlated with intergroup differentiation. It was also predicted that amount of contact between the different nurse groups would be associated with less differentiation. Data was obtained from interviews with 40 qualified nurses working in specialized or general areas in three hospitals. Clear ingroup bias was found in intergroup attitudes, despite a strong ethos of cooperation within the nursing profession. However, contrary to hypothesis, this bias was negatively rather than positively correlated with group identification, as revealed by multiple regression analyses. These also showed that contact was associated with reduced bias, only in the general nurse group. In the specialized group, there was little effect for contact. The theoretical and practical implicatio...

Title: Youth's Conception of Life-Cycle Stages: The Israeli Case
Author-Name: Tamar Rapoport
Author-Name: Sharon J. Barnett
Abstract: Conceptions held by contemporary adolescents about the four major life stages were examined among a sample of 347 Israeli adolescents. Subjects were asked to characterize in one sentence the terms "adult," "youth, " "child, " and "old person." A content analysis of the data, based on structural categories developed by the authors (biological aspects, roles, and personal resources), showed that youth conceive of all the stages predominantly in terms of personal resources, i.e., assets and characteristics utilized in social behavior. In addition, a strong positive attitude toward youth, a strong negative attitude toward old age, and ambivalence toward childhood and adulthood were discerned. The findings are explained in terms of major social characteristics of youth's transitional life stage (marginality and moratorium) within Israeli society. This sociological perspective is suggested as a useful addition to the more common psychological one in explaining youth's conception of the life cycle.

Abstract: This study outlines and tests a dialectical model of group development in self-analytic training groups. Part 1 establishes dimensions that differentiate between developmental phases using factor analysis and analysis of variance. In 18 observed groups, a factor named "group cohesion" differentiated most adequately. Part 2 defines the different developmental patterns. Trend analysis showed that, of the 18 groups five developed fully, two arrested in the authority dilemma, and six arrested in the intimacy dilemma. Expectations about the content of group communications for these different development patterns were tested, also through trend analysis, and results supported the theoretical model.

Title: Leader Style, Leader Consistency, and Participant Personality Effects on Learning in Small Groups
Author-Name: Astrid M. Richardsen
Author-Name: William E. Piper
Abstract: Twelve small experiential learning groups were conducted in which leader style and leader consistency were experimentally manipulated. The leaders were predominantly meaning attributive or predominantly caring in style, and either consistent or inconsistent in their behavior from session to session. Each group was composed of two high, two medium, and two low scorers on the change subscale of the PRF-E. Seventy-one participants provided self-report data concerning several aspects of learning. Evaluations of participant learning were also provided by the three leaders. Leader style that was characterized by a predominance of meaning attributive interventions relative to caring interventions was associated with greater learning. Consistent leader behavior as opposed to inconsistent leader behavior was also associated with greater learning. Evidence for the additive effect of meaning attributive style and consistency on participant learning was discussed. Relationships among participant perceptions of leader...

Abstract: This paper re-examines career theories and notes a number of their shortcomings which derive from a lack of rigor in approach and from certain epistemological and methodological considerations. The way forward suggested for this field of study represents a shift in the root hypothesis from organicism and mechanism to contextualism. The ecological, the biographical, and the hermeneutical approaches are proposed as a means of reconceptualizing this area of study.

Abstract: The degree to which co-workers, supervisors, doctors, instructors, family members, and patients are used to gather information regarding task characteristics was studied over a 3-month period. The influences of information sources changed as nurses and students gained work experience. Differences in information source influence was also found between nurses and student nurses. The findings support the social information processing approach to the study of task characteristics; however, relevant sources of social information should be expanded beyond the influence of co-workers and supervisors.

Abstract: Quality of Working Life (QWL) programs are designed to increase the enrichment of jobs, the autonomy of workers, and the degree of collaboration among workers and between workers and management. This study examines the impact of QWL programs in five petrochemical plants by contrasting worker attitudes and job perceptions in these plants with perceptions from those in the same industry as well as from those in plants in different industries. Few differences between the QWL and non-QWL petrochemical plants were found; there were some differences between petrochemical and nonpetrochemical plants.

Abstract: This research investigates the perceptions supervisors have of their female employees' communication proficiency, assuming, as has been repeatedly discussed in the literature, that communication skills are a critical component of organizational effectiveness and promotability. In particular, comparisons were made between evaluations of supervisors on a variety of communication competencies and female employees' self-evaluations. Similar comparisons were made between the supervisors' assessment of the importance of future training in each skill and the females' own assessment of their need for future training. While this research is exploratory in nature, the results demonstrate striking and potentially important differences between the perceptions of female professionals and their supervisors.

Abstract: This study examined the association between stress and the leisure needs and activities of four occupational groups: professional, managerial, clerical, and trades. It was found that stress was associated with passive/recuperative leisure needs and activities among managerial employees. Professionals also showed evidence of a correlation between stress and leisure needs and activities which revealed a partly recuperative, partly active-compensatory leisure pattern. Among clerical and trades employees there was little association between stress and leisure. Occupational differences in the sources and effects of stress, and differences in coping patterns need to be explained.

Title: Professional Models vs. Patient Models in Rehabilitation after Heart Attack
Author-Name: Dan Bar-On
Abstract: Two problems were identified in the professional treatment of rehabilitation after acute myocardial infarction (MI): (1) “Tower of Babel”—the physician, the social worker, and the psychologist use competing models to diagnose, intervene in, and evaluate a rehabilitation process, while each of them accounts for a fraction of the variance of the rehabilitation outcomes. (2) Asymmetry of relations-all three models overlook the possibility that the patients themselves have their own models, and that these models should be considered in the rehabilitation process. In a recent study, 89 male patients, ages 34-60, admitted to the Intensive Coronary Care Unit of the Soroka Medical Center in the south of Israel, were interviewed after their first acute MI. Their choices from a special Q-sort were factor-analyzed, and five consistent models were identified. Two of these patient models accounted for 35% of the variance in a regression analysis of the rehabilitation measures (return to work and physical and sexual fu...

Title: An Examination of Individual Differences as Moderators of Upward Influence                 Activity in Strategic Decisions
Author-Name: Warren Keith Schilit
Abstract: This study examines the upward influence capabilities of middle level managers (MLMs) in a variety of strategic decisions. It was found that: (1) MLMs tended to be successful in their upward influence interactions but exerted influence primarily in less risky strategic decisions, (2) MLMs who had been working for their superior for a long period of time were extremely influential in strategic decisions, and (3) MLMs who were high in their needs for achievement or power or who had an internal locus of control were more influential in strategic decisions than were MLMs who were low in their needs for achievement or power or who had an external locus of control.

Title: A Sociocognitive Network Approach to Organizational Analysis
Author-Name: William N. Dunn
Author-Name: Ari Ginsberg
Abstract: Following the lead of other contributors to cognitive organizational theory, this paper offers a sociocognitive network methodology that represents a sharp departure from traditional approaches to organizational analysis. After outlining the contours of a sociocognitive perspective of organizational dynamics, we present a highly flexible, but reproducible methodology that allows us to uncover and quantify differences in the content of organizational reference frames. We then demonstrate how the resulting indices of cognitive content may be merged with standard sociometric data, creating a network matrix that measures the sociocognitive connectedness of an organization's participants and enables us to identify and monitor barriers to organizational innovation and change.

Abstract: The present study examined the difference between moonlighters and non-moonlighters on a number of personally-, socially-, and organizationally-valued outcomes among blue-collar workers (N = 285) and among firefighters (N = 252). Results obtained from ANOVAs and discriminant analysis appeared to be more supportive of the energic/opportunity hypothesis of moonlighters than of the deprivation/constraint hypothesis. Implications of the findings are highlighted for management and practitioners.

Author-Name: Robert C. Dailey
Author-Name: William Ickinger
Author-Name: Elizabeth Coote
Abstract: The study of Type A behavior (Friedman & Rosenman, 1974) is developing a research tradition in related streams of literature in organizational behavior. The predictive characteristics and diversity of these studies are encouraging since they signal improved understanding of the organizational, personal, and economic effects of coping with work-generated tension and stress. The research presented here is consistent with these scholarly developments. The research attempts to illuminate the relationships between: (1) Type A behavior (Friedman & Rosenman, 1974), (2) role conflict and ambiguity (Rizzo House, & Lirtzman, 1970), (3) Locus of control (Rotter, 1966), (4) symptoms of adaptation to stress, and (S) tension discharge rate (Rose, Jenkins, & Hurst, 1978). The relationships between these constructs are studied in three samples: (1) registered nurses, (2) executive MBA students, and (3) female middle level managers in the telecommunications industry. Excellent comparative results were obtained across the ...

Title: Perceived Control by Employees: A Meta-Analysis of Studies Concerning                 Autonomy and Participation at Work
Author-Name: Paul E. Spector
Abstract: Perceived control by employees is a variable that has been heavily researched in two popular areas, job design (as autonomy) and participative decision-making. A meta-analysis was conducted of studies relating perceived control variables to 19 employee outcome variables. For all studies combined, it was found that high levels of perceived control was associated with high levels of job satisfaction (overall and individual facets), commitment, involvement, performance and motivation, and low levels of physical symptoms, emotional distress, role stress, absenteeism, intent to turnover, and turnover. A similar pattern was found for the autonomy and participation studies analyzed separately, with one exception. Participative decision-making was not associated with absenteeism in the single study available.

Title: Task Role Ambiguity, Satisfaction, and the Moderating Effect of Task                 Instruction Source
Author-Name: Marc Siegall
Author-Name: L. L. Cummings
Abstract: The literature regarding the relationship between role ambiguity and satisfaction has produced mixed results. Evidence suggests that factors such as the source of role expectations may affect this relationship. In order to examine one source of expectations (the supervisor), an experiment was conducted in which ambiguity (presence/absence of task clarity instructions) and instruction source (supervisor, nonsupervisor) were manipulated within the same objective task environment. Thirty-two men and 65 women participated in a full factorial design. An instruction source, satisfaction with supervisor interaction (F(1,92) = 3.5, p < .07) was found, supporting the general proposition that the source of task role expectations would affect the relationships between role ambiguity and satisfaction.

Author-Name: Victor D. Wall, Jr.
Author-Name: Linda L. Nolan
Abstract: The study reported here was descriptive in nature and looked at 375 subjects involved in a group task. The research focus was on individual satisfaction, type, and amount of conflict, its resolution, perceived inequity, and quality of outcome. The results indicated that greater inequity was associated with people conflicts, which in turn were managed primarily with avoidance tactics. Task conflicts were managed mainly with integrative styles. Greater satisfaction was associated with integrative tactics. Perceptions of inequity were more associated with conflicts centering around people than with task and less inequity resulted from conflicts managed integratively. Inequity was negatively related to satisfaction, positively related to conflict, and not found to be related to outcome quality.

Abstract: The impact of parents and best friends upon the marital lifestyle preferences of a sample of 181 high school students is examined. Respondents' choices of lifestyles are found to be correlated with their perceptions of best friends' choices to a slightly greater degree than with perceptions of parents' choices. However, perceptions of best friends' and parents' choices both exert a significant influence on respondents' own choices. Mother's occupation also exerts a strong influence. A variety of family and attitudinal variables tested through regression analysis fail to show any additional significant influence on respondents' stated preferences for marital lifestyles.

Abstract: Three hypotheses were developed and tested relating the moderating effects of interdependence between leader behaviors and satisfaction and performance. Results from a survey of 419 participants on 22 teams in eight sports revealed strong support for the performance hypotheses, but not for the satisfaction hypotheses. Winning coaches of high interdependence sports teams were described as exhibiting significantly greater leader-initiating structure than losing high interdependence coaches. Also, winning coaches of high interdependence teams exhibited significantly more leader-initiating structure and significantly less leader consideration than winning coaches of low interdependence teams.

Title: Exploring the Dimensionality of Managers' Performance Feedback to Subordinates

Author-Name: M. Peter Scontrino
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate the dimensional structure of managers' performance feedback to subordinates. Three hundred and sixty pairs of managers and subordinates from over 50 organizations located in three countries participated in the study. Both members of each pair completed an instrument assessing the timeliness, specificity, frequency, and sensitivity of the manager's positive and negative performance feedback. The relationship among these dimensions was examined using both confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis. The results offer little evidence that these dimensions actually exist as distinct features of managers' performance feedback behavior. Instead, they appear to covary so strongly as to be empirically indiscriminable. This covariation is most extreme within the positive and negative feedback domains. It is substantially less, though still present, across domains. These results suggest that it may be more appropriate to examinethe overall quality of managers' performan...

Abstract: An empirical analysis is conducted of the principal determinants of a professional deviant/adaptive behavior scale. Data are furnished from 115 salaried professionals representing different disciplines. Several prediction equations successfully explain much of the variance in the behavioral and cognitive reactions of professionals when faced with conflicting expectations in their work environment. Age, enriched work conditions, professionally-oriented management, and professionalism appear as the most important determinants. Research and managerial implications are discussed.

Title: Martial Arts Training: A Novel “Cure” for Juvenile Delinquency
Author-Name: Michael E. Trulson
Abstract: Juvenile delinquents, identified by their scores on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) received training under one of three different protocols for 1 hour three times weekly for a period of 6 months. Group I students received training in the traditional Korean Martial Art of Tae Kwon Do, Group II students received training in a “modern” version of the martial art which did not emphasize the psychological/philosophical aspects of the sport as the Korean version did, and group III students served as a control group for contact with the instructor and physical activity. Group I students showed decreased aggressiveness, lowered anxiety, increased selfesteem, increased social adroitness, and an increase in value orthodoxy, as indicated by before-and-after scores on the Jackson Personality Inventory (JPI), in addition to normal MMPI scores at the completion of the study. Group II students showed an even greater tendency toward delinquency on the MMPI than they did at the beginning of the stu...

Title: High Stress Professions: Satisfaction, Stress, and Well-Being of Spouses of Professionals
Author-Name: Cynthia M. Pavett
Abstract: Traditional stress literature contains limited information about the impact of job stress on one's family. This study examines the relationship between stress, satisfaction, and physical and psychological well-being in a group of people married to an individual in a high-stress occupation. Stress and satisfaction were operationally defined to assess the impact of the high-stress occupation on one's spouse. Results supported the hypothesized negative relationship between the multiple sources of stress and satisfaction with the source. Source specific stress was also related to psychological and physical indications of stress. The hypothesis, that Type A personality and the use of social support coping mechanisms would moderate the stress-outcome relationships, was not supported. These results suggest that professional requirements or demands can serve as sources of stress and negative affect for one's spouse.

Title: Role Perceptions among Occupational Groups in an Ambulatory Care Setting
Author-Name: Bruce J. Fried
Author-Name: Peggy Leatt
Abstract: Effective multidisciplinary health care teams require a clear understanding of the roles and responsibilities of each group. This paper reports on a study of role perceptions among three occupational groups in a medical setting-physicians, nurses, and administrative personnel. Each group was asked to assess the extent to which their group and each of the others were involved in performing each of several activities. It was hypothesized that differences in perception are related to professional aspiration level, and that the greatest differences in perception would be related to the functions carried out by groups with the highest level of professional aspiration. The results confirmed this hypothesis. Nurses, highest in professional aspiration level among the three groups, showed consistently different perceptions in their role as compared with other groups' perceptions of their role. Implications for management and research are discussed.

Title: Gender and Vocal Stress Differences During Truthful and Deceptive Information Sequences

Abstract: The focus of this study was to determine the efficacy of the Mark II Voice Stress Analyzer as a means of discriminating between truthful and deceptive communications. A simulated job interview was manipulated so that participants in the deceptive condition told the truth on all questions except two, producing two types of deception: prepared and spontaneous lies. Participants in the truthful condition were truthful throughout the interview. Gender was introduced as a predictor variable. Results indicate that the Mark II can objectively and unobtrusively detect vocal stress indicative of deception for the prepared lie, but not for the spontaneous lie. Truthful participants demonstrated no significant differences for any of the information sequences, indicating that the Mark II avoids the problems of falsely identifying innocent subjects. Females exhibited elevated levels of vocal stress during the prepared deception, whereas males did not. Implications of this study and recommendations for future research ...

Abstract: This research investigated the relationship between organizational size and turnover, using longitudinal data and time-series statistical methods. Four measures of turnover (accession rate, voluntary separation rate, involuntary separation rate, and mean tenure of those leaving the organization) were computed on a monthly basis for 65 months. After ARIMA modeling, each series was cross-correlated with a series based on organization size to investigate the relationship between turnover and size over time. The clearest relationships found were for the accession rate and average tenure of weavers; the more interesting relationships to voluntary and involuntary separations, however, were not found to be significant. Results are discussed from the perspective of temporal relationships, and the viewpoint of organizations as dynamic systems.

Title: The Social Support Process in Men: Overcoming Sex-Role Obstacles
Author-Name: Phillip C. Burda
Author-Name: Alan C. Vaux
Abstract: While recent research has indicated that men's social support resources may be inferior to women's due to societal sex roles, the literature on the consequences of this disadvantage has been mixed. This study explored the hypothesis that men have developed methods of obtaining support which do not conflict with their masculine values. It was proposed that (1) men prefer to receive nurturance from women, and (2) social drinking may facilitate supportive exchanges involving males by easing restrictions against traditionally feminine behaviors. The results were consistent with these hypotheses. It was found that the level of the 205 male subjects' belief in traditional sex-role values was negatively related to a number of social support variables. The subjects also reported a clear preference for females as primary sources of emotional support. Finally, social drinking was found to be a significant positive factor in supportive exchanges particularly when they occurred between men.

Title: Organizational Management Styles, Employee Supervisory Status, and Employee Responses
Author-Name: Terry A. Beehr

Abstract: Employees' perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors are compared in two automotive supply organizations that are similar in size, technology, industry, employee characteristics, and geographic location, but are different in formal management styles. The data are examined separately for supervisors and production workers to identify hierarchical differences. Overall, the results indicate that rank-and-file employees' perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors are more favorable in the organization with the more democratic formal managerial style than in the more traditional organization, but there is very little difference in the responses of the supervisors between the two environments. Future research directions are suggested that would further enhance our understanding of the potential impact of managerial styles on employee responses at different hierarchical levels.

Title: Conflict Tactics and the Level of Emotional Commitment Among Unmarrieds
Author-Name: Robert E. Billingham
Author-Name: Alan R. Sack
Abstract: The responses of 690 college students were analyzed to determine if the level of emotional commitment in their relationship affected the type of conflict tactics used. Significant differences were found between the lowest level and higher levels of commitment for the Reasoning and the Verbal Aggression subscales while no differences were found among the levels of commitment based on the Violence subscale. The Reasoning score increased significantly at the point when the subject became emotionally attached to his or her partner. Also, females reported significantly higher Reasoning and Verbal Aggression scores than did the males. The study indicated that at the point the subjects decide that their partner was a potential mate, major distortions occurred in how the subjects view the partners' conflict tactics behaviors. This period of distortion is referred to as the period of partner idolization and its impact on both the respondent's and their partner's behavior is discussed.

Title: Normative and Utilitarian Particularism: The Impact of Social Structure on                 Service Commitments
Author-Name: Albert I. Goldberg
Author-Name: Chanoch Jacobsen
Abstract: Particularistic considerations among professionals have been ascribed to social structural exigencies. A comparison of conventionally employed professionals with practitioners belonging to a communal framework (kibbutz) reveals two distinct forms of particularism: a generally approved Normative Particularism that caters to the legitimate demands of the professional's immediate social environment, and a less accepted Utilitarian Particularism that reflects a concern for clients who can provide greater concrete rewards. Regression analysis shows both forms of particularism to be generated out of direct interactions between practitioner and client, irrespective of social structure. Such dyadic ties may encourage practitioners to meet legitimate normative expectations, but they also provide opportunities for satisfying egoistic motives. In either case, particularistic service commitments are inherent to professional practice, and demonstrate the continuing significance of this work practice in contemporary so...

Title: Sex Ratios, Sex Role Spillover, and Sex at Work: A Comparison of Men's and                 Women's Experiences
Author-Name: Barbara A. Gutek
Author-Name: Aaron Groff Cohen
Abstract: Sex-role spillover is the carryover of gender-based roles into the work setting. It is exacerbated by having a highly skewed ratio of the sexes at work. The sex roles associated with the majority sex become incorporated into the work roles. In male-dominated jobs, activity, rationality, and aggressiveness are emphasized, whereas nurturance and passivity are associated with “women's work. “ The implications of sex-role spillover for sexual behavior at work was investigated through analysis of a telephone survey of working adults in Los Angeles County in 1980. Sex-role spillover affects people in traditional work by having their sex role and work role merged together, and affects people in nontraditional work by the fact that they are a visible minority and their sex does not correspond to the sex roles normally associated with their jobs. In the case of sexual behavior at work, the fallout of sex role spillover is more visibly negative for women than for men. Very few men work in nontraditional or integrat...

Abstract: The general unavailability of and difficulty associated with obtaining records-based data on absenteeism suggests the potential value of self-report data for those conducting research on absenteeism. This should not be recommended, however, until the validity of these self-report measures is assessed. In this paper, we compare records-based and self-report measures of absenteeism for the same employees for the same period of time. We find that although the univariate descriptive data for the two measures are similar, the correlation between the two is .299. Although this is in the expected direction, its magnitude is small enough for us to question the validity of self- report measures of absenteeism. Several suggestions are offered for additional study of this.

Title: Public Sector Professionals: Job Characteristics, Satisfaction, and Aspirations for Intrinsic Fulfillment through Work
Author-Name: Cary Cherniss
Author-Name: Jeffrey S. Kane
Abstract: Previous research on job satisfaction in government employees has not distinguished professionals from other high status groups such as managers. Professionals and blue-collar workers employed in a state government in the U.S. (N = 252) were compared in order to learn more about the quality of the professional work experience. Data on job satisfaction, task characteristics, and aspirations for intrinsic fulfillment through work were collected via a questionnaire. Results suggested that there was no difference between the two groups in job satisfaction. However, professionals rated their jobs as significantly lower in skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and knowledge of results. Professionals also believed that their jobs should provide less intrinsic fulfillment than did the blue-collar workers. It was speculated that professionals employed in government maintain minimal levels of job satisfaction despite less fulfilling jobs by reducing their aspirations for fulfillment in work.

While most of the principles set out there have stood the test of time and experience, modifications are needed. In particular, the principles that govern the process of design and the activities of the design team are even more closely bound up with the principles governing the design itself. Some new principles are proposed. More attention is given to the needs of the organization as a society.

Title: The Craft Ideal and the Integration of Work: A Study of Potters
Author-Name: Kerr InksonI
Abstract: Contemporary self-employed "home" craftspeople are considered in relation to an "ideal type" of craft worker described by C. Wright Mills and others. The ideal stresses absorption in the craft, control over the production process, the use and development of skill, and integration of work with non work. De-skilling and other consequences of employment frequently subvert the ideal, but under conditions of public demand for handcrafted work and self-employment by craftspeople, the ideal may be approached. In a questionnaire study of 67 New Zealand commercial potters, it was found that their perception of their work was largely in accord with the ideal, and, in particular, that work was highly integrated with other aspects of their lives. However, in most cases, the ideal was partly subverted by their status as traders in a market economy and their needs for economic as well as expressive satisfactions.

Abstract: The effects of technology and formal structures on value structure for lower level individuals in service operations is examined. Service providers (337) in direct contact with clients/customers were surveyed. The results indicate significant relationships among formal structure, task uncertainty, and employee value orientation to customers. Task uncertainty was also found to mediate the relationship between formal structure and value orientation for individuals in direct contact with clients/customers.

Title: Organizational Commitment: Analysis of Antecedents
Author-Name: Fred Luthans
Author-Name: Donald Baack
Author-Name: Lew Taylor
Abstract: A model of the antecedents (personal-demographic, organizational relationship, and person-organization fit) of organizational commitment was empirically analyzed. The study used a sample of employees (N = 406) from a wide variety of organizations to test the hypotheses. The results of the multiple regression analysis supported the hypothesized relationships and the proposed model on the antecedents to organizational commitment. In particular, this study uncovered heretofore unknown implications that attributional processes such as locus of control have on organizational commitment as well as supporting previous research on the impact of demographics and leader behavior. Overall, the antecedent model, tested empirically, has important practical implications for predicting employees' organizational commitment.

Abstract: The generalizability of the findings showing a relationship among sexual attitudes, sexual and contraceptive behavior, and responses to statements about sexual topics was investigated. Females (n = 722) attending five state and private universities in urban and rural locations were administered the Sexual Opinion Survey, a questionnaire dealing with sexual and contraceptive behavior, and semantic differential items involving sexual matters. Associations generally occurred between the expression of more positive sexual attitudes and the reporting of behaviors and attitudes supportive of effective contraceptive activity. Analysis of variance of the questionnaire responses indicated main effects for both the campus setting and erotophobia-erotophilia for nearly all of the items. A correlational analysis found significant relationships in the predicted directions between sexual attitudes and responses to most of the survey items by subjects in each campus setting.

Title: Tenure as a Moderator of the Absence-Intent to Leave Relationship
Author-Name: Gerald R. Ferris
Author-Name: Kendrith M. Rowland
Abstract: Inconsistencies in the absenteeism-turnover relationship have prompted researchers to seek a more informed understanding of how these two forms of organizational withdrawal relate. Recent work on socialization and on job-related experiences at work suggests that the absenteeism-turnover relationship may vary as a function of tenure. The present study examined this notion and found a significant moderating effect for tenure. Low-tenured employees who were absent more frequently tended to be less inclined to leave, whereas high-tenured employees who were absent more reflected a stronger inclination to leave.

Title: Assessing Organizational Commitment in a Developing Country: Pakistan, A Case Study
Author-Name: Shafiq A. Alvi
Author-Name: Syed W. Ahmed
Abstract: This study examines commitment of male and female employees to their organizations in a less affluent society (Pakistan). It uses a blend of the "exchange" and "role" theories as its basic framework. Results indicate that both groups of workers are highly committed to their organizations. Unlike the results of most previous studies involving industrialized societies, the degree of female commitment in Pakistan appears to be much higher than that of male workers, and age seems inversely related with commitment. Also, the psychological and role-related factors seem to exert greater influence on commitment than the exchange-based and personal factors.

Title: Cosmopolitan-Local: A Cross-Lagged Correlation Analysis of the Relationship Between Professional Role Orientations and Behaviors in an Academic Organization
Author-Name: Jeffrey R. Cornwall
Author-Name: Andrew J. Grimes
Abstract: This paper examines the development of professional role orientations. The theoretical foundation of this study is Gouldner's (1957, 1958) research of the cosmopolitan-local construct. The focus is on the relationship between the five dimensions of the cosmopolitan-local construct and professional behaviors. Examination of the relationship of professional role orientations and professional behaviors involves the use of cross-lagged correlations of the role-orientation scales with professional behavior variables using data collected in a university at two points in time. The results indicate that the relationships with significant values show professional behaviors influencing professional role orientations over time.

Title: Experiencing Technical Work: A Comparison of Male and Female Engineers
Author-Name: Lotte Bailyn
Abstract: Analysis of questionnaire data from 51 matched male/female pairs of engineers shows that even though these pairs are in very similar positions and share similar orientations to the role of work in their lives, the women have a more ambivalent attitude toward technical expertise. The reasons seem not to lie in complications stemming from women's multiple roles, but relate, rather, to the singular, more "masculine" way that technical work is defined. In managerial roles, in contrast, where criteria of effective performance are more difficult to specify, women seem to be engaged in new models which are associated with less ambivalence. Such diversity, it is argued, is useful for all employees, male and female.

Author-Name: Diane Weissman
Author-Name: Adrian Furnham
Abstract: This study investigated the relationship between the expectations of a group of sojourning Americans before they came to England, and their experience 6 months after arriving. Nearly 60 Americans were contacted before leaving and completed two questionnaires, one relating to their expectations and the other a measure of mental health. These expectations were related to various demographic variables, especially mental health. After 6 months, a number of sojourners were contacted who filled out a similar pair of questionnaires. Although there were few differences between expectations and experiences, mental health was associated with the larger differences between expectations and experiences. The results are discussed in terms of self-fulfilling prophecies. Limitations of the study are also discussed.

Author-Name: Larry M. Lance
Abstract: This investigation focused on the influence of exposure to and interaction with gay persons on heterosexual self-reported attitudes of comfort with homosexuality. A group-administered questionnaire, including a 25-item scale by Hudson and Ricketts to measure the perceived degree of dread or discomfort of contact with homosexuals, was used in human sexuality classes at a southeastern metropolitan university during 1983. Findings taking into account the total scale scores, as well as the 25 individual item scores. suggested that exposure to and interaction with homosexuals results in a self-reported attitude of reduction in discomfort with homosexuals.

Abstract: This study examined outside observers' judgments of the influence of the nature and similarity of transacted resources on the growth of new and old friendships. A number of hypotheses were developed and tested in a questionnaire study in which female subjects responded to vignettes describing exchanges between two male friends. The design was a 2 (particularistic vs. universalistic resources) x 2 (similar vs. dissimilar resources) x 2 (new vs. old friendship) factorial. A new friendship was (with few exceptions) considered to grow more when similar particularistic rather than similar universalistic or dissimilar resources were exchanged, and when similar universalistic rather than dissimilar resources were exchanged. There were few corresponding differences for an old friendship, however. Also, the exchange of similar particularistic resources, as well as the exchange of dissimilar resources, were seen as more conducive to the growth of a new rather than of an old friendship. The exchange of similar unive...

Title: Beyond Epistemology and Reflective Conversation: Towards Human Relations
Author-Name: Norman Jackson
Author-Name: Hugh Willmott
Abstract: In response to the current crisis in the philosophy of social science, the proposition has been advanced that "reflective conversation" between researchers offers a way of attaining awareness and understanding of the non-epistemological influences that shape the processes and products of research. The recognition of these (inescapable) sources of bias is said to heighten awareness of the limitations of methodology and has the potential to avoid their undesirable effects. Highlighting the inconsistencies of this thesis, the paper argues that since non-epistemological influences cannot be purged, it would be better to move with them so that science becomes directly geared to the alleviation of socially unnecessary suffering. An essentially epistemological preoccupation with the question of how science makes its claims would then be replaced by a praxis orientation whose principal commitment is to the development of mature human relations, including the facilitation of the realization of creativity and commu...

Title: Further Examination of the Work Autonomy Scales: Three Studies
Author-Name: James A. Breaugh
Author-Name: Alene S. Becker
Abstract: Recently, Breaugh (1985) developed an instrument that measures three facets, i.e., method, scheduling, and criteria, of work autonomy. This paper presents the results of three studies designed to evaluate both the construct validity and the perceived usefulness of Breaugh's Work Autonomy Scales. In the first study, confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the underlying factor structure of the three work autonomy facet measures. Each of several methods for assessing the fit of a theoretical model confirmed that a three-facet model clearly fit the sample data. In Study 2, an experimental design was used to examine the degree to which individuals'self-reports of autonomy actually reflected objective conditions. A close correspondence between the experimental manipulations and subjective ratings of autonomy was found. In Study 3, the perceived usefulness of the information provided by the three autonomy scales was examined. In both an absolute and a comparative sense, i.e., in comparison to measuring ...

Title: Perceived Importance of Job Facets and Overall Job Satisfaction of Industrial Workers
Author-Name: A. Khaleque
Author-Name: M. A. Rahman
Abstract: The present study is an attempt to measure overall job satisfaction of industrial workers, to identify some determinants of job satisfaction, and to evaluate the perceived importance of job facets to their overall job satisfaction. The study was conducted on 1560 workers selected randomly from four jute industires in Bangladesh. The results indicate that the statisfaction variables are not unidirectional in their effects. Job facets can be sources of both satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Overall job satisfaction of industrial workers seems to be influenced by the satisfaction with job facets and personal life, and the degree of satisfaction appears to depend on the satisfaction with the number of job facets as well as their perceived importance.

Title: Factors Influencing Pay Decisions: Balancing Managerial Vulnerabilities
Author-Name: David C. Martin
Abstract: This study investigated the pay raise distributions of allocators when their job situations make them particularly dependent on subordinates. The study compared recommended pay raises when the worker was a high or average performer, had high or low specialized expertise relative to the particular work unit circumstances, and either used no influence attempt, voiced an inequity complaint, or engaged in ingratiating behaviors involving complimenting the manager and expressing conformity with the manager's views. The situation was described as one in which high performance was important, the staff was somewhat underpaid, and availability of alternative employment in the external job market was good. As expected, larger raises were assigned people with better performance. However, allocators also gave significantly higher pay raises when the subordinate had high specialized expertise relative to the particular circumstance. Contrary to predictions, however, influence attempts were not significantly better tha...

Title: Union Membership and Attitudes Toward Participation in Determining Conditions of Work in the Federal Government

Author-Name: Gregory H. Gaertner
Abstract: Data from five federal installations are examined in order to determine the relationship between union membership and (1) perceived influence over the determination of working conditions, and (2) satisfaction with participation in determining work conditions in this sector. Union members, compared with nonmember bargaining unit employees, show lowerperceivedparticipation in determining their annual performance standards and less satisfaction with their influence in creating these standards. Lower satisfaction with influence persists even when perceived amount of influence is controlled, supporting the argument that union members in the federal government seek more influence in determining their conditions of work than nonmembers. These results are not indicative of job dissatisfaction or of distrust between labor and management. Rather, they appear to reflect a positive desire among union members for more influence in the agency.

Abstract: An attitudinal model of organizational commitment was tested using a sample of 367 managerial employees. Several aspects of the organization: perceived structure, process, and climate, as well as job satisfaction were found to be predictive of commitment. Job satisfaction and commitment were found to be equally predictive of voluntary turnover. Commitment was found to be predictive of individual motivation and objective job performance, but not of supervisors' ratings of job performance.

Author-Name: C. A. L. Pearson
Abstract: A longitudinal field experiment of job change was conducted over a 1-year period with 42 geographically dispersed railway track maintenance gangs. Experimental groups that employed participative goal setting were compared with a control unit that continued to employ the traditional work procedures. When perceptual, behavioral and affective responses were evaluated, over eight trials, it was determined that there were significantly different responses between the experimental and control groups. Those incumbents who were engaged in participative goal setting reported higher perceived states of involvement in decision making and greater job satisfaction. It was also observed that goal setting and performance were positively related. The implications for these findings are discussed.

Abstract: A structural equation model is proposed to delineate the various aspects of self-reported job satisfaction. The model specifies structural linkages among four factors including (1) background, (2) perceptions, (3) organizational, and (4) subjective ratings of overall job satisfaction. The proposed model is evaluated by using data from a random probability sample of blackfemale managers living in five southwestern states. The results support the predictions derived from the proposed model and indicate that the model explains 66% of the variance in overall job satisfaction. Organizational measures, in general, account for most of the explained variance.

Title: Employee Reactions to Disciplinary Action

Author-Name: Chalmer E. Labig, Jr.
Abstract: While the use of disciplinary actions in the workplace is common, few studies have investigated employee reactions to these actions. Using survey data collected from 177 firefighters, associations between various aspects of meting out discipline and employee reactions are examined in an exploratory study. Results reveal that the pleasantness with which disciplinary action is administered appears to be the most important factor in lessening discipline's potential for generating emotional reactions and deterioration of supervisor/subordinate relationships. In addition, perceived appropriateness of discipline is related to the degree to which prior relations were positive, accuracy of supervisor's diagnosis of the situation, and presentation of a reason for discipline. Cessation of targeted behaviors was least explained by the variables of the study suggesting that the factors that account for effective behavior change through disciplinary action are in need of identification.

Title: The Psychodynamics of Regression in Work Groups
Author-Name: Michael A. Diamond
Author-Name: Seth Allcorn
Abstract: Individual regression in groups stems from anxiety arising from each individual's attempt to construct a psychodynamic equilibrium between one's demands for adequate self-identity (individuality that is not a threat to other group members) and group membership (affiliation that is not a threat to one's identity). The dilemma of reconciling needs for individuality and group membership provokes annihilation anxiety in which one resorts to regressive action in order to protect one's self from anxiety associated with uncertain object-relations, annihilation and feelings of persecution, and loss of affiliation. As a result, group cultures often are characterized by unconscious actions and shared fantasies stemming from the sum of individual regressed and primitive coping defenses. Individual regression and other primitive defensive actions are observable at the group level of analysis, and lend themselves to description as a group culture. The psychodynamics of individual and group regression with four work-gr...

Title: Depersonalization: A Valid Dimension of Burnout?
Author-Name: Anna-Maria Garden
Abstract: A major underlying assumption in burnout research is that burnout is a phenomenon to be found primarily in the human services professions. The focus of this study is the effect this assumption has had on conventional definitions of burnout. The generalizability of the concept of depersonalization, frequently cited as a part of burnout, is tested in a nonhuman services occupation. In addition, the study controls for the effect of Jungian psychological type, since one particular Jungian type is overrepresented in the human services. It was found that depersonalization was not a salient construct in this occupational setting. Further, the construct was not the unidimensional one said to exist in the human services. It was also found to be type-specific. Negative reactions to other people were associated with the burnout measure only for that Jungian type which predominates in the human services. Another Jungian type, which is underrepresented in that occupational arena, reacted with a greater degree of perso...

Title: Alternative Ethics: The Relationship between the Wealth, Welfare, Work, and Leisure Ethic
Author-Name: Adrian Furnhaml
Author-Name: Maria Rose
Abstract: This study attempted to devise and evaluate four belief systems regarding how people acquire their money and spend their time: the Protestant Work Ethic (P WE) which emphasizes the positive feature of work, the leisure ethic which sees recreation rather than work as the main means to personalfulfillment, the wealth ethic which stresses the accumulation of wealth to ensure independence from others and work, and the welfare ethic which is based on the idea that one should exploit state benefits as a primary source of income. As predicted, the PWE was significantly negatively correlated with the leisure and welfare ethic which were themselves positively correlated. The wealth ethic was significantly correlated with the leisure ethic. Correlations between subscale scores derived from factor analysis and other related measures showed an interesting and predicted pattern of work-related beliefs. Results are discussed in terms of developing and testing belief systems associated with the PWE.

Abstract: This paper identifies theoretical parallels between Keidel's triadic sports-model framework and several other constructs from the literatures on organization, strategy/planning, structure, and style/culture. It is argued that the sports models as a set offer a potentially unifying conceptual framework, because these models embody generic patterns of part. part and part:whole relations. Three possible relations among triadic elements are identified and found to be reflected in the sports-model framework. Research implications of this framework are discussed.

Title: A Paradoxical Conception of Group Dynamics
Author-Name: Kenwyn K. Smith
Author-Name: David N. Berg
Abstract: Most of the research literature on group dynamics has either ignored the subject of within-group conflict or sought ways to "resolve" it as a consequence of its seemingly dysfunctional effects. We argue that there are many processes experienced as conflictual because of the models members use for understanding and managing actions, feelings, and thoughts that are in "apparent opposition." We contend that by understanding the paradoxical nature of these group processes many of the conflicts associated with these "apparent contradictions" are "released" and, hence, not in need of "resolving" because they are experienced as essential to group life, rather than extraneous. Underlying theory about the paradoxical nature of group experiences is expounded, and seven group dynamics are examined using a paradoxical epistemology. These are the paradoxes of identity, disclosure, trust, individuality, authority, regression, and creativity.

Title: Sex Roles and Social Perception
Author-Name: Robert L. Quackenbush
Abstract: Recent research by Abbey (1982) revealed that men are more likely to perceive the world in sexual terms and to make sexual judgments than women are. The present investigation focused on the comprehensiveness of Abbey's findings, drawing from the theories of androgyny and gender schema. Males and females viewed a 5-minute videotaped conversation of a male-female dyad. They then completed questionnaires concerning the interaction, providing ratings for both actors on various trait terms. Male participants were then separated into androgynous, undifferentiated, and masculine sex-typed groups, using the Bem Sex-Role Inventory. Results revealed that undifferentiated males rated the male actor significantly higher, on specific sexual terms, than the other groups rated him. The findings are discussed in terms of gender roles as distinct social skills. They support the view that masculinity and femininity, as measured by the Bem Sex-Role Inventory and similar instruments, are actually social competencies that con...

Abstract: The importance of specialized cognitive function attributed to the right or left cerebral hemispheres is demonstrated for performance of management level jobs. The results are a first step to validate the often-repeated notion that managers should have good right hemisphere skills to manage effectively, especially for complex jobs. This series of studies employs a valid measure of cognitive function attributed to the hemispheres of the brain and a recently-developed technique for the analysis of work. The results suggest that specialized cognitive function interacts with job complexity and magnitude to predict performance ratings.

Title: Strategies for Third Party Intervention
Author-Name: Hugo Prein
Abstract: This article deals with intervention strategies, initiated by a third party, for social conflicts within organizations. An attempt is made to discover the extent to which a number of primary strategies, drawn from the literature, are used by internal and external organizational consultants in the day-to-day practice. Quantitative and qualitative material from 69 actual cases of third party intervention, distributed over different kinds of organizations and dealing with several types of conflict, is collected and analyzed. Two strategies (consultation and mediation) come clearly to the forefront: Consultation is split into two (sub)strategies, a confrontational and a procedural approach.

Title: Predictors of the Effectiveness of Supervisory Social Power
Author-Name: Ikhlas A. H. Abdalla
Abstract: The objectives of this research are: (1) to examine the relative importance of ten superior's, subordinate's, and situational attributes as determinants of the effectiveness of six supervisory bases of social power in the Arabian Gulf region, and (2) to extend the validity of previous research findings regarding the determinants of supervisory social power. Data were collected from 255 middle management Arab personnel from a wide variety of organizations in the State of Kuwait. Results obtainedfrom factor analysis indicate that three processes of influence are available to the superiors of middle managers: reward-punishment, position-organization, and expert-referent processes of influence. The internalization-influence process identified by Kelman (1958) was not obtained largely due to cultural influences. In addition, multiple regression results indicate that the educational level of the subordinate has dominating negative effect on the three influence processes. Most of the other determinants have sign...

Title: Sex-Role Salience: An Important Component in the Measurement of Sex-Role Identity
Author-Name: Shashi Ravinder
Abstract: This study describes the development of a new instrument of sex-role identity, the Ravinder Sex Role Salience Reptest (2RS Reptest). The 2RS Reptest is based on Kelly's Personal Construct Theory and recent advances in sex-role development models. In particular, this instrument incorporates the notion of sex-role salience, and makes it possible to characterize an individual as masculine, feminine, androgynous, or sex-role transcendent. The findings revealed support for the validity of the measure and illustrated the utility of using such an instrument for the measurement of sex-role identity.

Title: The Design and Activation of Self-Regulating Work Groups
Author-Name: John A. Pearce, III
Author-Name: Elizabeth C. Ravlin
Abstract: This paper reviews the literature on self-managing work groups as implemented in organizations, and briefly reviews relevant laboratory and other non-SR WG research. A model is developed exploring the processes of SR WG implementation and operation. Task, organization, and personnel preconditions to implementation are identified, including appropriate expectations by managerial personnel. Design features should include heterogeneous composition and minimal status differences. Activation mechanisms are thought to smooth the way for the successful group, which exhibits the positive process criteria of variety in group member responses, coordination of members, and commitment to group success.

Abstract: This paper develops and tests a theoretical model of the relationships among environmental interdependence, environmental uncertainty, and boundary-spanning activities. Drawing from the strategic choice literature, a decision variable labeled influence on organizational decision was incorporated as a moderator. Results supported the environmental interdependence-environmental uncertainty-boundary-spanning activities relationships, but the individual influence variable failed to emerge as a moderator.

Title: The Influence of Positive and Negative Outcomes on Force Model Expectancy Predictions: Mixed Results from Two Samples
Author-Name: John E. Mathieu
Abstract: The relative validity of valence-instrumentality-expectancy (VIE) force model predictions of performance, based on positive and negative outcome lists, was examined. Using an open-ended questionnaire, Army and Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets generated positive and negative outcomes associated with participation in ROTC. VIE predictions were tested separately for the two samples using both self and supervisor ratings of performance. VIE composites based on the combined lists of outcomes significantly predicted both self and supervisor performance ratings in the Navy sample, and self-ratings in the Army sample. Limited support was obtained for the hypotheses that (1) positive outcome based VIE composites would correlate greater with performance than negative-based composites, and (2) VIE correlations with self-ratings would exceed those with supervisor ratings. The results were discussed in terms of how individuals process positive and negative outcome information related to high performan...

Title: The Organization and Employee Alcohol Misuse
Author-Name: Martin Markowitz
Abstract: There are many factors that could contribute to the onset of alcoholism. This paper examines the possible role that the work organization plays in alcohol misuse among employees. It is suggested that perceived organizational and job characteristics facilitate the onset or continuance of an alcohol problem. The mechanism by which these perceptions may affect alcohol misuse and attitudes toward alcohol use by co-workers is through their contribution to feelings of self-estrangement and powerlessness. Two hundred and ninetythree full-time employees completed surveys which were analyzed using correlational and path-analytic techniques. The results indicate support for the perceptions-self-estrangement-alcohol misuse sequence. Feelings of powerlessness at work were not significantly associated with the dependent measures. The results are discussed.

Title: Power in Work Groups: Team Member's Perspectives
Author-Name: Joseph S. Fiorelli
Abstract: Power and restrictive participation are often identified as primary issues which can retard the productivity of work groups. The study describes team member responses to a questionnaire regarding bases of social power used within 19 interdisciplinary clinical team meetings and their relationship with team decision-making style, participation in team decisions, and team meeting productivity. Physicians were found to effect almost all treatment decisions, and autocratic decision making was found to be more prevalent than consensual decision making. It is suggested that the generally held belief that the interdisciplinary team approach is equivalent with shared decision making and broad-based participation needs careful re-examination. Implications of the findings for shared decision making in health care teams and work groups in general are discussed. The importance for managers and team leaders to understand and appropriately facilitate the dynamics of power in work groups is emphasized.

Abstract: This article argues that the introduction of qualitative research methods into the study of leadership may improve this area of research by facilitating the introduction of a wider range of contextual variables into the investigation of leadership styles. It is also contended that such variables have the advantage of being grounded in people's experiences and are therefore more accesible to practitioners. These points are developed from the authors' research into the construction industry, in which the factors taken into account by leaders informing their leadership styles were investigated through intensive interviewing during three construction projects.

Title: The Transforming Nature of Metaphors in Group Development: A Study in Group Theory
Author-Name: Suresh Srivastva
Author-Name: Frank J. Barrett
Abstract: It is proposed in this paper that members' creation of metaphors facilitates further expression and development of the group. Few methodologies for group inquiry help us in understanding the tacit awareness (Polanyi, 1959) of members as the group is in the process of interacting. One way of discovering members' awareness is by paying attention to their language, specifically their creation of metaphors. We would like to put forth propositions concerning metaphor and group process that suggest how: (1) paying attention to metaphors are indicators of a group's phase of development and can lead to a discovery of the tacit awareness of group members; (2) metaphor facilitates learning and overcomes resistance to otherwise difficult subjects; (3) metaphor is generative and facilitates contact between group members and in this way supports the growth and development of the group; and (4) as individuals articulate metaphors to express their feelings and perceptions while attempting to understand their experience ...

Title: Executive Stress: Extending the International Comparison
Author-Name: lain A. McCormick
Author-Name: Cary L. Cooper
Abstract: Much current research has considered the problems of occupational health and stress within particular work groups or individual countries. In a recent paper, an international comparison was made of the stress of senior executives in such countries as the United Kindgom, the United States, Sweden, Japan, Nigeria, and Egypt. In this study, it was shown that executives from less industrialized countries had higher levels of mental ill-health and job dissatisfaction. In the present study, this international comparison was extended using executives from New Zealand, a country with a reputedly more relaxed lifestyle but with serious economic problems. The comparison indicated that the New Zealand executives had lower levels of stress than those in all other countries but Sweden, and the lowest rates of job dissatisfaction. Stepwise multiple regression analyses provided clear and useful results indicating that threat of job loss was the best predictor of mental health, while interpersonal conflict and external a...

Title: Secrecy, Information, and Politics: An Essay on Organizational Decision Making
Author-Name: Steven P. Feldman
Abstract: The literature on organizational politics has described organizational decision making as a fluid, informal process characterized by conflict and compromise. One of the most important reasons decision making tends to become politicized is because decision situations are uncertain and open to multiple interpretations. The political process develops as coalitions attempt to define the decision context to gain control over the decision-making process. But the concept of information typically used to investigate organizational politics is defined in terms of the ability to predict future states of the world. This definition completely overlooks the socially constructed nature of information and the fundamentally socially constructed nature of the decision-making process. The result has been an ignoring or underestimating of the role the distortion and manipulation of information plays in communicating and decision-making processes. In this essay, information is understood as a socially constructed phenomenon ...

Title: Effectiveness Assessment in Public Service Systems
Author-Name: Efraim Torgovnik
Author-Name: Ela Preisler
Abstract: The study combines research on effectiveness and organizational assessment. The reliability model enables a qualitative and quantitative assessment of level of performance and quality of performance of public service systems in two structural networks: parallel and sequential. The two levels of analysis used here, the unit and the system, show (1) how unit's level of performance and quality of performance affect the effectiveness of a system as a whole, and (2) the extent of a unit's detraction or contribution to a system's effectiveness. The reliability model enabled the measurement of (J) effectiveness as a product of structure and human interrelationships, and (2) areas amenable to corrective policies. The holistic approach to the unit-system relations makes the analytical and measurement distinction between performance with and without citizen participation. The measurements make it possible to deal with a concept, which in the past was on unstable theoretical and methodological grounds. For example, ...

Title: A Longitudinal Study of the Psychological Well-Being of Unemployed Men and the Mediating Effect of Neuroticism
Author-Name: Roy Payne
Abstract: This paper proposes that the psychological experience of unemployed persons is determined by the stressfulness of the environment, but the relationships between the two is affected by certain conditioning variables, e.g., general health and social class, and by personal attributes such as their commitment to being employed and the tactics they use to cope with being unemployed. This model is tested empirically in a longitudinal study of 75 men who were studied on three occasions over a period of 2 years. Stepwise multiple regression was used to test the model on three occasions, and it was shown to be reasonably successful in predicting variations in psychological well-being. At time 3 of the study, trait neuroticism was measured to test the hypothesis that the large correlations among all negatively-toned scales found in the first two phases of the study were the result of a personality trait such as neuroticism. The results strongly supported this hypothesis. The implications of this for other self-repo...

Title: Organizations as Multiple Cultures: A Rules Theory Analysis
Author-Name: Randall A. Rose
Abstract: This essay articulates the utility of the coordinated management of meaning(CMM) theory of rules for identifying different cultures within an organization and for conceptualizing the complex interaction between them. In CMM, rules are conceptualized as cognitions that individuals employ to create action in interpersonal episodes. The utility of CMMas a theoretical and an analytical frame is specifically demonstrated through applying the perspective to one view of multiple cultures in organizations: the interplay between a dominant culture, one whose central values are espoused by top management and are widely shared, and three specific types of subcultures: enhancing, orthogonal, and a counterculture. The roles of structural vs. content factors in organizational cultures as well as the dynamic meshing of intrapersonal meanings to create interpersonal action are also addressed in terms of CMM.

Title: The Vortical Environment: The Fifth in the Emery-Trist Levels of Organizational Environments
Author-Name: Oguz N. Baburoglu
Abstract: The paper develops a conceptual scheme that has not been developed to extend the Emery-Trist levels of organizational environments to afifth level consistent with premises laid in their milestone paper (Emery & Trist, 1965). The mounting contemporary evidence that can be observed in the salience of maladaptive responses to turbulent environments is the second reason for undertaking this challenge. More specifically, it is argued that the prevalence of stalemate, polarization, and monothematic dogmatism, the second-order maladaptive responses to the turbulent environment, leads to a frozen or a clinched order of connectedness as well as that of unevenly dynamic turbulent conditions. This approach facilitates the articulation of a different causal texture of an organizational environment than the previous four levels (placid random, placid clustered, disturbed reactive, and turbulent).

Abstract: A quantitative review of employee absence correlates was conducted to address inconsistencies among findings and include the results of studies conducted since the last major review. Correlates were categorized as psychological, demographic work environment, or organization-wide factors and analyzed separately using two operationalizations (total time absent and absence frequency). Occupational status was used as a moderator for correlates with unstable effects. The results of the study indicate that work environment and organization-wide correlates are better predictors of employee absence than psychological or demographic correlates. Both the implications for volitional theories of absence and practical applications of the findings are discussed.

Title: Attention State and Critical Psychological States as Mediators Between Job Dimensions and Job Outcomes
Author-Name: Shaul Fox
Author-Name: Gerald Feldman
Abstract: Activity-related-attention (ARA), representing the arousal level, is proposed as an intervening variable linking job characteristics to job outcomes. Two initial studies evaluated a new ARA state questionnaire assessing job-related attentional states. Worker responses displayed high internal consistency and were related to job satisfaction as well as to differences between mundane and enjoyable activities. Student responses displayed high test-retest correlations over a 2-week period. The third study compared the relative role of attention/arousal vs. the critical psychological states (CPS) appearing in Hackman and Oldham's (1976) job characteristics model. Questionnaires completed by 119 employees dealt with (1) job characteristics, (2) job outcomes of work satisfaction, effort, and performance, and (3) ARA state, and CPS. Regression analyses indicated that CPS tended to have a stronger mediating role than ARA in the relation between job characteristics and outcomes. However, ARA was found to contribute ...

Title: Overcoming Hermeticism in Organization Theory: An Alternative to Paradigm Incommensurability
Author-Name: John Hassard
Abstract: The paper discusses a major logical problem in recent organizational analysis the assumption that while paradigms are incommensurable, movement between them is nonproblematic, i.e., writers suggest paradigms are exclusive yet advocate interparadigm research (Ritzer, 1975; Burrell and Morgan, 1979; Pondy and Boje, 1981; Morgan, 1986). To make sense of this, and to establish an argument for paradigm mediation, we return to the origins of the debate in Kuhn's philosophy of science. In finding much equivocation in Kuhn, and especially in his debate with Popper, we draw upon the "later" Wittgenstein for facilitating Giddens' "relativity without relativism. " The analysis rejects both Kuhn's (1962) "strong" thesis of incommensurability and Popper's (1970) notion of liberal transions, in favor of a middle ground through Wittgenstein's (1953) "language-game of everyday life. "For organizational analysis, the paper argues for being "trained into" new paradigms, given the premise that "unorganized experience cannot...

Title: Toward Measures of High-Level Competencies: A Re-examination of McClelland's Distinction Between Needs and Values
Author-Name: John Raven
Abstract: McClelland has argued that it is essential to distinguish sharply both between operant and respondent measures and between needs and values. Further, that it is not possible to develop respondent measures of needs. In this paper, it is argued that there are alternative explanations of the results which led McClelland to these conclusions. Thereafter, it is shown that McClelland's measures of needs are best understood as indices of the number of important competencies which people bring to bear to reach goals they value. The measurement paradigm embedded in these measures conflicts with the dominant psychometric paradigm. McClelland's indices are neither valuefree nor internally-consistent; they are value-based, and the scores, like multiple regression coefficients, involve summing across independent predictors of performance. This new understanding of the psychometric principles on which McClelland's measures are based points to ways in which respondent measures of needs can be developed. However, more im...

Abstract: Humor is seen as a virtuous personality trait that can be used to release tension, convey organizational roles, and alleviate boredom. What may be perceived as a humorous joke to one person, however, could be considered inappropriate or offensive to another. Thus, joking may impact on civil and human rights litigation and on the quality of work life. To further understand perceptions of humor and joking, 165 subjects were asked to evaluate the appropriateness of three types of jokes in work settings. Whites and females considered racist and sexist jokes more inappropriate than blacks and males. Inexperienced employees considered all joking behavior at work to be less appropriate than experienced employees.

Abstract: Much organizational behavior is argued to be performed mindlessly, on the basis of scripts learned through organizational socialization, work experience, and symbolic management. While scripts conserve cognitive capacity, provide a basis for organizing and evaluating behavior, legitimate organizational activities, moderate role conflict, andfacilitate sense making, prediction, and control, they also induce a lack of vigilance and authenticity in operating routines, and bunkered perceptions, premature closure, and superstitious learning in decision making. Directions for future research include documenting the existence and effects of mindlessness, and exploring the predisposing conditions of script processing and means of maximizing the functional and minimizing the dysfunctional aspects of scripts on organizational effectiveness.

Title: Models of Stress in Organizational Research: A Metatheoretical Perspective
Author-Name: Joe R. Eulberg
Author-Name: Jerr A. Weekley
Author-Name: Rabi S. Bhagat
Abstract: Four models of organizational stress are comparatively reviewed using seven metatheoretical criteria. It is found that while they have been rather successful in explaining large bodies of existing empirical literature in a post hoc fashion, there is a consistent lack of conceptual tightness in some of the models. The crucial role of temporal factors has not been adequately dealt with, and a variance, as opposed to a process theory framework (Mohr, 1982) has dominated much conceptual developments. It is suggested that metatheoretical assessments along the lines proposed in this review would aid in future theory-building efforts. Three major recommendations are made in order to improve conceptual developments and methodological robustness in this important area of organizational behavior.

Title: Theoretical and Methodological Problems Within Occupational Stress and Burnout Research
Author-Name: Jocelyn A. Handy
Abstract: This article examines the implicit assumptions underlying current research into occupational stress and burnout. It argues that the two fields utilize similar theoretical models and research techniques and therefore have a number of problems in common. These problems arise from their common tendency to adopt a psychological perspective which pays insufficient attention to the complexity of the interrelationship between social conditions and subjective experience. The article suggests that both fields could be strengthened by incorporating more sociological concepts and developing analyses of the effects which discrepancies between the manifest and latent functions and surface and deep structures of organizations have on the individual's subjective experiences of work. The value of such analyses is illustrated with three examples of empirical research utilizing this perspective.

Title: Organizational Factors and Perceptions of Climate in Three Psychiatric Units
Author-Name: Michael P. O'Driscoll
Author-Name: Rosalind Evans
Abstract: The relationships of perceived organizational structure, leader behaviors, and communication processes with perceptions of the work environment and ward atmosphere by staff in three psychiatric units were assessed. Satisfaction with communication and participation in decision making emerged as the most consistent correlates of staff views about their work environment, while dimensions of ward atmosphere were most frequently related to satisfaction with communication. Patient scores on the ward atmosphere scales were most closely associated with staff receptiveness and interest, along with patient involvement in decisions and satisfaction with the degree of patient-staff communication. These findings highlight the salience of organizational climate variables and illustrate the utility of ward atmosphere and work environment perceptions as components of a multi-dimensional climate construct.

Title: Factor Analysis and the Construct Indicator Relationship
Author-Name: John Bynner
Abstract: The use of factor analysis to validate theoretical constructs and to underpin multiple indicator measurement strategies ignores two methodological principles: a necessary condition for the operationalization of a theoretical construct is not the same as a sufficient condition, and a correlation does not imply a particular model of causation. It is pointed out that factor analysis of the traditional (exploratory) kind used as a basis for construct validation breaches these principles; it does not provide sufficient evidence of construct validity, and it is incapable of dealing with any structure of the relations between variables other than in terms of a set of underlying causes (common factors). Alternative causal interpretations can be evaluated only through the confirmatory methods of structural modeling. Using this approach in the analysis of Richmond Basic Skills Test data, the value of alternatives to the classical factor model is clearly demonstrated. Some implications for measurement strategy and t...

Title: Dual-Career Couples and Geographic Transfer: Executives' Reactions to Commuter Marriage and Attitude Toward the Move
Author-Name: Ann Siegris Taylor
Author-Name: John W. Lounsbury
Abstract: This study investigated four factors predicted to influence executive decision making concerning geographic transfers when married employees are involved. One hundred and fifty-one executives completed a series of "inbasket" decision-making tasks which described geographic transfer situations. Their ratings of geographic transfers were found to be significantly affected by the couple's attitude toward the move and the presence of commuter marriage (a marital arrangement in which spouses maintain separate households to maximize career possibilities, and reunite when schedules permit). In contrast to prior research, significant differences were not obtained for sex of employee. A number of significant interactions were observed; however, both of the above main effects held up in post hoc analyses of simple main effects. The results were discussed in terms of their implications for companies and for employees considering a commuter marriage. It was recommended that companies should show a greater awareness o...

Title: Cooperative and Competitive Dynamics Within and Between Organizational Units
Author-Name: Dean Tjosvold
Abstract: Goal interdependence has been theorized to affect collaboration both within and between groups. Thirty-nine employees of a public health agency were interviewed on specific interactions they had with those either in their own or another work unit. Consistent with previous experiments, employees who concluded that their goals were cooperative had trusting expectations, exchanged information and resources, worked efficiently and productively, and developed confidence for future collaboration. Interactions with competitive goals were characterized by suspicion, little exchange, and low productivity and morale. Results were interpreted as suggesting that independent goals interfere more with interaction between work units than within them.

Title: The Development of Political Understanding in Children Between 6-15 Years Old
Author-Name: Anna Emilia Berti
Abstract: The origin of political understanding in Italian children from 6-iS years old was investigated by presenting them with a modified version of the story which Adelson and O'Neil (1966) used to study such reasoning in pre-adolescence and adolescence. Subjects (N = 80) were asked to state what several thousand people, who had arrived on a recently discovered island, would do in order to settle on it. Interviews were conducted focusing on the following points: collective needs, political organization, conflicts, and laws; for each topic, children's answers were ordered into developmental sequences. Young children were found to be unaware of conflicts, need for organization, and the function of laws. Eight to nine-year-old children, after some prompting, mentioned "chiefs"governing the island by means of orders and prohibitions, 10 to 11-year-olds mentioned collective needs and political or ganization without any prompting, and the 12 to 13-year-old group expressed the idea that it is the whole community that m...

Title: Managerial Thought Patterns and Performance: A Study of Perceptual Patterns of Performance Hindrances for Higher and Lower Performing Managers
Author-Name: Charles C. Manz

Author-Name: Margie Mathison-Hance
Abstract: Results of a nationwide study of managerialperceptions ofperformance hindrances in a Fortune 100 Corporation (Honeywell) is reported. This paper relies on skill relapse-prevention theories and self-regulation theories to interpret the perceptual responses of 3,580 managers concerning relevant performance hindrances. The managers were divided into "higher" and "lower" performance groups, and perceptual response patterns regarding performance obstacles were contrasted between the two groups. In general, it was found that, while no apparent difference occurred between the number of hindrances perceived, higher performing managers more often focused on external performance hindrances, e.g., lack of promotion opportunities and non-performance-related appraisal systems. etc., while lower performers focused more on personal skill deficiencies, e.g., lack of people-managing and communication skills, and lack of technical skills, etc.

Title: Determinants of Organizational Commitment
Author-Name: Clifford J. Mottaz
Abstract: Using an exchange perspective based on work rewards and work values, this study is concerned with assessing the relative importance of various influences on organizational commitment. Data from 1385 workers representing a variety of occupations suggests that the model employed explains a large proportion of the variations in this work attribute. Moreover, it appears that work rewards have a strong positive effect on commitment while work values have a weaker negative effect. The results further indicate that intrinsic rewards are significantly more powerful determinants of commitment than extrinsic rewards. Additionally, the study examines the role of demographic variables. Generally, the data suggests that the effect of demographic factors on commitment is indirect through work rewards and values. The implications of these findings are discussed.

Title: Breadwinner vs. Non-Breadwinner Differences in Married Women's Job Satisfaction and Perceptions of Organizational Climate
Author-Name: L. Alan Witt
Abstract: The present study investigated differences in job satisfaction, interpersonal values, and perceptions of organizational climate between "breadwinning" and non-breadwinning married working women in a private sector organization. The data suggested that the breadwinners were significantly more satisfied with their pay and their opportunities for promotion and that they perceived a more favorable reward system in the organization. The results suggest that the family status of employees may be a variable important in accounting for variance in organizational behavior and for identifying issues particularly salient to female employees.

Abstract: Uncovering themes of organizational basic assumptions can assist in interpreting strategic behavior. These themes are derived from the dynamics at individual, group, and organizational levels of analysis, which reflect views of self, world, and others. Several such themes are presented in this paper. Structural properties of basic assumptions are then explored to understand how they operate. Diagnostic and research methods are discussed.

Title: Relations among Lateness, Absence, and Turnover: Is There a Progression of Withdrawal?
Author-Name: Joseph G. Rosse
Abstract: The progression of withdrawal hypothesis predicts a hierarchy among withdrawal behaviors, with lateness being followed by absence, which in turn results in quitting. This paper presents longitudinal attendance data from a sample of 63 hospital employees. Analyses of conditional probabilities revealed progressions from lateness to absence, from multiple (but not single) absences to quitting, and tentative evidence of a lateness-quitting progression. Initial lateness was also found to result in increased subsequent lateness, and likewise for absence.

Title: Power-Balancing Styles of Indian Managers
Author-Name: G. S. Das
Author-Name: Chester C. Cotton
Abstract: Emerson's (1962, 1972ab) power-dependence model has had a profound impact on the manner in which power can be viewed in relationships. However, there has been little empirical work examining Emerson's approach, and even less focused at the individual level. The present study takes a psychological approach to Emerson's theory of power and dependency. The study has two objectives. First, it examines the existence and distribution of dominant power-balancing styles among Indian managers. Second, it begins to validate an approach to operationalizing Emerson's conceptualization ofpower and dependency at the individual level. The study is based on a managerial sample from a cross-section of Indian industries. Findings provide partial support for the predicted relationships among power-balancing styles and other psychological variables. It also provides some support for the construct validity of the instrument used to measure power-balancing style.

Abstract: This study investigated self and supervisory perceptions of female employees' communication proficiency, as predictors of organizational effectiveness and promotability. Both self and supervisory evaluations of 15 communication skills were utilized as predictors of female achievement levels in two stepwise multiple regression equations. Results indicated that supervisor evaluation of seven communication competencies accounted for 55% of the variance in promotions while self-evaluations of these competencies accounted for a nonsignificant 14% of the variance in promotions. The most powerful finding of this research is the importance of perceived communication competencies for organizational achievement.

Abstract: Research into career success has usually dealt with objective aspects of career paths such as income and job title. This paper suggests also using cognitive variables to assess career success and examines past career choices to show that postdecisional justification may be apparent. The data reveal that demographics and success criteria are the best predictor sets when trying to explain a person's objective career success, mobility, and career satisfaction. Implications for future research and management are discussed.

Title: Personality and Relationship Dispositions as Determinants of Subjective Well-Being

Abstract: Costa and McCrae have proposed that neuroticism and interpersonal warmth are major determinants of subjective well-being (SWB) while gregariousness is not. To test this formulation, a range of standard SWB and self-report personality measures was administererd by means of a structured interview to 144 subjects. Multiple regression analysis showed general emotional vulnerability followed by interpersonal warmth to be highly predictive of SWB. Gregariousness was not significantly predictive of SWB. The findings imply that the amount of social support available to an individual may be less important in contributing to well-being than is generally believed.

Title: Effect of Assimilation of Work Experience on Growth Satisfaction: Assessment of Selected Validity Threats
Author-Name: Preston C. Bottger
Author-Name: Philip W. Yetton
Author-Name: Irene K-H. Chew
Author-Name: Murray A. Woods
Abstract: Responding to the weak evidence for moderating effects of growth need strength on the growth satisfaction/job enrichment relationship, Bottger and Chew (1986) argue that capacity rather than need for growth should be studied. They show that "assimilation of work experience" (A WE), a measure of the individual's affective responses to work performance variations, does explain variance in growth satisfaction independent of job scope and context satisfactions. Here we investigate aspects of the internal and construct validities of this finding. We show that the A WE effect on growth satisfaction is independent of role ambiguity and leader behavior. Also, whereas A WE explains variance in growth satisfaction, it has a random effect on satisfaction with supervision. The sample is 487 sales representatives. Moderated regression analysis is the primary analytical method.

Title: Attachment and Emotional Health: A Life Span Approach
Author-Name: Tamara Kotler
Author-Name: Mary Omodei
Abstract: Recent research on the relation between quality of attachments and socio-emotional functioning in both childhood and marriage is briefly reviewed Attention is specifically drawn to processes linking quality of early attachment relationships to later marital quality, taking account of socio-emotional health, social support, and experienced stress. The empirical and theoretical literature is integrated into a comprehensive "continuity" model which is represented as a path diagram. Using data from a socio-economically diverse set of Australian couples, estimates were obtained for all paths specified in this predictive model. Examination of the model estimates revealed moderate support for the continuity model insofar as close social bonds were found to be formative for both men and women. Following initial similarities between partners in psychological status, the quality of the early marital relationship contributes to changes in the psychological health of both partners which, in turn, influences changes i...

Title: Consciousness Raising among Mentally Handicapped People: A Critique of the Implications of Normalization
Author-Name: Susan E. Szivos
Author-Name: Eileen Travers
Abstract: Consciousness raising involves not only making bearers of a stigmatized identity aware of the inequitable distribution of social rewards, but also an exploration of the meaning of that identity on a personal level. Current theory and practice, however, assumes the advisability of "passing" and not exploring the nature of handicap. We present reasons why consciousness raising is of benefit to handicapped clients. These reasons cluster around five theoretical positions: (1) self-acceptance and self-esteem, (2) cognitive dissonance, (3) realistic attributions and goal-setting, (4) coming through the "loss spiral," and (5) social identity theory and intergroup comparisons. We also discuss possible drawbacks to consciousness raising. Implications for professional practice include whether to and how to "tell" and talk about handicap with clients.

Abstract: Although prior studies have explored the association between time spent communicating and various antecedents and outcomes, differentiating among multiple levels of analysis in these investigations has been largely ignored. In this study, the relationships among time spent communicating and effort, satisfaction with work, and autonomy from a superior were assessed with an explicit consideration of multiple levels of analysisindividuals, work groups, and collectivities. Results from within and between analysis (WABA) procedures suggest that some effects were cross-level, aggregating to higher levels of analysis and varying across job-based collectivities and work groups. Other effects were level-specific, varying across work groups, but not aggregating to a higher level.

Title: Separating Leadership from Leaders: An Assessment of the Effect of Leader and Follower Roles in Organizations
Author-Name: Virginia J. Vanderslice
Abstract: Findings reported in the research literature concerned with labeling, status and communication in groups, power, expertise, responsibility, and resistance support the position that leader-follower distinctions in organizations are likely to undermine the very goals they are established to achieve. Rather than being inspired by leaders to do their best, it is likely that followers will either limit themselves to status-appropriate behaviors or resist their low power roles. A case study is presented describing one organization's comprehensive set of internal structures that allows them to successfully fulfill leadership functions without creating leader roles. By drawing comparisons between this organization and another enterprise that has a flat structure, some preliminary suggestions regarding necessary conditions for the success of leaderless organizational structures are made. The implications for behavioral scientists are discussed.

Abstract: This study examines the impact of workgroup membership on individuals' perceptions of equity and choice of referent. Subjects indicated who they compared themselves to on four job facets (compensation, job complexity, supervisory behavior, and security) and whether or not they felt equitably treated relative to their referent. For security comparisons, results show that workgroup membership is related to perceptions of equity and referent choice. For compensation comparisons, workgroup membership is related to referent choice. Workgroup membership does not influence either equity evaluations or referent choice for job complexity or supervisory behavior. Implications of these results for future research on comparative referents are discussed.

Title: Extending the Metaphor "System"
Author-Name: C. J. Atkinson
Author-Name: P. B. Checkland
Abstract: Virtually all systems-based work is dominated by the notion of "system" as a concept of an adaptive whole which may survive in a changing environment. Such unexamined givens should be challenged; it might be fruitful in practical interventions in real-world problems to widen the concept "system." The nature of the concept of the adaptive whole is examined, both in general and more specifically in "soft systems methodology" (SSM), the systemsbased approach to tackling ill-structured problems which has been developed in the 1970's and 1980's. A method for developing alternatives to the core systems metaphor is presented, and its practical use in real-world problem solving is illustrated. This is a promising enrichment of SSM.

Abstract: We sought an integrative perspective on relations among work and nonwork stress and satisfaction in terms of their similarity in life domain (work vs. non-work) and psychological outcome (satisfaction vs. stress) facets. In a sample of American "insulated sojourners," we hypothesized stronger relations among outcomes (and their putative determinants) which shared either the life domain or psychological outcome facet, than among outcomes which shared neither facet in common. Results were generally supportive, indicating that psychological outcomes in at least two life spheres are distinguishable and may relate to one another in predictable ways.

A number of implications of this analysis are presented and discussed for both theory and practice in organizational decision making.

Abstract: Few studies have examined beliefs and attitudes about injustice and discrimination within minority communities. Most research has emphasized the institutional consequences of discrimination, or the racial beliefs of the majority groups. In this study we examine attitudes about injustice and reactions to discriminatory acts within a Black community in the U.S. South. Beliefs and attitudes were found to cluster in three dimensions, including responses to personal discrimination, perceptions of political structures, and perceptions of major social institutions. Economic, social, and psychological variables accounted for 10-30% of the variance in these dimensions in regression analyses. Implications of these results for theory and policy are discussed.

Title: Effects of Devil's Advocacy on Escalating Commitment
Author-Name: Charles R. Schwenk
Abstract: Devil's advocacy is designed to assist decision makers in questioning assumptions. Escalating commitment in organizations occurs in decisions involving ambiguous information which requires decision makers to make assumptions. In such decisions, experts often provide analysis and recommendations for action which may increase the tendency toward escalating commitment if decision makers uncritically accept the assumptions underlying the experts' recommendations. Devil's advocacy may be effective in this process. In this paper, Staw's (1976) escalating commitment task is used to examine the effects of an expert report and a devil's advocate treatment on the tendency to escalate commitment. Results show that an expert report increases dollar allocations to a failing project and subjects' estimates of the project's probability of success. A devil's advocate critique appeared to reduce the effects of the expert report though the results were only marginally significant. The results also suggest that, in their as...

Title: Patterns of Life Structure and Variability in Self
Author-Name: Laura M. Crary

Author-Name: Donald M. Wolfe
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between patterns of life structure and variability in self. It presents new methods for assessing two kinds of variability in self and four dimensions of life structure (complexity, conflict, flexibility, and compartmentation). Data for these measures were gathered through the design of a research program in which subjects were invited into the data-gathering process as co-inquirers. Empirical data reveal a congruence between variability of self and the nature of a person's environment as it is reflected in dimensions of life structure. Variability of self is linked with the occupation of complex, flexible, compartmented, and highly conflictful life structures. Theoretical implications point toward the need to consider patterns of life structure and variability of self as dimensions of individual differences.

Abstract: In this article, the potential impact ofparental divorce on the lives of young adult offspring is discussed. Parental divorce may upset both social and psychological aspects of the transition to adulthood process. The family roles young adults are expected to assume could be altered by the break-up, as could opportunities for particularyoung adult pursuits, such as advanced education. Heightened adjustment problems also are likely to result, as divorce produces additional life changes during the highly transitional period of early adulthood. Qualitative data from an exploratory study of 39 college students, ages 18-23, illustrate many of the relevant issues. Suggestions for future research are provided.

Title: Competition and Cooperation: Effects of Value Dissensus and Predisposition to Help
Author-Name: Richard A. Cosier
Author-Name: Dan R. Dalton
Abstract: Two studies were conducted in order to investigate the effects of cooperation and competition on performance and satisfaction. In Study One, it was hypothesized that the effects of cooperation vs. competition may be exacerbated by perceptions of value differences. Value dissensus did interact with the cooperation-competition variable for the satisfaction measure, but not for the performance measure. A main effect for performance was found, however, due to subjects in the cooperative condition performing significantly better than subjects in the competitive condition. In Study Two, an attempt was made to discover when cooperation may have advantages over competition. It was hypothesized that people who highly valued employee citizenship behavior would work better in a cooperative environment. An interaction was found suggesting individuals who highly value the helping dimension of citizenship behavior perform better under cooperative incentives than similar individuals under competitive conditions.

Title: Analyzing Organizational Conflicts Using a Model Based On Structural Role Theory
Author-Name: Boris Kabanoff
Abstract: A qualitative case approach is used to examine the capacity of the potential influence incongruence model of interpersonal conflict to analyze the latent sources of conflict and the resultant conflict processes in three cases of interpersonal conflict in organizations. A discussion of the case study approach and its role in theory construction and confirmation is provided. The three cases analyzed are those described by Walton (1969) in his seminal study of third-party conflict interventions. It is demonstrated that the model provides plausible, theoretically-integrated explanations of the sources of conflict in these three cases and aids understanding of the attitudes and behavior of the parties involved. A feature of the analysis is its integration of psychological and sociological concepts including bases of interpersonal power, the role concept and the process of role definition, and influence of role specialization and differentiation, symbolic aspects of interpersonal conflict, personality factors s...

Abstract: This paper builds on previous behavioral science research and theorizing as well as on classicalphilosophical examinations of entitlement andjustice, andproposes a newframeworkfor understanding these issues in the context of work organizations. This paperfocuses on how individuals in organizations develop perceptions of what they are entitled to receive in exchange for their membership and contributions. It proposes that there are two fundamental conditions that must be simultaneously satisfied for an individual to perceive his or her overall relationship to an organization as just: (1) that the individualperceive that he or she is being treated equally vis-a-vis others in the group category (e.g., seniorfaculty, juniorfaculty, student, or clerical) to which the individual belongs in the organization (referent similar) and (2) that the person perceive that he or she is being treated in accordance with legitimate criteria (such as seniority, education, and performance record) vis-a-vis those in groups to w...

Abstract: Strategic contingencies theory suggests that uncertainty coping, nonsubstitutability, and centrality predict intra-organizational group power. This theory was tested in 20 ambulatory care clinic settings. Physician, nurse, and administrator power and roles were examined. Theoretical support was greatest among nurses, but less conclusive for physicians and administrative personnel, whose roles in the clinics were more clearly prescribed and determined, and influenced to a lesser degree by power-enhancing dynamics. Implications are discussed of the relevance and usefulness of strategic contingencies theory and other theories of organization in health services organizations.

Apparently, even 8 years after graduation from dental school, dentists maintain their basic attitudes regarding traits important to the performance of the "competent" professional. In spite of the decrease in concensus among the group members, the basic rating of traits keeps the original sequence of importance set during the dental school period: peopleoriented traits ranked the highest, science-oriented traits ranked in the middle, and status-oriented traits ranked the lowest. This fact suggests that even though changes occur in the respondents' lives (from students to professionals), their basic norms and attitudes remain unchanged. When their professional self-image is concerned, the dentists display quite a uniform view, which attests to a relatively high...

Title: Barriers to Mentoring: The Female Manager's Dilemma
Author-Name: Belle Rose Ragins
Abstract: Mentoring relationships may be critical for women seeking advancement in organizations. The infrequency of mentoring relationships for females suggests special concerns and considerations. This literature review draws upon current research to examine the interpersonal and organizational barriers female managers face in developing and maintaining effective mentoring relationships in organizations. An analysis is made of gender differences in the function, nature, and effectiveness of mentoring relationships. Recommendations and guidelines for future research and theory development are proposed. The groundwork for a longitudinal theory of mentoring and career development for women in organizations is presented. Implications for organizations are also discussed.

Title: The Effect of Extent of Use of Information Technology and Job of the User upon Task Characteristics
Author-Name: John W. Medcof
Abstract: The relationships between extent of use of information technology (IT) and task characteristics were examined in two jobs using the Job Diagnostic Survey. Consistent with past studies, it was found that, among clerks, extent of use is positively correlated with skill variety, feedback from agents, and dealing with others, and that there is no correlation between extent of use and task identity, task signifcance, andfeedbackfrom the job. Also consistent with past studies was the finding that the nature of the IT user's job moderates the relationship between use extent and task characteristics. In the non-clerical job in this study, use extent was negatively correlated with skill variety, feedback from agents, and dealing with others. A model proposed to explain these results suggests that the relationship between use extent and task characteristics depends upon the task characteristics of the IT-using and non-IT-using components of the job. Practical applications of this model were suggested.

Title: The Network Structures of Organizations: Effects of Task Contingencies and Distributional Form
Author-Name: Charles B. Shrader
Author-Name: James R. Lincoln
Author-Name: Alan N. Hoffman
Abstract: The broad concern in this paper is a long-standing one in organizational sociology, the determinants of organizational structures. However, it is argued that internal structures are better conceived and operationalized in network terms than in the "distributional" terms of past organizational research. From a survey of 36 agencies, network data were obtained on the communication and client referral ties among practitioner staff. From these data, the following structural measures were computed for each organization, density, connectivity (cohesion), symmetry (hierarchy), and clustering. From such theories of organization as Burns and Stalker's distinction between mechanistic and organic forms, hypotheses were derived relating these network structural properties to the distributional properties of differentiation, formalization, and centralization, as well as the task contingency variables of size, age, technology, and professionalization. The regression analysis provides support for the general argument th...

Title: A Reconciliation of Market Competition, Decentralization, Size, and Financial Performance Results: An Extension Testing Moderating Effects
Author-Name: Ken Moores
Author-Name: Keith Duncan
Abstract: The paper reports a study conducted in New Zealand that further examines contingency propositions that have been the subject of study in India, Mexico, and Wales and for which the results remain equivocal. Specifically, the relationship between structural dimensions and financial performance are examined while acknowledging the moderating effects of market competition and firm size. Responses from senior executives of New Zealand public-listed companies along with published financial performance results indicate that under high market competition conditions a decentralized authority structure is positively related to financial performance. Under low market competition centralized authority structure and financial performance are positively related. Implications of these findings for control strategy are tendered.

Title: The Effect of Similarity on Performance Ratings and Interrater Agreement
Author-Name: Mary D Zalesny
Author-Name: Michael P. Kirsch
Abstract: Although training and use of multiple raters have been suggested to minimize demographic and individual biases on performance evaluations (Latham & Wexley, 1981), use of multiple raters often results in low interrater reliability which compounds the difficulty of establishing performance rating validity. The present study investigated the performance ratings made by the peers and supervisors of correction's officers, i.e., prison guards. Attention wasfocused on two issues: (1) the effects of rater and ratee personal, attitudinal, and relationship variables on performance ratings, and (2) examining performance "perspective differences" as an explanation of rating agreement. Results indicated that supervisor-subordinate educational similarity was significantly related to subordinate's performance rating. Supervisor-subordinate agreement on job dimension importance and subordinate age similarity with peer raters were also marginally related to performance ratings. The findings are discussed from the perspect...

Title: Understanding the Dynamics of Self-Concept of Members in Dual-Career Families
Author-Name: Uma Sekaran
Abstract: This study examined the gender differences in how self-esteem and sense of competence moderate the relationships between four specific work variables and job satisfaction among members of dual-career families. Based on the gender differences found among a sample of 85 couples in dual-career families, it is conjectured that women with high self-esteem and sense of competence might be experiencing tensions because of an excessive role overload and hence experience lower levels of job satisfaction. Suggestions are made for organizations and family members to enhance the quality of life of both working partners.

Title: Case Studies as Natural Experiments
Author-Name: Allen S. Lee
Abstract: The paper poses organizational case studies as a provocative way of addressing a long-standing controversy within the social sciences between the subjectivist and objectivist schools of thought. Whereas organizational case studies are customarily conducted as a form of subjectivist research, they may, in addition, be conducted so as to fit the conceptions of objectivist research as well. The paper explains how to achieve this result by conducting case studies as a form of natural experiment. The paper uses organizational case studies in this way to reveal the intersection which exists between the subjectivist and objectivist schools of thought. Organizational case studies which fall in the intersection constitute, in themselves, refutations to the alleged incompatibility between the two schools of thought, and exemplify how a rapprochement can be forged between them. The paper uses an actual organizational case study, Kanter's Men and Women of the Corporation, to illustrate these points.

Title: Office Design and the Behavior of Senior Managers

Author-Name: Umar Nimran
Abstract: In this study of office design it was predicted that the presence or absence of office co-workers would influence the behavior of senior managers, over and above the effects of their occupation of open or closed offices. This proposition was supported by a path analysis which was used to derive a descriptive model of the task performance and friendliness of a sample of senior managers. In particular, it was also found that the visibility and audibility of a manager's superior and the presence of other office occupants have both direct and indirect effects on managerial behavior.

Title: Strategic Human Resource Management and Industrial Relations
Author-Name: Randall S. Schuler
Abstract: It has recently been suggested that the potentially dynamic and proactive role of employers in industrial relations be recognized (Kochan, McKersie, & Cappelli, 1984). Because incorporating the notion of strategic human resource management appears consistent with that suggestion, it is done here integrating frameworks of competitive strategy and human resource management practices using the rationale of needed employee role behaviors and cost and market conditions. This is then merged with business life-cycles stages creating a contingency framework for understanding the impact of strategic human resource management on industrial relations. This is done also using the rationale of cost and market conditions and needed employee role behaviors. The integrated competitive strategy-human resource management model is extended by inclusion of strategic targets and industry chain. The implications for industrial relations are laced throughout the discussion along with three sets of propositions. Implications for...

Title: Occupational Stressors, Individual Strains, and Social Supports among Police Officers
Author-Name: Gary M. Kaufmann
Author-Name: Terry A. Beehr
Abstract: In a survey of 121 police officers of a Midwestern state, it was found that occupational stressors (under-utilization of skills, quantitative workload, and job future ambiguity) and several types of social support are related to individual psychological strain. An interaction between occupational stressors and instrumental social support was opposite from the predictions of the buffering hypothesis, and explanations are offered for this "reverse buffering" result. Additionally, police in supervisory positions experience less stress and more social support than do nonsupervisory police officers.

Abstract: This study examined the relevance of task complexity as a moderator of the stress and coping process for a sample of 173 museum store managers. Four categories of coping responses were developed: active cognitive, active behavioral, cognitive avoidant, and behavioral avoidant. Results showed that task complexity moderated the relationship that coping had with some individual and environmental antecedents as well as work outcomes. Relationships were generally stronger for simple than complex tasks.

Title: Change of Values during Socialization for a Profession: An Application of the                 Marginal Man Theory
Author-Name: Yael Enoch
Abstract: Social work is a marginal profession, ranking between a white-collar occupation and a fullfledged profession. When the training school toward such a profession is part of a well-established academic organization and students at the school come from a lower socio-economic background than those who choose other academic fields, the marginality is accentuated. The marginal-man theory may therefore offer an explanation of the attitude changes undergone by social work students during socializing at a university-based professional school. It was found that in each stage of their professional socialization, the (marginal) socializees adopted the values of the dominant group. Thus, while at the university, the social work students adopted the attitudes prevalent in the academic subculture (represented by social science students). Upon graduation, the young social workers changed their attitudes and adopted attitudes similar to those held by other members of their professional subculture, i.e., veteran social work...

Abstract: The relationships between Porter's (1980) business strategies and the process of strategy making are investigated. The complexity of a strategy is shown to be associated with the intensity of information processing and managerial interaction used in its development and implementation. Porter's strategy of innovative differentiation related significantly to information processing, interaction, and assertiveness in strategy making, especially among the most profitable firms, cost leadership had very few notable associations with decision making, and focus strategies related inversely to information processing.

Abstract: This investigation examined psychological burnout among 833 men and women in teaching using a framework developed by Cherniss (1980). Work setting characteristics in concert with person variables (both individual differences and extra-work factors) were hypothesized to result in experienced stress. Some individuals cope with these sources of stress by developing the negative attitude change termed psychological burnout. Respondents provided data by completing questionnaires anonymously. The data provide strong preliminary support for the model and produced findings consistent with previous research. Suggestions for organizational intervention are offered.

Abstract: This paper seeks to investigate the association between work values and organizational commitment in the Asian context. Two major dimensions of work values, that is, intrinsic and extrinsic, were derived from a factor analysis of Wollack et al.'s scale. Organizational commitment was defined in terms of an individual's degree of identification and involvement in the work organization. This variable was measured using Porter et al.'s scale. The analysis suggested that intrinsic work values relate more closely to organizational commitment than either the global measure of work values or extrinsic work values.

Title: Social Darwinism: A Determinant of Nuclear Arms Policy and Action
Author-Name: Alfred W. Clark
Author-Name: Richard C. S. Trahair
Author-Name: Brian R. Graetz
Abstract: A quota sample of 679 people completed a questionnaire about their view of the world, their preferred nuclear defense policy, and their political activity. Results showed that people with a low adherence to a social Darwinist world view favored nuclear disarmament and a nonbelligerent defense policy, whereas people with a high adherence favored nuclear arms and a belligerent defense policy. The results also showed that, irrespective of a benign or hostile world view, people's feelings of learned helplessness erected a barrier to political action. But, people lower on social Darwinism overcame the barrier and engaged in more political action than people higher on social Darwinism; and these people were more inclined to vote for, or change their political allegiance to vote for a party that favored nuclear disarmament. The findings demonstrate the importance of social Darwinism as an ideology determining preferred nuclear arms policy and political action and commitment. Also, the findings provide some suppo...

Abstract: The study examines the relationship between political behaviors, e.g., ingratiation, structure change, cooptation, and threat, and their outcomes such as interpersonal trust, alienation, and feeling about job performance. A negative relationship between political behaviors and interpersonal trust andfeelings about performance, and a positive relationship between political behaviors and alienation is hypothesized. Results largely support the hypotheses. However, a relationship between political behaviors and feelings about job performance is marginal. Findings are discussed in the light of available research.

Title: A Study of Bion's Basic Assumption Groups
Author-Name: Sigmund Karterud
Abstract: Bion's group dynamic theory can be divided into a general group dynamic part, a description of the basic assumptions fight/flight, dependency and pairing, and a metapsychological explanation of the basic assumption phenomena. Previous studies with somewhat questionable methodology have found that the basic assumption pairing seems more closely associated with fight/flight than dependency. This study replicates these findings. Seventyfive inpatient group therapy sessions were studied in detail by Group Emotionality Rating System and Group Focal Conflict Analysis. The phenomenological part of the study suggests quantitative levels when scattered emotional statements turn into manifest basic assumption. The groups demonstrating the association between pairing andfight/flight contained emotionality beyond these levels, thus indicating that they represented "true" basic assumption groups. Several observations suggest that the capacity for pairing is vitalfor the survival of fight/flight groups which otherwise ...

Title: The Career of the Military Wife
Author-Name: N. A. Jans
Abstract: The aim of this study is to investigate the phenomenon of a wife's psychological identification with her husband's career: her identification with the social role of "wife of' a member of a particular occupational group. The particular occupational group studied was the Australian military. The study isolated the wife's identification with the husband's career (WI) as a variable, and then developed and tested a model of the determination of a wife's identification. The concept of WI was derivedfrom Finch's (1983) research on the wives of British middle class professionals, and provides an empirical test of some of Finch's propositions about the determination of WI. A model of WI was developed by analogy to studies of the determination of psychological identification with an occupational career. Data were derived from responses to a questionnaire survey of male officers and wives/partners of the Australian Navy, Army, and Air Force, in the rank range lieutenant to colonel, or equivalents. WI and most other...

Title: Environmental Determinants of Generic Competitive Strategies: Preliminary Evidence from Structured Content Analysis of Fortune and Business Week Articles (1983-1984)1
Author-Name: Luis Ma. R. Calingo
Abstract: This paper seeks to determine whether the implementation of a generic competitive strategy (Porter, 1980) reflects variations in the competitive variables of customer price sensitivity and product differentiability, and whether tailor-fitting business strategy to the competitive environment is associated with a higher level of financial performance. Data on 59 companies cross-listed in the Compustat financial data base were obtained from a content analysis of Fortune and Business Week articles during the period 1983-1984. The data partially support the expectations from the Strategic Planning Associates (SPA) matrix, particularly those defining the determinants of differentiation and cost leadership. The findings further suggest the value of an environment/strategy fit to improving the firm's financial performance, particularly its long-term earnings growth.

Abstract: In response to the recommendation that researchers examine the consequences of turnover instead of merely its determinants, we test nine hypotheses about how the turnover rate in organization work units influences integration, centralization, promotional opportunities, instrumental communication, job satisfaction, and behavioral commitment. Data from 115 work units in five organizations are studied using a longitudinal design which measures the impact of the work unit turnover rate for 8 months on the changes in the six variables over the 8-month period. After introducing numerous controls, turnover is found to have a net negative effect on instrumental communication and behavioral commitment. Implications for future research are discussed.

Author-Name: Yehouda A. Shenhav

Author-Name: Albert I. Goldberg
Abstract: A resource dependence perspective is used to conceptualize and to investigate the consequences of externalfunding on scientific enterprise. We argue that the participation of scientists in collegial activities is constrained by resource relations and the resulting dependence of scientists on nonscientists. Constraining factors include secrecy regulations, nonscientists' lack of concern for scientific standards, and the diminished research time available to scientists. Researchers endeavor to protect their autonomy and reduce the dependence by establishing alternative sources offunds. The empirical analysis of the theory is based on a study conducted in Israel. Our theoretical expectations are confirmed for researchers operating in academic settings. They are not fully supported for non-academic research settings. The significance and theoretical implications of the results are discussed.

Title: Reactions of Nonparticipants as Additional Rather than Missing Data: Opportunities for Organizational Research
Author-Name: Robert I. Sutton
Abstract: Organizational research entails encounters with two groups of people who are usually labeled "nonparticipants": (1) those who are never asked to participate, but whom the investigator encounters during the data gathering, and (2) those selected to participate, but who cannot or will not do so. This paper demonstrates the value of these data for field research, particularly for studies that rely on questionnaires, interviews, and structured observations. The sequence of events typically associated with recruiting respondents and informants is proposed to create five key junctures at which research can be designed to gather such data. Ethical issues are raised concerning the use of information from nonparticipants.

Abstract: This paper considers problems in the conceptualization and operationalization of four concepts in occupational stress research: stress, strain, coping behavior, and coping style. The paper argues that a lack of conceptual and operational clarity in each of these areas has led to confusion in both the conduct and the interpretation of occupational stress and coping research, citing examples from the literature to support and illustrate this argument, as well as re-analyzing previous research. Recommendations are made for future research methodology which may overcome or limit some of the conceptual and operational problems examined.

Abstract: Transformation is inevitable for the survival of some organizations. It is argued that metaphors may be a helpful tool for a successful transformation if carefully chosen. Two kinds of methaphors are discussed which describe different transformation processes and outcomes. Illustrations are given for both kinds of metaphors, and the argument is substantiated with examples from a case study about an organization transformation. The use of multiple and adaptive metaphors allowed a wide range for action in that particular case.

Title: The Effect of Objective Social Stress Factors on Subjective Perception of                 Well-Being and Social Solidarity: The Israeli Case
Author-Name: Simha F. Landau
Abstract: The Israeli setting, with its unique combination of social stress factors was chosen to study (on the aggregate level) the effect of economic and security-related stressors on subjective perception of well-being and social solidarity. The objective security-related stressors considered are inflation and unemployment, and the objective security-related stressors are security-related casualties and incidents. Population size was included as a control variable. The two subjective perceptions of well-being are mood and coping. The four subjective indicators of social solidarity include solidarity between ethnic groups and between religious and secular groups, desire to remain in the country, and readiness for economic sacrifices. The data on the subjective indicators were derived from continuing surveys of representative samples of the urban Israeli Jewish population during the years 1967-1979. The periods covered range from 5-12 years. A multiple regression analysis was applied to the data. The main findings...

Abstract: Because feedback information from students has been found to improve teachers' classroom performance, factor analysis was used to report students' perceptions in a concise, meaningful manner to instructors. The emerging four factor structure over 2 years of data from 2084 students was found to be very stable, and relatively uninfluenced by class size or course level. The first two factors appeared similar to the two traditional dimensions of leader behavior, initiating structure and consideration, and it is conjectured that existing leadership theory might be applicable in the university classroom to enhance teaching effectiveness.

Title: Winning and Losing: Understanding Managers' Reactions to Strategic Change
Author-Name: Karen N. Gaertner
Abstract: Managers' interpretation of and reactions to large-scale organizational change that resulted in a new business unit strategy are examined in one firm. We find differences in the configuration of attitudes that predict support for the strategy, depending upon whether the employees gained or lost power and opportunity as a result of the change. Among “winners,” the strongest predictor of support for the new strategy was positive career expectations and current career satisfaction. Among “losers,” the strongest predictor was belief that people had been treated fairly during the change process.

Abstract: This paper reviews three cases illustrating how police roles are shaped by the interactions of variably powerful actors in ramified local networks. It focuses attention on the influence of the rank-and-file and police unions on the outcomes of these interactions, and on related tendencies to professionalize and bureaucratize the police; and it posits as a result of these interactions both a normative emphasis in police circles on law enforcement components of the police role and the preservation of police officer discretion in its performance.

Title: Contact and Prejudice Between Germans and Turks: A Correlational Study
Author-Name: Ulrich Wagner
Author-Name: Miles Hewstone
Author-Name: Uwe Machleit
Abstract: The reported study investigated the relationship between prejudice and intergroup contact for German and Turkish pupils (age 15 years) in the Federal Republic of Germany. A distinction was drawn between “opportunities for” and “real uses of” contact, operationalized using path analysis, and hypotheses were tested concerning the way contact in the neighborhood, at school, and in leisure time is related to prejudice. As predicted, leisure time contact was significantly correlated with reduced prejudice, but only for the German sample (N = 60); for the Turkish sample (N = 50), prejudice was unrelated to any of the measures of contact. The results are discussed in terms of the wider social background to contact between national and migrant labor populations in Western Europe.

Title: The Idealization of Technology: Power Relations in an Engineering Department
Author-Name: Steven P. Feldman
Abstract: The management of technological development involves a dilemma; the manager must strive to understand the diverse specializations required to develop new technology, but he must focus on integrating these specializations. The former requires knowledge, the latter power. It is my contention, however, that in technologically-oriented work groups, there is a tendency for the importance of technology to be exaggerated while power issues are ignored. This process is referred to as the idealization of technology. The result is an inattention to organizational goals and cooperative processes. In this essay, the interpretive concept of culture and the psychoanalytic theory of idealization is used to investigate this problem. The framework is applied to an engineering department whose primary work is the development of advanced technological products. The process of idealization distorts organizational reality in such a way that continual distortions are needed, is a cultural mechanism that is used to mediate the ...

Title: The Functions of Empathy (Decentering) in Human Relations
Author-Name: Mark V. Redmond
Abstract: Empathy, in its broadest usage, is considered a fundamental dimension of interpersonal and communication competence. Empathy enhances a person's understanding of others, and the ability to make predictions about others. Understanding and prediction make empathy a possible tool for persuasion, compliance gaining, relational development, and counseling. Empathy affects decision making about others and attribution. Empathy acts to reflect what has been perceived and creates a supportive/confirming atmosphere. Each function of empathy generally reflects a different conceptualization of empathy. The term “decentering” is offered as the more appropriate alternative term to represent the overall phenomenon with empathy as a subconstruct.

Title: The Leader as Mirror: Clinical Reflections
Author-Name: Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries
Abstract: Starting with a literary example, the nature of “mirroring” is reviewed in the context of human development and linked to leader-follower interaction patterns. It is argued that mirroring is needed for establishing and maintaining the boundaries of the self. Depending on the nature and quality of the developmental interface distortive mirroring patterns may come to the fore. Using a case example, it will be demonstrated how, particularly in situations of crisis, leaders can easily turn into mirrors reflecting what we wish to see. This can create an illusory form of reality and in the process endangers the organization.

Title: Job Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment in Relation to Work                 Performance and Turnover Intentions
Author-Name: Lynn McFarlane Shore
Author-Name: Harry J. Martin
Abstract: The differential associations that job satisfaction and organizational commitment have with job performance and turnover intentions were studied in a sample of bank tellers and hospital professionals. Results showed that organizational commitment was more strongly related than job satisfaction with turnover intentions for the tellers, but not for the professionals. Job satisfaction was related more strongly than organizational commitment with supervisory ratings of performance for both samples. The findings suggest that specific job attitudes are more closely associated with task-related out-comes such as performance ratings, whereas global organizational attitudes are more closely associated with organization-related outcomes like turnover intentions.

Title: Adaptors and Innovators in Organizations: A Cross-Cultural Study of the                 Cognitive Styles of Managerial Functions and Subfunctions
Author-Name: Gordon R. Foxall
Author-Name: Adrian F. Payne
Abstract: The hypothesis was tested that broadly-defined managerial functions can be sub-divided on the basis of their members' internal and external task orientations, and that the resulting subfunctions are, respectively, predominantly “adaptive” or “innovative” in terms derived from Kirton's adaption-innovation theory. Data from samples of British (N = 115) and Australian (N = 123) mid-career managers undertaking MBA programs who completed the Kirton Adaption-Innovation Inventory (KAI) and provided employment histories displayed the expected patterns of task orientation and cognitive style. Implications for adaption-innovation theory and the management of organizational change are briefly discussed.

Title: Toward a Theory of Change Role Efficacy
Author-Name: Kevin C. Wooten
Author-Name: Louis P. White
Abstract: Due to a lack of research and integration of OD theory, a theoretical model of change role efficacy for organizational development is presented. As an extension of a previously developed model (White & Wooten, 1986) of change agent, client system, and mutual roles, and an integrated model of change (White & Wooten, 1985), situational change roles are illustrated as contingent upon the stage of change which is sensitive to the change agent-client system relationship. Various forms of role conflict and ambiguity are discussed in relation to their impact upon various change roles to be assumed at each stage of change. It is concluded that highly integrative and contingency-based models are neededfor the theoretical development of OD as a science, and for practical guidance of change parties.

Title: Cutbacks, Management, and Human Relations: Meanings for Organizational Theory and Research
Author-Name: Russell L. Curtis, Jr.
Abstract: Retrenchments are a common occurrence in business, educaitonal, social service, and civic and public organizations in the United States. Administrative responses to the events leading to reductions have been reactive and last-resort activities typically leading to centralizations, formalization, and increased downward initiatives of communications and directives. In turn, these have tended to exacerbate the existing problems, especially those of employee morale, trust, depression, and productivity. Variations by types of organizations are presented and implications are drawn for practical consequences and solutions and for analytical contributions to organizational theory.

Title: A Coding Method for the Analysis of Moral Discourse
Author-Name: John Alan Lee
Author-Name: Sheldon Ungar
Abstract: Development of a social scientific study of morality, cutting across various disciplines and methodological approaches, is proposed. Drawing on both quantitative methods associated with content analysis, and the more naturalistic methods of discourse analysis, the authors outline a new methodfor the coding of moral discourse at three levels of analysis: (1) by the sides taken in the dispute, topics introduced, the "voice" of the moralizer, and key words used, (2) by the "stances" moral claims-makers take, which are conceptualized from a dramaturgical perspective, and (3) by the claims-making "appeal" made by moral rhetoric, whether to logic, feeling rules, or other claims. The first level of analysis, now well established, is illustrated by detailed examples from empirical data published elsewhere. The second level of analysis, well advanced in application, is illustrated by briefer selections. The third level of analysis is still in development. Its explanation here is useful because this journal reaches...

Title: The Panopticon: From Bentham's Obsession to the Revolution in Management Learning
Author-Name: Stephen Fox
Abstract: Foucault has shown us how Bentham's ideal design for a prison, the panopticon, stands as an archetype of disciplinary organization, that is, organization assured by the mutual reinforcement of power and knowledge. In this paper, we shall examine management eductaion from Foucault's perspective, tracing its growth from the 1960's to the present, to consider its significance for the modern organization conceived as a disciplinary apparatus. In this view, management education, personnel, and human resource management (HRM) represents some of the latest stages in the "formalization" of the individual within power relations, which began at the end of the eighteenth century with the emergence of the "clinical" human sciences. Finally, it is suggested that research concerning the documentary methods accompanying such "formalization," via the machinery M.E.D. and H.R.M., would benefit from ethnomethodological analyses of the type originated by Garfinkel.

Title: The Structure of Conflict Behavior of Managers Assessed with Self-and Subordinate Ratings
Author-Name: Walter F. Daves
Author-Name: C. L. Holland
Abstract: Most previous treatments of conflict style have focused upon five strategies: avoiding (withdrawing), forcing (competing), smoothing (accommodating), compromising, and confronting (collaborating), purported to lie in a two-dimensional (assertion and cooperation) space. The factor structure of conflict style in self-reports by 158 public-and private-sector managers and in reports by their subordinates (total N = 927) on Howat and London's (1980) 25 behavioral statements was determined. These data indicate a three-dimensional structure which was essentially the same for self-and subordinate reports, i.e., openness, distribution, and control, although self-and subor-dinate reports were correlated at only a very low level. Concern for the interest of both parties was a component of both openness and distribution. The implications for conflict management were discussed.

Title: Interpersonal Conflict at Work: An Analysis of Behavioral Responses
Author-Name: Roger J. Volkema
Author-Name: Thomas J. Bergmann
Abstract: Interest and research in interpersonal conflict has led to the development of a number of instruments for measuring conflict style. These instruments lack the more demonstrative responses that sometimes occur during interpersonal conflict, and each determines conflict style through abstract measures. Two hundred and sixty-three participants were asked to describe one conflict that they were involved in at work. Given a list of 21 conflict responses, participants were asked to (1) rank-order the responses in the order in which they actually responded to the conflict, (2) identify the responses they were currently using, (3) identify those responses they had not used but might, and (4) identify those responses they would never use. The results indicate some well-defined clusters of responses, including an emotive category.

Title: Group Cohesiveness and Productivity: A Closer Look
Author-Name: Peter E. Mudrack
Abstract: Although many organization researchers regard group cohesiveness as a key variable in their theorizing, the presumed importance of the cohesiveness construct has not always been accompanied by a corresponding emphasis on theoretical and empirical advances. This paper focuses primarily on the difficulties associated with the measurement of group cohesiveness, particularly as they pertain to the contentious relationship between group cohesiveness and productivity. Little is known for certain about this relationship in spite of four decades of investigation. One possible explanation for the inconclusive findings which characterize this literature is that no two studies reviewed here operationalized cohesiveness in exactly the same way. An emphasis on consistent and uniform measurement, and on the use of multiple measures of cohesiveness, should greatly improve the quality of future research.

Title: Cultural Influences on Styles of Handling Interpersonal Conflicts: Comparisons Among Jordanian, Turkish, and U.S. Managers
Author-Name: M. Kamil Kozan
Abstract: This study reports the results of surveys of conflict management styles of 215 Turkish and 134 Jordanian managers. Managers in both countries showed a resemblance to each other, and to their U.S. counterparts, in reporting a clear preference for the collaborative style in handling conflicts. The two countries differed both from each other and the U.S. in preferences for the remaining styles, notably forcing and accommodation. Conflict management styles were also found to be affected by the position of the other party, i.e., whether he/she is a subordinate, superior, or peer in both countries. Once again, differences between the two Mideastern countries were as marked as differences between them and the U.S. The paper discusses the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for comparative management.

Title: Gender and Organizational Commitment Among Hospital Nurses
Author-Name: David E. Gray
Abstract: This study examines occupational commitment among a sample of female hospital nurses working at a hospital in an urban Florida community. Previous research on work commitment and women is reviewed, and the significance of domestic relations and gender ideology for organizational commitment is discussed. Three categories of variables are used in the analysis: personal characteristics and experience, domestic relations, and gender ideology. The results revealed that organizational commitment among this sample of nurses has significant negative relationships with feminist gender ideology, and the extent to which work interferes with family life and a significant positive relationship with the presence of children. The implications of these findings are reviewed and the prospects of future research concerning organizational commitment among nurses is discussed.

Title: Patterns of Change in Marital Partners
Author-Name: Tamara Kotler
Abstract: Using coded interview data from a sample of 60 mostly married couples, residual values were obtained from a series of regression analyses which assessed a life span “continuity model” linking the quality of marital partners' significant relationships from childhood with their current socio-emotional functioning. The residual values were used to select six couples which differed in the amount of change reported and therefore in their degree of misfit with the model. A qualitative analysis of their interviews revealed processes which can be understood within the framework of Bowlby's attachment theory. This analysis suggests that mutual security provision by partners serves a stabilizing function for them and promotes some trust. However, those relationships which also foster positive change in partners are able to achieve a sustained intimacy which in turn requires adequate levels of autonomy and separation from the parental family. Early experience is thus represented in later outcomes. The advantage of c...

Title: Active and Passive Conceptions of the Television Audience: Effects of a                 Change in Viewing Routine
Author-Name: Greg Hearn
Abstract: Are human beings best viewed as active or passive in relationship to their environment? Television audience research in recent decades exemplifies this longstanding issue. Polarization on the question may be due to a tendency to compartmentalize qualitative and quantitative data. In this study, a prototypicalfield experiment involving 156 adult residents in a large Australian city generated both types of data to clarify the nature of television audience activity. Viewing frequencies for a group restricted to their least preferred channel decreased significantly when compared to two other comparison groups suggesting that attraction to content does in fact play an important role in influencing viewing behavior. Qualitative comments elicited during the experience of being restricted suggested important differences in respondents' affinity with the medium. Viewers can possibly be distinguished on the basis of whether they orient to content or medium and whether they experience a sense of freedom and control ...

Title: Assessing the Effectiveness of Sociotechnical Interventions: Antidote or Fad?
Author-Name: Rafik I. Beekun
Abstract: In spite of an official record of success, much uncertainty surrounds the mean effect of sociotechnical interventions on organizational effectiveness. A new technique, a meta-analysis, is used to estimate both this mean effect and its variation across 17 sociotechnical studies. Several contingency variables which may have moderated this mean effect are also examined. Results indicate that interventions that (1) involved the formation of autonomous instead of semi- or non-autonomous workgroups, (2) included an increase in monetary incentives, and (3) occurred in a non-U.S. country rather than in the U.S. led to greater increases in productivity. Conversely, sociotechnical interventions that also included a change in technology resulted in a smaller improvement in productivity and a smaller drop in escape behavior than interventions without a technological change. More importantly, a curvilinear relationship was uncovered between the duration of an intervention and productivity. This curvilinear relationshi...

Title: Understanding Organizational Transformation Using a Dissipative Structure Model
Author-Name: Richard Leifer
Abstract: Organizational transformation, qualitative and fundamental changes in an organization, occurs as a result of an organization's adaptive mechanisms being overwhelmed by internally or externally induced contingencies. Current approaches to change derived from equilibrium models are not adequate to describe the transformation phenomena. An emerging paradigm, dissipative structure, provides an alternative perspective on transformation by proposing that non-equilibrium conditions provide the opportunity for a new organizational order, resulting in an increased ability to manage complexity. Conditions, processes, and functioning of organizations from this perspective are discussed.

Title: Social Identity and the Northern Ireland Conflict
Author-Name: A. M. Gallagher
Abstract: A series of experimental studies examined various identity polarities (Catholic/Protestant, Irish/British, and nationalist/unionist) relevant to the majority and minority communities in Northern Ireland. Subjects allocated themselves to one group within a polarity and awarded points on a series of matrices to anonymous others identified solely on the basis of group membership. Results suggested that the Catholic and nationalist identities had a similar impact for minority group members over time, whereas the Protestant and unionist identities had a differential impact for majority group members over time. This latter effect was related to the context implied by the identity label. Qualitative data gathered from interviews with political activists suggested some continuities with the experimental data. Political activists from minority group parties adhered to a single identity label, but offered competing meanings for that label. By contrast, activists from majority group parties adhered to competing iden...

Abstract: This study investigated task characteristics and individual differences as predictors of task scheduling, i.e., the timeliness with which tasks are completed. It also assessed the impact of task scheduling on performance. Ninety-eight undergraduate management students were assigned six tasks as part of their requirements in an organizational behavior course. Students were free to select from multiple opportunities to complete each task throughout the semester. They completed difficult tasks later and boring tasks earlier. Students with high need for achievement completed tasks later. Successful prior performance and workload were associated with earlier task completion. Early task completion resulted in superior performance. Implications for work organizations are discussed.

Title: Experimentation and Control: A Conceptual Framework for the Comparative Analysis of Socialization Agencies
Author-Name: Tamar Rapoport
Abstract: The paper introduces a conceptual framework, backed by empirical evidence, in which experimentation and control are perceived as independent but coexisting generic dimensions within each of the three major socialization agencies during adolescence: the home, the school, and the informal youth association. The socialization experiences in each agency, in terms of each dimension, was assessed via a closed questionnaire distributed among 1433 Israeli Jewish adolescents. The results shown, first, a clear-cut differentiation between the two dimensions across agencies and, second, that the agencies differ substantially in the degree to which each of the dimensions is present and therefore diverge in the patterns of socialization on which they are based. In light of these results, a preliminary typology of socialization contexts, incorporating the dimensions of experimentation and control, is proposed under the assumption that each context has a distinct impact on the development of adolescents.

Abstract: The relationships among career experiences, perceptions of company employment practices, and psychological commitment to the firm are explored in this paper. Psychological commitment is defined as non-instrumental attraction to and identification with the goals and values of the organization, excluding propensity to stay in the organization. Results show that employee perceptions of the organization's adherence to career-oriented employment practices, including internal mobility, employment security, and training and development, are more strongly related to psychological commitment than other characteristics of the work context, including participation, supervisory relations, and instrumental communication. Results are discussed in terms of internal labor market employment practices.

Title: Examining the Nature of Work Stress: Individual Evaluations of Stressful Experiences and Coping
Author-Name: Philip J. Dewel
Abstract: Recent reviews of occupational stress research constantly emphasizes four important themes. These include the need to clarify what we mean by stress since how we define it influences how we research it and thus how we explain our results, the need to reconsider how we measure stressors, the need to explicity recognize the role of coping by developing measures of coping strategies, and the need to consider the role of alternative methodologies in investigating the stress process. Qualitative and quantitative methodologies are used to explore some of these issues. The results point to the value of using qualitative measures to assess the validity of current research practices. A number of issues emerge. When measuring work stressors, more attention should be given to such facets as intensity, frequency, and the meaning individuals attribute to events. Coping also influences individual meaning and future research should explore the nature of direct action and palliative strategies and more thoroughly investi...

Title: Self-Serving Attributions in the Face of Reality: The Effect of Task Outcome and Potential Causes on Self-Other Attributions
Author-Name: Gregory C. Elliott
Abstract: This experiment investigated self-serving attribution strategies designed to account for one's own and another's success or failure at an interpersonal judgment task. Using the dimensions of stability and locus of potential causes first proposed by Weiner, analysis was made of self-other differences in attributions of ability, task difficulty, effort, and luck. Results showed that the tendency toward self-serving attributions was modified by the reality constraints of relative task outcomes, with one exception. Regardless of outcomes, subjects never admitted that the other exerted more effort than they did at the task. For the other potential causes, self-other differences in attributions were dependent on the observed outcomes. The results are discussed in light of the stability and locus characteristics of each potential cause and the complex concerns that govern self-serving attributions.

Title: The Work Autonomy Scales: Additional Validity Evidence
Author-Name: James A. Breaugh
Abstract: Recently, Breaugh (1985) developed an instrument that measures three facets, i.e., method, scheduling, and criteria, of work autonomy. This paper presents the results of several analyses designed to evaluate the construct validity of these work autonomy scales. One set of analyses involved the use of confirmatory factor analysis to assess the underlying factor structure of the three work autonomy facet measures. Both indices for assessing the fit of a theoretical model confirmed that a three-facet autonomy model clearly fits the sample data. A second set of analyses involved subgroup comparisons. As predicted, unionized employees reported less autonomy in all three areas than non-union workers. Also as hypothesized, individuals in supervisory positions reported having more autonomy than those not in supervisory positions. The paper also reports a number of additional analyses relevant to the construct validity of the work autonomy scales. When the results reported in this paper are taken in combination wi...

Title: The Impact of Union Involvement on the Design and Introduction of Quality of Working Life
Author-Name: Beth Gilbert
Abstract: While Quality of Working Life (Q WL) has received a great deal of attention over the past years, somewhat less attention has been given to the role and impact of unions on QWL programs. The role that unions play is controversial. In order to examine the effect of union involvement, this paper uses the case survey method to analyze nine union and nine non-union organizations which implemented QWL programs. The union leadership appeared to play a positive role in improving the design and implementation of the QWL program, but there appeared to be an inability of the union leadership to transmit the program to the rank-and-file members. Recommendations are made to increase rank-and-file involvement in the QWL program.

Title: Alexithymia in Organizational Life: The Organization Man Revisited
Author-Name: Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries
Abstract: In this article, the organization man is looked at from a different perspective within the context of a relatively recent clinical construct called alexithymia. Alexithymia, meaning literally no words for moods, is basically a communication disorder. The construct has been introduced in psychiatry and medical psychology because of a consistent body of clinical and phenomenological observations relating to a particular way of interacting emotionally. More specifically, it refers to individuals with an extreme reality-based cognitive style, an impoverished fantasy life, a paucity of inner emotional experiences, a tendency to enagage in stereotypical interpersonal behavior, and a speech pattern characterized by endless, trivial, repetitive details. As a clinical syndrome, integrating and telescoping co-variant characteristics, it alerts the clinician to a cluster of otherwise most likely unobserved but frequently related cognitive and affective patterns. Alexithymia as a clinical construct also helps us bett...

Title: A Test of Participation Theory in a Work Re-design Field Setting: Degree of Participation and Comparison Site Contrasts
Author-Name: Barry A. Macy
Author-Name: Mark F. Peterson
Author-Name: Larry W. Norton
Abstract: Although the organizational theory and change literature are replete with intuitively reasonable descriptions concerning the potential effects of participation programs, few efforts have been made to empirically test participation theory. This article examines such theory via a longitudinal study in a naturalistic field setting. The primary intent is to examine the multidimensional organizational efforts that a participative change program lasting approximately 6 years with four separate measurement periods has on direct and indirect participants in contrast to the spontaneous changes in a comparison site. In addition to the delineation of the present study's methodology, results, and interpretation, a brief historical account of participation theory and a review of the empirical participation literature is provided. Contrasts with the comparison site indicate that the change program had beneficial effects for direct participants in the change program, some of which spilled over to other indirectly involv...

Title: Interorganizational Systems in Public Service Delivery: A New Application of the Dynamic Network Framework
Author-Name: Michael W. Lawless
Author-Name: Rita A. Moore
Abstract: Many key activities in both the public and private sectors today occur in interorganizational networks, involving high interdependence among otherwise autonomous agencies. Miles and Snow outline a special form of such systerms called the "dynamic network. "It is characterized by vertical disaggregation, a flexible governance structure resembling a market mechanism, a single strategy maker in the role of a "broker, " and shared information among members. The combination of these features distinguishes the dynamic network from other interorganizational systems. Miles and Snow claim their model is useful in both public and private settings. However, applications are, so far, limited to the private sector. Utilizing six comprehensive case studies, we examine the dynamic network model in public service delivery. New propositions are developed concerning structure and agency conduct in public interorganizational systems.

Title: Organization Design for Technological Change
Author-Name: Michel Liu

Abstract: The microprocessor revolution is the leading edge of a new "technology system" that in itself underlies a new paradigm of organization. While it is early to completely describe the emerging paradigm, some hypotheses can be advanced. They are presented in this paper. The hypotheses arise from studies of how new technologies have changed our understanding of the nature of jobs, the division of labor and the control and coordination of organizations. In the process of transition to the new paradigm, new professional skills will be required. It is postulated that skill in the design of organizations may be one of these.

Title: The Paradigm Plague: Prevention, Cure, and Inoculation
Author-Name: Ray Holland
Abstract: Although it is debatable whether Kuhn's concept of paradigm formation and change applies to the social and behavioral sciences, it has been very widely used to justify new descriptions, methods, and theories in these fields. Such is the dominance of paradigm arguments that fragmentation into incommensurable theoretical positions and specialties threatens to further undermine the credibility of the human disciplines. Some recent proposals by Hassard (1988) for overcoming paradigm hermeticism are noted, and the results of an experiment in reflexive professional education are put forward as one way out of the hermit's cave.

Abstract: This article contains an exploration of a number of the many interpretations of its title Liberating Systems Theory. It is in fact a point of reflection on the way to realizing Critical Systems Thinking. Particular points of focus are critical theory integrated to practice in systems "problem solving," and the history and progress of systems thinking, considering critically the relationship of the past with progressively emerging future ends, i.e., emerging Critical Systems Thinking.

Title: Non-Work Factors and Job Satisfaction Revisited
Author-Name: Kuo-Tsai Liou
Author-Name: Ronald D. Sylvia
Author-Name: Gregory Brunk
Abstract: The responses of 1473 subjects were utilized to examine the relationship between job satisfaction and extra-work satisfaction to test Wilensky's three hypothesized relationships. The current study regressed job satisfaction against the social trust of respondents, their sense of social equity, institutional confidence, and their satisfaction with government's handling of nationalproblems. These social attitudinal indices were added to factors utilized in previous research such as objective job factors, demographic variables, general life satisfaction, and their levels of social involvement. The results produced two previously unreported extra-work attitudinal contributors to job satisfaction: social trust and institutional confidence. The findings supported Wilensky's spillover theory but produced no evidence in support of Wilensky's segmentation or compensation alternatives.

Title: Internal Politics and the Interactive Elaboration of Information in Workgroups: An Exploratory Study
Author-Name: Emmanuel Lazega
Abstract: This exploratory research is concerned with the elaboration of appropriate information by workgroup members. Our theoretical approach centers on the interactive dimension of appropriateness judgments in work relationships; special attention is given to the way members use internal boundaries in their group in order to formulate these judgments. The study describes and grounds a typology of the processes of elaborating information and examines the link between these processes and the structure of the workgroup. Workgroup structure is defined in terms of authority relationships, taking into account different attitudes toward authority. The methodology is qualitative but builds upon a comparative approach applied in a social service unit and an administrative service unit.

Title: Academic Professionals: A Study of Conflict and Satisfaction in Professoriate
Author-Name: Halil Copurl
Abstract: Professional role conflicts of faculty in a research university are examined using confirmatory factor analysis. Results support the "compromise model" of professional bureaucracies with three decision arenas. Technical core of teaching function and purely administrative matters rarely create role conflicts while the area of collective decision making is the fertile ground for role incompatibilities of faculty. Role conflicts experienced by faculty are not found to be related to general job satisfaction but are significantly correlated with faculty disaffection in decisions that affect their work and work environment.

Title: Communication: A Cultural System of Meaning and Value
Author-Name: Bernard J. Reilly
Author-Name: Joseph A. DiAngelo, Jr.
Abstract: Communication is seldom what it appears to be. The critical heartland for the understanding of communication is not what is visible but rather what is invisible and hidden. Form and messages are secondary to pre-defined meanings within the organization. Namely, the embedded culture pre-sets communication among people and gives meaning to any messages which are communicated within the organization. Therefore, the hidden and symbolic elements give meaning to the visible communication process.

Title: Exploring the Dimensions of an International Social Issues Climate
Author-Name: Joseph E. McCann
Author-Name: Luis Gomez-Mejia
Abstract: While progress has been made in integrating many social issues concepts, empirical research testing these concepts remains limited. This paper examines four research questions posed from an open systems perspective about issues climate dynamics. These questions guided survey research with managers within 102 organizations to explore their perceptions of 40 issues active in the Caribbean Basin. The research supports the usability of the issue life cycle concept, helps differentiate between an issue's stage and its impact, and reveals an underlying structure among the issues within this region. Because the research also surveyed respondents' involvement in the region over a 2-year period, it also shows how their perceptions of issues can be linked to their subsequent behavior. Finally, the research suggests that foreign policy initiatives designed to stimulate private sector development need to be closely coordinated with other initiatives designed to improve political and social conditions as well.

Title: The Effects of Dual Career Participation on Men: Some Determinants of Variation in Career and Personal Satisfaction
Author-Name: Hazel M. Rosin
Abstract: Little is known about the ways in which men's professional and personal lives are affected by participation in dual career families. This paper presents findings from an exploratory, in-depth interview study which investigated this issue by probing the individual perceptions of husbands in dual career families. A majority of male respondents reported positive professional, familial, and marital consequences of dual career membership. A small group was less satisfied. Sources of variation in satisfaction are presented and five factors which appear to be linked to subjects' differential reactions are identified.

Title: The Splitting of Leadership and Management as a Social Defense
Author-Name: James Krantz
Author-Name: Thomas N. Gilmore
Abstract: This article explores a maladaptive response organizations are making to the great uncertainty and turbulence they face. The authors describe the ways in which management and leadership are split apart, with one aspect idealized and the other devalued, as a "social defense" against confronting the adaptive demands of contemporary operating environments. Two variants of this social defense are examined: "managerialism" which looks to the magic of technique and "heroism" which focuses on the heroic leader. Responding effectively to current conditions requires linking what has come to be viewed as leadership, the visionary and mission setting aspects of executive action, with management, the apparatuses and tools for achieving organizational purposes.

Title: Cooperation, Competition, and Self-Esteem: Aspects of Winning and Losing
Author-Name: Barbara Foley Meeker
Abstract: Two studies used questionnaires to assess how subjects thought they would feel about themselves in a variety of competitive and noncompetitive situations. Self-evaluations were on semantic differential items, which revealed two dimensions, "instrumental" and "expressive. " In Study 1, losing affected self-evaluations negatively on both dimensions, and winning negatively on the expressive dimension compared to some noncompetitive settings. In Study 2, the factors of success/failure and group/individual were separated from the competitive or cooperative nature of the task; gender and general self-evaluation were also controlled. Differences between winning and losing were similar to differences between succeeding and failing in noncompetitive settings, although competition had a positive effect on instrumental self-esteem. A group setting affected both dimensions positively. A few gender differences appeared.

Title: Relationships Between Subordinate Perceptions of Supervisor Influence Tactics and Attributed Bases of Supervisory Power
Author-Name: Timothy R. Hinkin
Author-Name: Chester A. Schriesheim
Abstract: This paper presents the results of a study investigating relationships between measures of supervisor influence and power, as perceived by subordinates (N = 251). The influence measures were based on the framework of Kipnis, Schmidt, and Wilkinson (1980), while the measures of power used were based on French and Raven's (1959) social bases of power. The results indicated that: (1) there was relatively strong support for most of the Kipnis et al. influence dimensions when viewed from the influence target's perspective, (2) perceptions of leader influence tactic behaviors and attributions of leader power bases are empirically distinct, and (3) several relationships exist between subordinate perceptions of leader influence behaviors and subordinate attributions of leaderpower. However, only one influence tactic, rationality, had both substantial and significant positive relationships with the more positively-viewed bases of power (expert and referent power), emphasizing its importance as a means of influence...

Title: Processes Linking Work and Family: A Critical Review and Research Agenda
Author-Name: Susan J. Lambert
Abstract: This paper critically reviews the theoreticalframeworks currently used to explain the processes through which work and family are linked, i.e., segmentation, compensation, and spillover. In the literature, these processes are treated as competing explanations, even though evidence and logic suggests that all three operate to link work and family. Moreover, it is likely that other processes also link the two. Most notably, workers may limit their involvement in work, or in family life, so that they can better accommodate the demands of the other. Clarified causal models and suggestions for advancing knowledge in this area are presented and discussed. It is argued that a fuller understanding of the processes linking work and family life is necessary to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of the family supportive policies currently being implemented by many U.S. firms, as well as to identify additional strategies for helping workers find satisfaction in both their work and personal roles.

Title: Multiculturalism in Australia: A Survey of Attitudes
Author-Name: Robert Ho
Abstract: The assimilationist approach to Australia's large-scale immigration program since the Second World War has recently been replaced by a policy of multiculturalism. While it is clear that public policy may have accepted multiculturalism as the appropriate philosophy for contemporary Australia, there is evidence to suggest that much of the community has yet to agree. This study has been designed to investigate Australian-born respondents' attitudes toward the policy of multiculturalism. Specifically, the study focuses on two research questions: (1) what is the extent of support for the policy of multiculturalism and its underlying dimensions?, i.e., the belief that such a policy is in line with Australia's national interest, that the policy has benefitted Australian society, that it serves as a social justice strategy by providing a fair share of society's resources to all Australians, and that it will lead to social cohesion, and (2) what are the correlates of these attitudes? A total of 159 Australian-born...

Title: The Eye of the Needle: Cultural and Personal Transformation in a Traditional Organization
Author-Name: Frances R. Westley
Abstract: This paper, based on ethnographic material gathered in interviews in a North American automobile manufacturing company, explores a particular, idiosyncratic culture in the process of change. It is argued that resistence to the planned change (a socio-technical re-design) demonstrated by organizational participants resulted in part from the clash between deeply held cultural assumptions and those implicit in the socio-technical re-design. Transformation when it occurred tended to be spearheaded by ideological conversion on the individual level facilitated by internal change agents as much as by the consultants. This case illustrates the truly systematic nature of change and the need to take into account structural, cultural, and personal transformation in any change effort.

Title: Calculations, Values, and Identities: The Sources of Collectivistic Work Motivation
Author-Name: Boas Shamir
Abstract: This paper argues for the further development of work motivation theories to include better links between the individual and the collectivity, in order to more adequately explain individual contributions to collective work efforts. Three co-determinants of collectivistic work motivation are discussed: calculative considerations, moral commitments, and the affirmation of identities. It is argued that perceived collective efficacy and social rewards and sanctions should be given a central place in calculative models of collectivistic work motivation. It is further argued that moral commitments and identity affirmation should not be reduced to cost-benefit calculations because doing so denies the social origins of collectivistic motivation, and masks the potential importance of these factors in explanations of collective action.

Title: Illusions of Management Control? Effects of Self-Serving Attributions on Resource Commitments and Confidence in Management
Author-Name: Charles R. Schwenk
Abstract: Past research has demonstrated that executives discussing the performance of their organizations tend to take credit for good performance and lay blame on the environment for poor performance. Two experiments were conducted to test the effects of this pattern of self-serving attributions on student subjects' confidence in management and their allocation of financial resources. Results of both experiments showed that executives' communications taking credit for good performance reduce recipients' confidence in management and resource commitments. Implications of these results for management practice and for future research are discussed.

Abstract: The view of a presuppositionless science has in recent years become increasingly under attack. Although the presence of presuppositions in industrial/organizational psychology and the need to study them have been acknowledged, no major attempt has been made to study these presuppositions in any systematic and comprehensive way. This article proposes that the study of such presuppositions falls within the ambit of an area called "subject philosophy." The article attempts to provide answers to two questions with reference to industrial/organizational psychology, "What is the nature of Subject Philosophy?" and "What is the task of Subject Philosophy?"

Author-Name: Penny L. Wright
Abstract: In a study of 264 bank tellers, different job characteristics were found to be associated with job satisfaction and organization commitment based on career orientation. For career tellers, satisfaction and organization commitment are enhanced by participation in decision making, job challenge, promotion opportunities, and a people-oriented supervisory style. For the non-career-oriented teller, job satisfaction and organization commitment will be affected positively through association in a cohesive, effective work group. Non-career tellers prefer a supervisory style characterized by a task orientation.

Abstract: A review of the literature revealed seven, quite different self-report measures of the Protestant Work Ethic (PWE). This study set out to compare and contrast these different measures by content, correlational, and factor analysis. Over 1000 English-speaking respondents completed all seven scales. Content analyses revealed seven dimensions to the PWE measures, and correlational analyses confirmed this. Factor analyses yielded five readily interpretable factors. The results are discussed in terms of the multi-dimensional nature of the PWE beliefs, the psychometric evaluation of the different scales, and the difficulty of defining the PWE in current contexts.

Title: The Role of Job Outcomes and Values in Understanding the Union's Impact on Job Satisfaction: A Replication
Author-Name: Martin G. Evans
Author-Name: Daniel A. Ondrack
Abstract: In this paper, the consequences of being a union member for a person's job satisfaction is explored. Berger, Olson, and Boudreau (1983) suggest that union membership is related to the job outcomes that people receive and the job values that they hold (or else that people with particular values choose unionized work settings); so that if these factors are controlled, it is hypothesized that there is no effect of union membership on job satisfaction. Using a sample of male employees in union and non-union worksites in southwestern Ontario, this hypothesis is explored with a focus on satisfaction with work itself and satisfaction with pay. Berger et al.'s (1983) findings were replicated, i.e., after controlling for job complexity, there was no relationship between unionization and satisfaction with work itself. However, contrary to the hypothesis, a relationship between unionization and satisfaction with pay was found. This result may be due to (1) unionization enhancing perceived fairness of pay, or (2) the...

Title: Age and Work Satisfaction in a Government Agency: A Situational Perspective
Author-Name: Gerald Zeitz
Abstract: A "situational"perspective on employee attitudes is used to interpret the relationship between age and work satisfaction among 434 employees of a Federal Government agency. Distinct age-satisfaction curves are discovered among three employee groups: a U-shaped curve among nonprofessionals, an upward-sloping double-bend curve among elite professionals, and a downward sloping curve among ordinary professionals. Employee perceptions of management climate, mobility possibilities, and personal influence all vary by subcontext and determine level of work satisfaction. Results are seen as supporting a situational rather than ontogenetic explanation of work satisfaction.

Title: Exploring the Dynamics of the End-User Environment: The Impact of Education and Task Differences on Change
Author-Name: Gayle J. Yaverbaum
Author-Name: Oya Culpan
Abstract: Myriads of researchers have investigated the link between information system use and end-user satisfaction. In spite of the proliferation of such research, many questions remain. This study explores the end-user environment by studying motivation and satisfaction of computer users over a 6-month interval. The Job Diagnostic Survey (JDS), designed by Hackman and Oldham, was employed to measure job core characteristics of 44 computer end-users. Scores were compared those of an earlier survey administered within the same organizations. We find that differences in perceived job motivation can be traced to task and education. Furthermore, we conclude that the type of educational program offered by organizations is vital to information system satisfaction.

Title: Promotions and Employees' Perceived Mobility Channels: The Effects of Employee Sex, Employee Group, and Initial Placement

Author-Name: Debra L. Juntunen
Abstract: Information from questionnaires and personnel records (perceived and actual promotions in previous 5 years, hierarchical level, and perceptions of ways of obtaining promotions-mobility channels) was gathered on 14 administrative/professional and supervisory/technical university employees to determine how mobility patterns and employee perceptions of them vary as a result of employees' sex and different starting points in the organization. Two 2 x 2 MANCOVAs (employee sex x employee group and employee sex x starting level), with age and education held constant, showed main effects for employee group and starting level, a marginal main effect for employee sex, and an employee sex x starting level interaction. Employees'sex and their positions in the organization, whether initial vertical placement or the (bargaining) group in which the employee works, are important in promotions and employees' perceptions of the promotion process.

Author-Name: David A. Vollrath
Abstract: This article reviews a program of research on how groups reason about moral dilemmas, and presents data from two studies. In the first study, discussions of 21 four-member groups were tape recorded, coded, and analyzed to identify the factors that affected group performance. The data indicated that a group's moral reasoning level (as measured by Rest's Defining Issues Test) seemed to depend on whether more principled reasoning members took a task leadership role. The second study attempted to manipulate the leadership variable by assigning the task leadership role to individuals who reasoned at more vs. less principled levels. Results indicated that the reasoning level of the assigned leader impacted group performance while individual performance overall on a subsequent moral reasoning task benefitted from the group experience. The extent of the individual change was influenced by subjects' initial reasoning level. Implications for management are discussed.

Title: In Search of Adams' Other: Reexamination of Referents Used in the Evaluation of Pay
Author-Name: Timothy P. Summers
Author-Name: Angelo S. DeNisi
Abstract: The paper provides a reexamination of Goodman's (1974) study of the referents used in evaluating pay. The present field research, largely in corroboration of Goodman (1974), found that perceptions of pay equity with respect to three classes of referents are strongly associated with pay satisfaction. In addition, pay valence was found to be associated with perceptions of equity vis-a-vis referent classes. This research was generally not supportive of Goodman's identification of factors affecting the selection of referents. Implications for future research are discussed.

Title: Work Rewards, Work Values, and Organizational Commitment in an Employee-Owned Firm: Evidence from the U.K.
Author-Name: Nick Oliver
Abstract: This study examines the influence of employee work values, demographic characteristics, and organizational rewards on levels of organizational commitment, involvement, identification, and loyalty in a U.K. employee-owned firm. The idea that commitment can be understood as afunction of the 'fit" between employee values and organizational rewards was explored. Under multiple regression analysis, demographic variables made little impact on levels of commitment, but both organizational rewards and work values showed significant relationships to commitment. Employees who showed strong participatory values exhibited relatively high commitment; those with strongly instrumental values showed relatively lower commitment, providing some support for the 'fit" model. The implications of these findings for theory and practice in the area of employee ownership are discussed.

Title: Rational Integration: Restoring Rationality to Organizational Analysis
Author-Name: Jonathan I. Klein
Abstract: A "rational integration" model is proposed to explain why organizations, according to Allison (1971), tend to be mutually perceived as "rational actors" exhibiting goal consensus. It is suggested that the perception of rational action is attributable not merely to cognitive error but also to rational behaviors, performed both by elements of the perceived rational actor and by members of other organizations with which it transacts. The discussion addresses practical implications of rational integration, including problems and opportunities, and strategies for overcoming or exploiting them. The discussion also demonstrates how (1) the proposed model may enhance knowledge of organizations, and (2) research may contribute to this knowledge. Finally, by assigning causality to both "objective" social structure and the "subjective" perception of it, the proposed model can benefit social analysis in general by demonstrating an approach that integrates the structural and interpretive schools through a newly-propos...

Title: Stress in the Prison Service: The Benefits of Exercise Programs
Author-Name: Julia Kielyl
Author-Name: George Hodgson
Abstract: This article examines the job and role of prison officers in the light of theoretical work on occupational stress. Research findings and literature reviews on the value of exercise to offset occupational stress are considered. A visit was made to a prison currently operating a staff exercise program during duty hours, and interviews were held with staff. Further prisons of similar categorization were contacted by questionnaire to obtain comparable statistical data on overtime and sickness rates. The questionnaire also sought Governors' opinions of occupational stress and the feasibility of introducting staff exercise programs as a means of alleviating stress. Finally, in-depth interviews were held with a selection of staff who had experienced an illness which they attributed to stress. The results highlight the positive benefits of physical exercise and general fitness both as stress preventors and as a means of overcoming the harmful effects of stress. It also reveals the need for more rigorous research ...

Title: The Effects of Quality Circles on Performance and Promotions
Author-Name: Kimberly Buch
Author-Name: Raymond Spangler
Abstract: This study was designed to test the developmental effects of quality circles (QCs) on participants' job performance and promotions. A quasiexperimental design was used to compare 118 circle members with 118 noncircle employees. In the year following the circle intervention, circle members received significantly greater performance ratings and were promoted morefrequently than non-members. The developmentalproperties of the QC process believed responsible for these findings are discussed. Other possible explanations for the results are also proposed: visibility, positive evaluation bias, and anticipatory socialization.

Title: Social Identity and Intergroup Perceptions in Minority-Majority Contexts
Author-Name: Caroline Kelly
Abstract: This study investigates intergroup perceptions between the members of minority and majority factions of a political party. Two hypotheses were tested derivedfrom the social identity approach to intergroup relations. First, it was predicted that minority group members would display higher levels of intergroup differentiation than majority group members, associated with a lower level of intergroup understanding. Second, it was predicted that, within each group, level of ingroup identification would be positively related to intergroup differentiation. A postal questionnaire was completed by 136 members of the British Labour Party, 92 supporters of the majority group, and 44 supporters of the minority group. Findings confirmed both hypotheses, and further investigation suggested that the significance of ingroup identification derived from its impact on ingroup ratings rather than on outgroup ratings. The implications of these findings for the underlying dynamics of intergroup differentiation are discussed.

Title: Age, Tenure, and Employee Absenteeism
Author-Name: Rick D. Hackett
Abstract: Two demographic/personal characteristics in the Steers and Rhodes' (1978, 1984) process model of employee attendance, and on which considerable research has accumulated in the absenteeism literature, are age and tenure. Recent narrative reviews of this research show that the results are quite mixed and likely to depend upon sex of the sample and absence type. A meta-analysis (Hunter, Schmidt, & Jackson, 1982) of this literature revealed that age (but not tenure) had a modest (p = -.23) relationship with avoidable absences, neither age nor tenure was associated with unavoidable absences, and sex of sample was identified as a moderator. Implications of these findings for the Steers and Rhodes' model are discussed in light of possible directions for future research.

Title: Defensive Behavior in Organizations: A Preliminary Model
Author-Name: Blake E. Ashforth
Author-Name: Raymond T. Lee
Abstract: The literature on organizational politics has focused on the proactive promotion of self-interests but has neglected the reactive defense of self-interests. Defensive behaviors are argued to: (1) avoid action, via over-conforming, passing the buck, playing dumb, depersonalizing, smoothing and stretching, and stalling, (2) avoid blame via buffing, playing safe, justifying, scapegoating, misrepresenting, and escalating commitment, and (3) avoid change via resisting change and protecting turf. Organizational antecedents of defensiveness include bureaucratic rationality and various stressors, and individual antecedents include insecurity and anxiety, emotional exhaustion, work alienation, self-monitoring, and low self-efficacy. The effects of defensiveness on the individual, recipients, and organization are discussed, and directions for future research are presented.

Title: Social Psychological Approaches to the Perception of Ethical Dilemmas
Author-Name: Stephen L. Payne
Author-Name: Robert A. Giacalone
Abstract: Moral psychology and social psychology theories are examined to illustrate their usefulness for evolving research on topics of business and organizational ethics. The authors believe that social psychological concepts such as attribution, cognitive distortion, and impression management can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of processes of moral perception and judgment. The organizational stakeholder concept and stakeholder mapping methods found in the strategic planning literature may also be particularly valuable for business ethics research. Using an organizational stakeholder model and considering the effects of cognitive and self-presentational biases of these stakeholders should allow researchers to better explain social controls and actions undertaken in cases of managerial misconduct in work organizations.

Title: Managers' Moral Reasoning: Assessing Their Responses to Three Moral Dilemmas
Author-Name: James Weber
Abstract: Based on Kolhberg's theory of moral development, an assessment of managers' responses to three moral dilemmas was explored. The findings indicate that managers typically reason at moral reasoning stages 3 or 4, similar to most adults in Western, urban societies or other business managers. However, differences were discovered when the organizational size of the managers' employer and type of moral issue were considered. Managers employed by large to medium-sized organizations tended to reason at lower moral reasoning stages than managers who work in small firms or were self-employed. Moral reasoning exhibited when the dilemmas were placed in a business context was significantly lower than for a dilemma in a non-business context. Implications from these findings are discussed.

Title: Predictors for Career Achievement in the Corporate Hierarchy
Author-Name: Urs E. Gattiker
Author-Name: Laurie Larwood
Abstract: This study investigates the interrelationships between objective and perceived career achievement and career choices, success criteria, family variables, and demographics, as well as examining vocational congruence between career and the individual. The congruence model is tested by using both objective and subjective measures. A sample composed of more than 200 managers from a variety of organizations revealed that demographic and family variables relate to individual perceptions of career achievement as well as to objective indicators of career achievement within a corporate hierarchy. While the applicability of the general congruence model in career research seems limited based on this study's result, the functional congruence model is supported with the data obtained. Implications of these results for research on careers and career counselors are discussed.

Title: Relationship of Job Stress and Type-A Behavior to Employees' Job                 Satisfaction, Organizational Commitment, Psychosomatic Health Problems, and Turnover Motivation
Author-Name: Muhammad Jamal
Abstract: The present study examined the relationship of job stress, job stressors, and Type-A behavior pattern with employees' job satisfaction, organizational commitment, psychosomatic health problems, and turnover motivation among full-time nurses (N = 215) working in a large Canadian hospital. Both job stress and stressors (role ambiguity, overload, conflict, and resource inadequacy) were significantly related to four outcome variables. Type-A behavior was associated with high job stress, high role ambiguity, conflict, resource inadequacy, and psychosomatic health problems. In addition, Type-A behavior was found to be an important moderator of the stress-outcome relationships. Implications of the findings for management and for future research are highlighted.

Title: The Relationships Between Candidate Personality, Self-Presentation                 Strategies, and Interviewer Assessments in Selection Interviews: An Empirical Study
Author-Name: Clive Fletcher
Abstract: Evidence suggests that selection interviewers make judgments about candidates' personalities on the basis of how they behave in interviews. The study reported here examined the relationship between the intended interview strategies of 110 students applying for university places and their scores on personality measures. Data were also collected on the impact of these self-presentation strategies on interviewers' ratings. The results indicate that interview experience is a factor in shaping candidates' behavior, and that although interviewers are influenced by self-presentation strategies, the latter do not necessarily reflect personality in a consistent way. The implications of these findings for how the selection interview should be conceptualized are discussed.

Title: The Organizational Fool: Balancing a Leader's Hubris
Author-Name: Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries
Abstract: This paper explores the role of the sage-fool as means of creating a counter-vailing power against the regressive forces inherent in leadership, in other words, to reinforce the leader's capacity for reality testing. After a brief review of leadership theories, some of the salient characteristics of the role of the sage-fool are reviewed, taking a historical perspective. It is subsequently demonstrated how the fool, in playing the role of mediator between leader and followers, brings to the surface certain conflictual themes and thereby allows both parties to deal with the issues at hand. In this context, the role of humor and joking relationships are examined. Finally, two case examples of the fool in an organizational setting are presented.

Title: Organizational Configurations: Cohesion, Change, and Prediction
Author-Name: Danny Miller
Abstract: Recent studies have argued that the variety of organizational forms is limited and that certain common organizational configurations-alignments among strategy, structure and environment-occur with remarkable frequency and account-for a very significant fraction of organizations. This has been demonstrated empirically. The purpose of this paper is to probe into the cohesion, dynamics, and predictive implications of configurations. Ten propositions are derived by analyzing some representative configurations. It is proposed that the constrained variety and cohesion of configurations are caused by the interdependent, robust, cyclical, and reciprocal relationships among their parts. It is also argued that configurations vary in their first-order changes, but that all resist second-order changes, that is, changes in the direction of evolution. This makes them prone to long periods of momentum punctuated by brief periods of revolution. Finally, configurations are shown to vary in their internal relationships so ...

Title: Role Strains, Tension, and Job Satisfaction Influences on Employees'                 Propensity to Leave: A Multi-Sample Replication and Extension
Author-Name: Karin E. Klenke-Hamel
Author-Name: John E. Mathieu
Abstract: Using data from samples of four different employee populations, we tested Bedeian and Armenakis' (1981) model of the relationships between role strains, tension, job satisfaction, and propensity to leave. Results from the path-analyses yielded mixed support for the model, both within and between samples. Furthermore, we explored the effects of employee personal characteristics on the variables included in the model and identified several additional sources of influence. The findings are discussed in terms of the applicability of the Bedeian and Armenakis model to various employee populations, the need to further develop and to refine the causal model, and the targeting of organizational interventions aimed at managing role strain and turnover-related processes in organizations.

Title: Stories as Cultural Creativity: On the Relation Between Symbolism and Politics in Organizational Change
Author-Name: Steven P. Feldman
Abstract: The organization theory literature on stories concentrates on the role stories play in political processes, especially the representative and integrative aspects. In this essay, I will build on this literature by introducing Victor Turner's work on cultural change. Stories will be seen as not only representing and integrating political process, but also creating them. By focusing on the creative aspect of stories, their role in organizational change is highlighted. This framework is applied to stories about a change of leadership in an electronics company. Two conclusions emerge. First, stories are a form of cultural creativity that can be used to mediate conflicts and contradictions that arise from changing circumstances. Second, stories, despite the fact that they are a form of cultural change, can have a negative influence on the process of organizational change.

Title: Predicting Worker Turnover: An Assessment of Intent on Actual Separations
Author-Name: Alan Kirschenbaum
Author-Name: Jacob Weisberg
Abstract: The predictive ability of most turnover models emanates from a key construct measuring a worker's intention to withdraw from a work organization. Empirical evidence to collaborate this cardinal assumption has, however, only moderate support. To test the predictive value of intention to leave, a logistic regression model of combined cross-sectional and longitudinal survey data on workers'potential and actual turnover was initiated. The results demonstrate that actual turnover and intent are influenced by a separate set of factors with intent a poor predictor of turnover behavior. Age, tenure, wage level, and perceived chances for improvement at the job were found to have a significant impact on actual separation, but not on the intent to leave. Work repetitiveness, importance of improvement, and perception of co-workers' intent influence the intent to move, but not turnover. Perception of co-workers' intentions to leave and importance of improvement played a dual role for both intent and turnover, but much...

Title: Ritual Speaking in a Canadian Suburb: Anthropology and the Problem of Generalization
Author-Name: Nigel Rapport
Abstract: In the context of an expanding suburb on the edge of a Canadian city, this paper explores the ritual of daily conversation, and the role of individual practice in bringing to fruition common cultural texts. It offers a re-working of the Geertzian notion of texts as cultural control mechanisms, and a reappraisal of Giddens' view of the sociology of action as the study of behaviors which may be legitimately divorced from their individual perpetrators and set alongside other reified social facts. It argues instead for a view of common cultural texts as incomplete: ambiguous shorthands and generalities. It is the practice of individual speakers which personalizes and particularizes them to specific circumstances. This individuals do in diverse fashion. Hence, the meanings which the texts come to express are neither necessarily consensual nor conventional. The form of an anthropological account of such routine occasions, therefore, should be to shuttle between collective text and individual activity, maintaini...

Abstract: This study was designed to investigate the determinants of mothers' and fathers' reports of children's participation in family tasks. Results indicate that across task categories, sibling structure, gender-role orientation, age of oldest child, and family size are more often related to mothers' reports of children's participation. Among fathers, reports of children's task participation are more often influenced by age of oldest child, sibling structure, and extent of mother-father task sharing. Mothers' employment status did not explain any of the variance in parental reports of children's task participation. Implications of these findings are discussed.

Title: The Pragmatics of Institutional Racism: Beyond Words
Author-Name: Dennis Howitt
Author-Name: J. Owusu-Bempah
Abstract: The modern arguments about the apparent emergence of a "new"racism are noted and discussed. While this "new" racism refers to forms of racist talk which lack the crude bigotry often associated with racism, there seems to be an inconsistency between concern about such a development and the recorded levels of crude racism in the community as evidenced by racial attacks and harassment as well as indicators of racial inequality. Research into responses to Black people compared to White people attempting to join an organization is presented and discussed in the light of these modern ideas. The organizations in question were voluntary social service ones who were approached by volunteers, through letters, about the availability of voluntary work with the organization. Some of the letters of enquiry were signed by a person using the name Croft and others using the name Kumari. These were deliberately chosen to represent White and Black applicants. Differences between the replies to the Black and White signed let...

Abstract: This study examined the causal sequencing of attitudes, personal situations, and behavioral intentions as determinants of turnover among hospital volunteers. Structural equation modeling indicated that, consistent with prevailing models of turnover, attitudes and personal situations influenced turnover indirectly with intentions acting as a mediating factor. However, the analysis suggested that one aspect of the volunteer's personal situation (the convenience of the work schedule) also had a direct effect on turnover.

Abstract: Theoretical and empirical organizational stress research typically focuses on some combination of stress, personality factors, coping, and symptoms of ill health. Though these factors are typically considered important, there is considerable disagreement regarding the underlying process by which they are interrelated. This article discusses and empirically evaluates seven alternative conceptual models specifying the interrelationships among stress, personality (in this case, Type-A behavior pattern), coping, and psychological and physical symptoms, using data from 1468 adults in four occupations. Results generally support three models which incorporate linear effects and fail to support four models which incorporate nonlinear, i.e., interactive, effects. Implications for research are discussed.

Some changes (degree of conflict, temporariness, and fulfillment potential) were best accounted for by the act of progressing through the steps of this major transition in life; other changes in life structure (complexity, flexibility, and self-determination) were better accounted for by an internal process of paradigm shifting.

Title: Transformational Leadership and Multiple Levels of Analysis
Author-Name: Francis J. Yammarino
Author-Name: Bernard M. Bass
Abstract: Transformational leadership was clarified conceptually in this study by focusing on leader-follower interactions in terms of multiple levels of analysis: individuals, dyads within groups, and groups. The focal leaders were 186 United States Navy Officers who were graduates of the United States Naval Academy and on active duty assigned to the surface warfare fleet. Data about the officers were collected from 793 senior subordinates of the officers via a mail survey. Results from within and between analysis (WABA) suggest that the network of relationships was based primarily on individual differences in subordinates' perceptions of leadership and outcomes. Transformational leadership as compared to transactional or laissez-faire leadership was related more strongly to subordinates' extra effort and satisfaction with the focal officers and the officers' effectiveness.

Title: The Old-Fashioned Personality
Author-Name: J. J. Ray
Abstract: It is noted that the authoritarian personality theory of Adorno et al. is now seldom referred to in race relations research and that the scale used to operationalize the theory (the Fscale) is a very poor measure of what it purports to measure (right-wing authoritarianism). The Fscale does have many correlates, however, and the work of Pflaum is referred to support the contention that the F scale in fact taps an old-fashioned orientation. A large correlational study by Kline and Cooper is reinterpreted in this light and it is shown that when pejorative assumptions are discarded, the old-fashioned person would appear to have many potentially admirable characteristics. The new understanding of what the F scale measures is also shown to be helpful in making sense of the findings from many other studies.

Title: A Re-examination of the Side-Bet Theory as Applied to Organizational Commitment: A Meta-Analysis
Author-Name: Aaron Cohen
Author-Name: Geula Lowenberg
Abstract: Contradictory research findings make it almost impossible to arrive at generalized conclusions about the side-bet theory despite the amount of attention this theory has received. In an attempt to resolve the argument about the ability of the theory to explain the formation of organizational commitment, this study examines previous findings of relevant correlational data from 50 published studies, using the Hunter, Schmidt, and Jackson (1982) metaanalysis procedure. Results show that 11 side-bet variables have estimates of low population correlations with organizational commitment. For most of the side-bet variables, no meaningful or generalizable relationships with organizational commitment were found. The results indicate that there is very little empirical support for the side-bet theory. Three possible conclusions are proposed. Discussion of the implications of each conclusion and how they relate to future investigation of the side-bet theory concludes the paper.

Author-Name: Ofra Anson

Author-Name: Benjamin Maoz
Abstract: While recent life events (RLE) cause ill health and psychological distress, religiosity is positively associated with health. The adverse effect of RLE on health is usually explained in terms of stress theory; the positive religiosity-health association is explained by the nature of the religious network, or by the effect of religiosity on the internal environment of the individual. Using data collected from a sample (n = 230) of two Israeli kibbutzim, one religious and one non-religious, with similar ecology, demography, and social structure, the stress-deterrent effect of religiosity is studied. Self-administered questionnaires, including a list of RLE, five health measures, and five religiosity measures, were randomly distributed. Our findings show that whereas RLE adversely relate to health, belonging to a religious community counterbalances the negative health consequences of RLE. Individual religiosity (private praying, theodicity, and religious commitment) do not have the same stress-deterrent effect.

Abstract: Mental health workers (N= 122) provided information regarding burnout, coping styles, and resources in their work setting and their family. Resources from both work setting and family were found to be related to subsequent levels of burnout at a 6-month interval. A LISREL model testing procedure provided support for the hypothesis that each resource area, family, work setting, and coping style, was independently related to changes in burnout over time. Each of the three aspects of psychological burnout showed a distinct relationship with the resource measures. Emotional exhaustion was related only to family resources, while depersonalization was related to both work-setting and family resources. Diminished personal accomplishment was not related to family resources, but was related to both work-setting resources and coping styles. The implications of the results for including family coping in a model of burnout and occupational stress are discussed.

Title: Social Identity and the Handicapping Functions of Stereotypes: Children's Understanding of Mental and Physical Handicap
Author-Name: Dominic Abrams
Author-Name: Debra Jackson
Author-Name: Lindsay St. Claire
Abstract: Data from a pilot study established that, in reference to people with mental handicap and physical disabilities, I1-year-old subjects tended only to use the terms "mentally handicapped," "physically handicapped," and the colloquial term "divvy." The main study asked children to rate a target child ascribed one of these labels (or the label "normal"), and to complete a measure of social distance from that target. In addition, subjects were divided into those with high or low prior contact with people with mental handicap. Subjects did not distinguish among the attributes of the different non-normal labels, but did differentiate between these and normal, indicating they generally simply employ a "normal/abnormal" categorization of others. In line with predictions derived from social identity theory, social stereotypes were unaffected by interpersonal contact. There was no effect of label on measures of anticipated interpersonal social distance. Implications for "mainstreaming" and ways of re-shaping stereot...

Title: The Generalizability of the Hidden Investment Hypothesis in Leading Japanese Corporations
Author-Name: Mitsuru Wakabayashi
Author-Name: George Graen
Author-Name: Mary Uhl-Bien
Abstract: The present study tests the generalizability of the hidden investment hypothesis (Wakabayashi, Graen, Graen, & Graen, 1988) for Japanese management systems. The hidden investment hypothesis was derived from a 13-year longitudinal study of the career progress of a cohort of 85 college graduates who joined a single Japanese company in the same year, and states that the higher the quality of the vertical exchange relationship between a manager and supervisor, the greater the career progress of that manager. To test for the generalizability of the hidden investment hypothesis, 1075 line managers at four different hierarchical levels were sampled from five of the leading corporations in Japan. Hierarchical regression and path analysis showed that both vertical exchange quality and hierarchical level contributed uniquely to investments in managers' careers after the contributions of company, age, tenure, education, technical specialty, and intrafirm mobility were controlled. The contributions of these control v...

Title: Making a Technological Innovation Work: Collaboration to Solve Problems
Author-Name: Dean Tjosvold
Abstract: How employees depend and interact with each other can affect their ability to solve problems and implement innovations. Fifty retail store personnel were interviewed on specific difficulties they had to cope with as they used their new laser scanning technology. Results indicate that cooperative goals and interaction contributed to progress, efficiency, and confidence. The study identifies antecedents to cooperative and competitive goals and categorizes and describes cooperative and competitive problem-solving behaviors and their consequences on the organization.

Title: Individual Responses to Job Loss: Empirical Findings from Two Field Studies
Author-Name: Carrie R. LeanaI
Author-Name: Daniel C. Feldman
Abstract: This research examined the responses and coping strategies that laid-off employees use to deal with job loss. Data were gathered from two samples: (1) 198 former industrial workers who lost their jobs through a plant closing, and (2) 163 managerial, clerical, and technical employees who lost their jobs after the space-shuttle Challenger disaster. Financial distress and attachment to the previous job were the strongest predictors of negative reactions to job loss. In general, the findings regarding coping strategies, e.g., job search and retraining, were mixed: some coping strategies were positively related to reemployment although there were no strong predictors of individual use of such strategies. For both samples, there were no consistent findings concerning the effects of company assistance programs or the length of time spent out of work. The implications of these results for future research, theory, and practice are discussed.

Title: Interpersonal Theory: Criticism, Modification, and Elaboration
Author-Name: John Birtchnell
Abstract: Interpersonal theory, as formulated by Freedman and developed by Leary, was constructed around the two dimensions of love vs. hate and dominate vs. submit. The two alternative dimensions of close vs. distant and upper vs. lower are introduced because they are generic and value free. To resolve confusion concerning what the theory is about, it is proposed that it be concerned with inborn dispositions which have their origins in interactions which occur between all animalforms. In humans, such dispositions are elaborated into competencies. Rather than considering negative forms of relating as the extreme of normalforms, it is suggested that they result from the imperfect acquisition of competencies. Interpersonal systems have been distorted by successive attempts to fit them into a circular ordering of bipolar opposites. This calls into question the appropriateness of the circumplex analysis as a means of confirming interpersonal theory.

Title: The Assessment of Perceived Environmental Uncertainty and Economic Performance
Author-Name: Donald L. McCabe
Abstract: Most models of the strategy formulation process suggest organization performance is related, to at least some degree, to the ability of top management to accurately assess the external environment and to reach a degree of consensus in this assessment. The research reported here tested these assertions within two distinct industry segments, U.S. producers of corrugated shipping containers and U.S. passenger airlines, andfound very limited support for these relationships. The results suggest that in complex, unstable environments, accuracy and consensus in assessing environmental uncertainty may actually detract from organization performance. Directions for future research are recommended.

Abstract: An attempt was made to replicate previous successful efforts to construct three subscales measuring different facets of work autonomy. Compared to previous attempts, where cross-occupational samples were taken, the present study drew from a relatively homogeneous sample of dental hygienists (n = 89). Factor analysis failed to replicate the three distinct subscales. Rather, one single nine-item measure of autonomy was formed which, for construct and divergent validity purposes, was predictably associated with variables with which theoretically it should be associated, and was predictably not associated with variables with which theoretically it should not be associated. Implications for the further development of a multidimensional measurement of work autonomy are discussed.

Title: The Moderating Effect of the Type A Behavior Pattern and Locus of Control upon the Relationship Between Change in Job Demands and Change in Psychological Strain
Author-Name: T. J. Newton
Author-Name: A. Keenan
Abstract: This paper examines (1) the relationship between changes in job demands and changes in psychological strain across time, and (2) the moderating effect of the Type A behavior pattern (TABP) and locus of control, or internality-externality (I-E) on this relationship. TABP and I-E were hypothesized to moderate job demands because they appear as factors likely to affect the longer-term coping patterns of individuals, or coping styles. Among the job demand variables, increases in qualititative "low-load" were most strongly predictive of increases in psychological strain. Significant moderating effects were observedfor both TABP and I-E. With the TABP, a uniform pattern offindings emerged in that all the significant partial correlations were negative in direction, indicating that where job demands increased, Type As experienced less psychological strain than Type Bs. With I-E, however, the direction of the partial correlations varied dependent on the type of job demand.

Title: Environmental Dependence and Departmental Structure: Case of the Marketing Function
Author-Name: Ali Dastmalchian
Author-Name: David A. Boag
Abstract: This paper reports the results of a study examining the relationships between market and customer dependencies and the structure of the marketing departments (boundary-spanning units) in 44 electronics/telecommunications companies in Canada. Data were collected by means of personal interviews with senior management and marketing officials in each company. The results show that product market dependency has positive effects on specialization and the level of integration of the marketing function, while customer dependency has a positive impact on centralization of decision making in the departments. When these relationships were compared in high and low performing firms in the sample, they were mostly evident only in more succesful ones. In addition, product market dependency had a positive impact on departmentalformalization in more successful units. Implications of the findings for research on dependence-structure relationships are discussed.

Title: Toward an Employee Responsibilities and Rights Paradigm
Author-Name: Yg. Chimezie A. B. Osigweh
Abstract: Current changes in the nature of the workforce, organizational structures, and institutions of society underlie the considerable, and growing, worldwide orientation toward a workplace responsibilities and rights paradigm. Analysis of the moral, legal, bureaucratic, and social construction of reality literature provides a broad definition of rights and responsibilities based on (a) the basic injunction to do no harm, (b) the obligatory character of rights, and (c) the reciprocal nature of workplace interrelationships. Further, the article analyzes in detail the development of rights-responsibilities concerns in modern workplaces. It identifies some major characteristics of employee! employer responsibilities and rights, and also provides a scheme for studying, understanding, and organizing knowledge in the emerging field underscored by the notions of responsibilities and rights. The underlying paradigm suggested by the article can be understood in terms of two dimensions: Focus are (e.g., organizational en...

Title: Humor, Power, and Change in Organizations
Author-Name: Tom Dwyer
Abstract: This paper analyzes joking relationships that are targeted at persons or at those affairs which actors interpret as representing persons. A theory of social relations of work is outlined; the literature illustrates that joking relationships have a content that reflects these relations. The form of joking relationships is then analyzed using Caplow's triad theory; this theory allows humor to be seen as a product of power relations and the contesting of these. The theory claims to be able to predict the likelihood of joking relationships between actors of various degrees of power, and the consequences of these, conservative, revolutionary, or improper for the organization. Jokes are analyzed in terms of the theory. Humor analysis can, in a complementary reasoning, be seen as a methodological tool that helps unmask organizational power relations. A number of reflections are drawn about humor in organizations subject to post-industrial change. Humor has no essence; it is inserted into the dynamics of social l...

Title: A Reexamination of Autonomy in Light of New Manufacturing Practices
Author-Name: Janice A. Klein
Abstract: Individual and/or group autonomy have long been considered critical dimensions of job design in participative work settings. Autonomy has typically been defined as discretion over pace of work and work methods (Hackman & Oldham, 1980), and in an effort to provide autonomy, buffers have traditionally been inserted into the work flow to break task interdependencies. The use of such buffers, however, runs counter to today's new manufacturing practices of just-in-time (JIT) inventory and standardized work. This paper, therefore, examines the effects of introducing such practices on levels of autonomy in different operations. In mature sociotechnical plants where employees have become accustomed to independent decision making, the introduction of process controls can diminish individual autonomy. But, there is an opportunity to exchange individual decision making with a form of collective autonomy which is limited to task design as opposed to task execution. Furthermore, individuals can still retain autonomy i...

Abstract: This article examines the relationship between the organizational structure and ideology of the psychiatric system and the daily actions and subjective experiences of psychiatric nurses. It presents empirical data from an in-depth case study in which psychiatric nurses attempt to deal with the stresses of their work by developing various collective coping strategies which eventually become embedded in the daily routines of the institution, intensifying the very problems they were originally intended to solve. The article is divided into three main sections. The first section examines recent sociological theorizing concerning the contradictory role of the psychiatric system within modern society. The second section presents empirical data illustrating the ways in which the structural contradictions of the psychiatric sector affect the daily lives of all who participate in the system, while the final section discusses the need for organizational level interventions to relieve occupational stress in welfare ...

Title: Switching Cognitive Gears: From Habits of Mind to Active Thinking
Author-Name: Meryl Reis Louis
Author-Name: Robert I. Sutton
Abstract: The phrase "switching cognitive gears" is used to call attention to the fact that cognitive functioning involves the capacity to shift between cognitive modes, from automatic processing to conscious engagement and back again. Effectiveness may be as much a function of an actor's capacity to sense when a switch is appropriate, as to process in one or another mode. In this paper the authors develop a perspective on the switch from automatic to active thinking and the conditions that provoke it. They apply the perspective to work settings and identify types of situations in which actors are expected to switch from habits of mind to active thinking. They propose further work to develop a framework for understanding the switch from active thinking to automatic.

Title: Close Coupling in Work-Family Relationships: Making and Implementing Decisions in a New Family Business and at Home
Author-Name: Allan W. Wicker
Author-Name: Kim A. Burley
Abstract: This research examined the relative influence of husbands and wives in decisions concerning several activities that occur in both the home and the business. Ratings by 24 women who with their husbands had recently opened a retail or service establishment indicated that influence was significantly related to (1) setting (wives had more influence at home), (2) activity (wives had most influence in decisions about division of labor), and (3) particular setting-activity combinations. Such a differential pattern of influence may reflect a way of resolving conflicting norms of equality and husband dominance. Additional findings suggest the operation of an equity norm: Wives' influence at home and in the business varied according to the number of hours they worked, and according to whether the business was "gender typed." Qualitative data indicated that couples rarely discussed division of labor in either setting, although this issue was a frequent source of family tension. Two years later, most of the responden...

Title: Psychoanalysis, Psychosis, and Postmodernism

Abstract: Postmodernist accounts of culture have referred to psychoanalytic descriptions of psychosis to support their claim that psychosis provides a model of contemporary personal experiences. In some cases, such as "schizoanalysis," this has led to a celebration of psychosis as a revolutionary process. This article examines these claims through a reading of the descriptions of psychosis given by Lacan and Bion, and argues that while some aspects of modernity are resonant of psychotic processes, psychosis remains a pathological state.

Abstract: The paper examines temporal aspects of organization. It argues that a major element of human socialization is the structuring of time-sense within formal organizations. Notable here is the process whereby family, school, and workplace teach us rigid time disciplines. These institutions segment activities into precise temporal units and condition us to an "organized" time-consciousness. This conditioning sees us subscribe to times which are external and specialized. The paper argues that in industrial societies, the external and highly specialized organization has become not only the main regulator of time, but also its primary claimant.

Title: A Study in Economic Psychology: Children's Saving in a Play Economy

Abstract: Economic Psychology extends the study of psychology and, in this case, the investigation of the socialization process in the economic realm. Thirty children, ten each aged 6, 9, and 12, took part in a "play economy" which consisted of four adjoining rooms, representing opportunities to save (one room was a "bank") or temptation to spend, e.g., another room contained a sweet shop with real sweets. Children were given 90 tokens over the period of the game and had to save 70 in order to purchase a desired toy which had been chosen at the outset. This study was designed as an extension of an earlier one which used a more restricted environment (a board game). The results took two forms: (1) a simple analysis of the "success" rates of children in terms of their saving, and (2) the recording of children's own constructions of the play economy and of savings behavior, based on their verbal accounts and explanations. While the results showed a predictable pattern of increased understanding of savings (especially ...

Abstract: Hazardous waste is seen as a major environmental issue by the American public, yet the social and environmental problems created by the high levels of generation and accumulation of this waste have not been seriously addressed. In this paper, it is shown that the relationship between social/ecological performance and the production of hazardous waste is a commons. A focus on this dynamic of the hazardous waste domain is essential to the elimination, reduction, and disposal of waste. Current organizational strategies for addressing the conflict between performance and production are reviewed., The strengths and limits of attempting to maintain both adequate health/environmental protection and economic growth through joint organization of the principal actors from government, business, environmental, and other organizations is examined.

Abstract: This study investigated changes in union, organizational, and dual commitment among 267 faculty of a public university in the U.S. over a 6.5-month period (from the beginning of contract negotiations to contract settlement). Specifically, it was hypothesized that labor-management relationship climate, union involvement, perceived pay equity, and the implementation of a multi-tier salary plan would differentially affect faculty members' commitment levels. In addition, three established methods of measuring dual commitment were utilized to assess their convergent validity. Results indicated that organizational commitment and, in some cases, dual commitment increased over the time period. Further, the correlational and classification methods of measuring dual commitment detected changes in commitment, while Angle and Perry's (1986) five-item dual commitment scale was found to have questionable reliability and validity.

Abstract: A modified version of a process model of psychological burnout proposed by Cherniss (1980) was used to study the relationship between job satisfaction and burnout. The research involved a secondary analysis of longitudinal data collected from 245 school-based educators from a single Board of Education. The results showed that negative work setting characteristics and marital dissatisfaction were associated with greater work stressors, which in turn were associated with increased burnout, which in turn resulted in decreased job satisfaction. When the longitudinal design was employed, psychological burnout appeared to have a causal relationship to job satisfaction, not vice versa.

Abstract: A firm's competitive strategy is implemented through the day-to-day actions taken and decisions made at the operating level of the firm. The purpose of this research was to address three questions: (1) in what areas do marketing and manufacturing groups within the same firm tend to disagree, (2) do marketing and manufacturing groups tend to support the postures traditionally associated with their departments, and (3) does use of written strategic plans and MBO linked to performance appraisal encourage a common strategic vision. Investigation of the areas of disagreement indicated that differences were firm-specific rather than representative of fundamental differences between marketing and manufacturing groups. Agreement between groups was significantly higher in those firms where marketing and manufacturing managers perceived that written strategic plans and MBO linked to performance appraisal were relied on frequently.

Title: History as a Mode of Inquiry in Organizational Life: A Role for Human Cosmogony
Author-Name: Frank J. Barrett
Author-Name: Suresh Srivastval
Abstract: Inquiry into social and organizational life has been characterized predominantly by a structural-functionalist orientation, following the influence of sociologists such as Talcott Parsons. While this orientation has produced a great deal of knowledge and insight in the field of organizational theory, there are ways in which this orientation has led to unintentional consequences. The structural-functionalist orientation tends to generate a snapshot approach to research by focusing on the givenness of social structures and in so doing, adds to a sense of reification of organizational processes. Organizational life is a socially constructed reality. This is easily forgotten because by nature, social institutions begin to degenerate into recipe knowledge for its members, and original meanings and intentions that once guided social arrangements get lost. This paper proposes that we need a methodology which attempts to capture the historicity and continuity of organizational life, and the contingencies and deci...

Abstract: Eight summary dimensions of psychological climate, i.e., autonomy, trust, cohesiveness, pressure, support, recognition, fairness, and innovation, were derived from over 80 differently labeled dimensions reported in the literature. Five item scales of each summary dimension were developed and tested in a sample (n = 367) of managerial employees. Coefficients alpha for the scales ranged from 0.80-0.89. When the 40 items were submitted to a factor analysis with an oblique rotation, eight factors were produced, generally corresponding to the eight summary dimensions. These results were validated by using a separate sample (n 84) of managerial and professional employees.

Abstract: We review the literature on the relationship between job satisfaction and life satisfaction on its theoretical, empirical, and methodological bases. Our review indicates that recent theoretical work is too often characterized by repeatedly confirming the spillover hypothesis to the exclusion of advancing further theoretical developments. The greater sophistication of statistical analyses is cited as one of the few recent methodological advances. Our review focuses on theoretical and methodological developments needed in future research. The areas of multiple links between job and life satisfactions, life stages, and satisfaction as a disposition are described as potential areas for theoretical advances. Methodologically, we suggest improvements by focusing attention on construct validity and the use of longitudinal designs.

Abstract: The 1960's and 1970's saw a mushrooming interest in research-based experiments with new forms of work organization. From the latter 1970's, this interest started to decline. When, today, new initiatives are taken to bring research back into the process of workplace restructuring, there is a need to analyze the experiences with the experimental-like projects of the past with a view to defining their limitations and seeing to what extent alternative strategies for change can be developed. Based on Scandinavian experience, the article contains a discussion of field experiments and related approaches, and outlines an alternative in terms of broadly oriented interactive change processes where human communication is the leading element rather than, i.e., a specific theory of design. Projects in mail centers are used as illustrations.

Title: Locus of Control as a Moderator of the Relationship Between Perceived Influence and Procedural Justice
Author-Name: Paul D. Sweeney
Author-Name: Dean B. McFarlin
Author-Name: John L. Cotton
Abstract: A survey of 172 employees of a consumer products manufacturing firm was used to test hypotheses about procedural justice. Some reviewers have noted that perceptions of procedural justice are enhanced by the degree of perceived influence workers have in decision making. However, not all research on this topic is consistent. We suggest that the perceived influence-procedural justice relation may be moderated by an employee's locus of control orientation. Our data support this hypothesis. Perceived influence was more likely to lead to perceptions of procedural justice for internals than externals. Implications of these results are discussed.

Title: Interdisciplinary Teams and the Control of Clients: A Sociotechnical Perspective
Author-Name: Eli Teram
Abstract: The literature on interdisciplinary teams discusses the relations between professionals independently of issues related to client processing. With a sociotechnical perspective, this paper examines how interdisciplinary work may well generate increased opportunities for unwarranted client control. A case example from the services for the mentally handicapped demonstrates how team members from vocational and residential programs "pool" control mechanisms in a way that compromises their primary organizational goals; such pooling may be a phenomenon that occurs in other fields too. Sociotechnical concepts elucidate how interprofessional relations affect and are affected by client-worker interactions, suggesting stricter criteria for evaluating technically-required cooperation in settings where the control of clients is an important contingency for workers. It is also argued that administrators should monitor team decisions, in particular those related to which clients cross what organizational boundaries, whe...

Title: Mastery and Frequency of Managerial Behaviors Relative to Sub-unit Effectiveness
Author-Name: Frank Shipper
Abstract: This research was undertaken in response to a review which called for a behavioral approach to the study of leadership. The subjects of the study were the managers of sub-units in a hospital. Eleven managerial behaviors were assessed using their subordinates as untrained observers, and behaviorally-anchored questionnaires. Effectiveness was assessed by industrial engineering measures of performance and employee attitude. The results indicate that managers of sub-units of high and low morale and/or performance exhibited significantly different levels of mastery of managerial behaviors. In contrast, no differences in frequency of managerial behaviors were observed for either high or low morale units, and only one managerial behavior was observed to be significantly more frequent for managers of high and low performing units. Whereas, higher frequency of managerial behaviors was found, overall, to be associated with low and not high performing sub-units.

Title: The Signifier and the Group
Author-Name: Susan Long
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the idea of the group as a signifying chain. Group elements, e.g., roles, subgroups, group episodes, and social acts, are viewed as signifiers open to particular significations each of which may be represented within the imaginary history of the group, i.e., in particular people and events. This theoretical position is arrived at via an application of Lacan's ideas to implications drawn from an examination of Freud's works on narcissism and group psychology. To Freud, the group is bound together by narcissistic identifications among the members who have each incorporated important aspects of the leader into his/her ego-ideal. The myth of the primal horde exemplifies this basic group structure. Taking this myth as a basis for further hypotheses about groups, this paper argues for differential member identifications with the leader. These differential identifications seem to be the imaginary effects of the signifying chain (group structure) that is anchored by the central signif...

Abstract: Critical deficiencies in the coverage of existing selection interview research are noted, and the paucity of studies into interviewer impression formation admonished. Perceptual links between candidate non-verbal behavior (NVB) and interviewer impressions of personality are examined in an experimental study of interviewer impression formation. Subjects (n = 68) reviewed four videotaped vignettes of the opening stages of a graduate recruitment interview where candidate NVB was manipulated using a 2 x 2 factorial design. Contrary to existing social psychological research, results indicate that subject interviewers were able to recognize experimental changes in candidate NVB. Furthermore, multiple regression analyses revealed that subjects' impressions of candidate personality were substantially linearly dependent upon the facial-area NVBs of eye contact and positive facial expressions. Evaluations of eye contact fundamentally determined perceptions of competence and strength of character, while positiveness...

Title: Career Commitment in Human Service Professionals: A Biographical Study
Author-Name: Cary Cherniss
Abstract: Twenty-five human service professionals were studied at two points in time: during the first year of their careers and 12 years later. Questionnaires and in-depth biographical interviews were used to gather data aobut the Ss' careers and personal lives. Quantitative analyses indicated that age, attitude toward life, and job satisfaction were positively correlated with career commitment. Marrieds were significantly more committed than singles, and career changers were less committed to their present careers than were those who had not changed careers. Qualitative analysis identified several other factors that might enhance career commitment, including a challenging work experience before entering the present career, positive professional development experiences, supportive organizational climates, and interesting work. The results were used to develop a theoretical model of career commitment in which professional self-efficacy plays a central role.

Author-Name: J. C. Munene
Abstract: The focus of this study is on the effect of institutional envioronment on organizational decision making in an African state. Three empirical studies were conducted consecutively in Nigeria. The first one provided the instrument for the subsequent studies. The instrument, containing 26 items, was factor analyzed in the second and third studies. In the second, four interpretable factors were identified where a factor containing items concerning the exchange environment accounted for the largest variance. The other factors measured aspects of the institutional environment. In the third study, a similar configuration of item clusters was obtained, though consistency was most observed in the factor measuring the exchange environment. This was taken as evidence for the validity of the exchange environment as well as the reliability of items used to measure it. Three characteristics define this environment. The first is transactional failure or the failure to take possession of a service or good already paid fo...

Title: The Group and the Shadow: Explorations and Echoes of Relatedness in a Small Study Group Setting
Author-Name: Russell Forrest
Abstract: An account of the experience of work with four small study groups at the Scottish Institute of Human Relations in Edinburgh is presented using a method of group analysis recording previously reported by Bennis and Shepard (1956). The aim of the groups was to provide the members with an opportunity to study overt and covert processes involved in developing group membership. The consultant's framework refers to Bridger (1980) and is related to the work of Bion (1961), Foulkes (1964), and Anzieu (1984). The paper argues that there are three distinct phases in group life in a narrative structure. These are discussed within a wide range of theoretical constructs, from developmental studies of infants (Stern, 1985), quantum physics (Bohm, 1980), anthropology (Leach, 1983), mythology (Levi Strauss, 1986), and analytical psychology (Jung, 1964). It is concluded that the individual search in groups for personal and social meaning helps to make manifest certain universal and recurring themes.

Title: Value Congruence and Satisfaction with a Leader: An Examination of the Role of Interaction
Author-Name: Bruce M. Meglino
Author-Name: Elizabeth C. Ravlin
Author-Name: Cheryl L. Adkins
Abstract: Organizations are increasing their use of sophisticated techniques, including video, to communicate with employees. They are also relying more on the use of "stories" and "legends" about leaders as a way of reinforcing their culture. An important issue in both of these trends is the relationship between the actions or behavior of the leader as depicted in the story or message and the values of the individuals who are the target of the story or message. This study examined this issue as it related to interpersonal affect. Sixty-three banking executives, 61 evening MBA students, and 102 full-time undergraduate students completed a work values survey and later viewed one of two video-taped presentations of leadership behavior. Results showed that congruence between a subject's values and the rated values of a leader was associated with greater anticipated satisfaction with the leader. This effect did not depend on the uncertainty of the leader's behavior, but seemed to be contingent on the subject having had...

Title: Antecedents to Cross-Cultural Adjustment for Expatriates in Pacific Rim Assignments
Author-Name: J. Stewart Black
Author-Name: Hal B. Gregersen
Abstract: Although past studies of expatriate adjustment have asked human resource executives their opinions about important antecedents of cross-cultural adjustment (e.g., Tung, 1981, 1988), very few studies have attempted to empirically determine which factors significantly affect cross-cultural adjustment based on data collected from actual expatriate managers. This paper examines the impact of job, personal, and general factors on three facets of cross-cultural adjustment based on data collected from American expatriate managers in Pacific Rim assignments (Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan). The results of the study indicate that different antecedents were related to different facets of cross cultural adjustment. Both research and practical implications of these findings are explored.

Title: An Assessment of Extrinsic Feedback on Participation, Role Perceptions, Motivation, and Job Satisfaction in a Self-Managed System for Monitoring Group Achievement
Author-Name: C. A. L. Pearson
Abstract: A longitudinal field experiment was conducted to examine a participative scheme for measuring productivity and some of the system outcomes. In addition to evaluating the robustness of the participative monitoring system, the impact of extrinsic feedback on participation, role indices, motivation, productivity, and job satisfaction was assessed. It was reported by subjects of 76 geographically-dispersed maintenance groups of a State railway that extraneous feedback had a significant influence on role ambiguity, motivation, job satisfaction, and productivity, and a number of the variable causal paths. However, contrary to predictions, which were based mainly on correlational research, substantially lower role stress levels were not encountered after the participative scheme was installed. The results are discussed.

Title: Predictors and Moderators of Employee Responses to Employee Participation Programs

Author-Name: Anil Verma
Abstract: This paper explores mechanisms that help account for the relationship between individual involvement in employee participation programs and variations in affective responses to such programs. Proximity to and duration of members' involvement in participation programs are investigated, as are two potential moderating factors: organizational citizenship propensity, and individual discontent with the extent of worker participation in decision making. Proximity and duration both are associated with increased liking of employee participation programs in this study. The positive association is enhanced for those low in organizational citizenship or high in discontent. Implications of these findings for the creation and management of employee participation programs are discussed. Directions for future research are also suggested.

Abstract: The present study investigated factors influencing voluntary organization members' engaging in a specific extra-role behavior, participation in a telethon, on behalf of their organizations. Affective organizational commitment was hypothesized to mediate the relationship between intrinsic satisfaction and the voluntarism criterion, and organization purpose (service vs. non-service) and organization membership size were hypothesized to moderate the relationship between commitment and voluntarism. PROBIT regression analyses indicated that affective commitment explained the voluntarism effects of intrinsic satisfaction. The effect of commitment on voluntarism was found to occur only among service organizations. Although it did not moderate the effect of commitment, size was negatively related to voluntarism.

Abstract: The present study investigated several potential antecedents and consequences of emotional exhaustion in a sample (N = 859) of computer-monitored telephone reservation agents. The agents performed their tasks in an environment characterized by tight managerial control and relatively little decision-making latitude. The results of regression analyses indicated that job satisfaction, job-related tension, age, and tenure on the job were each uniquely associated with reports of exhaustion. Exhaustion was, in turn, significantly related to intentions to leave, absenteeism, and actual job change. Supplemental causal modeling of the data using LISREL VI suggested that the implied causal linkages between emotional exhaustion and these outcomes provided a reasonable, albeit imprecise representation of the data.

Abstract: The mentor/protege relationship can be conceptualized within the context of biological dimorphism with sex roles reflecting different reproductive strategies that evolved by natural selection. Mentor/protege roles mimic the male/female mating roles in humans, often causing conflicts that are seldom understood within the limited context of mentoring. This article examines similarities in reproductive strategies and mentoring in terms of demographics, selection criteria, and acquisition strategies. Underlying sexual themes are identified and their impact on the mentor/protege relationship discussed, along with implications and directions for future research.

Title: Overt Funding, Buried Goals, and Moral Turnover: The Organizational Transformation of Radical Experiments
Author-Name: Len Holmes
Author-Name: Margaret Grieco
Abstract: Over recent years, there has been a growth in the development of organizational initiatives by local community groups, particularly those espousing radical values and goals. However, often these groups must obtain funding from more powerful sponsors, usually national or local government agencies. In order to obtain such funding, the community organizations must disguise their founding values and goals which are contradictory to the understanding upon which public policy is based. The resulting tension between public and covert goals leads to turnover of personnel subscribing to founding values, and thus to transformation of the organization away from radical intent. This paper analyzes this process in the case of two major radical organizational experiments.

Author-Name: Jacques Delacroix
Author-Name: Shahrokh M. Saudagaran
Abstract: We review the scholarly literature and report that there exists no convincing link between CEO compensation on the one hand and either CEO performance or company performance on the other. We report further that neither market processes nor a lottery-like process account for the systematic difference between the remunerations of CEOs in the US and in other industrialized countries. Based on the observation that CEO mega-compensations are not taxed out of existence although they seem to violate common social norms of equity, we speculate that such compensations must serve a mythical social function. We propose that, baffled by the non-hierarchical nature of our economic system, Americans use high CEO compensation as evidence that someone is in charge. Finally, we argue that the current very high levels of CEO compensation may be counterproductive because they protect CEOs from the material consequences of their bad performance.

Title: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Analyzing the Managerial Gender Gap
Author-Name: Kathleen Cannings
Abstract: In analyzing the sources of female-male earnings differences, this paper goes beyond the narrow focus of human-capital theory with its view that the only relevant productive attributes of individuals is their cognitive capabilities. Using a unique firm-level Canadian data set on managerial employees and a "social model" of earnings that includes behavioral and organizational as well as cognitive variables, the paper estimates the determinants of earnings differences in general and the gender gap in particular. The statistical analysis reveals that, for all employees in the sample, experience with the company has a significant positive impact on earnings while a reluctance to leave the company has a negative impact. As for the gender gap, the analysis reveals that the earnings of women are penalized by their disproportionate responsibilities for work in their family homes.

Title: Change in the Small Group: A Dissipative Structure Perspective
Author-Name: Charles Smith
Author-Name: Gary Gemmill
Abstract: In living systems that are experiencing highly turbulent conditions, dissipative self-organization sometimes takes place and results in greater viability. The potential applications of the paradigm of dissipative self-organization to the study of change dynamics in small groups are explored. A certain type of change in groups is likened to change in dissipative structures found in the physical world, and group effectiveness amid complex and turbulent environments is seen to require the key elements of dissipative self-organization: an ongoing tolerance for error and for deviation from an established order, a breaking of existing system relationships so that new ones may emerge, a reflective, self-referencing mode, and a creative process of boundary reparation and movement into new configurations. Lewin's model of change in social systems is extended here through the application of the self-organization paradigm. Instead of utilizing Lewin's formulation of a discrete movement through phases, the emphasis i...

This paper discusses the impact of the medical model in stress research and explores the extent to which it has constrained the design, implementation, and evaluation of stress management interventions. It is suggested that psychologically compatible models such as systems theory may provide a more fruitful basis for development and research and a focus for collaboration between occupational and clinical psychologists.

Title: Organizational Citizenship: A Review, Proposed Model, and Research Agenda
Author-Name: Mel Schnake
Abstract: Organizational citizenship was recently proposed as a form of job performance which may be more strongly related to job satisfaction than performance measures employed in previous job satisfaction-job performance research. However organizational citizenship holds more promise for organizational behavior research than merely its relationship to job satisfaction. Organ (1988a) argues that organizational citizenship, in the aggregate, promotes the effective functioning of the organization. Citizenship is defined as "supra-role behavior," that is, behavior which goes beyond formal job descriptions but which is desired by an organization (Organ, 1988a). Examples include helping co-workers who fall behind in task performance, keeping a work area clean, accepting temporary assignments without complaint, volunteering for tasks that are not assigned, and making suggestions which will improve the department (Bateman & Organ, 1983; Smith, Organ & Near, 1983).

Abstract: This is our hope: to sketch the conceptual outlines for an expanded field of inquiry into the organization dimension of global change more clearly, coherently, and urgently than has been done before. Today, a vital and pioneering latticework of global social change organizations (GSCO) is spreading across continents, involving people from every nation, in an unprecedented attempt to forge a new vision of the world's cooperative capacity. The people-centered GSCO, we submit, is one of the more important social innovations of the past half-century and is one of the greatest unrecognized resources in the world today. In spite of its rapid proliferation in number, scope, and planetary significance, the GSCO has been largely overlooked in leading organizational and administrative science journals of the discipline. An expanded focus to include "the organization dimension of global change" will, we believe, open up exciting vistas of learning and will compel changes in our current theories of human organization...

Title: The Old and New Transnationalism: An Evolutionary Perspective
Author-Name: Elise Boulding
Abstract: The concept of axial ages, when civilizations are exploring new terrains, interacting in a sustained way with strangers, and imaging the other and better, is used to trace the development of transnationalism through the ages. The problem of asymmetric contact between colonizers and colonized, historically and in the present, limits the two-way dialogue and learning processes that give rise to great periods of civilization flowering. Twentieth century global social change organizations (GSCOs) not limited by state interests and national boundaries, are helping to open up the two-way learning process and inspire new visions of possible futures for the whole of humankind. In particular, it is proposed that GSCOs are one of the most important vehicles in existence for crafting the world civic culture. The article concludes with several propositions for future research regarding the core contributions of GSCOs. These contributions are: (1) providing society with longer-term time horizons and visions; (2) lobby...

Title: Bridging Organizations and Sustainable Development
Author-Name: L. David Brown
Abstract: In many developing countries, sustainable social and economic development depends on creating effective local organizations, horizontal linkages across sectors, and vertical linkages that enable grassroots influence on national policy-making. This paper examines the role of "bridging organizations" in creating such institutional arrangements. Examples of bridging organizations and their constituencies of various types (associations, networks, cross-sectoral partnerships, political coalitions, social movements) are described. On the basis of these examples, it is argued that bridging organizations and their constituent networks are shaped by values and visions, their tasks, member diversity, and external threats. The cases suggest that bridging organizations can play key roles in building local organizations, creating horizontal linkages, increasing grassroots influence on policy, and disseminating new visions and organizational innovations. Finally the paper argues that bridging organizations are central ...

Title: The Leader as a Broker of Dreams
Author-Name: Lessey Sooklal
Abstract: The paper presents a grounded theory which explains how a personal vision becomes enacted into reality within a corporate arena. This enactment process is defined as leadership. The theory suggests that leadership is a political process. For enactment to occur in a manner which is engaging and inspirational, the leader must design and maintain through, patterned interactions, a support system. The interactions are brokerage transactions in which the leader modifies and clarifies intentions in response to technical, social, and environmental concerns expressed through exchanges with members of this support system. As this happens the leader matures. Vision also becomes converted into a social dream which is scripted for the purpose of implementation.

Title: Turning Facts into Stories and Stories into Facts: A Hermeneutic Exploration of Organizational Folklore
Author-Name: Yiannis Gabriel
Abstract: This paper analyzes three organizational stories which the author encountered in different work and military organizations. Each story reveals a dual structure, a recital, which varies in different accounts, and a common core, referred to here as the myth. These myths are seen as collective fantasies, fulfilling shared desires and offering either opportunities for cathartic discharge or a partial inoculation against misfortune. It is argued that the meanings of organizational myths are neither transparent nor unambiguous, often expressing ambivalent and contradictory wishes and permitting different or competing interpretations. The three myths discussed in this paper were all found to be symbolic means of turning passivity into activity, powerlessness into control, and of offering consolations against pain and suffering.

Title: The Frequency of Self-Limiting Behavior in Groups: A Measure and an Explanation
Author-Name: John F. Veigal
Abstract: This study sought to develop a valid and reliable measure of the frequency with which individuals choose to engage in self-limiting behavior in groups, i.e., behavior that reduces the individual's influence on or contribution to the performance of a work group's task. In addition, this study explored under what general conditions managers perceive they are most inclined to engage in self-limiting behavior when they are members of a task group. Based on in-depth interviews of managers and executives, and a relevant literature search, 45 conditional statements were developed to encompass the most commonly cited reasons for engaging in self-limiting behavior. Utilizing these statements, a reliable and valid instrument was developed to measure the frequency with which managers perceive themselves engaging in self-limiting behavior. Factor analysis revealed that there were six underlying conditions which precipitate self-limiting behavior on the part of a group member: (1) an indifferent group climate, (2) an ...

Title: On the Rocky Road to the First Global Civilization
Author-Name: Howard V. Perlmutter
Abstract: Because the main arenas of our world society have become more multidimensionally interdependent, we postulated (1) the emergence of the first global civilization, (2) that leaders and their constituencies due to national transparency around the world are beginning to recognize the axiological unpreparedness of their international, national, and local institutions for this kind of civilization, and (3) that a new social architecture for these organizations is needed that fits better with this emerging civilization. The core proposition of this paper goes beyond the assertion that civilization is reaching global coherence. The first global civilization, it is proposed, has a thematic pattern or development valence towards a social architectural mindset based on symbiotic societal (Paradigm S) values related to but distinctive from both industrial (Paradigm I) and de-industrial values (Paradigm D). We find evidence for three theories of the future of global civilization which we call: Homogenizing Westerniza...

Title: The Structural Imperatives of International Advocacy Associations
Author-Name: Dennis R. Young
Abstract: Recent decades have witnessed a significant increase in the number of voluntary, nonprofit associations established to address solutions to major international social problems such as threats to world peace, environmental pollution, illness and disease, social injustice, and poverty. Many of these associations are based in a single country, but others are international in scope. This paper is concerned with the latter. While rapid progress in communications and transportation technology has undoubtedly facilitated the development of these associations, such organizations still face formidable barriers to effective operation including those of language and cultural differences, political separation, interferences with free trade and interchange across national borders, and remaining costs and problems of long distance communication and travel. It is the thesis of this paper that international, voluntary associations which advocate for solutions to global issues are successful when they adopt particular org...

Title: Network Relations and Loss of Organizational Autonomy
Author-Name: Christine Oliver
Abstract: A fundamental premise of resource dependence theory is that organizations tend to avoid interorganizational relations which com- promise their autonomy. This study examined the frequency with which organizations in a population established interorganizational relationships as a function of five different types of network relations that varied in the degree to which they required organizations to relinquish autonomy. The findings failed to support the assumption that organizational independence is a primary consideration in the decision to establish or forego interorganizational relations.

Abstract: Evidence will be presented of the impact of the assessment and selection techniques used in a management development program in a major UK financial services organization. The assessment techniques involved are situational interviews and two different assessment centers. Drawing on a questionnaire study of 141 managers, data are presented concerning the impact of such techniques on organizational commitment and job and career withdrawal cognitions. The results suggest that assessment procedures and decisions have some impact on candidates' post-assessment attitude to the organization and their intention to leave their jobs and careers. The article also presents data on the reactions of the participants to the selection and assessment process. A preliminary theoretical view of the impact process is presented and discussed.

Title: Career Orientations in Women from Rural and Urban Backgrounds

Abstract: This study examines career orientations in women from rural and urban backgrounds, using a longitudinal data set collected over a period of 10 years, from 1973-1982. When first contacted, respondents were 18 years of age. The final data collection in 1982 resulted in a sample of some 1300 women. The longitudinal data was analyzed using LISREL structural equation modeling and was guided by a theoretical framework developed by Krumboltz (1981), which focuses on the process of decision-making. The theory attempts to explain how educational and occupational preferences and skills are acquired and how selections of courses, occupations and fields of work are made and identifies the interactions of genetic factors, environmental conditions, learning experiences, cognitive and emotional responses, and performance skills that produce movement along one career path or another. Results from the study found that there were some differences between women of contrasting geographic background over the secondary school-...

Title: Bob Geldof and Live Aid: The Affective Side of Global Social Innovation
Author-Name: Frances Westley
Abstract: This paper examines the case of Bob Geldof and Live Aid from the point of view of the relationship between visionary leadership and global social innovation. It briefly reviews the case. It then analyzes it in terms of four aspects of visionary leadership: the personal background of the visionary, the skills used in enacting the vision, the structural context in which the visionary operates, and the historical moment in which the visionary acts. It further reviews music as a symbolic system with powerful abilities to mobilize affect. It concludes that Geldof succeeded in initiating global action through the skillful juxtaposition of structures and processes from the music industry to the aid context and by the equally skillful linking of the affect generated by popular music with that generated by famine imagery to trigger philanthropic activity among consumers of popular music.

Title: Global Social Change: A New Agenda for Social Science?
Author-Name: David L. Cooperrider
Author-Name: William A. Pasmore
Abstract: That the world is undergoing a major transformation in social consciousness is now widely accepted. Never before has the world been witness to so many thousands of attempts by individuals and transnational organizations to combat age-old social ills such as hunger, poverty, disease, lack of education, human rights abuses, armed conflict, and environmental degradation. The 1990's will be known as the decade of global social innovation, and whoever chronicles that decade will see clearly what we perceive only dimly now. The emergence of global social consciousness has, in turn, produced new forms of human relationships and organizing activities. These relationships and activities may prove to be important to understand as the social sciences attempt to keep pace with the rapid changes occurring in our global society. This paper outlines some of the challenges and opportunities that will face social scientists should they choose to enter this new domain.

Abstract: A qualitative laboratory research design is used to study coalition formation within the simulated context of a formal organization. The scenario used focuses on an issue shown to produce political activity: executive succession. A content analytic approach was used to analyze the ideas, perceptions, and actions of the participants as reported by themselves. Results indicate that the process of coalition formation involves a much wider range of concerns, objectives, and interconnected behaviors than suggested by previous research on coalition formation. These are presented and implications for future research and theory building are discussed.

Title: Assessing Self-Appraisal of Job Performance as an Evaluation Device: Are the Poor Results a Function of Method or Methodology?
Author-Name: Mark John Somers

Abstract: Self-appraised job performance was studied in relation to supervisory ratings under those conditions in which self-evaluation is most likely to predict performance outcomes (Mabe & West, 1982). In contrast to previous research, there was no evidence of leniency error or restriction of range in self-appraised job performance. Convergence between self- and supervisory ratings was also evident, and was interpreted in light of the presence of halo error.

Title: Effects of Supervisor Age and Subordinate Age on Rating Congruence

Abstract: Although increasing numbers of older employees are in the workforce, little research has focused on the relationship between age and both self- and supervisory performance ratings. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of supervisor and subordinate age on the level of agreement between self- and supervisory ratings. The sample consisted of 35 male and 35 female assemblers and their supervisors. Results across dimensions did not show consistent effects for any of the independent variables. The results suggest that age bias may not apply exclusively to older workers and may only be associated with selected performance dimensions.

Author-Name: James R. Larson, Jr.
Abstract: Recent theoretical statements by Lord and Hanges (1987) and by Carver and Scheier (1981) suggest that supervision in the workplace can be analyzed as a control system made up of supervisors and subordinates. Two experiments are described which raise doubts about this claim. Subjects were engaged as supervisors and asked to provide performance feedback to a subordinate. It was found that subjects did not respond to subordinate work performance in the straightforward way predicted by control theory, but instead responded based on analyses of the context-dependent meanings of that performance. Implications of these results for applying the control system metaphor to social behavior in the workplace more generally are discussed.

Title: Creating a Family in the Workplace
Author-Name: Howell S. Baum
Abstract: Modern service work in bureaucratic organizations requires possibilities for acting aggressively in intimate relationships without anxiety. This article describes a local planning agency where staff created a “family” to solve these problems. Staff members originally created family activities to structure intimacy under intense working conditions. Simultaneously, they negotiated room for these activities in the bureaucracy. Consciously and unconsciously, they designed the family so as to transform organizational authority into family relationships, as well as to exclude Oedipal and sibling conflicts that are normally part of families. The departmental family eventually foundered on a changing reality: increasing individual and racial competition over promotions, as well as the departure of the family “father.” The case offers lessons for modern, bureaucratic service work.

Title: Differences in Employee Attitudes and Behaviors Based on Rotter's (1966)                 Internal-External Locus of Control: Are They All Valid?
Author-Name: Robert W. Renn
Author-Name: Robert J. Vandenberg
Abstract: Rotter's (1966) Internal-External Locus of Control (LOC) has been widely used to explain differences in many employee attitudes and behaviors. A review of organization studies employing Rotter's LOC scale reveals, however, that researchers used different strategies for classifying employees as “internals” and “externals,” and different statistical techniques and research designs to test hypothesized internal-external (I-E) differences. The present study examined the influence these variations in research method and design have on expected (I-E) differences in a blue-collar and a professional sample. Results showed that findings regarding expected 1-E differences varied by research method and design and were more likely to be supported: (1) when they were tested with I-E subgroups formed with only employees scoring at the extremes on Rotter's LOC scale, (2) when they were examined in a cross-sectional rather than a longitudinal research design, (3) when they were based on self-report rather than behavioral...

Title: Transorganizational Development in Urban Policy Coalitions
Author-Name: David W. Sink
Abstract: Transorganizational Development (TD) is a purposive, planned change strategy concerned with creating and improving the effectiveness of interorganizational coalitions. Unlike bounded, overorganized systems found within most organizations, coalitions frequently exhibit indefinite boundaries and underorganization. As such, they may demand more than the traditional organization development (OD) strategies to effect change. This research focuses on four social problem solving coalitions in an urban setting. Based on field research and a review of recent writings on TD and coalitions, a TD checklist was developed to guide change agents in dealing with coalitions. Borrowing from political science literature, we suggest that a “policy entrepreneur” may possess the centrality and purpose to serve as a TD intervener. Developing or increasing shared norms and values, and establishing predictable, regular structures, roles, and technologies are primary tasks of the policy entrepreneur/TD change agent.

Title: Lay Theories of Psychotherapy II: The Efficacy of Different Therapies and                 Prognosis for Different Problems

Author-Name: Zoe Wardley
Abstract: This study concerns the structure and correlates of lay people's perceptions of the efficacy of different types of “psychological” therapies and-the prognosis of various psychological problems. Two hundred lay people completed two questionnaires, the first examining their perceptions of the efficacy of 22 different types of psychological treatment. The second questionnaire required them to rate the perceived prognosis for 36 different and relative common psychological problems derived from (with definition) the DSM III. Both questionnaires had a relative simple and interpretable factor structure not dissimilar to that emerging from related studies. Although sex, age, and education of the subjects was related to their beliefs about both efficacy and prognosis, the best predictor was their experience of, and knowledge about psychology. These results are discussed in terms of the literature on lay theories of psychotherapy and treatment. Limitations of the study are also discussed.

Abstract: The present study examined the prevalence and consequences of Type A behavior among nurses working in eight hospitals in a large metropolitan Canadian city. Data were collected by means of structured questionnaires from 1148 nurses. The prevalence of Type A behavior in a number of subgroups based on sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, mother tongue, marital status, education, hours of work, seniority, and the number of previous nursing jobs in the last five years were examined. Age was the only sociodemographic variable significantly associated with Type A behavior. In terms of consequences, Type A nurses experienced significantly greater job, stress, role ambiguity, conflict, overload, and turnover cognition than Type B nurses. Type A nurses showed significantly higher job involvement, effort at job and attendance than Type B nurses. Type A and B nurses did not differ significantly on organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and promotion expectations. The moderating effects of age, marit...

Title: Strategic Decision-Making Tasks and Group Effectiveness: Insights from Theory and Research on Small Group Performance
Author-Name: Frances J. Milliken
Author-Name: David A. Vollrath
Abstract: Strategic decision-making is a critically important aspect of top managers' jobs. Although researchers have addressed the issue of how groups ought to be constructed to handle strategic decision making effectively, there has been little attention paid to the idea that different subtasks of the strategic decision-making process might have different task requirements. Research on small groups, however, shows that the nature of the task a group has to perform is a critical factor in determining the types of groups and group procedures that are likely to yield effective group performance. This paper analyzes the various tasks involved in strategic decision making and draws on small group research to suggest some hypotheses about how groups might be designed to enhance their effectiveness on each of these tasks. The analysis highlights the key role of managerial beliefs about the nature of strategic decision making.

Abstract: This study examines the influence of both calculative and moral involvement on the organizational commitment and task performance of a random sample of 121 direct-sales distributors. Based on data gathered from these distributors, organizational commitment is found to be positively related to distributor task performance. Similarly, calculative and moral involvement are found to be positively related to organizational commitment. While organizational commitment and calculative involvement are positively related to distributor task performance, there is a statistically significant negative relationship between moral involvement and distributor task performance. Results also indicate that, although time spent selling products is significantly related to successful distributor task performance, time spent personally recruiting new distributors is not related to successful distributor task performance. The results of the study support Etzioni's dual compliance structure hypothesis of organizational involvement.

Title: Gender Role Portrayal Analysis of Children's Television Programming in Japan
Author-Name: David R. Rolandelli
Abstract: Television viewing is a pervasive activity among Japanese children, yet little is known about the effects of television on their gender role attitudes and behaviors. One step in understanding television's contribution to such outcomes is to examine the messages conveyed through the medium directly and indirectly about gender role values. Unfortunately, most gender role analyses have ignored the programs most heavily viewed by Japanese children, namely, children's programming. In the current study, the gender role portrayals of 279 characters from a select sample of children's programs were analyzed. Results revealed that Japanese television programming for children is highly sex-typed. Males were overrepresented and were portrayed more often than females in professional occupations. Attributes descriptive of females were characteristic of relatively weak, younger, less mature individuals, while attributes descriptive of males were associated with powerful, older, likeable, mature persons. Males more than ...

Abstract: This article reports on a study of the relationship between motivation needs (achievement and power) and six measures of life success (status/wealth, contribution to society, professional fulfillment, family relationships, personal fulfillment, and security). Respondents were 756 full-time managerial and nonmanagerial service industry workers (439 women, 317 men) in the Southeast Florida area of the U.S. Results indicate that need for achievement is positively related to success strivings for status/wealth, professional fulfillment, and contribution to society. It is negatively related to personal fulfillment and security. Results also indicate that need for power is positively related to status/wealth and professional fulfillment, but negatively related to family relationships. Multiple regression analysis shows that type of work (managerial vs. nonmanagerial) is a significant predictor of both achievement and power needs. Implications are discussed.

Title: A Proportional Hazards Regression Analysis of Employee Turnover Among Nurses in New Zealand

Abstract: Research on employee turnover has usually relied on employment status (quitters vs. stayers) to index the criterion variable (turnover), and on multiple regression (MR) to model the turnover process. In the present study, which was based on a national sample of nurses in New Zealand (n = 1249), we improved the criterion variable by combining employment status with a continuous measure, namely, job survival duration (length of employment starting from the time of survey). We then applied Cox's (1972) proportional hazards regression (PHR) analysis to the improved criterion, and compared the results with those obtained by applying MR on employment status. The comparisons favored PHR: (1) MR selected an extra predictor of quitting that turned out to be nonsignificant, and (2) the numbers of quitters estimated by PHR tended to be more accurate than those by MR.

Abstract: The purpose of this research is to study employee responses to a new office automation system over an extended period of time. Following the conceptual framework proposed by O'Connor, Parsons, Liden, and Herold (1990), constructs of interest were categorized as individual differences, implementation outcomes. The research occurred in a life insurance trade association over an 18-month period. Three waves of questionnaires focused on different parts of the conceptual framework. Support was found for the direct relationships between inputs, facilitators (or resistors), and outcomes. The role of facilitators/resistors as intervening variables received mixed support. These results and others are discussed in the context of a conceptual model and future research suggestions are made.

Abstract: This paper examines approaches to the formation of organizational climate. Three perspectives appearing in the literature the structural, the perceptual, and the interactive are identified and examined. Additionally, a perspective termed the "cultural approach" is developed. This approach posits that organizational climate arises from the intersubjectivity of members as they interact within a context established by an organization's culture. A definition of organizational climate, informed by this approach, is presented. Finally, distinctions between organizational climate and organizational culture are examined.

Abstract: This article argues that theoretical and empirical progress in the field of human decision making is hampered by researchers' preoccupation with a narrow range of decision contexts. Four studies were conducted to highlight the categorical diversity of human choice behavior and to illustrate how an awareness of this diversity can promote more rigorous decision theory. In Study 1, college students were asked to list the most important decisions they had ever made. A cluster analysis of these decisions revealed decision categories involving interpersonal relations, career, living arrangements, money, college, values, family, and cars. In Study 2, the most important decisions listed by residents of a retirement home included many of the same categories as those of college students and also included categories involving retirement and post-mortem arrangements. In Study 3, we asked historians to indicate the most important decisions that they believed had been made in the twentieth century. Decision categories ...

Title: Exchange Ideology as a Moderator of the Relationships Between Importance of Participation in Decision Making and Job Attitudes
Author-Name: L. Alan Witt
Abstract: The present study examined the relationships between reported importance of participation in decision making and three job attitudes of relevance to Yugoslav self-management, namely job satisfaction, perceptions of organizational support, and perceptions of organizational goal norms. Data collected from 134 of 200 randomly sampled workers in a Yugoslav tooling plant yielded weak correlations but also indicated a moderating effect of exchange ideology. These results have implications not only for Yugoslav self-management but also for exchange theory and the study of job attitudes.

Title: A Multivariate Analysis of Curvilinear Relationships Among Job Scope, Work Context Satisfactions, and Affective Outcomes
Author-Name: Joseph E. Champoux
Abstract: This study investigated the curvilinear relationships between Job Scope and Affective Outcomes and the moderating effect of work context satisfactions on those relationships. The analysis used a multivariate design to examine main and interaction effects. The results showed several different relationships between job design and the work context. Those relationships included distraction, enhancement, and compensatory effects of the work context and the job itself. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.

Title: Leadership: An Alienating Social Myth?
Author-Name: Gary Gemmill
Author-Name: Judith Oakley
Abstract: The social construct of leadership is viewed as a myth that functions to reinforce existing social beliefs and structures about the necessity of hierarchy and leaders in organizations. The dynamics of the leadership myth in terms of its consequences for alienation characterized by intellectual and emotional deskilling is discussed. A trend toward massive deskilling on a societal scale is viewed as indicated by the current emergence of magical wishes for omnipotent leaders demonstrating a sense of helplessness and despair in being able to personally initiate and create less alienating social forms for the workplace. The types of experimentation required for refraining socially constructed meanings of leadership are explored, with emphasis placed on the role of heightened awareness of covert and undiscussable power and authority dynamics in an organizational context.

Title: Why Me? A Case Study of the Process of Perceived Occupational Stress
Author-Name: Jenny Firth-Cozensl
Abstract: This paper discusses occupational stress literature in terms of the movement from looking for job-related causes towards considering individual sources of stress such as dispositions and neuroticism. It goes on to consider this by a detailed examination of the personal meanings of job stress for one individual manager in psychodynamic psychotherapy. It outlines the ways in which measured job perceptions and satisfactions became more positive as symptoms decreased. The study supports the argument for some individually-related causes of stress but also shows how therapy and counseling can change perceptions, rather than treating them as dispositional and unchangeable.

Title: Applying the Concept of Appraisal to Work Stressors: Some Exploratory Analysis
Author-Name: Philip J. Dewe
Abstract: Researchers agree that the measurement of stressors and coping in occupational stress research should reflect new approaches and offer alternative frameworks if the different dynamics to the stress process are to be more adequately explored. This research adopted a methodology which reflected the presumed transactional nature of the appraisal process. How individuals appraise, give meaning to, and cope was explored by combining qualitative and quantitative data. Individuals, it seems, can describe the meanings they give to events and how they cope with them. The understanding that can be derived when alternative methodologies are used must lead to a refinement of traditional measurement strategies and a more fruitful avenue for future research.

Author-Name: David M. Romney

Abstract: Of critical importance in the applications of quality of life theory and measurement to clinical situations is the need to know how the different components of quality of life relate to each other and what these relationships mean. To answer this question, the present study reanalyzes data collected 6 months after surgery on 469 patients with cardiovascular problems. The data were factor analyzed and five factors were extracted, namely, Symptoms of Illness, Neurological Dysfunction, Interpersonal Relationships, Morale, and Socioeconomic Status. Because the factor scores derived from these five factors intercorrelated, we were able to hypothesize causal models suggesting how the factors might affect each other. Two competing models were tested against the data using LISREL. A crucial difference between the two models was that in one, Symptoms lowered Morale whereas in the other, low Morale aggravated Symptoms, i.e., a psychosomatic effect. The first model fitted the data very well in contrast to the second...

Author-Name: J. Stewart Blackl
Abstract: Recently, the topic of expatriate cross-cultural adjustment has received increased scholarly attention; however, adjustment after an international assignment (repatriation adjustment) has received relatively little systematic investigation. This study examined the relationship of managers' expectations with repatriation adjustment and job performance. In general, managers whose job and nonwork expectations were met reported higher levels of repatriation adjustment and job performance than those whose expectations were either underor overmet. Both research and practical implications are discussed.

Title: Job Performance and Absenteeism: A Review and Meta-Analysis
Author-Name: Peter Bycio
Abstract: The relationship between individual employee performance and absenteeism was examined using data from 46 articles. Meta-analyses (cf. Hunter & Schmidt, 1990) revealed a modest but significant tendency for frequently absent employees to be poor performers on many rating and non-rating indices. Importantly though, the associated credibility intervals were wide, and statistical artifacts did not account for all the variance among the studies. Several alternative theoretical mechanisms were identified, e.g., supervisor annoyance with frequent absences, employee disposition toward delinquency, progressive withdrawal, and stress coping, that could account for the remaining variation.

Title: Mentoring: Narcissistic Fantasies and Oedipal Realities
Author-Name: Howell S. Baum
Abstract: This article examines the literature on mentoring from a psychoanalytic perspective. Two common contrasting experiences of mentoring, harmony between a protege and a perfect mentor, and sexuality and aggressive conflict between the protege and mentor, are typically successive stages in mentoring relationships. These stages resemble infantile narcissism and the Oedipus complex. In successful mentoring, these experiences are followed by the protege's internalization of the mentor's values and growing autonomy, as the protege moves from largely unconscious fantasies about the mentor toward increasingly realistic understanding of and action in the organization. A successful mentoring relationship apparently requires the protege to undergo a regression in the service of ego interests in career advancement. This "rebirth" entails returning to narcissism and working through an Oedipus-like relationship with the mentor before moving into a latency concern with work skills and developing an independent identity.

Title: Social Support Under Conditions of Organizational Ambiguity
Author-Name: Irit Pauline Erera
Abstract: This study examines how supervisors perceive the singular characteristics of social support from their superior, peers, and subordinates. It also examines the effects of organizational ambiguity on each of these support sources. Both quantitative and qualitative measurements were applied in the investigation of 62 supervisors employed in departments of social services. The findings indicate that only subordinates were perceived as supportive, providing emotional and approval support. Superiors were criticized for providing inconsistent and insufficient information, and for withholding emotional, approval, and tangible support. Peers were accused for withholding emotional support. Relationships with other organizational departments, headed by peers, reflected competition and mistrust. It is argued that relationships with all these support sources were determined by organizational uncertainty, produced by ambiguous policies. The study concludes with implications for future research and practice.

Title: Sphere-Specific Just World Beliefs and Attitudes to AIDS
Author-Name: Adrian Furnhaml
Author-Name: Eddie Procter
Abstract: This paper is predicated on the idea that Just World Beliefs (JWB) are multidimensional. It is proposed that individual difference in JWB are divided into three components referring to different spheres of behavior: personal, interpersonal, and social political (Paulus, 1983). A questionnaire was specifically devised to assess these beliefs. There was some evidence of internal reliability. A construct validity study is reported to substantiate the use of the new instrument. It examined the relationship between JWB and the attitudes to AIDS. As predicted, JWB beliefs were closely related to five attitudinal factors concerning AIDS. Socio-political just world beliefs seemed most closely linked to attitudes to AIDS, though the size of the correlations suggests the relationship was not very substantial. The structure of JWB are discussed along with other relevant research on attitudes to AIDS.

Abstract: A longitudinal study of the effects of attending an assessment center on candidates' self-assessments was carried out. Self-ratings of ability were collected immediately before, immediately after, and 6 months after an assessment center, and correlated with assessors' ratings of participants in the assessment event. Results show that there were marked differences in self-assessment accuracy between successful and unsuccessful candidates immediately post-assessment center, which persisted 6 months later after feedback had been received; unsuccessful candidates seem to have misjudged the effectiveness of their performance. The findings are discussed in relation to their implications for the use of assessment centers as an aid to development and for the way feedback procedures are handled.

Abstract: Although a great deal of research has addressed the issue of outcome "fairness," relatively little has been done to illuminate the relationship between perceptions of outcome fairness (distributive justice), organizational systems fairness (procedural justice), job satisfaction, and intent to turnover. This paper isolates the empirical relationships between the types of perceived fairness, critical work attitudes, and intent to turnover using a sample of 88 employees in technical fields such as computer assisted design, product testing and assurance, and computer equipment repair. Intent to turnover was found to be most sensitive to perceptions of procedural justice. Implications of these results for managers are discussed.

Title: Organizational Change and the Corporate Career: The Restructuring of Managers' Job Aspirations
Author-Name: Rob Goffee
Author-Name: Richard Scase
Abstract: For managers in large-scale organizations, careers have traditionally provided a set of organizing principles around which they have been able to structure both their private and professional lives. Through them, they have been able to experience a sense of security, stability, and order. Personal feelings of growth and advancement have been achieved through jobs which provide not only the opportunities for the completion of specific tasks but also a mean whereby longer-term personal goals can be achieved. Indeed, the combined promise of job security and advancement within corporate hierarchies-as linked with incremetal increases in authority, status, and pay-have constituted the major rewards of the modern managerial career. It has been largely through these mechanisms that large-scale organizations have been able to obtain the motivation and commitment of their managerial staff. During the 1980s, however, a variety of technological, organizational, and broader social changes have led many observers to s...

Title: Mystification and Social Drama: The Hidden Side of Communication Skills Training

Abstract: This paper examines several aspects of management communication skills training. It discusses communication "skills" and their hidden potential as methods that sustain and mystify bureaucratic control. It also examines the social drama of communication skills training. Based on participant observation of a 4-day communication skills training seminar, the paper identifies and discusses six categories which, we argue, are designed to convert participants into practitioners and believers of the skills: creating an aura of status and wealth, creating an aura of credibility, minimizing risk, creating a "flow," trainer/participant testimonials, and closing-down-the-day rituals. The paper also looks at two groups of "nonbelievers" who resisted the training content or process. Last, the paper looks at why the workshop ultimately failed, discusses the covert aspects of management training, and speculates on management communication training that "demystifies."

Title: Turnover Intentions and Desire Among Executives
Author-Name: Karen N. Gaertner
Author-Name: Stanley D. Nollen
Abstract: We propose a typology of turnover intentions that uses desire to stay and intent to stay with the firm. The typology has four categories, leavers, stayers, locked-ins, and jilteds. Two questions are addressed. First, does the typology discriminate among executives empirically? Second, how do executives in one category differ from those in other categories? Using surveys from a sample of executives, we find empirical support for the typology. Results from three-category discriminant analysis indicate stayers are line employees characterized by high job satisfaction, integration into the management team, and perception that the company provides employment security. Leavers are more likely to be staff employees and have the opposite opinions of stayers about their jobs. Jilted executives are distinguished by moderate seniority, high outside career opportunity, and somewhat low inside career opportunity. The results suggest development of a non-linear model of unplanned turnover.

Abstract: Experiments and programs in labor-management cooperation are popularly believed to be effective in improving performance, but are often conducted with little or no evaluation of their success. This paper reports a test of a joint problem-solving model in a large telecommunications firm, as part of an overall assessment of the firm's quality-of-worklife (QWL) and employee involvement (El) committees. The assessment employed interviews, company performance indicators, and questionnaire survey data. Results showed strong evidence of the success of the joint committees as well as support for the model with respect to the contribution of key climate and process variables.

Abstract: Previous research has suggested that selection procedures and performance evaluations are not unfair to minorities. Results of a meta-analysis indicated that Whites performed higher than non-Whites on cognitive ability tests (d = .464) and on supervisory ratings (d = .284), but not on objective results (d = -.009) and that validities between the tests and ratings and results were not significantly different. In addition, a comparison of predicted to actual mean standardized criterion differences between White and non-White subgroups suggested that cognitive ability underpredicted actual differences in supervisory ratings. These results imply that researchers and policymakers need to continue to evaluate fairness in testing and performance evaluation because, contrary to prior evidence, the use of cognitive ability tests may indeed be unfair to non-Whites.

Abstract: This paper argues that current conceptions of organizational activity as ritual conformity (or isomorphism) to institutional demands which exist in the environment must also incorporate an understanding of organizational enactment. Enactment entails a conception of the environment in terms of processes of reality construction; organizations are active in creating and defining institutional demands. Data is drawn from a study of the response of mental health organizations to outpatient commitment which is a legal policy designed to fulfill the societal demands for deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill. Organizational responses were highly variable, despite the existence of outpatient commitment as a legal policy with active encouragement of its use by the State Division of Mental Health. This variability can be understood in terms of organizational enactments; each organization construed the workings of the policy according to its own definitions and stocks of knowledge, and then conformed with its ow...

Abstract: Relationships among dyadic structure, the influence tactics used by managers, the communication media they employ, and perceived influence success were investigated in a field study. Surveyed managers (n = 139) responded to questions about their patterns of communication and influence with respect to a single other individual in the organization. Dyadic relationship (upward, downward, or horizontal) affected influence tactics and media usage; these behaviors in turn were found to be selectively related to influence success, depending on the dyadic relationship between agent and target of influence.

Abstract: Numerous explanations for understanding the nature of superior-subordinate relationships are available in the leadership literature. Although these arguments differ, a common feature is that each view is based implicitly on particular levels of analysis. The purpose of the current study was to conceptualize and test alternative perspectives of superior-subordinate relationships by explicitly incorporating multiple levels of analysis in hypothesis generation and testing. Data from matched reports of superiors and subordinates were analyzed using Within and Between Analysis (WABA). Results from a sample of retail sales associates and their supervisors indicated that on the dimensions of attention, job latitude, satisfaction with performance, and job congruence, superior-subordinate relationships differed from one interpersonal relationship to another. In a sample of insurance agents and their managers, however, findings indicated that there were individual differences on these dimensions for superiors and s...

Abstract: Six hundred and forty police officers participated in a survey of job performance feedback. Results were interpreted in terms of a hierarchical view of feedback, in which task feedback is relied upon most heavily for evaluating one's own performance, but feedback from the organization is used to adjust the way information from the task is used. Consistent with these expectations, self-evaluations were most closely associated with task feedback. Strain varied as a function of both (a) inconsistency between organization and task feedback, and (b) affective relevance of feedback from others.

Abstract: This paper provides an introductory discussion of Bayesian statistics and their applicability to OD evaluation. Bayesian statistics provide an alternative to traditional statistics in the evaluation of OD interventions. Bayesian statistics allow for the explicit quantification of prior probabilities and give management and consultants control over the determination of the practical significance of an intervention. This makes Bayesian evaluation methods a more flexible tool for investigating dynamic interventions in systems. A discussion of the role of subjectivity in Bayesian statistical analysis and examples of how Bayesian evaluation strategies may be used in OD settings are provided.

Title: Panoptic Reason and the Search for Totality: A Critical Assessment of the Critical Systems Perspective
Author-Name: Haridimos Tsoukasl
Abstract: This paper reviews the main claims and assumptions of the critical systems perspective (CSP) and subjects them to vigorous criticism. It is argued that CSP is flawed on philosophical and sociological grounds. Philosophically, CSP is criticized for its use of ideological premises which are unsusceptible to scientific criticism, for its unrealistic assumptions concerning the alleged unitary nature of organizations and society, for an essentialist conception of human beings, and for its inability to distinguish between different types of systems research. Sociologically, CSP's inadequate conceptualization of power in organizations is discussed. CSP also espouses an apolitical conception of organizational actors, and fails to appreciate the inherently open nature of social systems which is manifested mainly through the emergence of unintended consequences. It is argued here that all the above deficiencies emanate from two fundamental premises: the panoptic status CSP accords to reason, and the totalizing natu...

Title: Development and Test of a Theory of Technological Learning and Usage
Author-Name: Richard P. Bagozzi

Author-Name: Paul R. Warshaw
Abstract: Beliefs, attitudes, and intentions are important factors in the adoption of computer technologies. While contemporary representations have focused on explaining the act of using computers, the role of learning to use the computer needs to be better understood within the overall adoption process. Inadequate learning can curtail the adoption and use of a potentially productive system. We introduce a new theoretical model, the theory of trying, in which computer learning is conceptualized as a goal determined by three attitude components: attitude toward success, attitude toward failure, and attitude toward the process of goal pursuit. Intentions to try and actual trying are the theoretical mechanisms linking these goal-directed attitudes to goal attainment. An empirical study is conducted to ascertain the construct validity and utility of the new theory within the context of the adoption of a word processing package. Specifically, we examine convergent validity, internal consistency reliability, stability, ...

Title: Creating a Bureau-Adhocracy: Integrating Standardized and Innovative Services in a Professional Work Group
Author-Name: Darlyne Bailey
Author-Name: Eric H. Neilsen
Abstract: This paper explores the organizing dilemmas of professionals who work in small organizations that attempt to provide standardized and innovative services with the same staff. Mintzberg (1979) suggested that the bureau-adhocracy would be the most appropriate form for coping with such conditions but did not elaborate on how it might develop or be maintained over time. The longitudinal the case study reported here supports this claim and goes further in two fundamental areas with respect to the smaller professional enterprise: First, it describes some of the learning processes involved in the creation of this hybrid, and second, it suggests the existence of two definable stages in the form's development, i.e., naive and mature.

Author-Name: Aaron A. Buchko
Abstract: Previous research on employee-owned organizations has been limited in time frame and in the outcomes examined, which have been primarily attitudinal measures. This study examined the effects of an employee ownership program on employee attitudes and actual turnover behavior over an extended time period. The results indicated that employees with greater perceived influence as a result of the ownership program and those with a greater financial value in the ownership program were more satisfied with the ESOP program, more committed to the organization, had lower turnover intention, and were less likely to exit the company.

Title: The Concept of Schools Village and the Incidence of Stress Among Science Teachers
Author-Name: Peter Akinsola Okebukolal
Abstract: The primary interest of this study lay in exploring the potential of the personnel relations in "schools villages" in reducing science teacher stress. The schools-village concept which has a Greek origin and is gaining wide acceptance in many countries of the world, is built on the philosophy of maximum resource utilization and the engendering of communal spirit. Data gathered from 368 science teachers in Nigeria indicate that science teacher interactions in the "schools villages" had a significant depressing effect on stress level on five clusters of stressors: curriculum, facilities, student characteristics, administrative, and professional growth and self-satisfaction. The implications of the results for science teacher welfare and for preparing the citizenry for the science and technology-dominated world of the twenty-first Century are drawn.

Title: Does Job Re-Design Theory Explain Job Re-Design Outcomes?
Author-Name: John Kelly
Abstract: A review of 31 methodologically rigorous case studies and experiments in job re-design showed only limited support lor the Job Characteristics Model. Where job re-design led to employee perceptions of improved job content then employees were also likely to experience higher job satisfaction. Job performance improvements however were not significantly associated with job perceptions, intrinsic work motivation, or job satisfaction, although they were associated with pay rises and job losses among employees. These findings are accounted for by a twin-track model which suggests that the determinants of performance are different from the determinants of satisfaction. While job re-design appears to give employees higher job satisfaction, there is no strong evidence that in and of itself it motivates them to higher performance.

Title: Nonwork Participation and Work Attitudes: A Test of Scarcity vs. Expansion Models of Personal Resources
Author-Name: Catherine Kirchmeyer
Abstract: Participation in nonwork domains can be assumed either to rob work of resources, such as time, energy, and commitment, or to enrich resources available for work. This study provides support for the latter view. Both organizational commitment and job satisfaction correlated positively with the hours spent in, and the resources provided by, certain nonwork activities. Furthermore, the nonwork factors contributed significantly to several predictive equations of the work attitudes after the effects of common work-related correlates were controlled. Specific implications for human resources management are discussed.

Title: A Typology of Career Wife Roles
Author-Name: W. Jay Strickland
Abstract: As interest in work-family linkages has increased, researchers have focused on the two-pcrson career and dual-career couples. These limited foci have obscured the fact that wives of professionals fill a variety of' achievement roles relative to market production. In order to identify these roles and promote more exact work-family research, this article presents a typology of carccr wife achievement roles. The categories of "homemaker," 'background supporter," "teamworker," "parallel worker," and "non-parallel worker" were derived from the career wife literature and comprise a continuum from lesser to greater direct participation in market production.

Title: Antecedents and Outcomes of Work-Family Conflict Among Married Professional Women: Evidence from Singapore
Author-Name: Samuel Aryee
Abstract: The study reported here examined the impact ol fivc antecedent sets of work and family domain variables on three types of work-lamily conflict (job-spouse, job-parent, and job-homemakcr) and the impact of these types of work-family conflict on well-being and work outcome measures. Data were obtained from 354 married professional women from duil-career families in Singapore. Results indicate that married professional women in this study experienced moderate amounts of each type of work-lamily conflict. Role stressors explained the most variance in job-spouse and job-homemaker conflicts while task characteristics explained the most variance in job-parent conflict. The three types of work-family conflict explained only modest amounts of the variance in the well-being and work outcome measures. The findings are discussed within a feminist framework and an option for combining work and family lives is suggested.

Approximately 200 lay people (working adults and students) and over 50 practicing psychologists completed a four-part questionnaire that examined attitudes to psychotherapy, beliefs concerning what patients report during psychotherapy, the efficacy of quite different types of psychological treatment, and finally the prognosis for a wide range of psychological problems. The ratings of the two groups, lay vs. professional, were compared on an item-by-item basis, as well as by interpretable factors that were found in previous studies (Furnham & Wardley, 1990, 1991). The results showed a predicted pattern of similarities and differences with most differences occurring on the questionnaires concerned with beliefs about what happens in psychotherapy and the efficacy of therapy, and least differences in the part concerned with the anticipated attitudes of psychothera...

Title: The Situational Occurrences Theory of Job Satisfaction
Author-Name: Vernon A. Quarstein
Author-Name: R. Bruce McAfee
Author-Name: Myron Glassman
Abstract: A two-phase study was conducted to test the Situational Occurrences Theory of Job Satisfaction. The theory was designed to address the following anomalies: (1) why do employees holding seemingly excellent jobs in terms of the traditional job facets such as pay and benefits sometimes report low satisfaction, (2) why do employees holding similar jobs at the same or different organizations with similar pay, etc. have different job satisfaction levels, and (3) why do employee job satisfaction levels change over time when pay, etc. remains relatively stable? The theory posits that job satisfaction is a function of a relatively finite and stable set of variables called Situational Characteristics and a broader based, fluid set of variables called Situational Occurrences. It was hypothesized that overall job satisfaction could best be predicted from a combination of Situational Occurrences and Situational Characteristics than by either alone. It was also hypothesized that Situational Occurrences play a dominant ...

Title: Language, Technology, Gender, and Power
Author-Name: Fiona Wilson
Abstract: This paper stems from a concern with how women are linguistically excluded in organizations. The paper will focus mainly on the form of language associated with technical change. Using research data the paper explores how metaphors are used within organizations which are in the process of adopting new technical systems, and what their use achieves. It is argued that men seek, knowingly or unknowingly, to facilitate the technological change process by drawing upon linguistic resources which reproduce relations of power. These resources are constituted as discourses of "battle," "maleness," and of "religious evangelism," expressed through metaphor. The language also serves the function of providing a vehicle for change; it marks out the "rules" as to how change is to be achieved; it not only helps differentiate "saints" from the "sinners" but helps re-enforce the power and all-encompassing dominance of male ideology in organizations. Language creates a reality which is gender-biased.

This article presents a model that broadens the inherent limitations of the reaction range concept by including (a) multiple sources of variation, (b) changing contributions across development, and (c) dynamic influences of context and situation. The model is intended to expand the focus on sources of variation and to offer heuristic tools for hypothesis generation.

Abstract: Although the importance of top managers in promoting technological innovation has been identified, the crucial role played by middle level technical managers in implementing the changes has been largely neglected. This paper offers a framework for the analysis of leadership roles in technological change, which draws upon often unrelated bodies of literature on leadership, technology, strategy, and organizational change. Data from empirical case studies of the implementation of CAD/CAM systems in British and Canadian companies are used to illustrate the impact of leadership by middle managers on organizational outcomes.

Title: The Moderating Effects of Locus of Control on Performance Incentives and Participation
Author-Name: Leslie Krenl
Abstract: Prior research has suggested that matching individual characteristics with task expectations and requirements leads to improved performance. The objective of this study was to examine the role of locus of control, an important individual characteristic, in moderating the impact of performance-contingent incentives and participation on performance. The results, based on a laboratory experiment, indicate that locus of control moderates the performance effects of both participation and incentives. The interaction with incentives is a substitute type in which either the person factor (locus of control) or the situation factor (incentives) blocks the effects of the other factor. The interaction with participation is a blocking type, wherein external orientation diminishes the performance effect of participation.

Title: Role of Identification with a Group, Arousal, Categorization Processes, and Self-Esteem in Sports Spectator Aggression
Author-Name: Nyla R. Branscombe
Author-Name: Daniel L. Wann
Abstract: Previous attempts to account for the occurrence of spectator aggression have employed one of the long-standing theories of aggression (i.e., instinctual theories, drive reduction models, and the social learning perspective). While support for some aspects of these theories has been documented, a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenon might direct research to more fruitful avenues. Such an analysis is proposed in this review. In addition to incorporating well-documented concepts such as physiological arousal and modeling, this new viewpoint includes the motivational aspects of team or group identification, the cognitive component of categorization, and the esteem-enhancing consequences of aggressive behavior. A model of the variables leading to spectator aggression is presented, and it is contrasted with prior theoretical viewpoints. Public policy implications for aggression reduction among sports spectators are discussed.

Abstract: Conflict management can substantially impact on the vital organizational objective of serving customers. This study used the goal interdependence approach to analyze the specific conflicts that marketing groups had with each other. As hypothesized, cooperative goals and open discussion of opposing views were found to contribute substantially to serving customers, completing tasks, using resources effectively, and strengthening expectations of future collaboration. Results also suggest that common tasks, shared vision, tasks requiring teamwork, and complementary roles underlie the conclusion of cooperative goals. In contrast to goal interdependence, amount of power was not highly related to the dynamics or outcomes of conflict.

Although we encourage replication research, the Klenke-Hamel and Mathieu study contains concerns which may render its findings suspect. We examine some of these concerns, indicating where we feel interpretational problems surface, and comment on the role of replication in extending theory.

Author-Name: Charles C. Manz
Abstract: Recent challenges raised in the literature suggest that the application of employee self-managing teams can create more of a illusion or myth of employee self-influence than a reality. The amount of self-influence allowed self-managing employees is frequently subject to many limitations stemming from management practice and organizational constraints. In order to more fully develop and utilize organizational human resources a movement beyond self-managing teams toward self-leading teams is proposed. This perspective suggests that employees are empowered to influence strategic issues concerning what they do and why, in addition to the issue of how they do their work. The role of several contingency factors is also considered.

Author-Name: Bruce Fortado
Abstract: Workplace conflict has traditionally been approached with legalistic, problemsolving, and power-oriented models. Most dominant organization cultures embody a combination of these models' assumptions. Based on 100 case studies from the United States, a bottom-up model reflecting the beliefs prevailing in subordinate subcultures is inductively developed via a two-stage content analysis. The key assumptions of all four models are contrasted along six cultural dimensions: namely, the nature of relationships, truth/reality, analytic determinations, evidence, time, and the consequences of grieving. The processes of nicknaming and story telling through which subcultural meanings are commonly constructed also receive close scrutiny.

Abstract: Participative decision-making and job autonomy have been linked to perceived control, however, there has been some ambiguity in how this relationship has been approached in the literature. Researchers have generally sought to maintain the conceptual distinction among the constructs but have treated measures of the constructs as if they were indicators of a single underlying control dimension or disposition. The present study tests the plausibility that a hypothetical general control factor influences responding on several measures of perceived job autonomy and participative decision-making at work. Hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis in samples of teachers and computer company employees supported a model in which measures of separate job autonomy dimensions, general job autonomy, perceptions of participative climate at work, and perceptions of control at work all were related to a second order control factor. The second order control factor was shown to be distinct from perceptions of one's supervis...

Author-Name: Udo H. Staber
Abstract: This study examines the effects of organizational population growth on organizational mortality rates in three populations of cooperative sector organizations in Maritime Canada for the period from 1900 to 1987. The findings reveal a partly asymmetric pattern of density dependence. At times, cooperatives cooperated with one another and benefitted from mutualist relations, consistent with the conventional view of the cooperative sector as an integrated community of mutually supportive organizations. But they also competed with one another and failed to achieve a united movement, increasing the chances of organizational dissolution. The empirical findings are interpreted within a community ecology perspective.

Abstract: Based on a sample of three employee-owned and seven conventional companies, this study empirically tests the theoretical claim that employee ownership and management reduces inequality at the firm level. Inequality is broadly defined as the unequal distribution of income, wealth, power, prestige, and privileges, as well as the existence of social boundaries between classes. Results, based on questionnaires, interviews, and study of workers' wages, reveal a more equal distribution of all of the above rewards among the worker-owners of the three employee-owned and managed companies in contrast to the distribution of those among employees of the conventional firms. Implications of results are discussed and further research suggestions are presented.

Abstract: The emergence of a British ethnic minority business class over the past decade promises much for the future of black people, but may deliver very little in terms of material improvement. Like its U.S. counterpart, which grew in the aftermath of the 1960's disorders, the British Black bourgeoisie is a product of post-riot developments. Many members of Britain's Afro-Caribbean and South Asian populations have lost faith in their power collectively to change society and are focusing on improving themselves as individuals. But a hitherto undetected form of racism threatens to undermine the efforts of the Black bourgeoisie to turn its particular successes into something more permanent for the black population generally. Business owners are forced to practice "racism-by-proxy," deliberately excluding blacks from their workforces.

Abstract: This paper presents the theoretical basis and the associated perceptions of race relations that characterized a race relations competence workshop which served as the educational component of an overall program to improve race relations among managers within the fictitiously named XYZ Corporation. Workshop activities combined didactic and experiential methods and focused on group and individual levels of learning based on embedded intergroup relations theory. An assessment of the race relations competence workshop was carried out as part of an overall effort to evaluate the race relations improvement program in the company. Employing measures of both global evaluation and perceptions of race relations among managers, the study showed that Blacks evaluated the workshop more favorably than Whites, that reports of having information about the workshop were positively associated with favorable evaluations of the workshop, that workshop participants more than nonparticipants were likely to perceive Whites as h...

Title: Drugs and Deception: Undercover Infiltration and Dramaturgical Theory
Author-Name: Bruce A. Jacobs
Abstract: This paper addresses interactional strategies used by undercover narcotics agents during covert drug transactions. Specific emphasis is given to the extent to which these strategies depend on particular drugs involved. In this regard, four narcotics are examined: marijuana, LSD, crack cocaine, and heroin. Discussion revolves around the concept of "interaction as infiltration," a new reading of dramaturgical theory which considers the relationship between structural (extent of group closure) and qualitative (extent of verbal and nonverbal machination needed to deceive) aspects of role performances. Data for this paper were drawn primarily from ethnograpahic interviews with 35 undercover narcotics agents located in a moderate-sized midwestern (U.S.) municipality.

Title: Managerial Resourcefulness: A Reconceptualization of Management Skills
Author-Name: Rabindra N. Kanungo
Author-Name: Sasi Misra
Abstract: The diverse nature of the prevailing conceptualizations of skills required for successful managerial performance hinders our understanding of the phenomenon. This paper examines the limitations to our understanding of the nature of managerial skills based on the analysis of managerial jobs that are often non-routine, unprogrammed, and ill-structured. A framework that distinguishes between managerial "skills" and "competencies" along several dimensions such as specific-generic, task driven-person driven, and transferable non-transferable is suggested as a possible alternative mode of conceptualization. Competencies representing fundamental generic cognitive characteristics are viewed as managerial resourcefulness. Integrating research from the fields of cognitive, clinical, personality, and social psychology, the paper identifies and explicates various components of resourcefulness which have implications for selection and training of managers. Developing appropriate operationalization, assessment, and tra...

Title: Attitudinal Militancy and Propensity to Strike Among Unionized Engineers and X-Ray Technicians
Author-Name: Aaron Cohen
Abstract: This study examines whether attitudinal militancy and propensity to strike represent two different constructs. The study also examines the joint effects of five models, each representing a different theoretical approach, upon the two dependent variables: propensity to strike and attitudinal militancy. Unionized employees of two occupational groups in Israel, 139 engineers, and 125 X-ray technicians, are surveyed. In general, the findings show that attitudinal militancy and propensity to strike are two independent constructs. This conclusion is supported by the factor analysis findings, the intercorrelations between the items of the measures, and the results of the regression analyses indicating different patterns of effects of the research models upon attitudinal militancy and propensity to strike. The findings also demonstrate that the commitment model and union commitment in particular, is an important determinant of union militancy. Discussion of the implications of these findings and how they relate t...

Abstract: Predictors of providing support among two-earner couples have rarely been examined.

Title: Understanding the Leader-Strategy Interface: Application of the Strategic Relationship Interview Method
Author-Name: Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries
Author-Name: Danny Miller
Author-Name: Alain Noël
Abstract: The argument that leaders substantially affect organizational outcome is presented. In order to better understand the leader/strategy/environment interface, however, the question of what leaders do has to be supplemented with why they are doing it. It is argued that the assessment of a leader's preoccupations will make for more effective human resource planning by facilitating the match between leader and organization. Unfortunately, the accurate assessment of a leader's preoccupations is still in its infancy. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a research methodology based on the clinical concept of transference, i.e., repetitive, consistent patterns of interaction which are unique to each individual. The applicability of the Strategic Relationship Interview Method (a derivative of the Core Conflictual Relationship Theme Method as developed by Luborsky and his collaborators) is explored as potentially a relatively simple way to capture the essence of leadership. Using the Strategic Relationship Intervie...

Title: Authoritarianism, Dominance, and Social Behavior: A Perspective from Evolutionary Personality Psychology
Author-Name: Robert D. Smither
Abstract: The concept of authoritarianism has been widely misunderstood because of both confusion about values and science and disagreement about a definition of the concept within different areas of psychology. Research in cognitive and social psychology has focused on linking scores on authoritarianism scales with social behavior or information processing, but these efforts have not been very successful at either defining the concept or predicting behavior. In developmental research, authoritarian parenting refers to an emphasis on parental control and decision making. Organizational authoritarianism has been linked to higher productivity and, in some cases, with lower job satisfaction. One way of making sense of the variety of definitions of authoritarianism is in terms of evolutionary personality theory and the concepts of dominance and submission. These biological concepts are relevant to both human and animal behavior, and they can be used to explain authoritarianism in scientific, rather than pejorative, terms.

Title: Conflicting Ideologies: Structural and Motivational Consequences
Author-Name: Susan C. Schneider
Abstract: Conflicting ideologies are revealed in different beliefs about how to design organizations. Beliefs regarding, for example, the extent of centralization of decision making and specialization of roles and tasks, in turn, influence motivation and behavior. This paper demonstrates how ideology influences organizational structure and the behavioral consequences by comparing the "medical" and "community" models of mental health care delivery. Although rational arguments would suggest that organizational structure, in terms of degrees of centralization and specialization, should be determined by goals and technologies, the ambiguity of these goals and technologies encourages organizational structure to be driven by ideology. Conflicting ideologies need to be incorporated so that the tension thus created will encourage the emergence of a different perspective on mental health service delivery.

Title: The Partial Unacceptability of Money in Repayment for Neighborly Help
Author-Name: Paul Webley
Author-Name: Stephen E. G. Lea
Abstract: This study focuses on the acceptability of using money in repayment for three kinds of neighborly help. Questionnaires were distributed to 400 households in four different neighborhoods. Only in the case of the "loan" of food was money found to be an acceptable form of repayment. In most cases, the use of money was rejected because it would break a social convention. There was a strong preference for repaying help by offering the same kind of help in exchange. The data suggested that there are strong patterns of reciprocal helping. Multiple regression analyses showed that the amount of help received was correlated with age, place of previous residence, and the number of people in the immediate area whom the respondent would call by name. Respondents who scored higher on either help received or perceived neighborliness were slightly more willing to offer money in repayment of neighborly help. These results are consistent with the view that there are limits on the use of money in social exchanges.

Title: Learning, Trust, and Technological Collaboration
Author-Name: Mark Dodgson
Abstract: Companies increasingly collaborate in their technological activities. Collaboration enables firms to learn about uncertain and turbulent technological change, and enhances their ability to deal with novelty. A number of studies reveal the importance for successful collaboration of high levels of inter-personal trust between scientists, engineers, and managers in the different partners. However, these individual relationships are vulnerable to labor turnover and inter-personal difficulties. Using two examples of highly successful technological collaborations, it is argued that the survival of such relationships in the face of these inevitable inter-personal problems requires the establishment of interorganizational trust. Such trust is characterized by community of interest, organizational cultures receptive to external inputs, and widespread and continually supplemented knowledge among employees of the status and purpose of the collaboration.

Title: From Postmodern Anthropology to Deconstructive Ethnography
Author-Name: Stephen Linstead
Abstract: The social sciences have recently exhibited renewed interest in ethnography while traditional anthropology has been struggling with the challenges of postmodernism. This paper considers the theoretical implications of the potential convergence of these strands, with particular reference to the ethnography of organizations. Postmodernism is seen to affect ethnography by problematizing the processes of description, reference, and the establishment of authority in ethnographic texts. It offers, rather than a "scientific" model, a "literary" model of such texts in which description is an active construction rather than a neutral recording of the other's world. Ostensive reference becomes displaced by evocation, the single authorial voice by the "heteroglossia" of many contributing voices. Unfortunately, there is a tendency for the processes of interpretation to be abandoned to a free play of unlimited signification in which any and all meanings are possible, which jettisons rigor and with it critical acerbity...

Title: Emerging Varieties of Action Research: Introduction to the Special Issue
Author-Name: Max Elden
Author-Name: Rupert F. Chisholm
Abstract: Action research is defined and its scientific basis is noted but not argued. Although its original, classical form established almost a half century ago still exists, there has recently emerged a variety of new models for doing action research today. The basic classical model is described in terms of five elements. These are, in turn, used to introduce the present collection of reports on new, emergent varieties of contemporary action research that complement and extend the classic model. The reports come from projects in hundreds of organizations, in communities and regions, and in numerous countries. The ideas behind the basic model of action research may remain viable today only because they are being practiced in new ways, in innovative research designs, and applied to new problems. The collection of cases presented in this special issue illustrates the rich variety of new thinking available in contemporary action research.

Abstract: We present a case study of a 5-year action research project in a 12-plant division of a multi-billion dollar firm. The division is attempting to design new plants and re-design all established plants as high involvement, high performance work systems (Lawler, 1986). The design process is based on a self-design learning model (Mohrman & Cummings, 1989). The history of the change process and data about its effects are reported. We review in detail how the self-design learning system is shaped by the nature of change in a large, multi-level, multi-site organization. We also consider the unusual role of the action researcher in large-scale change.

After describing the key features and strengths of participatory action research, we briefly analyze its role in promoting social change through organizational learning in three very different kinds of organizations. We argue that participatory action research is always an emergent process that can often be intensified and that works effectively to link participation, social action, and knowledge generation.

Title: Creating Networks for Rural Economic Development in Norway
Author-Name: Morten Levin
Abstract: Regional economic development is a social change process. This paper focuses on how the creation of social networks can support economic development. Action research methodology, the theoretical foundations of which are presented, was used to support network development. The paper describes and analyzes the social shaping of several types of new networks in coastal Norway over the 5-year period of 1986-1991. Networks linking entrepreneurs resulted in establishing several new enterprises. The shaping of networks for interorganizational cooperation promoted the survival and growth of existing economic activity. Networks that developed between the public and private sectors also promoted economic development and a new role for the public sector, network broker, emerged. This new role required public sector initiatives, provision of necessary resources, and active and equal participation among all parties involved in the development effort.

Title: Swedish Network Development for Implementing National Work Reform Strategy
Author-Name: Per H. Engelstad
Author-Name: Björn Gustavsen
Abstract: During the early history of action research it was common to work with one single enterprise or workplace. More recently there has been a tendency toward linking organizations together in networks of development projects. One of the chief reasons for this new approach is to achieve "critical mass" of changes between organizations. In creating networks, different approaches can be applied. While the first efforts to develop networks were seen as appendices to single case projects, the current tendency is to see networks as organizational structures in their own right. Their development requires means or action parameters which go beyond those generally applied in "organization development." Networks were a key means in a recently concluded 5-year, nationwide action research-based Swedish work reform effort involving more than 100 organizations in various networks (the "LOM" program). This article describes the LOM program and the background for the interest in network development, the means invented to cre...

Title: Social Change Through Collective Reflection with Asian Nongovernmental Development Organizations

Abstract: "Participatory action research" has been acclaimed for producing new knowledge as well as solutions to organizational and social problems. But the term has quite different meanings to different audiences: The "Southern" tradition is committed to community transformation through empowering disenfranchised groups; the "Northern" tradition is concerned with reforming organizations through problem-solving. This paper describes a series of collective reflections that brought together leaders of development agencies from Southern and Northern settings to consider the roles of nongovernmental development organizations (NGOs) in promoting sustainable development. The results of these reflections, in terms of new knowledge and new action strategies, are illustrated. Critical processes for such collective reflection, including the management of value and ideological differences, the definition of participation, and the organization of joint inquiry are discussed. The paper also discusses the implications of such re...

Abstract: The concept of culture promised to make organization studies more historical. This promise has not been fulfilled. Possible reasons for the failure to integrate business history and organization studies are explored and a synthesis developed, using the historical concept of invented tradition in conjunction with the social cognition biases identified by organizational culture. The major part of the article then demonstrates how Cadbury, a British confectionery company well known for its Quaker traditions, invented its corporate culture by attributing significance to the Quaker beliefs of the Cadbury family retrospectively. A history is reconstructed, mainly from published sources, to demonstrate how the histories constructed by the firm, including a centenary celebration in 1931, were part of the process of giving meaning to the firm's labor-management institutions.

Title: The Psychological Impact of Merger and Acquisition on the Individual: A Study of Building Society Managers
Author-Name: Sue Cartwright

Abstract: The prospect of increasing profitability and market share by acquisition or merger has continued to exercise a more immediate and seductive appeal to organizations than a reliance on organic growth alone, despite the seemingly high risks attached. The human aspects of merger and acquisition and the impact such a major change event has on employee health and well being has received relatively little research attention. This article reports on a recent study of middle managers (n = 157) involved in the merger of two U.K. Building Societies. Post-merger measures of mental health suggest merger to be a stressful life event, even when there is a high degree of cultural compatibility between the partnering organizations.

Abstract: Considerable attention has been given to different behavioral strategies of conflict management (e.g., avoidance, compromise, collaboration). However, conflict theory and research has overlooked a simple, but effective strategy for managing conflict: the use of social accounts or explanations. In this paper, we review the literature on the use of social accounts in conflict situations and find it supports the argument that social accounts can be an effective conflict- management strategy. Based on this analysis, we propose several promising directions for future theory development and research concerning the role of social accounts in conflict situations. In addition, we identify tradeoffs and dilemmas created when social accounts are used to manage conflict.

Title: The Comparative Utility of Third Party Consultation and Mediation Within a Complex Simulation of Intergroup Conflict
Author-Name: Loraleigh Keashly

Author-Name: Peter R. Grant
Abstract: Third party interventions designed to de-escalate intergroup conflict can be differentiated by their underlying assumptions regarding conflict. Process-oriented approaches such as third-party consultation try to de-escalate conflict by taking a subjective emphasis and focusing on the basic relationship between parties, their attitudes, and their perceptions. Traditional third-party interventions, particularly mediation, try to de-escalate conflict by focusing more on the substantive issues in dispute. This study examines how mediation and consultation operate differently within an intergroup conflict simulation. The Intergroup Conflict Simlatllion (Grant, Fisher, Hall, & Keashly, 1990) creates a moderately intense resource and value conflict which involves two equal power groups negotiating for points in a dispute over land divisions. A consultation or a mediation intervention was introduced midway through intergroup negotiations. The results showed that the two interventions did not have a differential i...

Abstract: This study investigates attitudes toward unauthorized copying of microcomputer software, a practice which is costing the industry an estimated $800 million to $2 billion a year in lost revenue. Specifically, the copying activities of business executives are compared with those of business faculty members. Executives are found to report less unauthorized copying activities both personally and by colleagues; they also reject rationalizations for such copying. Academicians, on the other hand, tend to view unauthorized copying as being less unethical. Possible explanations for the differences between the two groups include the degree and type of job-related supervision, identification with the organization vs. the profession, and social-desirability bias. Implications of these findings and future research needs are discussed.

Title: Exploring the Relationship Between Personal Values and Moral Reasoning
Author-Name: James Weber
Abstract: Personal values and moral reasoning have been found to influence behavior. However, as presently developed, these theories do not provide a comprehensive understanding and explanation of an individual's decision-making process leading to behavior. This paper explores the four personal value orientations introduced by Milton Rokeach and the moral reasoning characteristics of Lawrence Kohlberg's stage theory of moral development. Relationships between personal value orientations and stages of moral reasoning are developed and hypothesized relationships are empirically tested. Theoretical and research implications are drawn from these relationships in order to better understand, explain, and possibly predict decision-making and reasoning processes.

Abstract: This study used a policy-capturing approach to examine 3120 pay-allocation decisions of 65 managers (31 male, 34 female) who work in organizations that have a pay for performance policy. Subjects were asked to respond to packages that varied in terms of performance of subordinates, specialized skills/expertise of subordinates, difficulty in replacing the subordinates, possibility of potential subordinate turnover, and current salary of subordinates. Results indicated that all five factors were significant and in the direction expected. The interaction between performance and job offer was significant for only two of the 65 managers. The interactions between specialized skills and job offer and difficulty in replacement and job offer were not significant for any of the managers. Most of the variance across the managers was accounted by sampling error and criterion unreliability. Results also indicated that subjects' explicit rankings of the five factors did not correspond highly with the rankings of their ...

In addition, the subject's interaction goal was manipulated: Half of the subjects were led to desire self-enhancement, or to receive information increasing their self-regard; the other half were led to desire cognitive clarity, or to receive information that would increase their accurate understanding of everyday experiences. Consistent with predictions, subjects were more attracted to interaction partners who were positive than to interaction partners who were negative, and subjects were more attracted to interaction partners who were highly variable than to interaction partners who were low in variability.

Title: Rhetorical Vision of Men and Women Managers in Singapore
Author-Name: S. K. Jean Lee
Author-Name: Tan Hwee Hoon
Abstract: This paper reports findings from a content analysis of newspaper articles to uncover the rhetorical visions of men and women managers portrayed by the media in Singapore and unfold the inherent conflicting forces that women managers face. The study revealed that the women manager vision that was portrayed by the press, emphasized the dilemmas and role conflicts that the women managers face; whereas for the men manager vision, the emphasis was their managerial abilities. The study also uncovered that the success of the women managers had to rely on a support system that consisted of a male mentor, a supportive husband, a mother or maid to help in the housechores; whereas the success of the men managers depended wholly on themselves. Implications of the findings are discussed.

Title: Roles Executives Play: CEOs, Behavioral Complexity, and Firm Performance
Author-Name: Stuart L. Hart
Author-Name: Robert E. Quinn
Abstract: This paper develops a model of executive leadership consisting of four competing roles: Vision Setter, Motivator, Analyzer, and Task Master. These four roles are operationalized and hypotheses are then tested concerning their relationships to three dimensions of firm performance using data collected from a sample of 916 top managers. Results suggest that CEOs with high "behavioral complexity" - the ability to play multiple, competing roles - produce the best firm performance, particularly with respect to business performance (growth and innovation) and organizational (stakeholder) effectiveness. Executive leadership role had little to do with firms' financial performance.

Title: The Persean Ethic: Consistency of Belief and Action in Managerial Practice
Author-Name: Joseph A. Raelin
Abstract: The Persean ethic in managerial practice refers to the willingness of managers to follow through on their espoused beliefs with others in their immediate working network. It is considered to be among the most important of managerial practices since through it managers can monitor their beliefs to ensure that their actions are consistent with otherwise salutary espoused theories. In order to assess the dependent variable of Persean conduct, or consistency of belief and action, the core respondents' immediate work set, including their superior, peers, and subordinates, were surveyed as well as themselves. In an attempt to create an explanatory model of Persean conduct, individual personality and background factors, situational characteristics, their interaction, and learning factors were evaluated. Respondents were found to vary on Persean conduct, the Persean ethic was found not to be unidimensional, and although each of the independent variable clusters was represented in the predictor list, personality f...

Title: Making Sense of the Environment: The Role of Perceived Effectiveness
Author-Name: Donald L. McCabe
Author-Name: Jane E. Dutton
Abstract: This manuscript develops and explores two ideas: (1) that perceptions of environmental uncertainty are after-the-fact rationalizations used by decision makers to explain strong or weak effectiveness assessments, and (2) that different contexts motivate different sense-making outcomes. The findings, based on a sample of senior decision makers from 34 firms in two industries, suggest that assessments of effectiveness and perceptions of environmental uncertainty are related through decision makers' sense-making efforts. The manuscript also addresses the limitations and implications of these results.

Title: Personal Attributes as Predictors of Superiors' and Subordinates' Perceptions of Military Academy Leadership
Author-Name: Leanne E. Atwater
Author-Name: Francis J. Yammarinol
Abstract: Relationships between military academy leaders' personal attributes (e.g., traits, thinking styles) and others' ratings of transformational and transactional leadership were assessed in this study. Regression analyses indicated that personal attributes significantly predicted leadership ratings. Consistent with implicit leadership theories, however, the relevant predictors differed as a function of the positions of the individuals who rated leadership (i.e., superiors vs. subordinates of focal leaders). For example, leader intelligence and athletic experience were related to subordinate ratings of leadership while the leader's degree of conformity was associated with superiors' ratings of leadership. Implications for organizations and for understanding the leadership rating process are discussed.

Title: The Relationship Between Work Stress and Leisure Style: British and German Managers
Author-Name: Bruce D. Kirkcaldy
Author-Name: Cary L. Cooper
Abstract: In a study involving 255 management and executive personnel from Great Britain and West Germany, information was collated regarding occupational stress and leisure pursuits. Managers who exercised regularly were not significantly different in their occupational stress profiles compared to non-exercisers. Furthermore, physical exercise did not serve as a buffer in the stress-health linkage. There was some indication that the work-leisure balance may be moderated by culture. Discriminant analysis revealed that British managers tend to exhibit negative job carryover between their "job" and "off-work" domains, in contrast to the Germans who demonstrated "compensation."

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to clarify the readiness for change concept and examine how change agents can influence employee readiness for organizational change. The article contributes to an improved understanding of change dynamics in four important ways. First, readiness for change is distinguished from resistance to change. Readiness is described in terms of the organizational members' beliefs, attitudes, and intentions. Second, a model is offered that describes the influence strategies as well as the importance of change agent credibility and interpersonal and social dynamics in the readiness creation process. Third, by combining urgency of, and employee readiness for, needed changes, a typology of readiness programs is offered. Fourth, a large multinational corporation's efforts to create readiness for large-scale change are described to provide a cogent illustration of the various readiness interventions described in the model.

Abstract: Public service employees (3044) completed a questionnaire seeking information on their expectations regarding a proposal to increase their functional flexibility. It was proposed that beliefs concerning the unfavorability of outcomes of the intervention would be correlated with a range of biographical, affective, and job content variables. Multivariate analyses revealed that the scope of an employees' existing job and biographical variables (apart from age) were not generally predictive of attitudes to functional flexibility. Rather, unfavorable attitudes were weakly associated with low levels of extrinsic satisfaction, perceived reward equity, aspiration organizational commitment, and age. The implications of these findings for work and skills restructuring interventions and organizational change in general are discussed.

Title: Organizational Obstacles: Links with Financial Performance, Customer Satisfaction, and Job Satisfaction in a Service Environment
Author-Name: Karen A. Brown

Abstract: A model was developed to describe the roles of organizational obstacles (social and technical) in relation to three types of performance outcomes (customer satisfaction, financial performance, and employee job satisfaction), as well as to various moderators associated with different job types (e.g., customer contact, organizational commitment). In a test of this model, employee perceptions of organizational obstacles were measured in a retail banking environment. For employees in highest contact with customers (i.e., tellers), reports of co-worker obstacles, work environment obstacles, and workbreak scheduling obstacles were associated with lower levels of customer satisfaction. However, there was very little relationship between tellers' perceptions of obstacles and tellers' job satisfaction. For employees in positions associated with more experience and commitment (i.e., account representatives), information timeliness obstacles were linked with higher customer satisfaction, while materials, workspace s...

Title: The Influence of Cognitive and Affective Based Job Satisfaction Measures on the Relationship Between Satisfaction and Organizational Citizenship Behavior
Author-Name: Robert H. Moorman
Abstract: One of the most widely believed maxims of management is that a happy worker is a productive worker. However, most research on the nature of the relationship between job satisfaction and job performance has not yielded convincing evidence that such a relationship exists to the degree most managers believe. One reason for this might lie in the way in which job performance is measured. Numerous studies have been published that showed that using Organizational Citizenship Behavior to supplant more traditional measures of job performance has resulted in a more robust relationship between job satisfaction and job performance. Yet, recent work has suggested that the relationship between job satisfaction and citizenship may be more complex than originally reported. This study investigated whether the relationship between job satisfaction and citizenship could depend upon the nature of the job satisfaction measure used. Specifically, it was hypothesized that job satisfaction measures which reflect a cognitive basi...

Title: Chaos Theory and Its Implications for Social Science Research
Author-Name: Hal Gregersen
Author-Name: Lee Sailer
Abstract: Based on theoretical and mathematical principles of chaos theory, we argue that the customary social science goals of "prediction" and "control" of systems behavior are sometimes, if not usually, unobtainable. Specifically, chaos theory shows how it is possible for nearly identical entities embedded in identical environments to exhibit radically different behaviors, even when the underlying systems are extremely simple and completely deterministic. Furthermore, chaos theory arguments are general enough to apply to any type of entity, including individuals, groups, and organizations, and therefore they are relevant to a large domain of social science problems. As a result, this paper concludes with six familiar claims about the study of social phenomena for which chaos theory provides new theoretical arguments.

Title: The Concept of Intergroup Mirroring: Reality or Illusion?
Author-Name: Susan A. Wheelan
Author-Name: Marcia Abraham
Abstract: The purpose of this research was to investigate the viability of intergroup mirroring as a theoretical construct. Mirroring is said to occur when two or more groups operating within the same social system act in similar ways. The Institutional Event of a Group Relations Conference was the focus of study. The staff group and two member groups were audiotaped. Each group met five times and each session was 11/2 hours in length. A content analysis method was used to determine the conversational themes in each group. Seven major themes were identified in this manner. The findings suggested that mirroring occurred among the groups in both the total amount of minutes and the percentage of actual group time spent in discussion of the various themes. Mirroring was also noted during simultaneously occurring sessions but infrequently. In addition, the groups became more aligned over time with regard to developmental processes and their responses to focal issues. Intergroup mirroring was evident in the overall discu...

Abstract: This study aimed to determine whether widely-used personality test scores would be significantly related to the actual ratings of managers' performance in two different cultures. Chinese and European middle and senior management of an Asian-based international airline completed the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) which was related to reliable, behavioral ratings of the managers actual managerial practices (innovation, direction, support, decision making, planning, commitment, and participation) and departmental organizational climate (recognition, participation, unit-relations, standard maintenance, clarity, inter-unit communications, and inter-unit relations). The internal reliability of these measures was first checked and then both sets of scales were correlated with the four dimensions arising from the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator - separately for the European expatriates and local Chinese managers. Because there were major cultural (and to a lesser extent gender) differences on the MBTI but not the...

Title: Lessons from the National Alliance of Business Compact Project: Business and Public Education Reform
Author-Name: Sandra A. Waddock
Abstract: This paper reports on some of the key outcomes of the National Alliance of Business's Compact Project, a 12-city demonstration project intended to establish collaborations among businesses, public schools, and government. Factors related to problem recognition, definition and crystallization, the macroenvironmental context, and the emergence of a systemic orientation toward school improvement are associated with more and less successful outcomes. Reframing processes pervade development of a vision about education, the ways in which institutions relate to each other, as well as their orientation toward solving educational problems. More successful cities in the project adopted a systemic approach rather than more limited programmatic efforts to change the schools.

Abstract: The associations between work demands, supports, and levels of psychological and physical health have been clearly established by research. There is growing evidence that occupational stressors are transmitted to spouses, with a possible subsequent effect on disease risks and life expectancy of both marital partners. The present study investigates the extent and direction of occupational stress transmission and the possible psychological mechanisms in a survey of 60 working couples. It analyzes the relationships between partners' psychological strain levels, investigates the accuracy of couples perceptions of each other's work stressors, and analyzes the complex interrelationships between an individual's work and the mental well-being of their spouse. Results show that work-related discussion is frequent among marital partners and that individuals have accurate perceptions of their partners' jobs. The study found evidence of transmission of stress from men to women, particularly where men have high strain...

Abstract: To investigate the controversy between universal and contingent approaches to corporate change, a study was undertaken of 13 service sector organizations. The study used the Dunphy/Stace contingency model of organizational change strategies, developing measures to place the organizations within the model. Results indicate that universal models of change management are inadequate to describe the diversity of approaches actually used by these organizations. In particular, the traditional Organizational Development model is unrepresentative of how change in many contemporary organizations is actually made. The traditional OD model prescribes incremental change combined with a participative management style but most organizations in the study made rapid transformative change using a directive leadership style. The OD model is also inadequate as a prescriptive model because very different change strategies, some dramatically different from OD, resulted in successful financial performance. Four case studies are...

The sociology of enclave development provides the context for understanding the development of the larger Cuban-owned businesses in Dade County. The results indicate the sources of power upon which the entrepreneurs were able to draw, particularly their motivation and ability to use various forms of "Latin connections" with respect to suppliers, employees, and markets. The development of this enclave supporting entrepreneurial initiatives has implications for the potential for entrepreneurship in various communities in the post-Soviet world.

Abstract: Using data from a study of 114 Canadian companies conducted in 1990/91, this paper assesses the impact of new information technology on the job quality of white-collar workers. Results indicated that while both female and male employees experienced significant increases in job quality subsequent to the introduction of new IT, females experienced significantly larger increases than males. This occurred because clerical and secretarial employees experienced much larger increases in job quality than did professional/technical employees or managerial employees.

Abstract: Saving and borrowing are traditionally and stereotypically thought of as opposites, with different motivations and consequences. Through a questionnaire survey of economic position, practices, and attitudes, the present paper examined the relation between saving and borrowing among British respondents. While saving and borrowing were found to be determined by different economic, social, and psychological factors, they did not describe mutually exclusive strategies of financial management. Saving regularly could also be distinguished from having savings. In all, six strategies were identified (combining saving or not saving, borrowing or not borrowing, and having or not having savings). Each combination was found to have specific discriminating characteristics. Savers and borrowers were found to have different psychological motivations, seeing debt either as a failure or as a normal part of everyday life. Many people retained savings or carried on saving at the same time as having debts: they were found to...

Title: Gender and Turnover: A Re-examination of the Impact of Sex on Intent and Actual Job Changes
Author-Name: Jacob Weisberg
Author-Name: Alan Kirschenbaum
Abstract: Gender as a correlate of turnover has been inconclusive as a factor in understanding the development of a turnover decision. Yet, it is a decisive factor in the operation of key labor market processes which directly affect the entry and exit of labor to and from work organizations. Two possible conceptual and methodological explanations for this seemingly contradictory situation are proposed which distinguish "intent" from "actual turnover" and disaggregate male and female components of the "sex" variable. The lower and less consistent labor force participation rates of women in contrast to men led us to hypothesize that actual turnover behavior and intent to leave will be gender-specific, as well as influenced by differing sets of labor market and work environment factors. Three propositions testing these hypothesized relationships between gender and "intent" and "actual turnover" were examined. A representative sample of 506 textile workers located at 15 separate worksites was examined. A series of logi...

Abstract: The job satisfaction model embedded in the Price-Mueller turnover model was revised and estimated. The revised model examined the effects of a series of environmental, job characteristics, and personality variables that were excluded from the Price-Mueller model. Two-wave longitudinal data were collected from 405 employees of a 327-bed Veterans Administration Medical Center. Four different models representing refinements of the proposed model were estimated using LISREL maximum likelihood methods. The exclusion of important job characteristics (role conflict, supervisory support, and task significance) by the Price-Mueller model was not found to have a significant impact on the explanatory power of the revised model. However, the exclusion of an environmental factor (opportunity) and a personality variable (positive affectivity) was found to be a serious omission. Overall, it was found that the degree to which employees like their job is influenced by a combination of characteristics of the environment (o...

Title: Economics as an Imperialist Social Science
Author-Name: Peter J. Buckley
Author-Name: Mark Casson
Abstract: Economics is far more versatile than its critics believe. It is a method of analysis and not just a field of study. The method is to combine two core assumptions-individual optimization and equilibrium-with various sets of specific assumptions adapted to different fields of application. The method is applicable not only to the market system but also the social and political environment within which this system is embedded. Social and psychological insights can be encapsulated in the specification of interdependent preferences, which hold the key to modelling all kinds of institutional behavior in rational terms.

Title: Mirrors, Butterflies, and Training Policy
Author-Name: Judith Marquand
Abstract: Training holds a central place in the activities required to enable an economy to change and grow, but because it relates largely to process and changing capacity over time, it is an area where the limitations of traditional economics as an aid to decision-making are readily seen. Examples are given of practical areas where the narrow methodologies of neo-classical economics are unable to analyze training in a way which is useful for policy purposes. The abandonment of the view that theory can provide a perfect mirror of nature allows appraisal of the common sense view of the training professional. A broad range of social science methodologies can be applied to the analysis of the economic aspects of training. Economics itself has a contribution to made, but a limited one. Most of the problems of training policy today are much the same across industrialized countries and concern the different institutional responses to similar challenges. The search for good procedures in training policy, as in other area...

Abstract: This paper examines the "new institutional economics" approach to organizational analysis. Whilst acknowledging the benefits of the approach, especially in micro analysis, the paper discusses five areas of difficulty: the fundamental concepts of transaction and bounded rationality; the inadequate treatment of power relations; the over-simplified treatment of norms and values; the ahistorical treatment of organizational context; and the problematic status of functional explanations. The paper argues instead for an interest-interdependence approach, building upon the work of Blau and more recently Coleman.

The utility of the contract model is illustrated empirically using a large data set on organizations and their employees in U.S. and Japanese manufacturing industries. The results are consistent with many transaction cost and agency theory predictions, though they also indicate the need to supplement these economic theories with sociological explanations based on political, cultural, and other institutional differences.

Title: Studied Trust: Building New Forms of Cooperation in a Volatile Economy
Author-Name: Charles F. Sabel
Abstract: The understandings of individuality and sociability characteristic of modern liberal and sociological social theory are fatalistic about the potential for the creation of trust in economic relations. These understandings are reconsidered in light of the recent evolution of state-level industrial policy in the United States, focusing on the experience of the state of Pennsylvania where the state's efforts have shown early success in breaking down barriers of mistrust that block economic adjustment in the state's traditional manufacturing industries. Arguing that the sort of cooperation-in-the-making that characterizes the Pennsylvania case is ill-captured by mainstream theory, the paper proffers a notion of studied or vigilant trust based on the core conclusions of 20th century analytic philosophy as a way of squaring theory and stylized facts. Government-instigated discussion among key economic actors has the potential to spur reformulations of collective identities and common histories, resulting in the ...

Title: Organizational Contexts and Contingent Leadership Roles: A Theoretical Exploration
Author-Name: Kathryn K. Egglestonl
Author-Name: Rabi S. Bhagat
Abstract: This paper advances the premise that leadership roles are contingent upon the requirements of evolving organizational contexts. Leadership's substantive and symbolic role aspects are reinterpreted in a conceptual model. Emphasis is given to leadership roles in situations of decline. A transition state is proposed to illustrate the volatile and unstable nature of decline contexts. In a transition state, leaders are predicted to emphasize both their symbolic and substantive roles. During more stable convergent time periods, leaders are predicted to primarily emphasize their symbolic roles while in times of major organizational reorientation, leaders are predicted to primarily emphasize their substantive roles. A conceptual model is developed to provide a framework for understanding the contingent relationship between leadership roles and the organizational context particularly in situations of decline. Some implications of this model are discussed.

Title: Organizational Innovations in a Long-Term Perspective: Legitimacy and Souls-of-Fire as Critical Factors of Change and Viability
Author-Name: Torbjorn Stjernberg
Author-Name: Ake Philips
Abstract: What may be learned from organizational innovations in a long-term perspective? This article is based on eight studies over a period of 10-20 years. An insurance department is used as an illustrative and representative case. The department manager was a successful soul-of-fire (i.e., champion) during the change process. The continuous defense of the organization's values and culture distanced him from the rest of the company. Legitimacy (especially top management acceptance) is something that has to be continuously regenerated. The soul-of-fire faces two major dilemmas: first, the learning dilemma, i.e., the need to balance the efforts for internal learning and development in the unit with diffusion activities and the creation of external legitimacy; second, the change dilemma, i.e., the need to balance the direction and control of change with support for employee autonomy and influence.

Title: Scholarly Dialogues and Participatory Action Research
Author-Name: Jean M. Bartunekl
Abstract: This paper addresses two issues that are pertinent to the papers in the special issue on Participatory Action Research. The first is the conceptual contributions of the papers. The more explicit these contributions the more dialogue they enable with researchers beyond the action research tradition. The second is the extent to which intervention participants have a say in the scholarly presentations of the interventions. The greater the scholarly dialogue between action researchers and participants the more complete the description of the interventions.

Title: Logos and Eros: The Vital Syzygy for Understanding Human Relations and Organizational Action
Author-Name: M. L. Bowles
Abstract: The paper assesses the relationship between eros and logos, or what stereotypically are commonly referred to as feminine and masculine, in the way they are expressed in contemporary organizations. It is argued that a scientific culture defines an organizational reality where logos monopolizes the consciousness of everyday experience. This creates a lopsidedness which manifests itself in the partiality of human experience. History and myth are used to explore the directions with which logos achieved its supremacy. The deficiencies of current organizations are used to argue that a wider frame of reference is required for those who manage them.

Title: Business Strategy and Interorganizational Linkages Within the Acute Care Hospital Industry: An Expansion of the Miles and Snow Typology
Author-Name: R. I. Beekun
Author-Name: G. O. Ginn
Abstract: This survey study of acute care hospitals expands Miles and Snow's (1978) strategy gestalts by drawing from the literature on strategic choice, resource dependence, and loose coupling. Building upon the resource dependence perspective, we hypothesize that interorganizational coupling patterns will differ by strategy type. We also contend that different configurations of inter-organizational coupling are involved within each Miles and Snow strategy type when an organization deals with increasing environmental turbulence. The responses of 58 chief executive officers of acute care hospitals indicate that the strategy gestalts associated with Miles and Snow's typology have distinctive patterns or interorganizational coupling.

Title: Involvement, Motivation, and Reorganization in a Social Services Department

Abstract: This article reports aspects of research in the reorganization of a local government social services department. It focuses on the issues of involvement, participation, and motivation, utilizing classic and contemporary concepts as a basis for discussing the empirical evidence. It is argued that the intention to allow greater participation foundered on the paradox that these changes lacked the explicit direction which became necessary in the context of sudden changes in the wider political and organizational environment. In conclusion, it is suggested that this case study shows a need for explicit leadership and direction if participation is to be fostered in hierarchical work organizations as a means of creating motivated staff and external contributors to the services provided.

Title: Purgatory or Place of Safety? The Managerial Plateau and Organizational Agegrading
Author-Name: Nigel Nicholson
Abstract: The managerial plateau is generally assumed to be problematic for organizations, generated by motives for advancement outstripping opportunities for upward mobility. However, previous research has used unitary criteria for plateauing of untested validity, and failed to examine the phenomenon contextually by taking account of internal labor market characteristics. Measurement of agegrading was used to address these problems. Drawing upon a sample of 4000 managers at various levels of a large corporation the present study had three objectives. First, in setting out to evaluate the characteristics of the internal labor market, results showed patterns consistent with a partial "tournament" career system, but also that different career systems may coexist within the single organization, through advancement criteria differing across company levels. Second, in aiming to assess the relationships between conventional plateau criteria and agegrading, agegrading was found to covary with the more widely used criteria...

Abstract: An important aspect of corporate culture is its ability to influence relationship dynamics. This article examines how organizational stories can be used to study often unstated and perhaps unconscious codes for resolving conflicts, approaching decision-making, determining perceptions of positive and negative organizational forces, guiding role behavior, and the like. Stories are also defined, prior research is described, and the advantages and disadvantages in using this technique are discussed. We explain how our methodology can uncover comparative relationship patterns for human resource development professionals and business leaders in Fortune 500 companies.

Title: Organizational Change and Barriers to Innovation: A Case Study in The Italian Public Sector
Author-Name: Jennifer Landau
Abstract: This study describes the introduction of a new working organization in an administrative office of the Italian public sector. Staff members actively contributed and realized their ideas to improve service and increase organizational flexibility. These improvements resulted in a paradox: they went unrecognized by the staff members themselves who moreover sabotaged them to reproduce the organizational malfunctions existent prior to the changes. This study aims to understand both why staff members rejected the changes that they themselves had proposed and why they sought to return to their previous situation. The analysis seeks to shed light on the importance of individual recognition for the public employee and how this variable influences both barriers to, and opportunities for, innovation in the public service organization.

Title: Dual-Earner Couples in Singapore: An Examination of Work and Nonwork Sources of Their Experienced Burnout
Author-Name: Samuel Aryeel
Abstract: Based on data obtained from 95 dual-earner couples in Singapore, the study reported here examined a model of work and nonwork stressors as determinants of burnout. The model was underpinned by a conceptualization of burnout as emanating from the differential social roles performed by men and women within a gender stratified social structure. T-test, path, and moderated multiple regression analyses were used to examine the hypothesized relationships. Three findings were salient. First, wives reported significantly more burnout than husbands. Second, burnout in wives was influenced by both work and nonwork stressors while burnout in husbands was influenced only by work stressors. Third, the effect of job-spouse conflict on burnout in wives was moderated by quality of spouse experience. In general, the model was better able to predict burnout in wives (R = .34) than in husbands (R2 = .16). Limitations of the study, implications of the findings and directions for future studies are discussed.

Author-Name: James E. Everett
Abstract: This paper uses a method of citation analysis to examine the flow of knowledge between Human Relations and its most closely neighboring journals. Loglinear analysis of the citations for the period 1986-1990 is used to model the asymmetric citation matrix as a product of “importance” and “receptivity” vectors and a symmetric “similarity” matrix. The similarities are investigated by cluster analysis, and multidimensional scaling is used to produce a map of the journals. The results provide objective evidence about the sources and destinations of developments in the academic fields with which Human Relations is concerned. Potential applications of the method to the study of other human and organizational interrelationships are also discussed.

Abstract: This study used a quasi-experimental design to assess the effectiveness of self-managing teams in a telecommunications company. These teams performed customer service, technical support, administrative support, and managerial functions in a variety of locations. The balance of evidence indicates that self-managing teams were more effective than comparable traditionally-managed groups that performed the same type of work. The study illustrates the value of a collaborative research project in which researchers and clients jointly define the research questions, study design, and methods.

Title: Is Computer-Mediated Communication Intrinsically Apt to Enhance Democracy in Organizations?
Author-Name: Giuseppe Mantovani
Abstract: Recent studies on social and organizational processes involved in computer-mediated communication (CMC) are discussed. A technological deterministic approach, which views CMC as inherently apt to support democracy in organizations, is challenged. Claims about equal access, overcoming socialbarriers, openness and de-individuation, are critically examined with reference to up-to-date literature. Our point, consistent with sociotechnical theory, is that CMC, especially in E-mail use, can alter rhythms and patterns of social interactions in ways both powerful and pervasive, neither positive nor negative in themselves, but shaped by local contexts of use. Stress on social identity processes involved in CMC is suggested as relevant to further research.

Title: Who Gets Involved in Collective Action?: Social Psychological Determinants of                 Individual Participation in Trade Unions
Author-Name: Caroline Kelly
Author-Name: John Kelly
Abstract: This study examined social psychological factors associated with willingness to participate in collective action. These factors were group identification, collectivist orientation, outgroup stereotyping, perceived intergroup conflict, egoistic and collective relative deprivation, and political efficacy. Three hundred and fifty members of a trade union completed questionnaires where items measured these factors along with their prospective participation in a range of union activities. Regression analyses indicated that the most significant correlate of participation was the strength of the respondent's sense of group identification. Other significant correlates were collectivist orientation and the degree to which the outgroup (management) was perceived in a stereotypical fashion. Further analyses were undertaken to examine the possible moderating effect of group identification on the relationships between independent and dependent variables. These indicated a broadly similar pattern of results for both st...

Title: Social and Technological Characteristics of Coal-Face Work: A Temporal and                 Spatial Analysis
Author-Name: Jonathan Winterton
Abstract: This paper offers a re-evaluation of the Tavistock studies of coal mining during the 1950s by analyzing their relevance to the social and technological characteristics of coal-face work before and after the studies. The historical analysis draws upon documentary evidence, while the study of contemporary changes in coal-face work has involved a decade of interviews with miners, mining engineers, managers and union officials, supplemented with underground visits. The specific recommendations of the Tavistock work are shown to have been made redundant by technological change, but their wider relevance is demonstrated both in relation to understanding earlier technological developments and in identifying weaknesses in the present organization of face work. Had the lessons of the Tavistock experiments been incorporated in the design of new technologies of coal production and the organization of face work, more human-centered work could have evolved without sacrificing improvements in productivity.

Abstract: Over 12,000 young people from 41 countries on all five continents completed questionnaires measuring such things as the work ethic, achievement motivation, competitiveness, and attitudes to money and saving. Attitudes to competitiveness, money, and saving were clearly and logically related to gross domestic product and economic growth over a 10-year period. The European nations (N = 16) had lower scores on these dimensions than the non-European nations (N = 27). Countries from North and South America scored highest on work ethic and mastery while Far and Middle Eastern countries' young people reported highest competitiveness and acquisitiveness for money. These results are discussed in terms of the limited research in this field.

Author-Name: Gary N. Powell
Abstract: The effects of managerial and professional employees' (N = 188) perceptions of sex-based preferential selection and discrimination on their job attitudes were examined. As expected, men and women had negative job attitudes when they believed that selection practices discriminated against their own sex. Contrary to previous findings, however, both men and women had more positive job attitudes when their own sex was given preferential treatment than when decisions were sex-neutral. Overall, there was no support for the notion that preferential treatment has a negative effect on the job attitudes of its intended beneficiaries.

Title: Patterns of Differential Assimilation and Acculturation for Women in Business Organizations
Author-Name: Jacqueline N. Hood
Author-Name: Christine S. Koberg
Abstract: This article reviews cross-cultural studies on adaptation, specifically acculturation and assimilation, in the context of the literature on organizational culture and develops a conceptual model of women's current status in organizations. A cultural perspective that goes beyond person-and situation-centered theories helps to account for the gender gap in management. The cultural perspective suggests that it is possible for women, like other marginal persons, to acculturate to the organization without being assimilated into it. This article proposes a classification of differential patterns of adaptation for women in business organizations and suggests some options for changing the culture itself in order to mitigate the effects of the differences.

Title: Work/Family Fit as a Mediator of Work Factors on Marital Tension: Evidence from the Interface of Greedy Institutions
Author-Name: Joe F. Piftman
Abstract: This study tests the notion that the relation between work hours and marital quality is mediated by the perceived fit between work and family. A structural model was developed to examine this hypothesis in a sample of 407 male U.S. Army members and their wives, where both spouses' perceptions of the husband's work are considered. A sample of military families was used for this study because, at the interface between "greedy institutions" (Coser, 1974), the clash of demands between the role domains of work and family may be accentuated. Strong support for the mediation hypothesis was obtained. Actual work hours were unrelated to marital tension, and predicted only wives' satisfaction with husbands' work hours and with husbands' work settings. For husbands, satisfaction with work hours and job satisfaction were positively related to work/family fit, which, in turn, negatively predicted marital tension. No direct associations were seen for work variables on marital tension, but significant indirect relations...

Title: A Taxonomy of Behavioral Strategies for Coping with Work-Home Role Conflict
Author-Name: Uco J. Wiersma
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to catalogue specific behavioral strategies used by dual-career couples to solve work-home role conflicts in each of seven broad areas: domestic chores, maintaining social relations, role cycling, job relocations, sex-role socialization, social pressure, and direct competition between spouses. Twenty-four men and women from dual-career families were interviewed using the critical incident method. Results show that six of the seven dimensions could be supported empirically with behaviorally defined solutions; the exception being sex-role socialization. Differences between the results of this study and those of previous studies which have investigated coping behaviors are discussed, and suggestions are offered as to how the findings may be of help to practitioners.

Abstract: Promotion decisions of 197 managers (63 males, 134 females) from a large not-for-profit organization were investigated using a dependency perspective. Both performance level and organizational connections of a subordinate influenced promotion decisions. Subordinate influence attempts had an impact on promotion recommendations only when a manager was aware of a subordinate's organizational connections. Potential subordinate turnover did not influence promotion decisions by managers. The implications of this study for both practice and research are discussed.

Abstract: The literature on male-female differences in union attitudes and preferences in the U.S. is reviewed. Considerable ambiguity exists with regard to differences in the union attitudes and voting behavior of men and women. Preliminary research was undertaken to compare the union voting behavior of professional and subprofessional men and women. Traditional male/female differences were found within blue-/pink-collar occupational groupings, while the reported voting behavior of male and female professional level workers in the same organization did not vary. Possible reasons for the findings are suggested.

Title: The Effects of Absence Culture on Individual Absence
Author-Name: Joseph J. Martocchio
Abstract: This field study provided empirical evidence for the effects of absence culture on individual absenteeism among employees (N = 264) within five clerical units. Absence culture was derived from the aggregation of an individual-level measure of the beliefs about the perceived costs (i.e., deterrent outcomes) and benefits (i.e., encouraging outcomes) of being absent from work. It was hypothesized that these individual beliefs about absence could be aggregated meaningfully to the unit level. In addition, it was hypothesized that absence culture would explain a significant amount of variance in individual absence beyond the effects of demographics and general work attitudes. Paid and unpaid absence data for the 3-month period following collection of the beliefs measures were collected from organizational records. This study demonstrated support for the existence of an absence culture and its impact on individual absence. Implications for managing absence and suggestions for future research are discussed.

Title: The Relationship Between Interpersonal Attachment Styles and Work Difficulties
Author-Name: Gillian E. Hardy
Author-Name: Michael Barkham
Abstract: Hazan and Shaver (1990) have argued that attachment theory can be used to predict relationships between adult attachment types (love) and aspects of work behavior. They found that anxious/ambivalent attachments were associated with poorer work performance. Avoidantly attached individuals tended to be overinvolved with work which resulted in effective work performance but disrupted home life. The present study aimed to develop scales of insecure attachment problems for use with a clinical population and to further replicate Hazan and Shaver's findings. In this context the study also looked at the effects of psychological interventions on attachment difficulties. Using data from 219 depressed clients receiving psychological treatment for stress at work, differences in orientation to work were associated with the two insecure attachment groups as predicted. The anxious/ambivalent scale correlated significantly with reported anxiety about work performance and relationships at work. In contrast, the avoidant s...

Title: The Relative Influence of Life Events and Hassles on Work-Related Injuries: Some Australian Evidence
Author-Name: Lawson K. Savery
Author-Name: Mark Wooden
Abstract: Using data collected from over 1400 employees from 61 different workplaces, this study investigates the relative importance of stressful life events and daily hassles for the occurrence of injuries within the workplace. A multivariate model of the factors associated with injury occurrence is developed and estimated using probit regression techniques. The results provide strong support for the hypothesis that stress contributes to injuries in the workplace. More importantly, the observed relationship between stress and injuries is found to be far stronger for a measure of stress based on the frequency of daily hassles than it is for a measure based on the occurrence of stressful life events. The results are argued to have at least two implications for stress management interventions in the workplace: first, such interventions should be directed toward the management of extra-organizational stressors, not just stressors within the workplace; and second, intervention programs should give priority to improvin...

Title: Attributions for Job Termination and Psychological Distress
Author-Name: Michael V. Miller
Author-Name: Sue Keir Hoppe
Abstract: The nature of job termination and causal attribution for termination were examined for their association with psychological distress among a sample of working-class men in San Antonio, Texas who had recently become unemployed. Laid-off workers were found to experience significantly lower levels of distress than fired workers, largely because the former overwhelmingly defined job loss as a function of the economy. The fired typically attributed job loss to unfair treatment by employers, and they, like the laid off who made similar attributions, indicated significant distress. Psychological reactivity was by far the highest among fired and laid-off workers who reported having been unjustly terminated because of personal shortcomings or deficiencies. Contrary to conventional thought, job loss self-blame was not found to be associated with high levels of distress.

Author-Name: Mouraine R. Baker
Author-Name: Jong-Wook Ko
Abstract: Studies have hypothesized conflicting results regarding the effect of actors' interpersonal attachment on commitment to the encompassing large group. The cohesion approach hypothesizes that interpersonal attachment among actors will enhance group cohesiveness, which produces more commitment to the large group. In contrast, the subgroup approach predicts that interpersonal attachment among actors will contribute more to subgroup fragmentation which sets up barriers to actors' commitment to the large group. We derive hypotheses from these opposing approaches and test the hypotheses over a sample of 1621 employees drawn from 62 work organizations in Korea. The empirical tests indicate the following: (1) Interpersonal attachment among employees in local work units is shown to have a positive effect on commitment to the work organization encompassing the work units. (2) Interpersonal attachment between dissimilar positions in the same work units is shown to have a more positive effect on commitment than that b...

Abstract: This study investigates organizational and environmental determinants of functional and dysfunctional turnover. Functional turnover is negatively associated with levels of pay and unemployment and positively associated with the availability of individual incentive programs. Dysfunctional turnover is positively associated with the presence of group incentive programs and negatively associated with the presence of unions. The implications of these findings are explored.

Title: The Information Technology Field: Using Fields and Paradigms for Analyzing Technological Change
Author-Name: Andrew L. Friedman
Abstract: The technology field is proposed as a concept which will allow us to analyze the history of substantial technologies and to make predictions about future developments. The history of information technology is analyzed as an example of a technology field. The technology field gives place both to "supply-side," "natural," technological trajectories, and to "demand-side" socioeconomic factors. Unlike the recently developed concept of technological paradigm, the technology field directs our attention to issues of management and work organization which accompany the diffusion of a major new technology.

Title: Exploring Issues in Culture and Competence
Author-Name: John McAuley
Abstract: A key element of Organizational Culture is members understanding of the nature of competence and the ways in which different constructions of competence are created by members and are negotiated. Within organizations and as a component of culture, understandings of competence have political, moral, and ethical dimensions. In this paper, there is an exploration of the complex relationships between competence and culture and the way they impact on managing organizations. The author has taken two idealizations of organizational culture that is corporate culture (in which there is an emphasis on management control and the "management of meaning") and the ensemble culture (in which management is seen as a concern for the preservation of members autonomy and in which meaning is emergent) and shows how in both cases psychodynamic issues generate turbulence such that idealization and recipes describing competence are called into question.

Title: Acculturation in Acquired Organizations: A Force-Field Perspective
Author-Name: Priscilla M. Elsass
Author-Name: John F. Veiga
Abstract: The acculturation process involved when one organization is acquired by another, and the two organizational cultures merge, has not been adequately conceptualized in the strategic management literature. It is argued here that the acculturation process can be more fully understood by utilizing Lewin's (1951) force-field approach. In addition, major forces of cultural differentiation and organizational integration are identified. It is also argued that the dynamic acculturative change process will both influence and be influenced by postacquisition organizational performance. Predictions as to how post-acquisition performance influences subsequent acculturation modes are offered.

Abstract: The direct and indirect costs of occupational stress can be measured in both humanistic and financial terms. Therefore, financially healthy organizations are likely to be those which are successful in maintaining and retaining a workforce characterized by good physical, psychological, and mental health. In drawing upon recent empirical studies, this paper examines a wide range of issues including: factors intrinsic to the job, corporate culture, managerial style, style of work organization and physical layout, home/work interface, etc., which impact on employee health and well-being, and so determine the financial health and profitability of the organization. It also addresses the efficacy of various intervention strategies in reducing employee stress, and their implications for organizational practices and human resource policies.

Abstract: This paper presents a career specialization typology that is specifically designed to assess a CEO's career specialization, but more generally can be used to assess other top executives' career specialization as well. The typology is based on the results of a study involving 544 chief executive officers of Fortune 1000 companies. The typology integrates the functional and institutional specializations of the executives into a single typology of career specialization and empirically groups the executives into one of three career "types" based on their functional and institutional specializations.

Abstract: Data obtained with a questionnaire instrument from managerial employees (N = 200) in Singapore were used to examine some antecedents of subjective career success. The choice of antecedents was informed by recent calls to place research on career issues in the context of an individual's life roles. Confirmatory factor analysis (LISREL VII) was used to examine the one-factor and three-factor models hypothesized to underlie the subjective career success data. The results revealed a three-factor model to have adequate fit statistics - financial and hierarchical success, and career satisfaction. The antecedent sets of human capital, work values, family and structural or work variables accounted for over 40% of the explained variance in each career success dimension. While the career success dimensions were influenced by different variables, individual-organizational value congruity, quality of parental role and internal labor market emerged as consistent antecedents of the career success dimensions.

Title: The Interpersonal Octagon: An Alternative to the Interpersonal Circle
Author-Name: John Birtchnell
Abstract: If humans have evolved from earlier animals, there must be a common core of relating which runs from the simplest to the most complex, which is capable of multiple adaptations and variations. This is represented by the interpersonal octagon, constructed around the two nodal points of a dimension concerned with regulating distance, the two nodal points of a dimension concerned with relative power, and four intermediate points. Each point is associated with a relating objective called a state of relatedness. This is attained or maintained either by relating or being related to. People acquire relating competencies and establish sources and stores of each state. Emotional responses are linked with the successful attainment, danger of losing, or actual loss of states. Maladaptive forms of relating may be egocentric, insecure, or avoidant. Interrelating is the process by which two people reconcile their respective relating objectives.

Title: Understanding Our Differences: Performance in Decision-Making Groups with Diverse Members
Author-Name: Martha L. Maznevski
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to develop a model to explain performance in decision-making groups characterized by high diversity in composition. It begins with a brief discussion on the nature and effects of diversity. Previous research on group performance is then reviewed with the general conclusion that diverse groups perform less well than homogeneous ones do. This conclusion is challenged by closely examining a small group of studies specifically researching the effects of diversity, and it is shown that diversity can enhance a group's performance if it is integrated. Communication is proposed as an integrating mechanism, and a theory of communication in terms of preconditions is described. This theory is then used to develop propositions concerning the relationships among diversity, integration, and performance in decision-making groups. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

Title: Self-Organization in Small Groups: A Study of Group Effectiveness Within Non-Equilibrium Conditions
Author-Name: Charles Smith
Author-Name: Debra Comer
Abstract: Dissipative self-organization, a theoretical framework with roots in physics and biochemistry, has often been proposed as having relevance to change in social systems. Specifically, the processes and design features associated with dissipative self-organization have been used to describe the dynamics of social groups and organizations, especially in cases where highly turbulent and/or near-chaos conditions are present. A study assessing the usefulness of the self-organization paradigm as applied to the small group is described herein. The study took place within the context of a Tavistock-like group intervention, wherein the necessary condition for self-organization, a situation of turbulence, was induced within experimental groups. Based upon an approach suggested by Ackoff (1981), the general self-organization model served as a hypothetical idealized design of a self-organizing task group. A quasi-experimental design provided a test of whether the presence of self-organizing characteristics made any dif...

Title: The Gender We Think, The Gender We Do in Our Everyday Organizational Lives
Author-Name: Silvia Gherardi
Abstract: We “do gender” while we are at work, while we produce an organizational culture and its rules governing what is fair in the relationship between the sexes. The inner ambiguity of gender construction is expressed in the dilemma: how can we do gender without second-sexing the female? The management of cross-gendered situations (dual presence) is based on a two-stage ritual involving the ceremonial work of paying homage to the symbolic order of gender (a deep trans-psychic structure) and the remedial work of repairing the inequality inherent in gender difference. Studying the ambiguity of gender symbols enables us to use indirect speech and discoursively to change gender relationships in organizations.

Title: Gender Differences in Clerical Workers' Disputes over Tasks, Interpersonal                 Treatment, and Emotion
Author-Name: Patricia A. Gwartney-Gibbs
Author-Name: Denise H. Lach
Abstract: Although more than a quarter of American women work in clerical and administrative support jobs, little is known about the day-to-day experience of clerical work. We explore workplace dispute resolution among women and men clerical workers, focusing on how they define and resolve “personality conflicts.” “Personality conflict” is a label women clerical workers tend to use more than men to describe disputes over how tasks should be accomplished, interpersonal treatment, and emotional issues. In-depth interview data from two contrasting firms indicate that institutional dispute processing forums (a union-negotiated grievance procedure in “Firm A” and an open-door policy in “Firm B”) are ill-equipped to handle personality conflicts, causing women to laterally transfer, which in turn reduces their human capital. We suggest that workplace dispute resolution is an intra-organizational process which may create, maintain, or nullify employment inequality.

Title: Gendering Organizational Change: The Case of Relate, 1948-1990
Author-Name: Jane Lewis
Author-Name: David H. J. Morgan
Abstract: In this paper we argue for the need to develop a gendered understanding of processes of organizational change. However, this should not simply be seen as a question of the proportions of women and men at different levels in the hierarchy. Organizational culture and the gendered metaphors and rhetorics that are used within the organization are also shown to be significant. Our analysis focuses upon a single case, a historical and sociological study of Relate, formerly the National Marriage Guidance Council. This case is especially interesting in that issues of gender inevitably enter into its primary task, the treatment of matital difficulties, and that as a voluntary organization it has employed a high proportion of unpaid women in the key activity of counseling, while the managerial positions have been dominated by men. This organization experienced a period of crisis in the 1980s culminating in the commissioning of a report from a firm of management consultants. We argue that the analysis of organizatio...

Title: Fostering Empowerment, Building Community: The Challenge for State-Funded                 Feminist Organizations
Author-Name: Claire Reinelt
Abstract: Using a case study methodology this paper explores specific ways in which the battered women's movement in Texas was affected by state funding. State funding of movement organizations is a mixed blessing. It allows movement activists to stabilize the funding of their organizations and to have a wider political and social impact. At the same time, state funding expands the organizational field based on available resources, not common ideology. This expansion has the potential to threaten the ideological and political cohesion of the movement. The affects of state funding are mitigated when the movement's leadership has a feminist vision and engages in feminist practices that challenge the bureaucratic and hierarchical practices of the state's decision making structures by empowering movement participants to work together collectively towards common goals.

Author-Name: Amy Erdman Farrell
Abstract: This article explores the attempt by the editors of Ms. magazine, a feminist, mass-circulation, commercial periodical, to create a nonhierarchical, collective-type organization within the context of the mass-media publishing world. Drawing from interviews with the former editors and writers of Ms., published “Personal Reports,” and the editorial files collected at the Sophia Smith Archives, this article focuses on the tensions that emerged in constructing an egalitarian organization. The study finds that the primary transformations occurred within the editorial side of the magazine, though splits between women's movement-identified editors and women's magazine-identified editors made these changes more difficult than they had originally imagined. Few attempts were made to alter the business side of the magazine, which worked primarily as a pipeline to move staff into the world of mainstream (and male) publishing.

Abstract: The major traditions of organizational analysis have not been characterized by a significant and explicit concern with gender, sexuality, and violence. This article considers some of the changing ways in which gender and sexuality are being approached, or indeed avoided, within organizational analysis, and some of the reasons why a focus on gender and sexuality might lead on to the study of the relationship of violence and organizations. This argument is elaborated through the identification of significant questions that need to be addressed in the study of violence and organizations, the illustration of some of these through a case study, and an evaluation of the potentials and limitations of this “violence” perspective for organizational analysis.

Title: Petty Tyranny in Organizations
Author-Name: Blake Ashforth
Abstract: A petty tyrant is defined as one who lords his or her power over others. Preliminary empirical work suggests that tyrannical behaviors include arbitrariness and self-aggrandizement, belittling others, lack of consideration, a forcing style of conflict resolution, discouraging initiative, and noncontingent punishment. A model of the antecedents of tyrannical management and the effects of tyranny on subordinates is presented. Petty tyranny is argued to be the product of interactions between individual predispositions (beliefs about the organization, subordinates, and self, and preferences for action) and situational facilitators (institutionalized values and norms, power, and stressors). Tyrannical management is argued to cause low self-esteem, performance, work unit cohesiveness, and leader endorsement, and high frustration, stress, reactance, helplessness, and work alienation among subordinates. It is further argued that these effects may trigger a vicious circle which sustains the tyrannical behavior. Re...

Abstract: This paper extends earlier research on perceived leader reinforcement behavior and its affective and behavioral correlates. The current study examines relationships among subordinate perceptions of our supervisory ("leader") reinforcement behaviors (contingent and noncontingent reward and punishment behavior) and the five French and Raven (1959) bases of power (reward, coercive, legitimate, expert, and referent power). Based upon the literature, five sets of hypothesized relationships were developed, relating the perceived power bases to the perceived reward and punishment behaviors. Bivariate correlation, stepwise multiple regression, and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed on data obtained from surveys conducted in two large (N = 375, 297) samples. The results supported the positive effects of subordinate-perceived supervisor contingent reward and punishment behavior and the negative effects of noncontingent punishment on subordinate perceptions of their supervisor's power.

Title: Professional/Organizational Commitment and Job Satisfaction for Employed Lawyers
Author-Name: Hugh P. Gunz
Author-Name: Sarah P. Gunz
Abstract: This paper presents the results of a two part field study designed to examine issues of organizational-professional conflict (OPC) amongst employed layers (corporate counsel). The study adopts the Johnson (1972) collegiate/oligarchic typology, and hypothesises that the unexpectedly low OPC found by Aranya and Ferris (1984) amongst employed accountants is a function of the nature of the profession. It replicates the Aranya and Ferris study using subjects from a collegiate profession where, arguably, external reference groups and traditions are more powerful. Using standard multi-variate analysis, the study suggests that for this sample, OPC is no more of an issue than in the Aranya and Ferris study. There was, however, evidence of career factors impacting strongly upon organizational commitment, suggesting that previous ideas on the nature of the link between professionals and their employers are an oversimplification. The theoretical and practical iplications of these findings are discussed.

Abstract: The authors propose that neither the legalistic, adversarial approach, nor the cooperative approach stands alone as the set of practices that constitutes "good quality" union-management relations. In fact, it is suggested that the ideal union-management relationship is one that is "constructive," a term drawn from the conflict literature. Utilizing data gathered with the Quality of Union-Management Relationship (QUMR) Instrument, evidence is provided that six major factors are related to the effectiveness of a union-management relationship. Two of these factors are classified as cooperative, two as adversarial, and two as neutral. A model of union-management relationships is presented.

Author-Name: John Goodman
Abstract: It is now generally agreed that there has been a growth in the extensiveness of employee involvement (El) in Britain in recent years. However, the value of this information is limited because many of the studies rely heavily on management viewpoints about the impact of El. Even when surveys of employee opinion are undertaken, however, the results are typically abstracted from the organizational context in which they are located. In this article, we present information from six organizations collected as part of a larger study on El in Britain. This illustrates that employee attitudes to El are dependent, inter alia, upon the prior experiences which employees have of El and work in general, management's approaches to employee relations, and the recent and projected corporate performance of the organization. This leads us to suggest that El is as much affected by the prevailing organizational culture and environment as it is a source of change. The authors call for more research studies of this kind to be u...

Abstract: Heightened worker autonomy and participation characterize emerging workplace relations in the 1990s. Some analysts fear that, while such relations may make the workplace more hospitable for workers, they may also undermine workers' solidarity and unity. We investigate this thesis using a telephone survey of a random sample of employed persons from a Midwestern state. Participation increases rather than decreases worker solidarity and it is a more important factor in this regard than job autonomy. In addition, participation heightens workers' concerns with organizational injustice. These findings contrast sharply with fears that heightened autonomy and participation will undermine workers' autonomous cultures of solidarity and resistance.

Abstract: In this study, we sought to identify conditions under which workers could experience empowered managers as empowering. Within an organizational context, we defined empowerment as the belief that one has control over decision making. Specifically, we proposed that when workers believe that their managers both have a high level of control over decision making and are supportive, workers will report that they themselves are empowered. We reasoned that managers who exercise power in a supportive manner will be an empowering force for their workers. In support of these hypotheses, we found that it is possible for both workers and supportive managers to enjoy relatively high levels of perceived control over organizational decisions.

Abstract: Groups have been subject to a number of weaknesses and problems that interfere with their effectiveness. One notable destructive group tendency has been labeled "groupthink"-a defective decision-making process afflicting highly cohesive and conforming groups (Janis, 1972, 1983). One contemporary type of group that appears particularly vulnerable to groupthink is the self-managing or self-directing team (Manz & Sims, 1982). In this article we examine the vulnerability of self-managing teams to groupthink and propose a theory regarding the establishment of constructive synergistic team thinking and problem solving-"teamthink."

Abstract: Renewed calls for democracy make it imperative that we understand the nature of democratic leadership. Existing definitions of democratic leadership are inconsistent and inadequate, so this essay provides a clear definition that applies to social groups both large and small. As defined herein, democratic leadership is conceptually distinct from positions of authority; rather, it is defined as the performance of three functions: distributing responsibility among the membership, empowering group members, and aiding the group's decision-making process. Many, most, or all members of a group serve these functions, regularly exchanging the roles of leader and follower. A limited number of practical and moral considerations are identified for assessing the appropriateness of the democratic leadership model for different groups. In addition, the National Issues Forums program is used to illustrate the model, and suggestions are made for future research on democratic leadership.

Title: Patterns of Organizational Commitment and Perceived Management Style: A Comparison of Public and Private Sector Employees
Author-Name: Rachid Zeffane
Abstract: Organizational commitment and perceived management styles were examined using survey responses from 1418 employees from both public (N = 474) and private (N = 944) sector organizations, operating in Australia. Comparisons between the two groups of employees revealed higher commitment among private sector employees. These differences were consistent with differences in perceived management styles. In agreement with previous research, factor analysis unveiled that the concept of organizational commitment was multidimensional. However, in the present study, that concept was found to incorporate the notion of "corporate loyalty/citizenship" and the notion of "attachment to the organization." The operational concept of management style used in the study was found to incorporate four subdimensions: (factor 1) the degree of "emphasis on flexibility and adaptation"; (factor 2) the degree of "emphasis on rules and regulations"; (factor 3) the degree of emphasis on "hierarchy and role specialization" and (factor 4)...

Title: Social Information Processing and Social Networks: A Test of Social Influence Mechanisms
Author-Name: Gordon W. Meyer
Abstract: After identifying the implicit assumptions about social influence mechanisms and the social structural bases reflected in the social information processing literature, social network analysis concepts and structural models are used to clearly specify three alternative influence mechanisms. Simple interaction contact, norm enforcing cohesive groups, and the occupation of structurally equivalent positions or roles in an interaction structure are hypothesized as the structures underlying different social influence processes. The relative efficacy of these various structural configurations in predicting similarity of perception of and attitudes about organizational phenomena are then evaluated. While the evidence seems to indicate that the social influence of norm enforcing groups is most robust, multiple mechanisms appear to operate, sometimes simultaneously, for different kinds of perceptions. The limits of social information processing effects are discussed in light of the findings here of no significant e...

Title: Social Support, Depression, and Self-Acceptance Among Gay Men
Author-Name: John Vincke
Author-Name: Ralph Bolton
Abstract: This study analyzes how low social support of gay men when coming out affects the reported levels of depression and self-acceptance in a non-clinical sample of Flemish (Belgium) gay men. The model used is nonrecursive. It incorporates the mutual causation between depression and self-acceptance. The manipulation of social support is considered as part of the general process of social control. After delineating the methodological problems associated with studying the relationship between the perception of support and depression, it is shown that low social support because one is gay leads first to depression and then to low levels of gay self-acceptance. Findings are discussed within the framework of social stress research and the characteristics of the social context of the setting where the data was collected.

Title: Critical Incidents in Communicating Culture to Newcomers: The Meaning is the Message
Author-Name: Lisa K. Gundry
Author-Name: Denise M. Rousseau
Abstract: Recent hires (n = 149) in 12 electronics manufacturing firms were asked to relate their experiences of formative events and the messages derived from them. Newcomers also described the behavioral norms characterizing their organization, one facet of its culture. Critical incidents newcomers reported were significantly related to their perceptions of behavioral norms. The messages newcomers interpreted from these incidents were coded in terms of positive or negative frame (emphasizing desirable or undesirable outcomes). Positively framed events were related to experiencing the organization's culture as team-oriented. Negatively framed events were related to describing the culture as more control-oriented. Analyses indicate that the critical incidents impact beliefs regarding cultural norms through their effect on the frame of the message newcomers derive from the events. Moreover, team norms were negatively related to role conflict and positively related to role clarity. Findings are interpreted with respe...

Title: Matrix Management of Projects and Power Struggles: A Case Study of an R&D Laboratory
Author-Name: Paul B. de Laat
Abstract: Matrix management of projects, it is argued, may generate normative conflict, prompting project and functional managers to engage in nonconformist conflict behavior which challenges the division of authority in matrix. An analysis of such struggles has been lacking yet. The present study fills this gap. Distinguishing between retreatism, ritualism, manipulation and rebellion, forms and outcomes of such power struggles are explored in a case study of the R&D establishment of a multinational corporation. A so-called balanced matrix was applied, in which power between both kinds of matrix managers is equally balanced. Analysis shows, how each party tried to shift the balance of power toward its side -mostly in vain however; in the end, the "hot" war between contending parties gave way to a mixture of "cold" war and willing cooperation. From the case data, organizational features other than matrix design as such are identified, that seem to affect the chances of mutual conflict escalating. Finally, it is conj...

Title: The Dominant Logic of Employer-Sponsored Work and Family Initiatives: Human Resource Managers' Institutional Role
Author-Name: Ellen Ernst Kossek
Author-Name: Parshotam Dass
Author-Name: Beverly DeMarr
Abstract: This paper argues that concepts from institutional theory and managerial dominant logic can be used to examine human resource managers' institutional role supporting the adoption of employer-sponsored childcare as a form of organizational adaptation to change. Three components of the dominant logic of employer-sponsored childcare were found: management control, environmental, and a coercive component. These components overlap to form an overall management orientation toward employer-sponsored childcare, which are related to management's demographic backgrounds, and their organizational and industry environments. The extent of adoption of employer-sponsored childcare was found to be positively related to (1) the strength of human resource manager's global orientation, and (2) their interpretations of favorable executive attitudes toward employer-sponsored childcare.

Title: Organizational Behavior Revisited
Author-Name: Malcolm Warner
Abstract: This article attempts to reappraise over 100 years of theorizing about organizations. It starts by looking again at the chronology of the development of the field and examines problems of categorization and periodization. It reviews the Classical Approaches, including Scientific Management, then Human Relations and the arrival of Organizational Behavior as an interdisciplinary field of study. It then goes on to discuss the challenges to the mainstream paradigm and radical criticisms of its values and methodologies. In the Discussion following, the limitations of mainstream work is further examined vis-A-vis its generalizabilily, its cultural biases, and the gap between theorists and practicing managers. It concludes that O.B. had probably benefitted from these criticisms and from adopting a wider frame of reference, if at the cost of theoretical integration and cohesion.

Title: Cognitive Schemata of Professional Obsolescence
Author-Name: Asya Pazy
Abstract: This exploratory study used qualitative data as a basis for grounding a new theoretical framework for understanding obsolescence and updating. Fifty professionals were interviewed at length. Four propositions emerged out of the data. One, obsolescence and updating are multifaceted phenomena. Obsolescence has different meanings for different people. Professionals adopt world views-or cognitive schemata-regarding the nature of obsolescence, its relevance to them, and their roles in coping with it. Eleven cognitive schemata were identified. Two, the various schemata constitute various ways of coping with the obsolescence threat. Three, schemata are not individual creations. They are shared by groups of people in organizations. Four, organizational rank and career stage determine to a large extent which schema will be adhered to by the person (or the group). These four propositions are integrated with extant literature, and organizational implications of the new framework are discussed.

Title: Professional Control as Process: Beyond Structural Theories
Author-Name: Michael I. Harrison
Abstract: Until recently, studies of the impact of bureaucratic employment on professionals drew heavily on structural models, such as the theories of proletarianization and of professional stratification. In contrast, this paper develops a processual approach to professional control. This approach views control as resulting from struggles by occupational groups for institutional recognition and from struggles and negotiations within and between occupations. The structural and processual approaches are applied to the explanation of union activity-an increasingly prominent form of collective action among employed professionals. Unionization and union militancy are examined among Israeli physicians, who have a long history of bureaucratic employment. Although they are helpful, neither the proletarianization nor the stratification theories adequately account for the overall pattern of medical unionization or for individual and subgroup involvement in a lengthy physicians' strike. The processual approach points to seve...

Title: The Social Context of Skill Enhancement: Training Decisions of Occupational Health Nurses
Author-Name: Michael P. Leiter

Author-Name: Tom Cox
Abstract: A model of mid-career training decisions was examined in a survey of 270 occupational health nurses in the U.K. The model proposed that distinct factors define the facilitation and deterrence of educational involvement, each of which has an impact on employees' interest in pursuing educational programs. Educational interest mediated the impact of facilitators and deterrents on participation in both formal educational programs and autodidaxy. Situational and personal characteristics of employees predicted participation as well. The existence of a training department within the organization and the availability of collegial support also had an impact on actual training involvement, but not on nurses' interest in pursuing training. The article discusses influence of organizational context on the development of professional efficacy through mid-career training. It considers as well suggestions for educational policy for organizations employing occupational health nurses and for the nursing profession.

Abstract: Using 162 pharmaceutical managers in a longitudinal research design, this study tested whether level and importance of a pay referent interacted to affect pay level satisfaction. Five pay referents (financial, historical, organization, market, and social) and three standardized pay level satisfaction scales (Job Descriptive Index, Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire, and Pay Satisfaction Questionnaire) were used. After controlling for employee salary, job inputs, job characteristics, pay system administration, and level and importance pay referent main effects, interactive effects were found which varied by pay satisfaction scale. Results and limitations of this study are discussed.

Abstract: North American scholars have had an historical interest in the extent to which workers can be committed to both their employer and their union. This is particularly relevant given the recent emphasis on greater labor-management cooperation as part of a competitive strategy. This paper reviewed the correlational literature concerning the relationship between company and union commitment. Meta-analysis procedures were applied to the results of 76 samples involving a total of 15,699 respondents and found a mean corrected effect size of .42. The extended analyses included multiple studies from Canada, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. A system-level moderator, adversarial, or consensual approach to industrial relations, was found. While further moderator analysis was warranted, studies lacked sufficient information for coding. Conceptual and practical implications from the findings are drawn.

Title: Empirical Studies of Projection: A Critical Review
Author-Name: J. Rees Lewis

Author-Name: S. Lawrence
Abstract: Empirical work to date on the Freudian concept of projection is assessed. Previous reviews are considered and recent work integrated as well as material from several disciplines. This is an area with a substantial but convoluted research literature from which elements are distilled which seem essential for progress in the clarification of Projection, particularly with reference to its defensive qualities and its targeting. Of the many forms of projection that have been included in previous literature, two, Classical and Attributive (Holmes, 1868), are isolated as relevant to this paper. A “checklist” of pertinent factors for future designs is drawn up which integrates the strongest strands from work done under the rubric Social Psychology. It is concluded that despite the tenacity of the projection concept, work so far has provided a series of methodological caveats and much suggestive, but little conclusive data.

Title: Objectivity, Reflexivity, and Fiction: Humanity, Inhumanity, and the Science                 of the Social
Author-Name: Stephen Linstead
Abstract: Problems of perspective, proximity and distance, objectivity, and self-interest perpetuate tensions in the social sciences. In positivistic research, still dominant in the organizational sciences, attention has been concentrated on the eradication of bias in the researcher. The effects of this approach have extended into areas where it is implicit and remains unrecognized, particularly in the tradition of “reflexive sociology.” The focal problem here is one of self-knowing and declaration. Focusing on distanciation, the problem of stepping outside one's data, is an alternative perspective. Esthetic approaches to this issue demonstrate that the processes of fictionalization are endemic to the interpretation of data and the production of research accounts. Language is the central element in creating accounts which are constitutive of the world rather than revelatory of its essence, and hence are partial and persuasive versions of reality. This is discussed with reference to the work of organizational and oc...

Abstract: The major properties of the interpersonal circumplex model, and measurement procedures that accompany it, are described. It is suggested that the model and procedures can handle social interaction at a variety of levels from micro to macro, and are ideally suited to studying the interface between interpersonal behavior and social structure. Areas of present and potential application are described including psychotherapy and family processes, conflict and conciliation, consultation and advocacy, autonomy and leadership. Some methodological and substantive problems and issues pertaining to the model and measurement procedures are discussed and some possible extensions to the model proposed. These include the need to further incorporate socio-emotional variables into the model; the possibility of using the model to describe social settings; and the need to modify the classic theory of interpersonal complementarity.

Abstract: In a recent edition of Human Relations, Elmes and Costello (1992) reported the results of their observations of a communication skills training (CST) workshop. Their paper examined this approach to training from a dramaturgical perspective and argued that CST could be considered as an inherently manipulative means of strengthening management control within organizations. Given that there has been an explosive growth of interest in CST as a means of furthering personal development, in a variety of professional contexts, the present paper addresses the concerns raised by Elmes and Costello, by examining some of the central issues associated with this approach to training. Research evidence is reviewed which suggests that CST is an effective training medium which can be a positive force for strengthening relationships within the work environment. CST as a means of furthering behavioral change is examine in the light of the Elmes and Costello critique. Finally, the implications of these issues for the managem...

Abstract: This paper examines the process of work computerization in a Health Maintenance Organization from an institutionalist perspective. It investigates how one element of the institutional environment, viz., the ideology of professionalism, became a powerful presence and continually influenced the process of work computerization in the organization. Using ethnographic methods of participant observation and in-depth interviews, the paper identifies the different local meanings of professionalism held by organizational members. It then examines how the ideology of professionalism became institutionalized within the organization through a combination of micro-and macro-level forces. The paper also looks at the consequences of this ideology for the computerization process. Mainly, it shows how the ideology of professionalism facilitated a climate of acceptance toward computers, escalated commitment to the technology and was partly responsible for the suppression of individual concerns regarding work computerizatio...

Abstract: The research program undertaken by the Meaning of Working (MOW) International Research Team has documented effects of individual characteristics and macrosocioeconomic variables on work-related values and beliefs in different countries. The present study adds another dimension to this work by studying intact organizations-local governments in the United States and Japan-in place of the usual MOW samples of occupational groups. The measures used cover the three core facets of the "Meaning of Working"-work centrality, work goals, and entitlement/obligation norms. By studying intact organizations, the effects of other contextual variables-organization, region, and hierarchical level-in addition to country become evident.

Abstract: This study examined the relationship between work-specific cognitive style, and measures of organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and involvement. One hundred working adults completed the revised Occupational Attributional Style Questioinaire and three validated measures of work attitudes. In general, cognitive style showed few associations with demographic variables, occupational status, and salary. Internality and perception of personal control over positive outcomes were positively correlated with job commitment, involvement, and satisfaction, a finding that appears to generalize across different occupational groups. The discussion considers the relative merits of attributional style vs. locus of control methodology in assessing work-related cognitions.

Abstract: The effects of social support, job control, participative decision making practices, and locus of control upon the relationship between occupational stress and psychological well-being have been well discussed and researched. In order to synthesize these areas of research, a 1-month follow-up study of 244 accountants was conducted. The results indicated complex interactions between stressors, locus of control, and social support or job autonomy in predicting psychological well-being, controlling for initial measures of well-being. These interactions reveal that an internal locus of control, and social support/job autonomy synergistically buffer the effects of stressors upon well-being.

Title: Of What Value is a Job Attitude? A Socio-Cognitive Analysis
Author-Name: Anthony R. Pratkanis
Author-Name: Marlene E. Turner
Abstract: Job attitudes are often weakly predictive of job-related behaviors. A socio-cognitive model is presented to demonstrate why job attitudes are important, to identify their structural and functional properties, and to specify when they predict behavior. According to this model, attitudes are represented in memory by a cognitive structure consisting of an object label, an evaluative summary of that object, and a knowledge structure. This structure serves several functions: it allows individuals to make sense of their social world (heuristic and schematic functions of attitudes) and to maintain self-worth (self functions of attitudes). Finally, we use the socio-cognitive model to identify six propositions for increasing the attitude-behavior relationship.

Title: Managing the Uncertainties of Innovation: Extending Thompson (1967)
Author-Name: J. C. Spender
Author-Name: Eric H. Kessler
Abstract: Thompson's two domain model, with its central core of rational activities separated from a mantle of boundary-spanning activities, tells us how organizations cope with externally generated uncertainties. Innovation is an internal source of uncertainty that this model does not adequately cover. Following Burns and Stalker, we suggest that the rational core and the organic boundary-spanning are incompatible domains of activity with different modes of governance. Many writers overlook the problems of coupling these domains and simply argue that "upstream" innovation activities can be managed organically while "downstream" implementation activities can be mechanistic. Sometimes they see a mixed mode of governance being applied between the project's initiation and completion points. We argue that far from there being a gradual transition from organic to mechanistic, there is a dialectical tension between these modes which is best managed by "nesting" the organic within a host matrix of bureaucratic activity.

Title: Blindness Rehabilitation Agencies and Organizational Environments

Author-Name: Betty A. Dobratz
Abstract: Previous research has suggested that the extent to which rehabilitation agencies must compete over clientele affects the structure and behavior of organizations. Institutional theory suggests, however, that increased competition is unlikely to affect the rehabilitation process and client outcomes. In this paper, multiple regression analysis on survey data from 135 agencies in 22 states suggested that organizational structure and behavior were not affected. However, increased competition did appear to lead to a greater retention of clientele while personnel constraints appeared to increase the referral of clients to other agencies. Since agencies have less control over funding and other related scarce resources, clientele appear to be the manipulable resource which can be referred or retained to meet organizational needs.

Abstract: Organization culture contains psychosocial defenses against the experience of anxiety in the workplace. It is, therefore, possible to understand organization culture by the quantity, quality, and permanence of these defenses. Psychoanalytic object relations developmental theory provides a means of understanding psychological defenses. The theory includes three forms of subjective experience, psychodynamics, and psychological defenses-presubjective, intrasubjective, and intersubjective. When these three subjective perspectives are used to understand psychosocial defenses in the workplace, they permit the development of a systematic understanding of organization culture. A taxonomy is provided that uses the three levels of developmental subjectivity and accompanying psychologically defensive processes to understand organization culture. The taxonomy is then found to subsume other theoretical perspectives for understanding organizational dynamics.

Title: Emotion in the Workplace: A Reappraisal
Author-Name: Blake E. Ashforth
Author-Name: Ronald H. Humphrey
Abstract: Although the experience of work is saturated with emotion, research has generally neglected the impact of everyday emotions on organizational life. Further, organizational scholars and practitioners frequently appear to assume that emotionality is the antithesis of rationality and, thus, frequently hold a pejorative view of emotion. This has led to four institutionalized mechanisms for regulating the experience and expression of emotion in the workplace: (1) neutralizing, (2) buffering, (3) prescribing, and (4) normalizing emotion. In contrast to this perspective, we argue that emotionality and rationality are interpenetrated, emotions are an integral and inseparable part of organizational life, and emotions are often functional for the organization. This argument is illustrated by applications to motivation, leadership, and group dynamics.

Title: Leadership and Empowerment: A Social Exchange Perspective
Author-Name: Tiffany Keller
Author-Name: Fred Dansereau
Abstract: This paper proposes that the receipt of negotiating latitude and support for self-worth from superiors empowers subordinates by increasing their perceptions of control. Subordinates reciprocate by performing in accordance with supervisory preferences. Additionally, superiors who utilize empowering leadership practices are predicted to be viewed as fair by subordinates. The results from the analysis of data collected from 92 superior-subordinate dyads support these hypotheses. The implications of empowerment for management are discussed.

Title: Upward Impression Management: Goals, Influence Strategies, and Consequences
Author-Name: Asha Rao

Author-Name: Lynda H. Murray
Abstract: Employees often seek to create favorable impressions with their managers. An empirical study of the antecedents, process, and consequences of influence strategies in upward impression management found that subordinates have both multiple goals and strategies. Subordinates' strategies varied with their goals in impression management. They also reported using a wider range of strategies than usually attributed to impression management. Managerial ap- praisals were based on their impressions of their subordinates, and perceptions of their influence style. While subordinates may believe that ingratiation will help them get better appraisals, using coalitions appears to lead to favorable impressions and appraisals. Subordinate assertiveness may lead to unfavorable impressions and performance appraisals.

Title: Allen and Meyer's 1990 Longitudinal Study: A Reanalysis and Reinterpretation Using Structural Equation Modeling
Author-Name: W. Kevin Baker
Abstract: Allen and Meyer (1990) proposed a possible latent factor, role certainty, impacting the effects of socialization tactics on organizational commitment and role orientation. Their data was reanalyzed with structural equation modeling to test this proposal and to examine the overlooked factor of interaction with job incumbents. The results indicated the presence of two latent factors, role certainty, and incumbent interaction. More importantly, the most pronounced impact was from incumbent interaction. Interaction with incumbents had a strong early impact on organizational commitment of newcomers, but this effect diminished significantly over time. The implications of this are discussed.

Author-Name: Ronald J. Burke
Author-Name: Esther Greenglass
Abstract: This longitudinal study examined antecedents and consequences of psychological burnout among human service professionals. Antecedents of psychological burnout included individual and situational characteristics, work stressors, and measures of social support. Consequences of psychological burnout emphasized satisfaction and emotional and physical well-being variables. Participants in the study were 362 school-based educators (teachers and administrators) employed by the same school board. Respondents completed questionnaires sent to them at their schools at two points in time, 1 year apart. Regression analyses of time-lagged data replicated many empirical findings from cross-sectional studies.

Title: The Concept "Acceptable" as a Means of Assessing Heuristic Work Practices in the Professional Arena
Author-Name: A. Dale
Abstract: This paper examines the limitations of established assessment techniques when applied to the heuristic work practices found in professions. The paper observes that the search for quality by means of the imposition of quantitative measures is at best restrictive and at worst dangerous and misleading when applied to the work of professional services. Describing an approach originally conceived for the assessment of police work, the paper argues that the concept "acceptable" has high utility in the valuing of professional work. The paper argues that the model of professional as "negotiator" is relevant in terms of the way an "acceptable" solution to novel problems may be defined. The paper reasons that in terms of the provision of direct professional services, success should be judged according to what may be negotiated between those affected and the constraints imposed by the role of the professional practitioner.

Title: Career Plateau and Work Attitudes: An Empirical Study of Managers

Abstract: This study examines the effect of objective and subjective career plateau on the attitudes and behavior at work of a population of 2183 managers from three sectors of the Canada economy. Our study corroborates others that have found that "plateaued" and "non-plateaued" individuals respond differently to their work environment. Our results indicate that career plateau is associated with a number of consequences, once we have controlled for the effects of a number of personal characteristics such as age, sex, education, seniority and hierarchical level. The study also shows that the explanatory power of the subjective career plateau is significantly greater than that of objective career plateau. The explained variance in reactions is increased by at most 1% with the introduction of objective plateau for career satisfaction, while introducing subjective plateau into the model has the effect of increasing its explanatory power by 12%.

Title: An Examination of the Relationships Between Work Commitment and Nonwork Domains
Author-Name: Aaron Cohen
Abstract: The goal of this research was to examine the relationship between work commitment forms (e.g., organizational commitment, occupational commitment, job involvement, Protestant work ethic, work involvement) and nonwork domains. Nurses from two hospitals in Western Canada were surveyed. A total of 238 usable questionnaires were returned: a response rate of 47%. The findings showed that nonwork domains affect all work commitment forms examined in this study, especially organizational commitment. It was also found that variables representing nonwork domains affect work commitment forms in different ways. For some commitment forms, such as organizational commitment, there is a strong effect of one variable (e.g., organizational support of nonwork) while for other commitment forms, such as job involvement, there is a complex three-way interaction effect. The main conclusion of this study is that the relationship between work commitment and nonwork domains should receive further attention in future research.

Title: The Effects of Career Salience and Life-Cycle Variables on Perceptions of Work-Family Interfaces
Author-Name: Yuen Chi-Ching
Abstract: In recent years, the life-stages theory on work-family interfaces has attracted considerable attention. Being based on theories of adult development, the life-stages theory has a strong biological/physiological overtone. It overlooks individual differences in values, attitudes, and orientations, as well as the effects of such differences on perceptions of work-family interfaces. In this context, the present paper explored the effects of career salience and life-cycle variables on life-role salience. The findings showed that career salience interacted with life-cycle variables such that life-cycle variables affected the perceptions of men and women with different career orientations differently. The study involved a stratified sample of 429 Business Administration graduates from a local university.

Title: Marital Violence: Comparing Women in Violent and Nonviolent Unions

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to explore the degree to which concepts drawn from North American research are applicable to marital violence among Israeli Jews. Interviews were conducted with 161 women after they gave birth in a large medical center, 29 of whom reported at least one occurrence of violent marriage (VM) during the study year. As in comparable North American research, marital violence was associated with economic hardship, with lack of collectiveness in the dyad, and with the conflict solving tactics employed by both spouses. VM women held different attitudes toward husband control and marital violence, and were emotionally dependent on their husbands. Discriminant analysis successfully classified 90% of the cases (67% of VM). The findings can be interpreted in terms of the battered women syndrome as well as in terms of a struggle for power within the family. The data strongly suggest that these may be two distinct patterns of marital violence.

Abstract: A 6-year study tracked the effects of a group-level absence control program within a Midwestern urban bus company. By modeling employee time-use options systemically, effects were examined graphically with daily precision. Short-term nonlegitimate absence decreased and time worked increased, but unintended substitution effects occurred as employees discovered legitimate ways to exploit absence and time scheduled off. Propositions for future research and methodological insights are noted.

Title: Rhetoric, Ritualism, and Totemism in Human Resource Management
Author-Name: Ken Kamoche
Abstract: This paper posits an interpretivist approach to the study of human resource management (HRM) by examining how organizational members construct meanings of HRM in everyday life through ritualistic behavior and the use of language. Concepts from language philosophy and socio-anthropology are brought together to develop an analytical premise upon which we can begin to appreciate the seemingly complex issues associated with expressive and ritualistic behavior in organizations. Propositions are posited and subsequently examined through an analysis of statements about teamwork in a Kenyan firm. A thematic analysis reveals that teamwork is a totemic device created by organizational members in everyday life. Through shifts in language games ranging from rhetoric to plain speaking, management uses the totem of teamwork to create and legitimize the desired pattern of power and social relations.

Title: The Managerial Performance Implications of a Developmental Assessment Center Process
Author-Name: A. S. Engelbrecht
Author-Name: A. H. Fischer
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to determine if a developmental assessment center process improves managerial performance in the workplace. Focus was placed on the behavioral level of evaluation. The research design made use of a two-group design with random selection and a control group. A sample of 76 managers, at supervisory level, was used. Behaviorally anchored rating scales were developed to measure the job performance of participating managers. The results indicated significant differences between the experimental and the control groups for six performance dimensions. Significant differences were also found in all the second-order factors and the total managerial performance score. Thus, the developmental assessment center process had a positive impact on managerial performance, and this effect was still measurable 3 months after center attendance. In order to generalize the results of this study, it is essential to do further research on the utility of the developmental assessment center.

Abstract: An assessment of the turnover process was undertaken with subjects of railway track maintenance crews. The differences between the responses of workers who left the crews and others who retained membership for the study were partially explained by the met-unmet expectations framework, and there was some evidence to suggest a variety of work related factors are a source of employee perceptions. However, to obtain a fuller understanding of the processes of employee reactions further theoretical articulation is required.

Title: Fitting In or Making Jobs Fit: Factors Affecting Mode of Adjustment for New Hires
Author-Name: J. Stewart Black
Author-Name: Susan J. Ashford
Abstract: This study tested a theoretical framework of work role transitions by examining the impact of individual factors (personal need for control and need for feedback), job factors (job discretion and job novelty), and organizational factors (organizational socialization tactics) on two modes of adjustment for new hires. In this study, need for control and need for feedback had a significant impact on self change as a mode of adjustment but not on job change. Job novelty and job discretion had little impact on either mode of adjustment. Investiture-divestiture organizational socialization tactics had a significant impact on self change as a mode of adjustment and fixed-variable socialization tactics had a significant impact on changing ones' job as a mode of adjustment. In general, the results of this study suggest that variables hypothesized by past theoretical work may only be moderate predictors of changing self or job as modes of adjustment for new hires.

Title: Motivational Underpinnings of Command-and-Control, Market-Based, and Voluntarist Environmental Policies
Author-Name: David R. Karp
Author-Name: Clark L. Gaulding
Abstract: Historically, regulatory command-and-control schemes have dominated the environmental policy process. Recently, market-based incentives and voluntarist programs have begun to compete with regulatory policies. We argue in this article that policymakers must distinguish these strategies by their motivational underpinnings. While each strategy attempts to achieve the same goal, behavioral or organizational change that reduces pollution and/or provides environmental protection, each strategy is distinct in its means. We discuss how command-and-control capitalizes on fear, market-based incentives capitalize on greed, and voluntarism on one's sense of social responsibility. We discuss the implications of choosing each of these policy alternatives by drawing on the insights of "social dilemmas" research that analyzes situations in which the individual and the collective good are in conflict.

Title: Strategic and Tactical Logics of Decision Justification: Power and Decision Criteria in Organizations
Author-Name: Samuel B. Bacharach

Abstract: Organizational researchers tend to explain the often high degree of unpredictability in managerial decision-making in terms of differences in the cognitive processes of decision-makers. However, the decision criteria used by managers remain relatively unexplored. Viewing the use of decision criteria as a method by which managers justify their decisions, we examine the logics of justification underlying an empirically-generated list of decision criteria. We then test a number of hypotheses regarding the impact of power-related individual and role characteristics on the decision criteria used by the 962 public sector managers in our sample. The results suggest that although managers may indeed use decision criteria based on two different underlying logics of justification (i.e., strategic and tactical), power-related characteristics of individuals and roles explain only a limited proportion of the variance in the use of decision criteria based upon strategic logics of justification, and explain an even smal...

Title: Organizational Change and the Provision of a Secure Base: Lessons from the Field
Author-Name: William A. Kahn
Abstract: In this article I lay groundwork for a theory of practice related to organization members' dependency on change agents. A promising place to begin such a theory of practice is attachment theory, a framework developed in child developmental psychology that focuses on how relationships between children and attachment figures (typically parents) facilitate or undermine children feeling secure. Using material from an organizational diagnosis and change project I conducted from multiple theoretical perspectives, I show how I as a change agent created and undermined a secure attachment with organization members. I then offer implications about how change agents-as temporary attachment figures-may undermine or facilitate fundamental change in organization members' patterns of relating.

Title: Managing the Work-Nonwork Boundary: An Assessment of Organizational Responses
Author-Name: Catherine Kirchmeyer
Abstract: Three types of organizational responses to nonwork were identified according to orientations toward the work-nonwork relationship and toward the employer-worker relationship. The attitudes and experiences of 221 managers active in multiple domains were used to assess the effectiveness of the types. The type that enhanced the flexibility of the work-nonwork boundary, and involved the employer providing resources for workers to fulfill nonwork responsibilities themselves, proved most effective. This framework serves to shift the thinking about work-nonwork programs from a practice-by-practice focus to a more strategic level.

Abstract: This article reviews the research on groupthink and analyzes the results and identifies areas of inconsistency. Based on these analyses and integration of research on the effects of time pressure on group decision making, a revised groupthink framework is presented. The revised framework alters the role of the leader, adjusts the linkages between groupthink antecedents and symptoms, and focuses attention on the importance of time pressure and methodical decision-making procedures on the prevention of groupthink. The revised framework attempts to correct a fundamental flaw of Janis' (1983) model - that is, to explain why within the same group, groupthink can occur during one decision-making situation and not another.

Abstract: This study investigates the interaction effect of information asymmetry and decentralization on the job satisfaction level of sub-unit managers. Responses gathered by means of a questionnaire survey from 42 managers in Singapore were generated and analyzed using regression analysis. The findings indicate the presence of nonmonotonic relationship between information asymmetry and job satisfaction over the range of the degree of decentralization in the organizations. More specifically, the results indicate that a higher level for information asymmetry was associated with a higher level of job satisfaction for managers working under conditions of high decentralization.

Title: Virtual Reality as a Communication Environment: Consensual Hallucination, Fiction, and Possible Selves
Author-Name: Giuseppe Mantovani
Abstract: This article addresses a matter of potentially great social significance-Virtual Reality (VR) as a communication environment-from the point of view of social psychology. While it is easily recognized that technological research is deeply involved in the ongoing development of VR systems, there is no equal agreement about behavioral sciences having good reasons for both interest and concern in VR as medium. This paper reviews current research on the quality of VR experience and integrates it in a theoretical framework centered on self identity processes. The main issues are: which sense may be ascribed to the "consensual hallucination" experienced in VR? Which sort of fiction is peculiar to VR? Which influence can VR as a medium have on the construction of the self? We cannot reject in principle the idea that VR could, when fully developed, create alternative realities almost paralleling, in sensory richness, "conventional" realities. The "cyber" view, stressing the capability of VR to supply alternative, ...

Abstract: Charitable giving is a topic that has received little attention in the literature to date, in spite of the recent growth of the voluntary sector in the U.K This paper uses data from interviews with 49 people about their preferences for ways of giving, for kinds of causes, and their beliefs about the role of charity in society. Two main themes are selected for analysis: (a) the kinds of experience that people have had of others in need, and (b) the organization of giving, formally or informally, within social institutions. These themes are used to construct a conceptual framework showing that charitable giving reflects variations in the relationship of individuals to the community of which they are a part. This is a critical alternative to explanations of charity based upon either individual motive, social norms, or the setting in which the solicitation of gifts occurs.

Title: Group Incentives and Pay Satisfaction: Understanding the Relationship Through an Identity Theory Perspective
Author-Name: Theresa M. Welbourne
Author-Name: Daniel M. Cable
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to develop a conceptual model based on identity theory to specify the relationship between group incentives and pay satisfaction. Pay satisfaction, as currently measured, does not include items that directly measure group-based rewards, therefore, any changes in pay satisfaction associated with group incentive implementation would be the result of some spillover effect. Identity theory is employed to model this effect by delineating how group incentives tap salient work-related roles; the theory also has implications for various behavioral consequences. The research described in this paper tests two hypotheses derived from the conceptual model. These hypotheses are tested in two quasi-experimental field studies conducted in a high technology firm and a consumer products company that both implemented gainsharing programs. The findings indicate that gainsharing plans can be viewed as either a benefit or as part of individual pay based on the ability of the incentive plan to activat...

Title: The Social Construction of Organizational Learning: Conceptual and Practical Issues in the Field
Author-Name: Davide Nicolini
Author-Name: Martin B. Meznar
Abstract: The field of organizational learning (OL) has been characterized by a wide diversity of opinions, definitions, and conceptualizations. After discussing difficulties associated with previous conceptualizations of organizational learning, this paper suggests a broader conceptualization which is consistent with and integrates diverse perspectives in the field of OL. To the extent that organizations continuously act and enact their environments, cognitive processes associated with learning continually take place whether the organization recognizes it or not. OL cannot be understood without taking into account the continuous ongoing change of organizational cognitive structures. However, learning is only recognized when an observer identifies and contextualizes those changes. Thus, organizational learning can be interpreted as a social construction which transforms acquired cognition into accountable abstract knowledge. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of this conceptualization of learning on...

Title: Leadership for Self-Managing Work Teams: A Typology and Integrative Model
Author-Name: Greg L. Stewart
Author-Name: Charles C. Manz
Abstract: Many organizations are currently implementing self-managing work teams. Supervision of these teams is particularly challenging in that leaders are expected to lead others to lead themselves. Grounded primarily in the positivistic paradigm of research, a typology of leadership approaches is thus developed to explain team leader behaviors and their impact on team self-management. A model incorporating leader and organizational characteristics is then presented to illustrate antecedents of team leader behavior.

Abstract: This paper compares organization culture assessments in two high reliability organizations (HROs) with each other, with similar assessments done in other HROs, and with assessments done in other kinds of organizations. It then assesses the consistency of the culture assessments in the two HROs reported here with the theoretical typology of HROs offered by Schulman, and compares the relationship of culture norms to attitudes and role perceptions found in this research with similar relationships found in the HROs. Finally, the paper provides field data from the two organizations reported on here that support Schulman's model.

Title: Work Redesign and the Balance of Control Within a Nursing Context
Author-Name: E. Molleman
Author-Name: A. Van Knippenberg
Abstract: Within the nursing organization of four hospital wards, a new work design was introduced, which was primarily characterized by the delegation of responsibilities from head nurses to nurses and by the participation of patients. First, it was hypothesized that the participation of patients in health care would enhance their perception of both their own and the nurses' control over their stay in the hospital. Second, it was hypothesized that, in the perceptions of head nurses, nurses, and doctors, the new work design would enhance the perceived control of nurses and reduce the perceived control of head nurses over nursing care. Over 1000 patients, nurses, head nurses, and doctors completed questionnaires. The data support the hypotheses and the results are discussed in terms of participation and decentralization effects of work design changes. It was further observed that doctors evaluated some practical aspects of the new work design negatively, but measures have been taken to overcome these problems. Some ...

Title: Group Feedback Analysis Applied to Longitudinal Monitoring of the Decision Making Process
Author-Name: Frank Heller
Author-Name: Alan Brown
Abstract: The paper describes the application to longitudinal research of a method of data collection which combines quantitative and qualitative material. It is claimed that Group Feedback Analysis (GFA) helps to validate data collected by various methods and produces additional ethnographic material and insight into the process under investigation. When the people who supply the data are experienced in the subject matter, as is the case with managers and other employees in organizational research, GFA makes it possible for them to help with the interpretation of the data instead of leaving it entirely to the researcher. The method, which has previously been used in cross-sectional research, is shown to have utility in a longitudinal design where it can facilitate organizational learning. It can also contribute to the refinement of a theoretical model.

Title: Power and Influence in and Around the Boardroom
Author-Name: Andrew Pettigrew
Author-Name: Terry McNulty
Abstract: This paper presents the early findings of a pilot study of the power and influence of part-time board members in the top 200 U.K. industrial and commercial firms by turnover and the top 50 U.K. financial institutions. The part-time board members hold multiple roles of either chairman and/or non-executive director of these organizations. The findings are presented around a tripartite model of power and influence. The results indicate that the power and influence of part-time board members is shaped by the simultaneous and interactive effects of a set of structural and contextual factors, position and skill in mobilizing a constellation of power sources, and skill and will in converting potential power into actual influence.

Title: Organizational Chiaroscuro: Throwing Light on the Concept of Corporate Governance
Author-Name: Norman Jackson
Author-Name: Pippa Carter
Abstract: Corporate governance describes an apparent attempt by the corporate sector to put its house in order. Relative to a number of notorious examples of illegal or unethical corporate malpractice, corporate governance is seen as a recent, welcome and well-intentioned concern. However, rather than the universal good which it would appear to be, by reference to the work of Foucault corporate governance is disclosed as partial and interested. Far from being a new response to a contemporary problem, corporate governance is shown to have a long history, both of academic interest and of ineffectuality. Apparent differences in orientation over its history are dissolved and, via the analogy of chiaroscuro, corporate governance is shown to be just another reactive and manipulative defense of capitalism.

Title: Organizational Renewal: Top Management's Role in a Loosely Coupled System

Author-Name: P. H. Grinyer
Abstract: A number of writers, March, Simon, Weick, Orton, Pfeffer and Clegg, have dealt with change in loosely coupled systems. But one associated aspect, the role of top management, has yet to be clarified. Drawing on recent empirical research in punctuated change and CEO replacement, we consider how tight coupling might lead to punctuated change while loose coupling facilitates continuous change. But loose-coupling is no simple prescription. It raises questions about the "glue" that holds organizations together through significant change. We argue top management has a crucial role creating and maintaining this cohesion. Rejecting the weaker notion of "shared values," we focus on the cohesive function of behavior and on top management's role in shaping the loosely coupled organization's patterns of practice.

Author-Name: Hazel A. Kerwood
Abstract: This paper explores how just-in-time (JIT) networks differ from conventional networks, by positioning this form of network within a typology of three distinct "hub and satellite" structures. The form and duration of coupling, both within the network, and between the network and its external environment, are identified and examined from a multitheoretical perspective. The most relevant theoretical frameworks for each network type are identified, areas of integration between internal and external coupling are suggested, and conditions for success for each network type are hypothesized.

Title: Catalytic Alliances for Social Problem Solving

Abstract: Catalytic alliances (CA) are temporary network organizations created to effect long-term social change through media-based "campaign" efforts to increase public awareness and commitment to action on social problems. Two CA organizations - Hands Across America and the Partnership for a Drug-Free America - are profiled in this paper. Each illustrates the catalytic alliance phenomenon and delineates a number of critical management dimensions. The paper then uses these examples to more precisely define the organizational features and characteristics of catalytic alliances, and to develop a process model of how such alliances are formed.

Title: Validating A Method for Mapping Managers' Mental Models of Competitive Industry Structures

Abstract: Cognitive mapping techniques refer to methods used to elicit the structure and content of people's mental models. There is a growing interest in applying these techniques to the study of managers' mental models of strategic management issues. This paper reports on a new method for mapping managers' mental models of competitive industry structures, that is based upon recent developments in the cognitive psychology of the categorization of concepts. This method, a simple visual card sorting technique, is quick to administer and interpret. The method is evaluated with respect to its psychometric properties against the well established, but potentially cumbersome, repertory grid technique. The method is demonstrated to have good validity by comparing it with the repertory grid technique.

Title: Managing the Academics: Commodification and Control in the Development of University Education in the U.K.
Author-Name: Hugh Willmott
Abstract: The paper analyzes a number of major developments in higher education in the U.K during the past decade or so. It explores the connection between changes in the organization and control of academic labor processes (e.g., teaching, administration, and research) and pressures exerted by the dynamics of capitalist development to commodify and control the work of academics. The first section considers the relevance of labor process analysis for understanding these changes. Attention is then paid to the historical development of academic work and, in particular, to the role played by the University Grants Council in providing academics with a significant measure of protection from commodifying pressures. In the remaining sections of the paper, the focus is upon major developments of the past decade or so: (i) the context, character and impact of the 1981 cuts in university expenditure, (ii) the research selectivity exercises of 1986, 1989, and 1992, and (iii) the work of the CVCP's Academic Audit Unit.

Title: Socio-Psychoanalytic Perspectives on the Subordinate
Author-Name: Bonnie D. Oglensky
Abstract: This paper integrates psychoanalytic and sociological concepts to examine what persons do with the role of subordinate in the work situation, specifically in relations with immediate superiors. Focusing on the side of the subordinate, the authority relation at work is viewed as a complex emotional attachment and understood as a dynamic process-one which considerably reflects and conforms around the internal needs, dispositions, and conflicts of the individual in the subordinate position. It is argued that patterns of relating to authority crystallize in the earliest years of life in connection with parents and that by way of patterned movements throughout the life-course, persons choose and modify contexts that sustain these patterns. Recurrent themes relating to subordinates' paradoxical needs and ambivalence around dependency and control are discussed. A case study of an attorney's relations with her superiors is presented to illustrate how these emotional dynamics unfold and are expressed. Special atte...

Title: Family Functioning and Coping with Change: A Longitudinal Test of the Circumplex Model

Abstract: The Circumplex Model of family functioning suggests that families differ according to their ability to adapt to change. The aim of this study was to test two hypotheses from the model in the context of a longitudinal study of families experiencing geographical relocation. Questionnaires were completed on three occasions by employees and their partners during the process of relocation. Results indicated that there was no relationship between family functioning at Time 1 and subsequent psychological well-being of either employees or their partners. There was some evidence that families who made minor changes in response to their move adapted more successfully than those who did not change or made major changes. The results highlight possible limitations of the Circumplex Model and the need for further longitudinal studies of family adaptation.

Author-Name: Simon Baddeley
Abstract: Innovation in the governance of external polities prompts a resonant internal rhetoric. This paper attempts to expand the concepts of citizenship and individuality by applying political language to the internal life of individuals. Repression has been a conditional means of civilizing the psyche, but in pluralistic democracies where diversity is valued, where assimilation is not a condition of citizenship and where aspirations are formed within consumerism, this tradition of self-definition may be insufficient. At a time when neither individualism nor collectivism seem able to nurture individuality, the idea of an internal polity can enrich self-awareness and strengthen a sense of agency in the world.

Abstract: This paper seeks to understand a subtle form of relational common sense among Japanese conversational partners. To do so we examine possible explanations of a conversation between two Japanese that at first glance appears atypical. We argue that the most satisfying explanation is grounded in an understanding of the Japanese concept of kenson. Using ethnographic techniques the "common sense" of kenson is detailed in regards to its forms and meanings. Implications of this concept for conversation are discussed as well as comparisons made between kenson, the American notion of modesty and Japanese indirect refusals. Finally, kenson is discussed as an informal ritual grounded in social norms.

Abstract: This study attempts to assess work-related values in Singapore and how these work values may differ from those of another nationality. The aim of this study is to replicate Hofstede's model in the Singapore managerial context. A comparison is made between Singaporean Chinese managers and Japanese managers in Singapore. Hofstede's four value dimensions of Individualism, Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance and Masculinity are used. The mean Power Distance and Masculinity scores of Singaporean Chinese managers and Japanese managers are found to be different from the samples in Hofstede's study. These differences in work values indicate that interpretations of Hofstede's cultural constructs cannot be made without modifying or redefining the constructs in terms that are relevant to the cultural context. This finding is supported by the differences in factors that make up the Individualism and Masculinity value dimensions of Singaporean Chinese and Japanese managers. The differences in work values between are...

All five plants were engaged in identical operations that were designed and implemented by its U.S.-based owner. Each of the plants, however, was under the direction of host nationals. Data demonstrated that the degree of participation differed widely between the Italian, Mexican, Spanish, American, and English plants. It appears that the management systems in each of the plants reflects the expectations of the society and the local workforce. The data also revealed significant differences in the levels of productivity. While the most productive plants had the lowest levels of participation, the relationship between productivity and participation was not statistically significant across the five plants.

Abstract: Entrepreneurs develop and use motives, abilities, and resources to benefit from an environment conducive to entrepreneurship. The present study builds upon analyses of the Cuban enclave in South Florida to analyze the motives, abilities, and resources that this community's most successful entrepreneurs brought and developed in the U.S. Their motives were influenced by family-linked aspirations and role models, need to achieve through business ownership, and by personally and situationally-rooted propensity to accept the risk of entrepreneurial action. Entrepreneurial abilities came through family mentors, education and business experience, and, in some cases, English language skills. Entrepreneurial resources included resources brought from Cuba, but more significantly resources developed personally in the U.S., or arranged through partners and social contracting. Implications for entrepreneurship research and for prospective entrepreneurs are considered.

The paper argues that this represents a largely static approach, which does not take into consideration the dynamic aspects of design choice, such as the history, the external context and the continuous feedback loop between behavior and choice. Furthermore, organizational economics systematically draws upon sociological concepts, such as trust or social conventions which are variables exogenous to its own framework, and which consequently remain unexplored and unresearched.

Title: Exploring Knowledge and Cognitions in Decisions About Technological Innovation: Mapping Managerial Cognitions
Author-Name: Jacky A. Swan
Abstract: Successes and failures with technological innovation can, in some cases, be attributed to the decision-making processes in the user organization. There has been a growing interest among strategy researchers in managerial cognitions. This paper describes the nature and importance of knowledge bases and cognitions for decisions about technological innovation and suggests how knowledge and cognitions can be explored using process research. An example is given from research comparing firms who had tried to adopt computer-aided production management technologies. This research illustrated that knowledge bases provided the potential to innovate but that cognitions of individuals also shaped the outcomes of decisions about the design of the innovation. Cognitive mapping methodologies could be used to explore systematically and in more detail the cognitions of individuals and groups. The paper provides an overview of these methodologies. It concludes that they are useful to researchers, particularly in conjunctio...

Abstract: This study investigates the criteria for acceptance of an employee's superior as a role model, with special attention placed on the effect of superior/subordinate gender. The data for the study were collected from 1579 senior managers from three large Canadian public and quasi-public organizations. While significant gender differences were found, they were relatively unimportant determinants of role model acceptance. By far the most important determinant of subordinate acceptance of a superior as a role model is the subordinate's perception of the superior's performance.

Abstract: This research was designed to explore the relationship between interaction with women managers and attitudes toward women as managers. Data were collected from 101 male bank managers on the extent of their interaction with women managers and their attitudes toward women as managers. Results showed little relation between the extent of interaction with women managers and participants' attitudes. However, there was a significant positive relationship between satisfaction with interaction with women managers and attitudes toward women as managers. Discussions with participants indicated the possibility of their attitudes toward women as managers being influenced by their interaction with women clerks. A second study was carried out on another set of 99 participants with a comparable profile to explore the relationship between interaction with women clerks and attitudes toward women as managers. The earlier pattern of relationships persisted: the extent of interaction with women clerks was not associated with...

Title: Do Explanations of Absenteeism Differ for Men and Women?
Author-Name: Audrey VandenHeuvel
Author-Name: Mark Wooden
Abstract: Despite the consistent finding in the absence literature that women tend to be absent more often than men, little attention has been paid to whether the process of absence differs by sex. This issue is examined using data collected from 1401 Australian employees from 61 different workplaces. Hypotheses suggest that the predictive ability of job satisfaction, age, commuting time, family responsibilities, stressful life events and shift work on absence behavior differs for men and women. To test these hypotheses, a multivariate model is developed and estimated. The results indicate that there are structural differences in the absence behavior of men and women, requiring the estimation of models separately for each sex. Moreover, strong support for all but one of the hypotheses is found. These results show the critical importance of considering the sex of employees when developing explanatory models of absence.

Title: Segregated Occupations and Gender Stereotyping: A Study of Secretarial Work in Europe
Author-Name: Catherine Truss
Author-Name: Robert Goffee
Author-Name: Gareth Jones
Abstract: Much has been written about the "gendered" nature of many occupations, especially to explain how they have developed and maintained their female-dominated identity. This article reports the findings of one study of women working as secretaries in England, France, and Germany, in an attempt to assess the validity of this explanation. Data were collected by questionnaire and interview from secretaries, and by interview from their bosses. It was found that secretarial work in all three countries does conform to some of the gender stereotypes, but that organizational and societal factors impinge on the social construction of secretarial work. Some consideration is given to the role of the secretary as agent, acting to shape her work identity, which has hitherto been ignored in the literature.

Abstract: This research examines gender differences in personal characteristics, work experiences, work attitudes, and professional commitment for a group of young (age < 45) dentists. While males and females had similar work attitudes, they differed in work experience -males worked more hours, saw more patients, and earned higher incomes. Males had higher scores on affective and behavioral professional commitment measures than did females, but the gender difference was significant only for behavioral commitment. For both females and males, affective professional commitment was related positively to job satisfaction, office cohesion, having young children, and negatively related to stress. The relationship between owning the practice and affective professional commitment was greater for men than women, whereas the relationship between the proportion of office staff who are close friends and affective professional commitment was greater for women than men. For males, behavioral commitment was related positively to b...

Title: Finding New Jobs After a Plant Closing: Antecedents and Outcomes of the Occurrence and Quality of Reemployment
Author-Name: Carrie R. Leana
Author-Name: Daniel C. Feldman
Abstract: In a longitudinal study of laid-off industrial workers, we examined the factors which influenced whether individuals got reemployed after a plant closing as well as the factors which influenced whether individuals got satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily reemployed. Financial pressures, levels of optimism and self-blame, and the amount of problem-focused and symptom-focused coping that individuals engaged in were significant predictors of reemployment status. There were also significant differences among the unemployed, satisfactorily reemployed, and unsatisfactorily reemployed in terms of adjustment, with the unsatisfactorily reemployed experiencing substantially lower life satisfaction. The paper highlights quality of reemployment as an important issue in understanding individual adjustment to job loss and the ways in which unemployment and unsatisfactory reemployment can be detrimental to individual well-being.

Title: Factors Predicting Employees' Approval of Lean Production
Author-Name: Mark A. Shadur
Author-Name: John J. Rodwell
Author-Name: Greg J. Bamber
Abstract: A number of influential studies advocate the adoption of a lean production system (LPS) in order to improve quality and efficiency in Western automotive plants. Critics argue that such systems place excessive demands upon employees. Very little survey data, however, is available on employees' attitudes toward lean production since companies are frequently reluctant to grant such access. Our survey of 200 employees in a Japanese-owned automotive plant in Australia using lean production found that commitment to the company, speed of work and, in special circumstances, age were predictors of employees' approval of the LPS. Employees' perceived levels of stress and Japanese management techniques, such as consultation and a teamwork orientation, were not predictors of approval of the LPS, a finding that contradicts earlier research in this field. Other variables in the analysis, including employee demographics, had no predictive value. We use the results to comment on the wider debate about the transfer of Jap...

Title: Innovation Use: Performance Assessment in a Community Mental Health Center
Author-Name: Sherri N. Sheinfeld Gorin
Author-Name: Thomas W. Weirich
Abstract: This paper discusses the influence of the political economy on the use of performance assessment systems (PAS) in the case of the Community Mental Health Center (CMHC). Performance assessment is defined, and scales for measuring use are discussed. A factor analysis of the influences revealed four separate factors; organizational polity, new money, governmental political-economy, social-task, and cultural contexts. Multiple regression analyses of the impacts of these factors on the use of performance assessment showed the organizational polity and new money to be dominant. Implications of organizational determinism and a stage model of innovation use are discussed.

Author-Name: Shoou-Yih Lee
Abstract: This paper advances the study of organizational demography and turnover by testing propositions derived from Blau's theory of heterogeneity and social structure. In a sample of 398 U.S. community hospitals, voluntary nursing turnover was examined in relation to three demographic dimensions-educational preparation, tenure and employment status-among nurse staff. The form of relationships between turnover and heterogeneity was specified to test whether heterogeneity affects turnover in a linear fashion or, alternatively, in an inverted U-shaped pattern. Our results suggest that effects of heterogeneity on turnover differ by dimension and that such effects can obtain independently of other dimensions. Further, interactions between demographic dimensions show that demographic dimensions also interact with each other to affect nursing turnover. Our findings partially support Blau's conceptualization of heterogeneity in social structure and highlight the importance of multiform heterogeneity in the study of org...

Abstract: This study developed and tested a longitudinal multivariate model of the stress process using an intensive structural equations modeling (SEM) approach. The use of latent variables permits a powerful test of the causal relationships between stress process constructs. Anderson and Gerbing's (1988) two-stage process of analysis was followed: A measurement model was examined in Stage One of the analysis; structural verification of the proposed stress process model using a panel design was tested in Stage Two. Findings from both stages contribute to our understanding of stress by uncovering some dynamic components underlying the stress process. This study offered a sophisticated methodological examination into the complexity inherent in uncovering the dynamics of the stress process.

Title: Influences upon Managerial Moral Decision Making: Nature of the Harm and                 Magnitude of Consequences
Author-Name: James Weber
Abstract: Business ethics research typically emphasizes the influence of personal and organizational forces upon ethical decision making. While accepting these forces as important, Collins (1989) and Jones (1991) suggest that the moral issue and its intensity may also influence individuals' resolution of an ethical dilemma. Utilizing a sample of 259 managers and a modified Moral Judgment Interview survey, this research reports that the type of harm, that is, the nature or kind of harm, and the magnitude of the consequences, that is, the degree or extent of the harm affecting the victim, influence the moral reasoning criteria evoked to resolve the dilemmas, as predicted by Collins and Jones. This finding has significant theoretical, empirical, and practical implications, as discussed in the paper.

Title: Complementing Kohlberg: Mapping the Ethical Reasoning Used by Managers for                 Their Own Dilemma Cases
Author-Name: Robin Stanley Snell
Abstract: In standard Kohlbergian research, respondents tackle hypothetical ethical dilemma cases and state what should be done and why (a form of espoused theory). Kohlberg's six-stage model of espoused theory (KSSMET) is used to assess the responses. An individual's ethical reasoning is located either at a single stage or at transition points. This paper demonstrates a complementary research paradigm where ten Hong Kong Chinese managers were asked how they had tackled their own ethical dilemmas at work and why (indicating theory-in-use). Their ethical reasoning theory-in-use was found to be volatile (spanning many stages). An aggregate map of respondents' theory-in-use values (MTV) was developed as an approximate “cultural” map, representing socially-constructed values which may change over time. While MTV was found strongly to resemble KSSMET, there were some differences in actual values expressed which appeared to reflect cultural differences between Chinese and U.S. managers.

Abstract: Commission is popularly believed to engender unethical intentions, although little research has directly examined this relationship. This paper directly examines the influence commission, along with experience, income, professional accreditation, and a modified theory of planned behavior, has on agents' ethical intentions toward clients. The study sample was systematically drawn from a national group of financial service industry professionals. Only a modified theory of planned behavior significantly predicted agents' ethical intentions. Implications and limitations are discussed.

Title: Power, Interaction, Position, and the Generation of Cultural Agreement in Organizations
Author-Name: William B. Stevenson
Author-Name: Jean M. Bartunek
Abstract: Cultural agreement in organizations can be considered from integration, differentiation, or fragmentation perspectives (Martin, 1992). Underlying these perspectives are differing assumptions about the effects of power, interaction, and position on cultural viewpoints in organizations. This study examines these assumptions by content analyzing the stories organizational members tell about their organization. Differences in formal power, informal influence, and organizational position all led to differences in stories that signified different cultural viewpoints. At the group level, informal interaction between groups did not lead to cultural agreement. However, groups that occupied similar positions or roles created through interaction in the network of influence did share similar cultural viewpoints. The results suggest that the effects predicted from the integration, differentiation, and fragmentation perspectives are likely to be jointly present in organizations. They also suggest that an understanding ...

Abstract: It is widely accepted that different strategies need to be implemented in different ways. The strategy style match model assumes personality is the primary determinant of strategy implementation actions. It is argued that such an approach is inadequate because it ignores the effect of context on behavior. The study demonstrates that strategic context influences managers' espoused strategy implementation intentions. The implications for the management of human resources in strategic change are discussed.

Title: Measuring Coping: A Review and Critique
Author-Name: Susan Oakland
Author-Name: Alistair Ostell
Abstract: Coping is thought to be a major component in the relationship between the experience of stress and health. Currently, the most popular method for measuring coping is the quantitative, methods-foci approach which was developed by Lazarus and his colleagues (Aldwin, Folkman, Schaefer, Coyne, & Lazarus, 1980). Through a critical review of studies using this approach, and by drawing on qualitative data from a study of stress, coping and health among headteachers, this paper argues that these widely-used measures need refining. Qualitative data show that the efficacy of coping actions and the adequacy of external resources are two pivotal variables in the coping process, both of which are completely overlooked in quantitative coping checklists. More broadly, it is argued that alternative methodologies must be considered if we are to better understand the role of coping in the stress/health relationship.

Title: Coping with Stress: Public Welfare Supervisors Doing Their Best
Author-Name: Pauline Irit Erera-Weatherley
Abstract: This study examines the coping mechanisms used by public welfare supervisors to deal with organizational stress. The findings, based on a qualitative study, indicate that the 14 supervisors examined employed two different coping categories which differ with regard to (a) their focus, (b) the source of stress, (c) the target person who is meant to benefit from them, and (d) the specific coping mechanisms. The first category is basically problem-focused, and serves the purpose of buffering subordinates from policy-ambiguity. The second category is essentially emotion-focused, and aims at buffering supervisors from stressful expectations of management and peers.

Title: Job Insecurity and Its Outcomes: Moderating Effects of Work-Based and Nonwork-Based Social Support
Author-Name: Vivien K. G. Lim
Abstract: The moderating effects of work-based support on the relationship between job insecurity and several work-related outcomes, namely (i) job dissatisfaction, (ii) proactive job search, (iii) noncompliant job behaviors; and nonwork based support on the relationship between job insecurity and a nonwork-related outcome, (iv) life dissatisfaction, were examined. Data were gathered through a mail survey to MBA graduates of a large northeastern university in the U.S. The findings of this study suggested that support derived from others at the workplace can contribute significantly in buffering individuals against job dissatisfaction, proactive job search, and noncompliant job behaviors when their job security is at stake. Equally important is support provided by family and friends which may buffer individuals against negative outcomes such as life dissatisfaction associated with job insecurity. Implications of the study are discussed.

Abstract: The relationship between occupational stress and worksite accidents has increasingly become the focus of research attention. However, few studies have considered the "spillover" effect of work related stress on employee behavior outside the specific work domain. This article reports the findings of our study to investigate the possible effects of occupational stress on the incidence of road accidents among company car drivers. Using motor vehicle claims data, stress levels were compared between accident-free (ACCF) and accident-involved (ACCI) drivers of a large car fleet operated by an international retailing organization. Comparisons were also made between different divisions/subsidiary companies within the organization. Despite the relatively small sample (n = 236) and the retrospective limitations of the study, the findings would indicate that occupational stress is playing a role in predicting accident rates among company car drivers. It is suggested that organizational initiatives aimed at stressor ...

Abstract: A study among health-care workers is reported where a traditional stress management program (n = 66) was compared with an intervention promoting innovation at work as a form of stress management (n = 52), and a control group (n = 84). Measures relating to both the process of participation in the respective interventions, and outcome in terms of psychological well-being were taken. The traditional program, emphasizing cognitive-behavioral and arousal reduction techniques, was associated with improvements in general psychological strain and job satisfaction. The intervention promoting innovative responses to stressors (e.g., changing work methods, modifying working relations with colleagues) was associated with improvements in work-related stress, and innovation. Statistical analysis suggested session process variables, in addition to the theoretical orientations of the respective interventions, were associated with outcome variance. Follow-up data, 1 year post-intervention, suggested short-term gains on ou...

Author-Name: Oswald Jones
Abstract: This paper identifies the factors which determine the human resources reputation of firms involved in R&D. Reputation in this context refers to the extent to which employees regard their organization as a “good” place to work. The sample of 402 respondents was drawn from ten science-based firms. In terms of age, educational qualifications, and years of experience, the sample was representative of scientists employed in the ten organizations. Reputation is regarded as being of importance both conceptually and practically. Organizational reputation has been widely referred to in the literature, but it has not been consistently defined nor its determinants investigated systematically. Innovatory climate and job satisfaction are identified as the main determinants of reputation among R&D scientists.

Title: The Construction of Clients' Experience of Psychotherapy Through Narrative,                 Practical Action and the Multiple Streams of Consciousness
Author-Name: Aubrey Baillie
Author-Name: Sarah Corrie
Abstract: In response to the demise of positivist rationality, different theoretical traditions have proposed alternative formulations of the way in which human beings construct their realities: discourse (social constructionism), self-interventions (critical realism), and the potentials of human consciousness (the humanist tradition). The notion of a “practical order” is introduced to conceptualize the practical context in which self-intervention takes place. Qualitative accounts of client experience of psychotherapy (Dinnage, 1988) provide examples of all three modes of reality construction. It is argued that a multimode perspective is consequently needed to provide an integrative framework that identifies in a systematic manner the different facets of client experience. The three modes correspond to three different sorts of questions that need to be addressed when researching client experience of psychotherapy. The multimode perspective advocated in this paper is used to highlight neglected research topics in th...

Title: Information Acquisition in Promotion Decisions

Abstract: When organizations publicly post notices of promotional opportunities, they often must justify the rejection of unsuccessful applicants, and may therefore decide to rate all applicants. When the process is less public, however, selectors are not required to assign ratings to inferior candidates. We hypothesized that selectors would gather less information on inferior candidates when they were not required to rate them than when they were so required. Results of a study of 157 managers using an information display board methodology confirmed our hypothesis. Contrary to previous research in consumer behavior, individual proxies for “product familiarity,” such as number of years of previous work experience, were not related to information-gathering behavior.

Abstract: The effects of subordinate and supervisor age on objective and subjective performance ratings were examined in a field study covering the period from 1980 through 1986. Archival data on sales representatives and their supervisors were collected from the southern United States region of a large corporation. Results revealed that older employees performed better according to objective measures as well as on subjective performance ratings. Findings also demonstrated that subordinates of older supervisors achieved higher levels of objective performance than did subordinates of younger supervisors. Recommendations are discussed for theory development and experimental studies to resolve some of the inconsistencies in the literature.

This study set out to compare these different measures by correlational and factor analysis. The results of the correlational analysis showed the convergent validity of the questionnaires in a number of significant correlations among the overlapping subscales intended to measure the same theoretical construct in each of the four questionnaires. Finally, the factor analysis yielded six readily interpretable factors providing an eclectic framework of the organizational culture dimensions which is supported by the relevant literature. Results are discussed in terms of different frameworks and measures of organizational culture.

Threats to natural justice are discussed in relation to the different assumptions concerning men's and women's subjectivity in a representative university sexual harassment policy document. An alternative analysis in terms of multiple, non-unitary gendered subjectivities, taking into account unconscious intersubjective dynamics, is illustrated through a case example. The political implications of this analysis are discussed.

A combination of standard social sciences' research procedures and a modified space syntax/graph theory technique are employed to investigate society-space relationship. The social study reveals gender division in the conduct of activities and use of space, whereas the spatial analysis highlights a morphological pattern of gender segregation in the Sudanese house. The findings suggest that applying both spatial and aspatial methods of analysis is invaluable for eliciting and interpreting society's cultural norms.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the amount and helpfulness of entry training and work outcomes for newcomers during organizational socialization. A sample of 152 newly-hired entry-level professionals completed a questionnaire after the first 6 months of socialization. Supervisor ratings of job performance were obtained 4 months later. The results indicated that the amount of training received by newcomers was significantly related to job satisfaction, commitment, intention to quit, ability to cope, and several measures of job performance. Newcomers' perceptions of the helpfulness of training was significantly related to job satisfaction, commitment, and intention to quit beyond that explained by training amount. However, none of the amount x helpftdness interactions were significant. In addition, newcomers' anxiety was found to mediate the relationship between training and ability to cope, and to partially mediate the training relationships with job satisfaction, commitme...

Abstract: This study investigates the reactions of men from minority groups and White women who were selected through preferential treatment. The selection procedure allowed for group membership to be taken into account only after the qualifications of candidates were successfully established. Participants, 76 men from minority groups and 170 White women, worked as bus drivers or maintenance workers, which were the two job categories targeted by the affirmative action program in place. Contrary to previous studies, it was found that men and women did not differ in their reactions. Moreover, this study revealed that work related self-evaluations, work motivation, and satisfaction were contingent upon one's beliefs about affirmative action, and emotional reactions to discrimination against one's group. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.

Title: Balancing lwo Major Parts of Adult Life Experience: Work and Family Identity                 Among Dual-Earner Couples
Author-Name: Samuel Aryee
Author-Name: Vivienne Luk
Abstract: As sources of meaning and identity, it has been suggested that research on work and family roles should focus on understanding the processes by which commitment to these roles is built and sustained (Bielby, 1992). Informed by this view, data obtained through structured questionnaires from dual-earner couples (N = 207) in Hong Kong were used to constructively replicate the work of Bielby and Bielby (1989). The thesis of this paper is that as individuals become involved in a role, they develop an identity attached to that role. Results of the regression analysis revealed support for the thesis but generally, in ways consistent with the prescribed roles of men and women in a gender-stratified social system. In addition, the results revealed that women balance their work and family identity by trading-off one for the other. In contrast, men are able to simultaneously identify with work and family roles. Limitations of the study, directions for future research, and implications of the findings for a balanced ...

Title: Dominant Ideologies, Strategic Change, and Sustained Performance
Author-Name: Doug A. Stace
Abstract: Strategies for organizational change which are successful in one business era, and in one culture, may not necessarily be successful in another. Yet the evidence is that powerful espoused ideologies about how best to effect change often live on within organizations, well beyond their capacity to help sustain positive performance. The espoused ideal approach to change becomes a myth which clouds the ability of managers to analyze their environment incisively and to move against the prevailing logic of change in the organization. It is suggested in this paper that often the best moves in organizational change may be countercyclical-against the preferred ideologies of change in the organization. Managers therefore need good contingency maps and models of change, rather than fixed ideologies and recipes, and the courage to move against the trend. This is made all the more difficult by researchers and management writers, who describe, espouse, and normalize dominant, preferred "best practice" ideas of change w...

Title: Three Faces of Eden: The Persistence of Competing Theories and Multiple Diagnoses in Organizational Intervention Research
Author-Name: Amy C. Edmondson
Abstract: Recently, three noted scholars in the field of organizational development and action research, Edgar Schein, Peter Senge, and Chris Argyris, decided to collaborate on research at the newly formed Center for Organizational Learning at MIT. This article presents an analysis of factors impeding this collaboration, drawing from the literature and from the author's experiences as a researcher at the center. The article compares the three strategies for intervention research, and explores the theories of organizational effectiveness implied by each. Core challenges for each approach are identified, followed by theoretical and temperamental factors that may contribute to the persistence of separate approaches. Finally, options for collaborative research are reviewed, along with a recommendation for an integrative approach.

Title: Developing an Organization Capable of Implementing Strategy and Learning
Author-Name: Michael Beer
Author-Name: Russell A. Eisenstat
Abstract: Acting as consultants, the authors developed a process by which leadership teams in Alpha Technologies' many business units could develop an organization capable of implementing strategy and learning. Leadership teams of 20 units implemented the self-diagnosis and redesign process between 1988 and 1994. The process was designed to develop the ongoing capacity of the client organization to achieve systemic change, to surface undiscussible data about barriers, as well as to develop a partnership with employees. Research was conducted to determine whether the intervention achieved its intended objectives, as well as to understand the elements of the intervention design, and managerial and organizational context that lead to these results. The research, funded by the Harvard Business School, relied on the following methods: content analysis of task force reports, interviews, questionnaires, and participant observation. The process succeeded in the short term in all of its attended objectives. The process, how...

Title: Understanding and Creating Whole Organizational Change Through Learning Theory
Author-Name: Chris Hendry
Abstract: The management of change has become characterized by an atheoretical pragmatism, overfocused on the political aspects of the change process. Emerging interest in the learning organization provides an occasion to remedy this, by developing a theory of change which is more congruent with the requirement to build learning capacity within organizations. The result should be to place learning theory more centrally within the theory of planned organizational change. This should also reinvigorate action research by defining a wider range of learning technologies and perspectives. The argument is developed by first reviewing theories of learning employed in organizational change. The notion of communities-of-practice is then developed as a core concept to highlight the paradoxical processes of inertia and change centered on groups. A series of examples is then drawn from a recent action research project in order to illustrate the possibilities for applying learning theory. Finally, a research agenda is set out fo...

Title: A Predictive Model of Self-Managing Work Team Effectiveness
Author-Name: Susan G. Cohen

Author-Name: Gretchen M. Spreitzer
Abstract: This paper tests a theoretically-driven model of self-managing work team effectiveness. Self-managing work team effectiveness is defined as both high performance and employee quality of work life. Drawing on different theoretical perspectives including work design, self-leadership, sociotechnical, and participative management, four categories of variables are theorized to predict self-managing work team effectiveness: group task design, encouraging supervisor behaviors, group characteristics, and employee involvement context. Data is collected from both a set of self-managing and traditionally managed teams from a large telephone company, and the model is tested with structural equations modeling. Support is found for hypotheses concerning group task design, group characteristics, and employee involvement context, but not encouraging supervisory behaviors.

Title: Teams: Panaceas or Prescriptions for Improved Performance?
Author-Name: Dexter Dunphy
Author-Name: Ben Bryant
Abstract: This paper addresses the contribution of teams to organizational performance. It distinguishes between three types of team attributes: technical expertise, self-management, and self-leadership, reviewing each attribute and assessing its relative contribution to three aspects of organizational performance: cost, value, and innovation. The paper also addresses the issue of the relatively neglected factor of the development costs of establishing and maintaining such groups and advocates a more rigorous approach to making a cost/benefit analysis before instituting teams. Finally, the paper advances a model of team development based on team attributes and performance objectives. Overall, therefore, this paper advances a classification of team attributes which is intended to facilitate team design and development, and which is potentially applicable to all teams in organizations.

Author-Name: Christopher B. Keys
Abstract: Two of the authors of this paper have developed a model for promoting intergroup collaboration called collaborative advocacy. This model aims at achieving intergroup relationships that are both productive and empowering for their members; its cornerstone process goals include intergroup cooperation, group co-empowerment, and member empowerment. In this paper, an outside researcher and the two developers of this model describe and evaluate its use in the advisory board of an education and advocacy project for persons with developmental disabilities, family members, and professionals. Results of archival and interview investigations indicated that the project has succeeded in fostering educational activities, spawning the development of new advocacy projects, obtaining financial support, and providing opportunities for participants to make public contributions to the understanding of disabilities. Most board members have been satisfied with their level of influence. Group differences remain regarding the ad...

Abstract: This manuscript examines neoclassical economic theory's egoistic, hedonistic, and autonomous kind of individualism and argues that this theoretical perspective on self can be congruent with executive power and control behavior. Using ideal-types of models, it proposes how this kind of executive behavior can arise from ego-insecurity to stifle the potential for shared meaning and social integration in organizations.

Title: Contracting Careers
Author-Name: Peter Herriot
Author-Name: Carole Pemberton
Abstract: In the light of the changing economic and organizational contexts for careers, it is argued that a model of organizational careers needs to be: contextualized; interactive between individual and organization; subjective, not normative; processual, not structural; tolerant of different interests; and cyclical in nature. A model of organizational career as a sequence of renegotiations of psychological contracts is proposed. These contracts are based both on a perceived match between one's own wants and what the other has to offer, and on the exchange of promised offers. The cost-benefit ratio of this exchange for themselves is optimized by each party, and is affected by the power each takes into the negotiation. Responses to the contract by each party are based on their perceptions of its equity and of whether it has been honored. Depending on whether the contract is transactional or relational in nature, a variety of outcomes will ensue, including exit from the contract or its renegotiation. Since the mode...

Abstract: Building on research on collective relative deprivation, we used independent samples of psychologists and managers to assess the relationship of perceived discrimination to an individual's reactions to the job and to the organization. While workers perceived relatively little sex discrimination, women perceived more discrimination against women than did men, and both sexes perceived more discrimination against women than discrimination against men. For women, perceptions of discrimination against women were associated with lower feelings of power and prestige on the job, more work conflict, more hours spent on paid work activities, and a lessened willingness to make the same career choice. Among men, perceptions of discrimination were related to few outcome measures. Implications for organizations are discussed.

Abstract: The psychometric properties and utility of the Helpgiving Practices Scale are described. The scale includes 25 items which measure different kinds of helpgiving practices that have previously been found associated with positive recipient outcomes, including psychosocial functioning and self-efficacy appraisals. Item analysis, internal consistency reliability, factor analysis, criterion-related validity, and known-groups validity found the scale to have excellent psychometric properties. The scale was especially useful for differentiating the helpgiving practices of professionals from different kinds of programs and agencies that varied on a continuum from professionally-centered to family-centered. Implications for research and practice are described.

Abstract: The adaptation of attitudes toward parents following migration was tested in a transnational study of Greek, German, and second-generation immigrant Greek adolescents in Germany (N = 342). Three major factors resulted on the first section of the Attitudes Towards Parents Inventory and these corresponded to parental involvement, achievement motivation, and family cohesion. Principal component analysis of the second section extracted the two factors obedience and parental conflict. Greeks per se (i.e., migrants and nonmigrants) shared the characteristic of higher levels of achievement motivation, otherwise the second generation Greeks were more similar to adolescents from their “host” country. Several gender differences emerged. The results are discussed within the framework of cultural integration vs. pluralism.

Title: The Anatomy of the Entrepreneur: Clinical Observations
Author-Name: Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries
Abstract: In psychoanalytic theory, studies of work behavior have been relatively scarce. Most of the existing literature concerns itself with cases of work inhibition or compulsion. Occasionally, one finds a discussion of people in the creative professions. No attention has been paid, however, to a major contributor to economic development in society, the entrepreneur. This contrasts sharply with the amount of attention given to entrepreneurs by other disciplines. The object of this study is to better understand the dynamics of entrepreneurship, and in particular the work behavior of entrepreneurs. First, there is a brief overview of the role of work in psychoanalytic theory. Then a number of factors important to entrepreneurship are reviewed from the perspective of economic, sociological, anthropological, psychological, and organizational theory. A case history is presented of one entrepreneur who chose to be treated through psychoanalysis. The intensity of this type of treatment means that continuity in observat...

Values underpin organizational structure and give it meaning. Drawing on concepts of culture, institutional theory, and archetypes, this paper tests hypotheses on the value/structure relationship. The sample used for the study was a set of Canadian amateur sport organizations undergoing institutional change. This test shows that there is a fit between elite values and the nature of the institutionally prescribed organizational archetype.

Title: A Multidirectional Approach Toward Leadership: An Extension of the Concept of Behavioral Complexity
Author-Name: Robert Hooijberg
Abstract: This paper explores the idea that behaviorally complex managers are more effective than their less complex counterparts. Behavioral complexity is assumed to have a repertoire and differentiation component. Behavioral repertoire refers to the portfolio of leadership functions managers can perform and behavioral differentiation to the ability of managers to vary the performance of their leadership functions depending on the situation. An empirical examination of the perceptions of the subordinates, peers, and superiors of the behavioral repertoire and differentiation of 282 middle managers from a large Fortune 50 manufacturing company and 252 managers from the public utility industry shows strong support for the notion that behavioral repertoire is positively associated with effectiveness and mixed support for the hypothesized positive relationship between behavioral differentiation and effectiveness.

Abstract: The research reported in this paper attempts to explain variation in career intent among physicians at a U.S. Air Force hospital. A causal model which comes from the research of Price-Mueller and their colleagues is used to explain career intent. The model is estimated with data collected from Wilford Hall Medical Center, the U.S. Air Force's tertiary-care center. Data were collected by questionnaires and from records. The variables are assessed with widely used organizational measures which are generally valid and reliable. Data are analyzed by ordinary least squares regression analysis. Seven variables are the most important in explaining career intent: organizational commitment, job satisfaction, search behavior, opportunity, met expectations, positive affectivity, and promotional chances. The causal model that has been tested primarily for female employees in civilian hospitals was found to operate just as well among male physicians in a military hospital.

Title: Organizational Commitment Across Cultures: The Impact of Antecedents on Korean Employees

Abstract: This study analyzed whether demographic and situational factors identified in the U.S.-based literature had the same antecedent influence on the commitment of 1192 employees in 27 large Korean firms. Consistent with U.S. studies, the Korean employees' position in the hierarchy, tenure in their current position and age all were significantly related to organizational commitment. Total tenure and education were not related. As for the situational antecedents, except for management style, all the others were significantly related. Specifically, as organization size increased, commitment decreased; as the structure became more employee focused, commitment increased; and the more positive the organizational climate perceptions, the more the commitment. Although the exceptions need to be explained, this study provides beginning evidence that the theoretical constructs predicting the organizational commitment of employees may have cross-cultural validity.

Title: Organizational Transformation: A Case Study of Two Aboriginal Organizations

Author-Name: Ian D. Chapman
Abstract: This paper describes two Canadian aboriginal organizations which have attempted a second-order change, a transformation of their belief system, to make their organizations operate in a manner consistent with traditional aboriginal beliefs, values, and customs. One organization completed a successful change, the other organization's change process was abandoned after 2 years. The process of organizational change followed by the two organizations illustrates the link between interpretive schemes, organizational actions, and organizational structures. The process which focused primarily on the link between the aboriginally-based interpretive scheme and actions proved more effective than the process that linked the structure and the interpretative scheme. For the successful organization, the process of organizational transformation was shown to be incremental, iterative, multifaceted and required a lengthy period of time to complete. During the early stages of process of change, both old and new interpretativ...

Author-Name: Howard S. Schwartz
Abstract: The roots of the postmodernist denigration of the patriarch are traced to the postwar middle class family. The premise of this family was that the father would work and make possible a sphere of family life in which maternal influences, based on a primordial image of the mother, could operate without constraint. But identification with the primordial mother was psychologically insupportable for the mother, who blamed the father and enlisted the son in her antagonism. This deprived the son of the possibility of forming a superego and resulted in his aliention. The daughter raised the antagonism to the level of social program and carried it forward.

Author-Name: Elizabeth Garnsey

Abstract: This paper examines the discourse surrounding a major U.K. initiative designed to increase the “quality and quantity” of women's participation in the workforce and in managerial roles. Texts are studied to explore ways in which the persistence of inequalities may, without apparent intention, be encoded in language. Our analysis suggests that cognitive schemata are framed by the dominant discourse, here of “target-setting” within organizations. We find from commentaries that even potential critics of the campaign were drawn into acceptance of a common agenda and have been thereby diverted from addressing other pressing issues affecting women's opportunities. This analysis draws upon a conceptual scheme which is concerned with ways in which cycles of cognition, action, and outcome collectively actualize social structures, a process referred to as social enactment. We explore how a conventional discourse reinforces enactment processes supporting prevailing structures while new discourse offers the potential ...

Title: Men, Women, and Attitudinal Commitment: The Effects of Workplace Experiences                 and Socialization
Author-Name: Diane Dodd-McCue
Author-Name: Gail B. Wright
Abstract: Women's underrepresentation in higher organizational ranks is often attributed to low attitudinal commitment. This study examines attitudinal commitment to determine its origins and whether it differs for men and women. Previous research indicates that men and women have different levels of attitudinal commitment. Two explanations of attitudinal commitment differences are the gender model and the job model. The gender model contends that socialization shapes attitudinal commitment; in contrast, the job model suggests that workplace experiences determine attitudinal commitment. This study tests these models using 328 accountants as subjects; controlling for subjects' professional and educational background minimizes the confounding of extraneous factors found in previous research. Attitudinal commitment and workplace experiences were measured using subjects' evaluation of organizational involvement and job satisfaction. Stepwise regression models predicted significant amounts of variation and identified th...

Abstract: This exploratory study examined satisfactions and work experiences of managerial and professional women as a function of the gender proportions of their organizations. Gender proportion considered both the number of women (predominantly women, 50% women, predominantly men) and their location (at every level, in senior management). Data were collected from 792 managerial and professional women using questionnaires completed anonymously. Most respondents worked in organizations with predominantly men in senior management although women were as likely as men to be present at other organizational levels. Gender proportion was found to have only modest effects, when personal and organizational factors were controlled.

Abstract: Recently, Thacker and Ferris (1991) proposed a theoretical model in which they suggested that targets' responses to sexual harassment would be influenced by the nature of the working relationship between the target and the harasser, the type of harassment, and gender. The purpose of this study is to investigate these potential influences, as well as duration, another situational influence, upon two types of target response: complaint/refusal and avoidance/going along. Respondents are employees of the Federal government. Findings suggest that both situational and individual influences have differential effects upon target response. Implications for the design of user-friendly sexual harassment prevention policies are discussed.

Title: Economics and Social Anthropology—Reconciling Differences
Author-Name: Peter J. Buckley
Author-Name: Malcolm Chapman
Abstract: This paper is the outcome of collaborative work between an economist and a social anthropologist. It explores the differences of outlook and approach between these two subjects, both in general, and in the specific context of a research project, “The Management of Cooperative Strategies,” which tests economistic hypotheses using methods largely derived from social anthropology. There remain major dissonanaces between the two subjects, but an attempt is made here to find fruitful common ground.

Title: Economics and Anthropology—Reluctant Partners
Author-Name: Mark Casson
Abstract: Recent developments in economic theory make it an opportune moment to re-examine the role of economic principles in the interpretation of anthropological evidence. In analyzing human motivation, economics now takes proper account of affective as well as material rewards, while its analysis of individual decision-making allows for cognitive limitations, where these can be expressed in terms of information costs. There remain significant gaps in economic theory, though, so far as anthropological applications are concerned, for example, in the economics of language and the economics of social control. The paper shows how the application of economics can be extended to these and other issues. In the light of this, it is argued that anthropologists can and should now make greater use of economic principles in their research.

Title: Corporate Cultural Fit and Performance in Mergers and Acquisitions
Author-Name: Yaakov Weber
Abstract: While cultural fit has been acknowledged to be a potentially important factor in mergers and acquisitions, the concept has been ill-defined. Hence, its relationships to other human aspects in mergers have not been rigorously examined. Further, the relationships between cultural differences and other human factors to the effectiveness of the integration process and financial performance have not been subject to rigorous research that use relatively large samples of mergers and acquisitions. The present study assesses the role of corporate cultural fit, autonomy removal, and commitment of managers to the merger in predicting effective integration between merger partners in different industry sectors. The relationships between, and role of, these variables are found to be complex; they vary across industries and have different relationships with different measures of performance.

Title: A Review and Critique of Workplace Industrial Relations Typologies
Author-Name: Jim Kitay
Author-Name: Mick Marchington
Abstract: Over the years, there have been a number of attempts to construct typologies of workplace industrial relations. Each of these typologies has been useful in helping us to differentiate between workplaces, but we have doubts about the comprehensiveness and applicability of these typologies, and concerns that authors do not justify why they have chosen to focus on certain variables to the neglect of others. The aim of this paper is to offer a review and critique of some of the most widely quoted typologies of workplace industrial relations, before putting forward our own ideas. We have constructed a typology for understanding and predicting how the process of industrial relations change will proceed at workplace level, which is illustrated by examples from our own research. It is hoped that this paper will stimulate further discussion about the nature of typologizing as well as contribute to our understanding of workplace industrial relations.

Author-Name: Pascal Paoli
Abstract: A survey on the work environment in Europe was carried out by the European Union in 1991. The sample of the study was 12,500 workers (about 1000 per country) and was representative for the workforce distribution in the EU according to occupation, gender, age, economic sectors, and company size. With the help of cluster-analysis, it was concluded that a four-cluster solution was the best to describe the situation in Europe with respect to the work environment. The four clusters were: the “Northern” cluster (Denmark, West Germany, former East Germany, the Netherlands, and Great Britain), the “Middle” cluster (Belgium and Luxembourg), the “Southern” cluster (Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, and Ireland), and the “isolated Southern” cluster (Greece). The overall quality of working life in the Southern countries and Ireland-in comparison to the other European countries-was below average. In the Northern and Middle European EU-countries the quality of the work environment was above average. In the discussion, it...

Title: Police Unions and the Police Role

Author-Name: Raymond G. Hunt
Abstract: We studied the relationship of police unions to several dimensions of the police role while controlling for characteristics of the department, its external environment, duty assignments, and the demographic characteristics of police officers. We also examined the relationship between these variables and the role outcomes. Questionnaire data were collected from 830 randomly selected rank-and-file police officers from 15 urban police departments. Our findings support our hypothesis that unionization is related to greater emphasis on the law enforcement component of the police role. There also are significant relationships between organizational tenure, duty assignment, geographic location, and variation in the way police roles are performed. Our findings also include significant relationships between various characteristics of the department's environment, characteristics of the department itself, duty assignments, demographic characteristics of police officers and the satisfaction of police officers with t...

Abstract: The study attempted to examine the effect of organizational commitment as a moderator of the stress-outcome relationship. In all, 106 (39 male, 67 female) professional and administrative officers from various departments of a public sector organization each completed a set of questionnaires which consisted of the Occupational Stress Indicator (OSI) which has six subscales relating to stressors, six relating to coping strategies, three relating to Type A, three to locus of control as well as three outcome measures: mental health, physical health and a five subscale job satisfaction measure. The Organizational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ) and a single item for intention to quit was also completed. According to previous findings (Begley & Czajka, 1993), individuals with high organizational commitment suffered less negative outcomes in terms of job satisfaction, mental and physical health, and intention to quit as compared to those who were less committed. Therefore it was predicted that commitment buffered...

Title: The Ethical Issue Emphasis of Companies: Content, Patterning, and Influences
Author-Name: Nigel Nicholson
Author-Name: Diana C. Robertson
Abstract: The study investigates the content and form of attention paid to ethics issues by U.K. firms. It considers the extent to which ethical attention can be characterized in terms of broad domain groupings, corresponding to company concerns with stakeholder groups, stewardship responsibilities, intrinsic values, and the social order of the firm. Survey results from an industry-stratified sample of 299 U.K. firms indicate that attention to ethical issues is industry-specific and a function of factors in the firm's operating environment. Of particular importance seem to be perceptions of public interest in the ethical conduct of management and staff, and in the social and environmental consequences of products and services. Results also indicate how companies manifest their ethical interests in different ways, including expressed concern, internal and external communications, and new policy formulation. Patterns across these criteria suggest scope for deeper analysis of relationships between ethical strategy, rh...

Title: Employee Cynicism: An Examination Using a Contract Violation Framework
Author-Name: Lynne M. Andersson
Abstract: Employee cynicism is an attitude characterized by frustration, hopelessness, and disillusionment, as well as contempt toward and distrust of business organizations, executives, and/or other objects in the workplace. This paper uses theory on contract violation to help integrate the diverse literature on cynicism and develop plausible propositions concerning some of the predictors and moderators of employee cynicism. First, the pertinent theory and research on cynicism is reviewed. Four specific domains of research are discussed in terms of their relevance to cynicism in an organizational setting. Next, the literature on psychological and implied contracts and their violation is presented as a framework for the study of employee cynicism. Finally, hypothetical linkages between cynicism and specific characteristics of the contemporary workplace are explored, offering propositions for future research.

Title: A Network Analysis of Social Contagion Processes in an Organizational Intervention
Author-Name: Gregory Bovasso
Abstract: Interventions aimed at changing the psychological attributes of individuals who form a social system may be limited by reliance on models and methods which do not account for the effects of social interaction on individual attributes. The use of network analysis to model the effects of social contagion on personal attributes is demonstrated in an evaluation of an organizational intervention. Sociometric indices of the norms created by social contagion predicted subjects' self-perceptions better than either expectations imposed on them in small groups or their own observable behavior. Social contagion stabilized the subjects' self-perceptions over time, despite the efforts of the intervention to change their self-perceptions through small group socialization and organizational restructuring. Network models of social contagion may provide useful tools for the design and evaluation of interventions that aim to change the attributes of individuals who form social systems. Further, these models theoretically i...

Title: Third-Party Sensemaking in Interpersonal Conflicts at Work: A Theoretical Framework
Author-Name: Roger J. Volkema
Author-Name: Katherine Farquhar
Author-Name: Thomas J. Bergmann
Abstract: Theoretical and empirical models of interpersonal conflict focus primarily on engagement and avoidance behaviors between the conflict parties. Recent studies of workplace conflicts, however, suggest that encounters with third parties (e.g., co-workers, friends, family) are common responses to perceived incompatibility of interests. This paper introduces a model for understanding conflict-induced sensemaking behaviors, grounded in the conflict and social cognition literatures. Three components of sensemaking are proposed-emotional, cognitive, and behavioral. These elements are influenced by the focus of the party initiating sensemaking, as we illustrate through case-history scenarios.

Abstract: This paper describes an empirical assessment of several hypotheses associated with organization design in the context of new and flexible technologies. Three distinct technologies were examined in four different geographical locations in Sweden, France, and Canada. The hypotheses illustrate how workplaces are being organized within the context of flexible, new technology, and the movement toward an emerging new paradigm of work. Flexible, new technologies and this paradigm are entering organizations at the same time. The former are changing the ground on which assumptions underlying the emerging paradigm of organization have been built. Several of the hypotheses examined have been revised as a consequence. The data from twelve companies are plotted on a matrix of organization design principles against organization design implementation to illustrate changing organization design patterns as well as geographic differences between the companies.

Title: An Exploration of Interpersonal Relationships in Two Taiwanese Computer Firms

Author-Name: G. Richard Holt
Abstract: This study provides a fuller description of some of the ways businesspeople relate to each other and their customers in Taiwan. Through ethnographies and extended interviews, relationship patterns in two Taipei computer companies are shown to be influenced by Chinese traditions which view human emotion and orders of relationship as the basis of society. Taiwanese employees, particularly salespeople, are shown as adept at fusing functional and emotional elements to flexibly manage interpersonal relationships in complex and dynamic Taiwanese social, political, and economic contexts. It is concluded that relationships, as social resources, manifest themselves in various levels of business conduct, influencing the functioning of Taiwan firms in the modern business environment.

Abstract: A field study of real estate agents' transactions demonstrates that business friendship affects the negotiation process and the outcome of some transactions more for senior agents with 10 or more years of experience in real estate brokerage than for less experienced agents. Senior agents may have different cognitive scripts for business friendship than do new licensees. Newer agents rely more on friendly relations and on attention to reputation in their transactions, while the more experienced agents consider genuine business friendship useful for facilitating transactions.

Abstract: Researchers have speculated on the nature of relations among parental satisfaction, school climate, and other variables. However, few empirical studies have examined relations among these variables in a causal framework, even when rhetoric of organizational change and its positive effects on parents, students, and teachers is abundant. The purpose of this study was to test a causal model incorporating school climate, school-parent communication, and parent empowerment and their effects on parental involvement and satisfaction. The present study employed a 71.2% sample of 42,818 parents (or 33,244 responding parents) from 122 elementary schools. Parent-school communication and school climate showed the strongest direct effects on parental satisfaction, followed by empowerment. The strongest indirect path to parental satisfaction was from school climate through informing parents. Other paths that showed weaker relations to parental satisfaction were: School climate-empowerment-informed; school climate-empow...

Title: The Downside of Downsizing
Author-Name: Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries
Author-Name: Katharina Balazs
Abstract: With the help of data obtained from open-ended interviews conducted with the various stakeholders in downsizing operations and applied within a clinical framework, individual reaction patterns are explored in the victims, the survivors (those staying with a company after layoffs), and the "executioners" (those responsible for the implementation of downsizing). Special emphasis is given to the reactions of the executives implementing the downsizing operation. Among this group of people, a number of ways of coping can be discerned, described as compulsive/ritualistic, abrasive, dissociative, alexithymic/anhedonic, and depressive. The article ends with a number of practical recommendations about how to facilitate the downsizing process. From the interviews conducted, it appears that downsizing, in the more narrow sense of the word, can be a quite destructive process. Reframing the concept so that downsizing is viewed as a continuous process of corporate transformation and change, a way to plan for the contin...

Title: The Limitations and Opportunities of Business Process Re-engineering in a                 Politicized Organizational Climate
Author-Name: Davd A. Buchananl
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the organizational change and project management issues raised by the implementation of a business process re-engineering (BPR) approach in the politicized hospital context. This is a report of research in progress, focusing on the issues arising at the problem definition and project planning stages of a BPR application in an operating theaters department experiencing problems with scheduling and delays. The research design relies on a case study approach, with the researcher as participant observer, as both an adviser to the project team and as field interviewer. The paper argues that an ambitious BPR agenda is compromised in at least two regards. First, the lack of precision surrounding the focus and methodology of BPR gives politically motivated actors considerable influence with respect to defining terms of reference in ways which will shape potential outcomes in their favor. Second, the complexity and indeterminacy of the business process or "patient trail" can also dilut...

Title: Organizational Learning and the Learning Organization: A Dichotomy Between                 Descriptive and Prescriptive Research
Author-Name: Eric W. K. Tsang
Abstract: Despite the growing popularity of the term 'organizational learning," writings on the topic have little consensus in terms of definition, perspective, conceptualization, and methodology. This article examines the dichotomy between two main streams of theorizing in the field. The first stream, prescriptive writings on the learning organization, is concerned with the question "How should an organization learn?" Targeting practitioners, these studies are usually based on the authors' consulting experience and seldom follow rigorous research methodologies. They also tend to overgeneralize their theories to all types of organization. Descriptive researches on organizational learning fall in the second stream which tackles the question "How does an organization learn?" These are academic studies striving for scientific rigor. Nevertheless, they often fail to generate useful implications for practitioners. In the final section of the article, brief suggestions are made to integrate the two streams of research.

Title: A Single Garbage Can Model and the Degree of Anarchy in Japanese Firms
Author-Name: Nobuo Takahashi
Abstract: This paper refreshes an empirical examination of the garbage can model, particularly in a sample drawn from Japanese firms. The garbage can model of organizational decision making was originally developed by Cohen, March, and Olsen (1972) to describe organized anarchy. This paper incorporates two methodologies in an attempt to both validate and extend the garbage can model: Simulation is first used to generate a research hypothesis, then several surveys are conducted to test that hypothesis and to empirically develop an ex-post model of decision ambiguity, flight, and anarchy. The data support our hypothesis and we find out new conditions of ambiguity: (i) fluid participation, (ii) divorce of solution from discussion, and (iii) job performance rather than subjective assessments, which are clearly related to the simulation assumption of our single garbage can model. By using our new conditions of ambiguity, we develop a measure of degree of anarchy, and the regression analysis indicates a linear relationsh...

Title: A Conceptual Framework for Assessing Organization, Work Group, and Individual                 Effectiveness During and After Downsizing
Author-Name: James B. Shaw
Author-Name: Elain Barrett-Power
Abstract: The need for a unified, cross-level (organization, work group, individual employee) model of organizational downsizing has been suggested by several authors (e.g., Kozlowski et al., 1993). The definition of downsizing, in terms applicable only at the organization level, prevents researchers from developing a more cohesive view of the interactive impact of downsizing for the organization, work groups, and individuals. In this paper, we define downsizing more broadly as a constellation of stressor events centering around pressures toward work force reductions which place demands upon the organization, work groups, and individual employees, and require a process of coping and adaptation. This stress-based view of downsizing allows researchers to develop concepts to guide research on downsizing that are more broadly applicable across levels of analysis. To show the advantages of this stress-based view of downsizing, this paper uses concepts from the stress coping literature to identify a set of critical depen...

Title: Members' Participation in the Union: An Investigation of Some Determinants in Singapore
Author-Name: Samuel Aryee
Author-Name: Yaw A. Debrah
Abstract: Data obtained from unionized employees in Singapore (N = 205) were used to investigate Strauss' (1977) suggestion that union participation studies be fitted into the general theories of role and commitment. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to examine the contribution of role commitment variables (family and union) net of demographic, job or work and union-related variables to the explained variance in a unidimensional model of union participation. The model accounted for 43% (R2) of the explained variance in participation with the role commitment antecedent set contributing a modest 5% (ΔR2). The significant positive individual variables were union satisfaction, union commitment, union tenure, and gender while union socialization and marital status positively, and family commitment negatively approached significance. Extrinsic satisfaction was significantly negatively related to participation. Limitations of the study, directions for future research and the implications of the findings are discussed.

Abstract: This paper extends previous work on the psychological impact on candidates of selection and assessment processes, presenting results from a study of 32 participants in an assessment center (AC) program of a major U.K financial services organization. Both quantitative and qualitative methodologies are used to investigate: (a) the impact of the assessment outcome on cognitive and affective reactions to the assessment process and candidates' post-assessment psychological states, job-related attitudes, and intentions, and (b) the role of factors such as quality of feedback from the assessor, managerial support, and career line position on the impact process. Results show that the assessment outcome decision does have an effect on post-assessment psychological states and work-related attitudes but this effect works through a person's perception of the impact the assessment process will have on their career. This perception of impact is well predicted by the candidate's perceived quality of feedback and current...

Title: Task Interdependence as a Moderator of the Relation Between Group Control and Performance
Author-Name: Robert C. Liden

Author-Name: Lisa K. Bradway
Abstract: Data were collected from the managers of 77 groups in a large service organization and a large manufacturing organization. The results revealed that the relation between group control over decision making and group performance became more positive with increased levels of task interdependence. The main implication of the findings is that increasing group control over decisions may result in high performance only for groups that are highly task interdependent. The performance of groups that are low in task interdependence may suffer when provided with group-level control of decisions.

Title: Group Identity and Individuality in Times of Crisis: Psychoanalytic                 Reflections on Social Psychological Knowledge
Author-Name: Ian Parker
Abstract: This paper locates contemporary social psychological conceptions of group identity in the context of crises in forms of knowledge, and in the ways researchers have responded to crises in disciplinary identity. Forms of group social psychology that emerged within the European tradition of research promised a fully social account of human activity and experience, but recent trends of research in the discipline, even within group identity frameworks, have returned to the individual as a focus of study. The work of Bion is used to draw attention to the ways in which crises in group identity often provoke particular varieties of response which serve to defend the group, varieties of response which look to the individual as an escape from the threat or as a solution to the problem.

Title: The Half Full or Half Empty Glass: The Views of the Economic Optimist vs Pessimist
Author-Name: Adrian Furnham
Abstract: This paper examines the economic beliefs and value correlates of adults either optimistic or pessimistic about their economic future. On the basis of an internally reliable, 19-item scale, nearly 277 British subjects were divided into economic pessimists, optimists, and status quo observers. These economic views were then correlated with ratings on economic social comparisons, beliefs about work, job involvement, and economic "values." Subjects with Marxist-related work beliefs tended to be more pessimistic and those with leisure ethic beliefs tended to be more optimistic. A multiple stepwise regression showed that nearly 45% of the variance could be accounted for by five factors which indicated that older, less religious, richer people who strongly believed in the humanistic work-belief system, but not in the leisure ethic, tended to be more pessimistic about the economic future of their country. The results are discussed in terms of the literature on psychological and economic optimism and pessimism.

Title: Longevity and Cultural Differences of International Joint Ventures: Toward                 Time-Based Cultural Management
Author-Name: Pierre-Xavier Meschi
Abstract: This article explores the relationships among time, organizational, and national cultural distance in an international joint venture setting. More particularly, the extent to which the longevity of an international joint venture affects the intensity of its cultural differences, is investigated in a sample of 51 international joint ventures set up in Hungary. It addresses certain mechanisms available to an international joint venture's managers and to its partners to deal with cross-cultural issues. The results suggest that the temporal dimension is a cultural moderator of prime importance, but to be totally effective, it must be combined with a willful strategy of cultural integration.

Title: Psychoanalytic Challenges: A Contribution to the New Sexual Agenda
Author-Name: Stephen Frosh
Abstract: Behind its conservative facade and the rigidity of much of its clinical practice, psychoanalysis retains a disruptive attitude toward conventional discourses on gender and sexuality. This attitude derives from psychoanalysis' capacity to “ook awry” at experience and consequently to undermine notions of fixed identity, including sexual identity. In contemporary work, much of the debate on psychoanalysis' disruptive consciousness, particularly among feminists, has centered on the contribution of Lacanian thinking and in particular on the question of whether Lacan offers a more rigorous alternative to object relational accounts of gender identity and sexual difference. In this paper, the debate on psychoanalysis' contribution to the "new sexual agenda" is introduced and furthered by exploration of the notion of identification as used first in some non-Lacanian work by Jessica Benjamin, and then in a classic seminar of Lacan's. It is suggested that both Benjamin and Lacan offer insights into the “provisional”...

Title: The Determinants of Parenthood: Power and Responsibility
Author-Name: Mili Mass
Abstract: The conception of parental adaptation in terms of the complexity of the balance between the parent's responsibility and the infant's power is presented. A method based on this conception is proposed as a way to describe and assess parental adaptation. The adaptational view is compared with the clinical approach to parenthood, and its advantages for the detection of parental vulnerability and early intervention in the parent-infant relationship is illustrated. In addition, the conception of parental responsibility, in terms of the parent's evaluation of the balance between his/her responsibility and the infant's power, is compared with the conception of the legal approach which views parental responsibility in terms of accountability and the parent's duties and rights. The evolving change in the societal view of parental responsibility, brought about by the Children Act, requires a shift in the conceptualization of parenthood such as the one proposed by the adaptational conception. This could constitute a ...

Title: Social Movement Rhetoric and the Social Psychology of Collective Action: A                 Case Study of Anti-Abortion Mobilization
Author-Name: Nick Hopkins
Author-Name: Steve Reicher
Abstract: This paper seeks to contribute toward an integrated approach to social movement mobilization. It does so through considering how a social psychological account of the determination of collective behavior (self-categorization theory) may be applied to the mobilization rhetoric of social movements. More specifically it argues that as people may define themselves and act in terms of social categories, we may usefully conceive of social movement rhetoric as being organized so as to construct social category definitions which allow the activists' preferred course of action to be taken on by others as their own. Our theoretical argument is illustrated through the detailed analysis of category construction in contemporary U.K. anti-abortion argumentation.

Title: An Exploration of the Meaning and Consequences of Workaholism

Author-Name: Marcia P. Miceli
Abstract: Although much has been written about "workaholism," rigorous research and theoretical development on the topic is in its infancy. We integrate literature from. multiple disciplines and offer a definition of workaholic behavior. We identify three types of workaholic behavior patterns: compulsive-dependent, perfectionist, and achievement-oriented workaholism. A preliminary model is proposed; it identifies potential linkages between each type of workaholism pattern and important outcomes such as performance, job and life satisfaction, and turnover. Specific propositions for future research are articulated. We conclude that, depending on the type of workaholic behavior pattern, workaholism can be good or bad, and its consequences may be experienced or evaluated differently by individuals, organizations, and society at large. Researchers and managers should avoid making judgments about the positive or negative effects of workaholism until more carefully controlled research has been published.

Title: Meeting God: When Organizational Members Come Face to Face with the Supreme Leader
Author-Name: Yiannis Gabriel
Abstract: This paper focuses on a theme which features in numerous organizational stories, in which an "ordinary" member of of an organization comes face to face with the organization's top leader. This theme echoes not only the archetypical religious scene of meeting God as supreme judge, but also several well-known scenes in drama, opera, and literature. Through a psychoanalytic study of this theme, a set of primal phantasies projected by organizational members onto their leaders are explored. The paper also throws into sharp relief the underlying asymmetry of the relationship between leader and follower: while the follower may shake the leader's hand once, the leader will shake innumerable hands. The paper is based on a detailed interpretation of three narratives supplied by students, drawn from 6-month industrial placements (internships) which they undertook as part of their studies. In the first narrative, a student describes her encounter with the leader in almost religious terms as a liminal moment in her li...

Title: How Can We Train Leaders if We Do Not Know What Leadership Is?
Author-Name: Richard A. Barker
Abstract: Views of leadership that focus on the traits and behaviors of the leader are commonly used to develop training programs. Although these leadership training programs have some application, they suffer from several problems. First, there is no reasonable agreement on what traits or behaviors are leadership traits or behaviors. Second, there is no way to differentiate what makes a good leader from what makes an effective manager or an effective person. And third, people who emerge from these training programs rarely become what anyone might define as good leaders. A view of leadership as a community development process is explored as an alternative to traditional leadership approaches, and its implications for training and education are discussed.

Title: Graduates' Construction Systems and Career Development
Author-Name: Valerie Fournier
Abstract: The paper draws on the Chicago School's conceptualization of career and on Personal Construct Psychology to examine the relationships between graduates' construction systems and patterns of career development during the first 4 years of employment. It seeks to identify differences in trends of constructive revision between "successful" and "less successful" graduates. The study is based on 33 graduates who completed repertory grids on entering employment (T1), 6 months later (72), and 4 years later (T3), re-eliciting constructs each time. The results show some significant change in the nature of the constructs elicited by graduates over the 4 years; in particular, graduates made greater use of constructs related to achievement, cynicism, and organizational politics. Graduates whose career was more "successful" (i.e., who experienced one or two promotions during the 4 years of the study and felt generally satisfied with their careers) were more likely to use constructs related to social behavior and flexib...

Title: Experiencing Work: Values, Attitudes, and Moods
Author-Name: Jennifer M. Georgel
Author-Name: Gareth R. Jones
Abstract: This paper describes a model (the VAM model) which integrates three of the most significant dimensions of the work experience, work values, attitudes, and moods, into one overarching framework. The VAM model proposes that a rich and more complete understanding of the experience of work necessitates the simultaneous consideration of work values, attitudes, and moods. After describing how work values, attitudes, and moods, each capture key aspects of experiencing work, we discuss three important dimensions along which they vary: time, dynamism, and focus. These dimensions underscore the need for the simultaneous consideration of values, attitudes, and moods for a fuller understanding of the work experience. We then describe how work values, attitudes, and moods have the potential to influence each other. Finally, we discuss the implications of the VAM model for understanding important organizational outcomes including extra-role behavior, job performance, social loafing, absenteeism, and turnover.

Abstract: Organizational innovation is now widely seen to be a major source of competitive advantage for firms, along with product and process innovation. One of the major intellectual sources for the current organizational upheavals, in which firms strive for some form of "international best practice," is the sociotechnical systems tradition, which traces its roots back to innovations such as semi-autonomous work teams in manufacturing in the 1960s, associated with the work of the Tavistock Institute. An international Colloquium was staged in Melbourne, Australia, in May 1995, to explore the current relevance and contribution of STS ideas to organizational innovation.

Title: From Complex Organizations with Simple Jobs to Simple Organizations with Complex Jobs

Author-Name: Ben Dankbaarl
Abstract: Organization redesign has become widely accepted as a regular task for management, recently invigorated by the interest in Business Process Reengineering. In spite of that, it is still a neglected area in organization science. This paper emphasizes the importance of design theory and design-oriented research. The potential role of design theory is exemplified by the description of Integral Organizational Renewal (I0R), a design theory grounded in practical experience in the Netherlands. This approach can be viewed as a Dutch variant of Sociotechnical Systems Design. The essence of this approach lies in the transformation of complex organizations offering simple jobs into simple organizations offering complex jobs. IOR can both be regarded as an expert approach and as a route for self-design. The approach enables the members of the organization to develop and use their own design expertise. IOR is therefore not only a strategy for organization design, but for organization development as well. The paper poi...

Title: What To Do When You Can't Have It All: Toward a Theory of Sociotechnical Dependencies
Author-Name: Ann Majchrzak
Abstract: It is often the case that ideal sociotechnical systems (STS) profiles cannot be implemented. Consequently, STS designers often must decide which among the many design features in an ideal STS profile to implement. This paper presents a theory for understanding the dependencies among ideal design features. With such a theory, if choices among ideal features must be made, the relative impact of choosing not to implement one ideal feature on the effectiveness of other ideal features will be better understood. Several propositions are offered based on the theory, including a proposal that not all ideal design features are needed since some can compensate for others. The theory was applied to manufacturing organizations and tested using data obtained from site visits to 86 companies. The results indicated that the theory significantly differentiated higher from lower performing manufacturing organizations. The theory has been embodied in a computational modeling software program that has been used by over 50 i...

Title: Lean Production: Denial, Confirmation or Extension of Sociotechnical Systems Design?
Author-Name: Ben Dankbaar
Abstract: This paper makes a comparison between the basic elements of lean production and sociotechnical systems design (STSD) and compares them both with the characteristics of the traditional Fordist system of mass production. It argues that lean production can hardly be considered as an alternative to mass production, as its proponents suggest, but is on the contrary extending the life of mass production methods. However, lean production does appear to contain some building blocks for the innovative production systems that are expected to prevail in the 21st century. STSD, which has always presented itself as an alternative and possible successor to Fordist methods, will need to link its traditional concerns for quality of work and flexibility of work organizations with the new issues of continuous improvement, learning, and innovation.

Title: Sociotechnical Systems and Unions: Nicety or Necessity
Author-Name: Edward Cohen-Rosenthal
Abstract: Sociotechnical systems (STS) theorists have largely ignored the role of unions both in their theoretical framework and in STS implementation. This oversight weakens the potential application and dissemination of STS theory and practice. STS democracy is frequently seen by its proponents as preferable to union democracy except when they come to the same conclusion. Unions have historically played a key role in the development and success of seminal STS initiatives but are not seen as a critical specification for success. Many practitioners have noted the instrumental importance of unions in unionized settings without acknowledging class, conflict, or union values. As such, many unions have dismissed or resisted STS innovations. Despite these serious shortcomings, the labor process argument has failed to produce a credible alternative to STS principles. In some cases, the union role has been central to STS reforms and examples like these have prompted some national union movements to promote work reform wit...

Abstract: The founders of the sociotechnical model perceived its relevance at the macro level of the community, at the meso level of whole organizations, as well as at the micro level of the primary work systems, but it is at the primary work system that most applications have been carried out. An efficient micro level sociotechnical solution may still cause the technology to have a harmful impact on the environment. An increasing popular awareness of environmental damage due to certain technologies leads one to consider an extension of the Important joint optimization concept to a systemic heuristic device called the socioecotechnical model in which the intra and extra-organizational factors can be jointly assessed and optimized.

Title: The Cognitive Analysis of Competitive Structures: A Review and Critique
Author-Name: Gerard P. Hodgkinson
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growth of interest in the study of business competition from a cognitive perspective. This paper reviews this rapidly expanding literature in order to synthesize key empirical findings and identify significant theoretical and methodological issues which warrant further investigation. It is argued that the notion of "competitive enactment" and the associated "cognitive life cycle" approach recently advanced by Porac and his associates (Porac, Thomas, & Baden-Fuller, 1989; Porac & Thomas, 1990; Levenhagen, Porac, & Thomas, 1993) represent a potentially major breakthrough in our understanding of the dynamics of competition in industries and markets. However, several important propositions are derived for which the currently available empirical evidence is found wanting. Furthermore, a number of methodological hurdles are identified which have yet to be overcome if the validity of these propositions is to be investigated with an acceptable degree of rigor.

Title: A Popperian View of Change in Innovative Organizations
Author-Name: Reginald Shareef
Abstract: The cognitive model used by theorists and practitioners to understand organization change is most likely based on Kuhn's paradigm scheme of normal (i.e., the routine verification of the dominant theory in any historical period) vs. revolutionary (i.e., the abrupt development of a rival paradigm that can only be accepted gradually by the scientific community) science. This perspective suggests that scientific revolutions are rare. However, this article contends that changes are occurring so rapidly in innovative organizations that Kuhnian notions of "scientific revolutions" do not adequately describe this phenomena. Rather, these changes are more congruent with Sir Karl Popper's concept of "revolution in permanence." The conclusions of this research should allow organization stakeholders to better understand (1) the process of change in innovative organizations, and (2) how to facilitate these changes.

Title: Ignoring Commitment Is Costly: New Approaches Establish the Missing Link                 Between Commitment and Performance
Author-Name: Birgit Benkhoff
Abstract: The branch network of a bank was used to investigate the link between employee commitment and organizational performance in terms of sales targets met and change in profits. Commitment was measured by the conventional Organizational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ) and different variations of a specifically designed new commitment scale. The approach taken involved the application of multiple regression analysis. That way a variety of factors assumed to contribute to performance, apart from commitment, could be included in the model and held constant. It emerged that employee commitment is significantly related to the financial success of bank branches. The results varied depending on how commitment and performance were measured. Supervisory commitment appears to have a particularly strong impact on the outcome indicators.

Title: Becker's Side-Bet Theory of Commitment Revisited: Is It Time for a Moratorium                 or a Resurrection?
Author-Name: Jean E. Wallace
Abstract: The results of Cohen and Lowenberg's 1990 meta-analysis of 50 studies that empirically test Becker's (1960) side-bet model provide little empirical support for his theory of commitment. They conclude that severe limitations of past research, both in terms of measuring commitment and the strategies used to test the side-bet model, may be responsible for the lack of empirical support. Alternatively, they submit that if these methodological problems are not at fault, we should consider abandoning the side-bet theory. Three limitations of past side-bet research are addressed in this study. The results of this study suggest that it is time to resurrect Becker's side-bet theory of commitment. In doing so, we should subject his theory to tests that employ more valid and direct measures of the side-bet variables, that use measures of continuance commitment rather than affective commitment, and that apply to both organizational and occupational commitment.

Title: The Protestant Ethic: Weber's Model and the Empirical Literature
Author-Name: Harold B. Jones, Jr.
Abstract: Empirical research with regard to the Protestant ethic is reviewed in relation to Weber's model of the part a specifically religious ethos played in the rise of capitalism. Weber argued that Western legal and commercial changes were not in themselves an adequate explanation. Essential also was the set of values emphasized by ascetic Protestantism: self-discipline, hard work, the careful use of time, the reinvestment of one's gains, personal honesty, creative innovation, and faith in the rewards of a just God. Empirical research has found positive correlations between Protestant ethic values and internal locus of control (self-discipline), hard work, honesty, and belief in a just world. Findings with regard to the use of time and money are inconclusive. The relationship with creative innovation has not been examined. There is a need for empirical study of the relationship between the Protestant ethic and personal religious orientation.

Title: The Myth of Management: Direction and Failure in Contemporary Organizations
Author-Name: Martin Bowles
Abstract: Life in organizations and society appears to many social commentators as increasingly more demanding and insensitive to the needs of people. In this paper, the "Myth of Management" is explored to investigate some of the key beliefs and images through which contemporary management is practiced. Myth, in this context, is understood as consisting of beliefs and values which serves to provide meaning for human action. The adoption of a particular mythic frame is argued to direct the management of organizations to particular ends and purposes. Central to a "Myth of Management" are the doctrines of Social Darwinism and Function Rationality, and these are briefly evaluated in their impact on organizational life. An archetypal approach, with particular reference to the archetype of the "hero," is employed to explore the depth dimensions which underpin the formulation and exercise of the "Myth of Management." The conclusion reached is that the myth of management exacts a critical cost on people and society which c...

Title: CEO Succession: Overcoming Forces of Inertia
Author-Name: Michael C. White
Author-Name: Mark Smith
Author-Name: Tim Barnett
Abstract: Population ecologists suggest that inertial pressures make it difficult for organizations to adapt their strategies and structures in response to environmental changes. One way in which organizations may attempt to overcome these inertial tendencies is by selecting executive successors with different career specializations than their predecessors, which may enable them to better cope with changing environmental contingencies. The present study examined the relationship between the previous CEO's career specialization, the corporate strategy in place at the time of the succession event, and the career specialization of the new CEO from 1981-1990. The results suggest that organizations often chose successors with different career specializations than their predecessors, and that previous corporate strategy was a relatively poor predictor of successors' specializations. These results differ from earlier research findings concerning executive succession between 1957-1981. Possible reasons for these difference...

Abstract: Few topics have resulted in as much theory, empirical study, controversy, and practical application as participative decision-making (PDM). Although most past empirical research has assumed that the decision-making process in PDM was unidimensional, this paper explores a multidimensional view and examines the integration of degree of participation and decision-making processes and their relationship with satisfaction and performance. The results suggest that the degree of involvement in generating alternatives, planning, and evaluating results are related significantly to satisfaction and that degree of involvement in generating alternatives and planning are related significantly to performance.

Title: The Revolt Against Cultural Authority: Power/Knowledge as an Assumption in                 Organization Theory
Author-Name: Steven P. Feldman
Abstract: Foucault-inspired organization theory has interpreted the Enlightenment effort to make reason the foundation for human freedom as a failure. Reason is seen as developing into "disciplinary knowledge," which dominates modern organizations and the individuals who live and work in them. In fact, the individual's very identity is the means by which the individual is enslaved. Knowledge is thus seen as nowhere separate from power. In this essay, I will use a concept of traditional authority to examine Foucault-inspired organization theory and its power/knowledge conceptual framework in terms of their ethical and cultural implications. This will include Foucault's influence on both the literature in critical organization theory and postmodern organization theory. My approach will highlight the Foucault-inspired misinterpretation of the effect of the Enlightenment on modem organizations, its rejection of the authority of the past as a basis for moral order, and its impossible attempt to find "freedom" through th...

Title: Challenges to the Social Foundations of Capitalism in an Age of Global Economics
Author-Name: John D. Aram
Abstract: Capitalism transforms its own social foundations even as it holds forth the prospect of continuing human advancement. This paper examines changes in nation-state, civil society, and democracy in response to the forces of global capitalism. These institutions, all associated with Western liberalism and the advent of industrialization, represent forms of social integration important to the success of capitalism. However, they appear to be deeply affected by economic globalization, and their capacities to ensure social stability are in question. This analysis leads to policy directions for reducing the socially-corrosive effects of global capitalism, strengthening the capacities of foundation social institutions, and exploring a value synthesis between liberalism and moral community.

Title: Identification with the Human Species: A Challenge for the Twenty-First Century

Abstract: The unanticipated proliferation of ethnic conflicts, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and Eastern European satellites, poses a perplexing question: Can human beings develop an identification with more inclusive social units than ethnic/racial groupings and nation-states? A concentric circle model is presented of multiple identities, from the self to the human species. Achieving an identification with the human species-a substantial challenge for the twenty-first century-would have profound implications for the incidence and resolution of interethnic and international conflicts.

Title: Organizational Hope: Reaffirming the Constructive Task of Social and                 Organizational Inquiry
Author-Name: James D. Ludema
Author-Name: Timothy B. Wilmot
Author-Name: Suresh Srivastva
Abstract: This paper develops the construct of organizational hope as a methodological imperative for studying and strengthening organizations. It calls on organizational scholars and practitioners to move beyond the critical impulse by advancing "textured vocabularies of hope" that affirm the best and most promising dimensions of social and organizational life and provide a moral image of the future to guide collective action. This can be accomplished by defining hopeful research agendas and choosing methods of inquiry that explore and illuminate the hopes and aspirations of a broad range of organizational members. After clarifying the concept of textured vocabularies of hope, this paper undertakes a thorough analysis of hope by tracing the construct throughout the Western intellectual tradition, highlighting four of hope's enduring qualities, and offering a set of propositions that extends the implications of organizational hope to our task as scholars and practitioners.

Title: Evolutionary Psychology: Toward a New View of Human Nature and Organizational Society
Author-Name: Nigel Nicholson
Abstract: The paper argues that evolutionary psychology offers a radical and challenging new perspective on human nature and organizational society. Its roots in a convergence of insights and scientific discoveries from diverse natural and human sciences are described, and how it seeks to avoid common fallacies of earlier biological reasoning about human society. Recurrent themes in human nature and their manifestations are summarized, including sex and personality differences, cognitive and affective biases, social orientations, and preferred modes of social exchange. The paper concludes that we suffer the consequences of poor fit between our inherited natures and many of the constructed environments in organizational society, but that new emerging forms of organization may present us with the opportunities for social relations closer to the ancestral paradigms of our psychology.

Title: Disciplines of Organizational Learning: Contributions and Critiques
Author-Name: Mark Easterby-Smith
Abstract: The paper argues against attempts to create a single framework for understanding organizational learning. Relevant literature is reviewed from six disciplinary perspectives: psychology and OD; management science; sociology and organizational theory; strategy; production management; and cultural anthropology. It is argued that each discipline provides distinct contributions and conceptions of problems. Furthermore, a basic distinction between organizational learning and the new idea of the learning organization is noted. Whereas the former is discipline based and analytic, the latter is multidisciplinary and emphasizes action and the creation of an "ideal-type" of organization. Due to the diversity of purpose and perspective, it is suggested that it is better to consider organizational learning as a multidisciplinary field containing complementary contributions and research agendas.

Title: Abjection and Organization: Men, Violence, and Management
Author-Name: Stephen Linstead
Abstract: This paper explores case material to show the extent to which non-organizational experiences of violence can shape subsequent behavior within organizations. These connections are not commonly considered either in the study of organizational behavior or of managerial practice, because behaviors from other arenas, adaptations, and responses, can be reproduced many years away from the source of anxiety. These behaviors are widespread, patterned, cyclical, and carry an inevitability about them that cannot be modified simply by changing behavior alone. The paper concentrates on examples where the extent of pathological behavior is easily seen, but the processes which surface are common mechanisms of "ordinary" human behavior and more attenuated experiences of violence within organizations operate similarly. These processes are discussed through the work of object-relations theorists, Julia Kristeva, and recent theorists of masculinity, arguing that bureaucracies seek to deny the emotional dimension of their be...

Title: Supervisor Intervention with Troubled Workers: A Social Identity Perspective
Author-Name: Karen M. Hopkins
Abstract: Supervision has evolved from managing and directing workers to supporting workers. Supervisors are key people that workers go to for assistance with personal problems. This article reviews the contributions of various theoretical models to our understanding of supervisor intervention with troubled workers and identifies factors that have been left unexplored in the research. From this analysis, I explain how social identity theory may provide a framework that overcomes many of the limitations of the existing knowledge in this area. Social identity theory has the potential to capture the more personal aspects of the helping process between supervisors and workers that go beyond workers' job performance and productivity, including supervisors' beliefs and attitudes, personal experiences, and social identification with the organization and the work group.

Abstract: Data from 666 employees of a large midwestern telephone company were analyzed to identify communication pattern differences between: (a) males and females; (b) exempt and nonexempt employees; and (c) employees using rich and lean communication media. MANOVA and discriminant function analyses results indicated females sent less information to supervisors and experienced less information overload than males. Exempt employees interacted more with department heads and sent less information to peers than nonexempt employees. Those using the richest media communicated more with supervisors while those using the leanest media received most of their information from department heads. Additionally, interaction effects were detected. Discussion is advanced on how these findings might be used to improve intraorganizational communication.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of a preliminary study on the recognition of affect attunement in adult psychotherapy. Brief extracts from six videotaped therapy sessions were shown to experienced clinicians, who were asked to judge whether the therapist was attuned to the client/patient or not. Clear examples of attunement and non-attunement were obtained and these were then shown to a sample of postgraduate social work trainees. The trainee results showed none of the consistency of the clinicians' judgments: 67% (n = 21) were undecided about the example of attunement, with only 19.3% (n = 6) giving responses which corresponded with those of the clinicians. For the non-attuned extract, just over a third gave a response which coincided with the clinicians, with 42% (n = 13) undecided. The results were used to develop a model for future research on affect attunement, which should provide the basis for the development of strategies for teaching the attunement skills which may be required by therapists.

Abstract: This paper argues that our understandings of ourselves as gendered, as either masculine or feminine, are a power effect of the contemporary discourse of gender difference. The main premise of the paper is that this social construction of gender allows for gender difference to be resisted-and the form of resistance analyzed here is gender-inappropriate dress. Two forms of gender-inappropriate dress-male transvestism and female power dressing-are discussed in the paper and argued to present a particular kind of challenge to our discursively constituted sense of the rigidity and mutual exclusivity of the gender divide. This analysis is used in the conclusion to offer some critical comments regarding the strand of organizational analysis which argues for a "feminization/reeroticization" of the workplace.

Title: The Effects of Gender Role Congruence and Statistical Discrimination on Managerial Advancement
Author-Name: Alison M. Konrad
Author-Name: Kathy Cannings
Abstract: This paper makes the argument that the managerial advancement process is different for women and men. Men in management who choose to participate more fully in family labor experience gender role congruence pressures and are penalized in the workplace. Women in management experience statistical discrimination, meaning that they are viewed with suspicion and that their commitment and competence is over-tested. Findings from data collected in two large firms supported the gender role congruence and statistical discrimination perspectives. Specifically, effort expended on paid work was more strongly positively associated with advancement for men than for women. Participating in household labor hurt men's advancement more than it did women's. Demonstrating competence in a series of internal organizational experiences was more strongly associated with advancement for women than for men. Implications for theory, management, and future research are discussed.

Drawing upon contemporary studies of management practice, the paper explores the relevance of poststructuralism and an attentiveness to subjectivity to articulate a view of managerial work as the subject and object of the contradictory organization and control of capitalist labor processes. This understanding is illustrated by reference to empirical studies of ICI and is supplemented by interview material drawn from a study of changing management practices in the U.K.

Author-Name: Michael C. White

Author-Name: William H. Friedman
Abstract: There has been much debate in the management literature between neo-Darwinists (who believe in the natural selection of populations of organizations) and adaptationists (who contend that changes in organization structure and behavior occur in response to the environment). The general thesis of neo-Darwinism is that species are blindly selected for survival by the environment. The latest empirical support for the dominant neo-Darwinism perspective adopted by most biologists is based primarily on the experiments conducted by Salvador Luria who claims to have conclusively demonstrated that genes mutate randomly. Recently, however, biologists have re-examined Luria's research methods and, after replications of his experiments, now question some aspects of the validity of his results. Moreover, there is now new research which provides support for the earlier adaptationist position, namely, the existence of evolutionary drivers and directors existing within self-organizing systems. Of particular importance to t...

Title: Research Selectivity, Managerialism, and the Academic Labor Process: The Future of Nonmainstream Economics in U.K. Universities
Author-Name: Sandra Harley

Abstract: This paper reports the results of empirical research designed to explore the impact of research selectivity on the work and employment of academic economists in U.K. universities. Research selectivity is seen as part of the general trend toward "managerialism" in higher education in both the U.K. and abroad. Managerialism based on performance indicators and hierarchical control has been contrasted with collegiate control-based or informal peer review. However, analysis of the academic labor process has idealized collegiate relations at the expense of professional hierarchies and intellectual authority relations. We argue that in the U.K., there has evolved a mainstream economics which is located within a well-defined neoclassical core. We find that the existence of lists of core mainstream journals which are believed to count most in the periodic ranking exercise poses a serious threat to academic freedom and diversity within the profession, institutionalizing the control which representatives of the main...

There exists a noticeable contrast between the economic approach which is almost exclusively based on a single model of the rational job seeker, and the diverse approaches adopted by psychologists. Accordingly, the paper concentrates on areas of research by psychologists which are relevant to the economic model. The paper starts with an overview of the research program in economics. Next, the psychological literature on the general well-being of the unemployed is briefly surveyed; this research might be useful in informing economic studies of the effects of the duration of unemployment on an individual's search behavior. Two psychological approaches to job search behavior are then discussed, namely expectancy-value theory and prospect theory. Findings using the expectancy-value approach suggest that certain psychological variables, including normative pressures, might play an important role in job search....

Title: Antecedents of Union Commitment: The Impact of Union Membership Differences in Vertical Dyads and Work Group Relationships
Author-Name: Roderick D. Iverson
Author-Name: Donna M. Buttigieg
Abstract: Relational demography has recently been employed to investigate the influence of workplace diversity on organizational outcomes, such as organizational commitment, turnover, and performance (O'Reilly, Caldwell, & Barnett, 1989; Tsui & O'Reilly, 1989; Tsui, Egan, & O'Reilly, 1992; Tsui, Egan, & Porter, 1994). In the present study, we utilize the techniques and theoretical framework employed in the relational demography literature to examine the impact of heterogeneous union membership status within work groups and vertical dyads, and the effect of these differences on union commitment. A composite dataset was created from two Australian hospitals. Analyses of the data were confined to 460 nursing staff who could be identified within 43 specific work groups (hospital wards). The results indicate that while no relationship was found between differences in membership status among co-workers in work groups on commitment, differences between members and their supervisors served to decrease union loyalty and bel...

Title: Nonwork Influences on Withdrawal Cognitions: An Empirical Examination of an Overlooked Issue
Author-Name: Aaron Cohen
Abstract: The aim of this research is to examine several dimensions of nonwork domains such as nonwork-to-work spillover, work/nonwork conflict, coping strategies, and organizational support for nonwork, and their relationship to withdrawal cognitions. Questionnaires were mailed to all employees of a school district in western Canada. A total of 300 usable questionnaires were returned: a response rate of 42%. The findings show that nonwork domain variables are significantly related to withdrawal cognitions. This was demonstrated mainly in two strong interaction effects between the importance of nonwork and personal coping strategies on the one hand, and between the importance of nonwork and perceived organizational support for nonwork on the other. The two interactions remain significant when two work variables, i.e., organizational commitment and job satisfaction, were entered into the regression as control variables. The paper concludes with proposed directions for future research based on the findings of this pr...

Title: Alternative Models for Antecedents and Outcomes of Work Centrality and Job Satisfaction of High-Tech Personnel
Author-Name: Bilha Mannheim

Author-Name: Joseph Tal
Abstract: Alternative causal models were developed, relating Work Centrality and Job Satisfaction to antecedents and outcomes. The antecedents examined were demographics and need for achievement, and the outcomes included performance, wages, organizational commitment, and career planning. The models were tested using data of Israeli high-tech personnel. Results indicated that organizational commitment, career planning, and wages were significantly affected by work centrality, while performance was positively but nonsignificantly related to it. While all models proved to be acceptable, the best model posited Job Satisfaction as an antecedent rather than an outcome of Work Centrality. It also revealed the importance of demographics for outcomes. Implications are discussed.

Title: The Influence of Recruiter Characteristics and Organizational Recruitment Support on Perceived Recruiter Effectiveness: Views from Applicants and Recruiters
Author-Name: Mary L. Connerley
Author-Name: Sara L. Rynes
Abstract: There is very limited information available about whether organizational recruitment practices influence the impressions made by recruiters on job applicants. In response to the scarcity of two-sided information about recruitment processes, the present study obtained data directly from 1571 applicants and 216 matched recruiters who interviewed them. Results suggest that, similar to previous research, a large proportion of variance in applicants' overall impressions of recruiters could be explained as a function of their impressions about more specific recruiter characteristics and behaviors, particularly perceived concern for the applicant and information given to applicants, and enthusiasm regarding the job vacancy. In addition, recruiters' self-perceptions of overall effectiveness were also highly predictable on the basis of more specific self-perceptions, particularly self-perceived interpersonal effectiveness. However, applicants' perceptions of recruiter effectiveness were not well predicted by recru...

Title: Promotion to Partner in Professional Service Firms
Author-Name: Timothy Morris
Author-Name: Ashly Pinnington
Abstract: A shift away from "up-or-out," the conventional promotion system in professional service firms, has been explained as part of a wider set of changes in internal labor market arrangements and management methods. This is investigated empirically in a sample of large partnerships in one profession. Up-or-out was used by less than one-third of the sample of firms but is common among the largest firms. Internal reforms to the professional firm do not fully explain its rarity; up-or-out appears to be adaptable to new forms of management and internal labor market policies. This raises a number of questions about the utility of theoretical explanations of how professional service firms work or are changing.

Title: Organization-Community Embeddedness: The Social Impact of Enterprise Restructuring in the Post-Communist Czech Republic
Author-Name: Ed Clark
Author-Name: Anna Soulsby
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to examine the impact of the enterprise restructuring process, which has typified the experience of post-communist industry, on local communities. It is argued that restructuring has had differential impacts on communities, and one key factor in making this judgment is the nature of the enterprise-community relationship inherited from the former state socialist regime. Conceptually, this relationship can be understood in terms of the social and institutional embeddedness of the enterprise in its local community. The paper draws upon research into three large former state enterprises in the now Czech Republic in order to examine the effects of different degrees of embeddedness on the impact of restructuring decisions to reduce enterprise overstaffing, and to unburden the enterprise of its social and welfare assets and activities.

Abstract: The study investigates the role structure of managers in China's Henan province. The results produce a two-facet classification consistent with Shapira and Dunbar's findings for North American managers, yet displaying a number of unique features attributed to the Chinese business environment. The leader's role of the Chinese manager splits into task-related and relationship-oriented activities, and the monitor role is plotted across the informational and decision facets. An addition to this study, the political role is also found across the two facets, providing integration across the various managerial activities. An open system model of the Chinese managerial role is proposed.

Abstract: This study examined the influence of family-responsive variables and the moderating influence of gender on the retention-relevant outcomes of organizational commitment and turnover intentions. Data were obtained with the aid of structured questionnaires from employed parents (N = 228) in a human service authority in Hong Kong. Results of regression analysis revealed that satisfaction with work schedule flexibility and supervisor work-family support were related to both retention-relevant outcomes. Contrary to our prediction, gender did not moderate the influence of any of the family-responsive variables on the retention-relevant outcomes. Limitations of the study, directions for future research and implications of the findings for enhancing the effectiveness of family-responsive human resource policies are discussed.

Title: Impacts of Class on Hong Kong Peoplés Well-Being
Author-Name: Chau-kiu Cheung
Abstract: Whereas class theory and research have offered evidence showing the significant effect of class on the individual's well-being, some researchers think that class has no impact on people in modem society because of reduced inequality in education and profession. In such a modern society as Hong Kong, further arguments suggest that people have vague images of class. This controversy may arise because of the failure to operationalize class. To amend this shortcoming, this study operationalized class by using Wright's (1985) definition. With data from 138 marital couples, it tested a causal model predicting the husband's and wifés well-being by class, through the mediation of problem-solving confidence, received social support, work alienation, pleasant and stressful life events, and income. Analysis via structural equation modeling indicated that well-being was significantly associated with a higher class position. That work alienation mediated the relationship between class and received social support, prob...

Title: Male Managers as Fathers? Contrasting Management, Fatherhood, and Masculinity
Author-Name: Bris Aaltio-Marjosola
Author-Name: Jyri Lehtinen
Abstract: In this study, we discuss the relationships between the private and professional life of male managers, with special emphasis on the meaning of fatherhood in this relationship. By presenting and studying the symbolics of an adventure movie, Hook, we aim to show how the personality of a male manager named Peter Banning is changed when he grows closer to his children through recalling his earlier life as Peter Pan, a boy with a rich fantasy life and the ability to fly. The key concepts in our interpretation are drawn from clinical approaches toward management, narcissism in particular. Moreover, we aim to point out that managerial personality issues are closely related to the questions of gender and to the reconstruction of masculinity as a social trend. Until now this aspect has not been considered in management studies applying the clinical approach.

Title: Unraveling the Relationship of Distress Levels Within Couples: Common Stressors, Empathic Reactions, or Crossover via Social Interaction?
Author-Name: Mina Westman
Author-Name: Amiram D. Vinokur
Abstract: Using structural equation modeling analyses we examined the correlation in levels of depression symptoms within couples to determine whether the underlying mechanism is due to common stressors, empathic reactions, or crossover via social interaction. The analyses were based on two waves of data collection from a sample of 354 male Vietnam veterans, Era veterans (veterans who served elsewhere during the period of the Vietnam War), and nonveterans and from their wives or committed partners. The results demonstrated that the correlation in depression symptoms within couples is due primarily to common stressors and crossover via negative social interaction. Common stressful life events increase depression in both spouses, and this in turn increases social undermining, which further increases depression.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence, antecedents, and consequences of work-family conflict among employed women and men in Finland. The data were obtained by questionnaire from a sample of 501 employees working in four organizations. The results showed that work-family conflict was more prevalent than family-work conflict among both sexes, but that there were no gender differences in experiencing either work-family or family-work conflict. Family-work conflict was best explained by family domain variables (e.g., number of children living at home) for both sexes, and work-family conflict by work domain variables (e.g., full-time job, poor leadership relations) among the women, and by high education and high number of children living at home among the men. Family-work conflict had negative consequences on family well-being, and work-family conflict, in particular, on occupational well-being. The findings suggest that in particular improvements in working life are needed to prevent problems i...

Abstract: The present study examined whether political orientation, experience of unemployment or with the unemployed, and/or occupational background predicted three dimensions of attitudes expressed toward the unemployed in conversation. The three dimensions were: nature of attitude, variability in attitude, and form of attitude. Sixty-seven employed individuals participated. Political orientation was found to be a good predictor of the nature of and variability in attitudes toward the unemployed. It was also a good predictor of the form with which attitudes were expressed in general, with political moderates using fewer generalizations than those who were politically polarized, but it was not a good predictor of the form that people used to express particular types of attitude. Occupational group also predicted the nature of and variability in attitudes toward the unemployed, with other factors constant. Personal experience was a good predictor of the form of attitude expressed. Those with more experience with un...

Title: Making Employee Involvement Work: Cooperative Goals and Controversy to Reduce Costs
Author-Name: Dean Tjosvold
Abstract: Organizations are involving employees to help reduce costs to succeed in the intensely competitive marketplace. However, many researchers have been skeptical of the value of participation. This study uses Deutsch's theory of cooperation and competition to examine the critical mediating variable of the interaction as employees discuss how to reduce costs. Results of structural equation analyses on data collected from interviews when employees participated in reducing costs indicate that cooperative goals contributed to constructive discussion among employees that resulted in productive work and stronger relationships, which in turn led employees to be committed to reducing costs. Competitive goals were negatively correlated with dynamics and outcomes. These results suggest that researchers and managers can agree that employee involvement has potential but employees need cooperative goals and skills to discuss issues open-mindedly and constructively to realize these benefits.

Title: The Enduring Legacy of Elton Mayo
Author-Name: J. H. Smith
Abstract: When Human Relations first appeared, Elton Mayo had just retired from Harvard and was at the peak of his fame. All contributors to the journal in its first decade would have acknowledged his already legendary status as a pioneer of applied social science, especially in the workplace. His fall from grace in the late 1950s coincided with growing ideological-cum-methodological critiques of the Hawthorne Experiments. In the event, this sustained interest in Mayo himself, although much of the comment on his contribution remained speculative and ill-informed. Fifty years on, the enigmatic aspects of Mayo's career have largely been unraveled, thanks to the availability of family letters and other archival material. A more balanced assessment is now possible of Mayo's intellectual interests and long-term contribution to the field of human relations.

Title: Work Design Issues in Lean Production from a Sociotechnical Systems Perspective: Neo-Taylorism or the Next Step in Sociotechnical Design?
Author-Name: Willem Niepcel
Author-Name: Eric Molleman
Abstract: The similarities and differences between two paradigms, Lean Production (LP) and Sociotechnical Systems (STS) thinking, which currently compete for the attention of managers and scholars interested in improving the design of work systems, are studied in this article. In order to find the logic behind each approach, the design principles formulated by Cherns have been used to evaluate LP from an STS viewpoint with respect to work design issues. The two concepts differ most with respect to their definition of system boundaries, the control mechanisms they favor and their value bases and assumptions about workers. The way control is exercised in each concept is closely related to the production structure and has far-reaching consequences for the human resource policies practiced. Although each approach has something to offer the other, the question whether the best ideas of both can be synthesized in designing a superior overall system cannot be answered so easily. In the end, it will require more than just ...

Abstract: This paper presents the current Dutch sociotechnical design approach to integral organizational renewal in a contextual way. Both its design theory and intervention processes are reviewed and some aggregated empirical evidence is presented. Next, the paper compares the ideas developed in the Dutch approach to those presented in its American, Scandinavian, and Australian counterparts. It is concluded that, at a meta-level, they all share the ideal of participative democracy, while at the conceptual level, these distinctive approaches appear quite incompatible. Notwithstanding substantial diversity, it is presumed these approaches can be seen as local manifestations of a single sociotechnical paradigm.

Title: Bringing Business into Sociotechnical Theory and Practice
Author-Name: Niclas Adler

Abstract: Current developments in the sociotechnical framework address a number of vital issues that failed to occupy the high ground in its formative years. These include: (i) the purpose of the systems, to create customer value under social and resource constraints, (ii) the context or external business environment, and (iii) the dynamics of the sociotechnical system. Due attention to the dominant issues of purpose, context, and their dynamics make it more meaningful to speak of sociotechnical business systems (STBS) and organizational learning instead of sociotechnical systems (STS) and individual learning. In STBS each unit in an organization has business responsibilities and goal-based couplings with its environment and focuses on the creation of customer value. The implications of this shift from STS to STBS are discussed and illustrated with current research and two summary case studies.

Abstract: This paper deals with the three waves of the discourse on group work in social science and industrial practice that have helped pave the way for the current boom in the introduction of group work in companies. These waves are represented by the human relations approach, the sociotechnical systems approach, and the lean management debate. They are reviewed in two perspectives. The first relates to their concepts of work design and group work, following four questions: (a) What emphasis is put on work factors or on subjective orientations, on the design of working conditions or symbolic strategies? (b) How do the various approaches address the relationship between efficiency and control? (c) Which concepts of participation or democracy are involved? (d) How is the role of the social scientist in the process of industrial modernization conceptualized, explicitly or implicitly? The second perspective from a sociology of science relates to the context of production and utilization of social scientific knowledg...

Author-Name: Darren McCabe

Author-Name: Glenn Morgan
Author-Name: Hugh Willmott
Abstract: This article provides a broad classification and critique of the theoretical and empirical approaches toward quality initiatives. These are the "technical" managerialist, social managerialist, and critical nonmanagerialist approaches. The technical managerialist approach is based upon the flawed assumption that practice follows policy almost like night follows day. By contrast, focusing on intraorganizational politics and the tensions of hierarchy, social managerialists recognize that outcomes are always a negotiated compromise. A majority of these authors are concerned with rendering quality initiatives more effective for management. In contrast, critical nonmanagerialists refuse to take on uncritically the assumptions and attitudes of management, and are concerned with understanding the forms and content of quality initiatives. The article provides a conceptual framework for guiding and advancing research on quality initiatives, and it offers themes and issues which warrant exploring.

Title: Social Defenses Against Organizational Learning
Author-Name: Alastair Bain
Abstract: It is argued that for organizational learning to occur maladaptive social defenses within the organization have to be altered. The origins of the concept of social defenses are traced through the work of Jaques and Menzies. A new concept of "system domain," and related concepts of "system domain fabric," and "system domain defenses," are proposed in order to account for the difficulties in sustaining organizational change in organizations that share a similar primary task. "Organizational learning" is defined as occurring when there is co-evolution of "organizational container" and "contained." The article distills variables from three successful consultancy/action research projects which are characteristic of organizations that are learning, and it is hypothesized that the creation of "organizational awareness" is necessary for organizational learning to occur.

Abstract: Many efforts to use the social sciences for the purpose of change and reconstruction have their roots in the idea of the field experiment. In various forms, the field experiment played a dominant role in the period 1930-1970. In more recent years, new patterns have emerged, such as complementary research roles in network building. In this contribution, focus is on the links between the early experiments and today's approaches, to see the latter in terms of responses to the challenges posed by the processes that were triggered off by the field experiments.

Title: The Power Behind Empowerment: Implications for Research and Practice
Author-Name: Cynthia Hardy
Author-Name: Sharon Leiba-O'Sullivan
Abstract: The 1990s have been called the “empowerment era,” yet growing evidence suggests that empowerment programs often fail to meet the expectations of both managers and employees. To provide a better understanding as to why empowerment programs often fail and to suggest how such failures may be averted, we examine the power behind empowerment. Ironically, although power and empowerment are inextricably linked, much of the work on empowerment in the business literature has been devoid of any discussion of power. We present a four-dimensional model which shows the multifaceted way in which power works. In it, we observe the similarities and differences in the ways that different theorists have approached the study of power, notably those ascribing to mainstream, critical, and Foucauldian perspectives. We then use this power model as a lens with which to examine empowerment practices in business. This analysis suggests a number of possible reasons for the failure of business empowerment programs and provides direc...

Author-Name: Stephen Wood
Author-Name: Lilian de Menezes
Abstract: Are the practices widely associated with the high commitment or involvement model, such as job flexibility and minimal status differences, actually used in conjunction with each other? Or rather are they being used, as some commentators speculate, in a fragmented or ad hoc manner? The authors use Latent Variable Analysis to assess whether practices identified with high commitment management do form a unity. They are simultaneously attempting to see if such practices can be used as indicators for measuring an underlying high commitment orientation on the part of management. The analysis uses data from the 1990 UK Workplace Industrial Relations Survey and its sister survey, the Employers' Manpower and Skills Practices Survey, on the use of a range of high commitment practices across the whole economy. The evidence suggests that there is an identifiable pattern to the use of high commitment practices. Four progressive styles of high commitment management (HCM) were discovered. Though the use of it in its ent...

Title: Congruence in Job-Performance Ratings: A Study of 360° Feedback                 Examining Self, Manager, Peers, and Consultant Ratings
Author-Name: Adrian Furnham
Author-Name: Paul Stringfield
Abstract: Seven task-oriented teams worked together for between 4 and 6 months on a project. At the end of the task, members were each subject to four task-performance ratings: from self, superior, team-peers, and a consultant who was part of the team. There were fewer than chance differences between the different teams on the congruence measures so the data was combined. While the congruence between self and manager, self and peer, and self and consultant ratings were very low, the manager-peer, manager-consultant, and peer-consultant congruence was overall high. Observable behaviors like forward planning and communication showed overall highest congruence while less observable cognitive variables showed much lower congruence. These results are similar to previous studies in the area. Implications of the use of these ratings in management development are considered.

Title: Individualism/Collectivism Orientations and Reactions Toward Alternative Human Resource Management Practices
Author-Name: Nagarajan Ramamoorthy
Author-Name: Stephen J. Carroll
Abstract: In this study, we examined the relationship between individualism-collectivism orientations of potential job seekers and their reactions toward alternative human resource management (HRM) practices in the areas of selection, performance appraisal, reward system, career system, and employment security. Using several subdimensions of individualism-collectivism, we found many significant relationships between individualism-collectivism orientations and preferences for alternative human resource management practices that might affect the effectiveness of alternative HRM practices.

Title: The Ecology of Diversity in Organizational Settings: Lessons from a Case Study
Author-Name: Meg A. Bond
Author-Name: Jean L. Pyle
Abstract: This paper advances a social ecological perspective on the resources necessary to support workplace diversity. It is based on observations from an ongoing organizational case study which used a collaborative inquiry process. We worked with insiders to establish a project steering team, conducted 36 confidential interviews, and met with work units to assess diversity-related concerns. The complex case portrait that emerged illuminates four lessons about the ecology of workplace diversity: (1) the influential role of organizational history and tradition in shaping current diversity dynamics, (2) the importance of understanding how participants' experiences of events may differ, (3) the power of informal organizational processes, and (4) the connections between individual, organizational, and broader cultural values. We discuss these lessons in the context of a three-part definition of support for effective diversity which includes representational, interactional, and cultural components. The goal is to furt...

Title: Toward a Phenomenological Framework for the Study of Work and Organizational Stress
Author-Name: Marc J. Schabracq
Author-Name: Cary L. Cooper
Abstract: In this article, elements from different stress models are embedded in a phenomenological framework for work and organization stress based on practical insights on the one hand and ideas and methods from ethology, microsociology, and cultural anthropology on the other. The framework is compatible with most of the existing research and theoretical views, and pays attention to some lacunas in these views. The central concept is integrity, i.e., the ways in which the process of situated individual functioning is organized in a niche, consisting of a limited set of situations. Integrity refers to the internal integration of individual functioning and the integration of the individual in his or her niche (and thereby in an organization and society at large). Integrity is a multileveled process with considerable individual variation, characterized by signification, morality, and individual experiences, which, with the help of four auxiliary verbs, can be analyzed in terms of individual options for action.

Abstract: Using the construct of job satisfaction, this study examined work attitudes of 286 females and 416 males employed in 27 female-owned and 29 male-owned small businesses in three industries: construction, manufacturing, and distribution. Job satisfaction scores (dependent variables) were analyzed with regard to the interaction of owner-employee gender. Demographic and job-related variables were also considered. The gender-moderated results are discussed in terms of methodological implications for conducting research regarding work attitudes.

Title: A Study of the Determinants and of the Impact of Flexibility on Employee Benefit Satisfaction

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of individual characteristics and organizational justice on employee benefit satisfaction, and to explore the role of flexible benefit plans. Employees from three Canadian organizations were surveyed. A total of 285 usuable questionnaires were returned, for a response rate of 42%. The variables in the model accounted for more than 40% of the variance in benefit satisfaction. The findings showed that while distributive and procedural justice were useful in predicting benefit satisfaction, the concept of process justice had the greatest effect on satisfaction. Among the variables, communication had the greatest impact. The effect of flexibility, although significant, was ambiguous. Sociodemographic factors had a very limited effect when perceptual variables were introduced into the equation. The paper also sets out the limitations of the study and its practical implications, and makes some suggestions for future research.

Title: The Unmaking of Management? Change and Continuity in British Management in the 1990s
Author-Name: Harry Scarbrough
Abstract: In the late 1980s, a series of reports-notably, "The Making of Managers" by Charles Handy-outlined a development path for management in the U.K. This was to be based on the development of an education and training base and the model set by leading corporations. A decade later, this paper reviews current trends in managerial work and employment against the expectations of the late 1980s. In doing so, it distinguishes between the objective condition of British management and its institutionalized meaning within wider British society. It argues that recent accounts of changes in managerial work and employment have focused solely on incremental changes in the empirical domain and have neglected important discursive shifts in the way management is understood and enacted within organizations. These shifts have been catalyzed by the emergence of a series of organizational initiatives-first, Total Quality Management (TQM) and, latterly, lean production and Business Process Reengineering (BPR)-which aim to systema...

Title: The Rhetoric of Organizational Change
Author-Name: Nils Finstad
Abstract: This study is a discussion of change strategies: the contextual aspects of change and the rhetoric of change. Change is analyzed along two dimensions: (1) the context of the change initiative in the organization, (2) the relations of the change project to the institutional environment. Four cases are used as examples of inducing change in municipal services. The four cases are part of a national reform project. In Norway, municipalities are important institutions both as arenas for political decisions but also as decentralized instruments for distributing local services. The main purpose of the reform project was to achieve better adjusted services through more interdisciplinary work and local responsibility. Change efforts may be forced on the organization, e.g., by laws, instructions, and frame budgets or they may be triggered by different voluntary mechanisms. The idea of "isomorphism" describes a passive or incremental adaptation to "signals" and from structure imposed by the environment. The idea of ...

Title: Go and Say, "Wére Shutting": Ju Jutsu as a Metaphor for Analyzing Resistance
Author-Name: Helga Drummond
Abstract: While it is well known that employees in organizations may successfully resist managerial impositions, relatively little is understood about how resistance operates. The present study utilizes a martial arts metaphor known as ju jutsu to generate insights for understanding how resistance is exercised. The ju jutsu metaphor was chosen because it is a defensive technique whereby a physically weaker person may resist a much stronger one. Ju jutsu as metaphor suggests resistance can be exercised by systematically employing bodily movements which disturb an opponent's balance and/or strike at physiological weak points. By exploring a case study of a successful example of organizational resistance, the ju jutsu metaphor is utilized to generate new perspectives for conceptualizing and analyzing the dynamics of resistance.

Title: When "Life Is but a Dream": Obliterating Politics Through Business Process Reengineering?
Author-Name: David Knights
Author-Name: Darren McCabe
Abstract: In this article, we explore the genesis and operation of Business Process Reengineering (BPR) within a medium-sized U.K. bank from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. We dismiss the claims of those evangelical gurus who assume that BPR can be decontextualized and decoupled from organizational politics and posit that BPR can be managed instantaneously and unproblematically. Instead we argue that BPR is likely to be constituted by and through political relations, and that BPR in turn will reconstitute organizational forms and norms, in a highly political fashion. We endeavor to build upon current approaches toward organizational politics. We illustrate that politics is not simply about resistance to some putative organizational norm of stability or uniformity as BPR's gurus imply. Nor does it derive "exclusively" from diverse interest groups pursuing separate or conflicting ends that can be juggled and managed as processual or pluralistic accounts of organizational change tend to assume. Neither, in this insta...

Title: Organizational Capital and Joining-up: Linking the Individual to the Organization and to Society
Author-Name: John E Tomer
Abstract: Do employees ever make efforts on behalf of their employing organization's interests or fellow employees' interests when it is not in their direct self-interest to do so? By drawing on organizational behavior literature relating to the joining-up process, organizational commitment, and organizational citizenship behavior, and integrating these insights with economic theory, this article provides a new explanation of why employees' efforts are typically suboptimal and what organizational activities can resolve this problem. The key variable explaining whether organization members behave responsibly or not is the presence of organizational capital formed either during the joining-up process or in preparation for it.

Abstract: This paper reviews aspects of two largely disparate literatures from the adjacent fields of individual and organizational learning and identifies some implications for theory and practice. The focus of attention is the extent to which the individual level construct cognitive style can be meaningfully applied to aid the understanding of learning at the level of the organization as well as at the level of the individual. Attention is given to the ways in which consideration of cognitive style can improve the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve individual and organizational performance. Nine categories of intervention are identified.

Abstract: Research on how the context of work affects HRM practices in general, and socialization practices in particular, is relatively scarce. The present study assesses a model linking context, socialization, and newcomer adjustment. Self-report data from business school graduates after 4 months (N = 295) and 10 months (N = 223) on the job revealed that mechanistic (vs. organic) structure, organization size, and jobs of high motivating potential were each positively associated with organizations' use of what Jones (1986) refers to as institutionalized socialization, and this form of socialization was positively associated with newcomer adjustment. Contrary to expectations, neither a newcomer's bureaucratic orientation nor growth need strength moderated the relationship between socialization and adjustment.

Title: Putting the "Team" into Teamwork: Alternative Theoretical Contributions for Contemporary Management Practice
Author-Name: Svan Lembke
Author-Name: Marie G. Wilson
Abstract: This paper establishes that teamwork is a function of how team members perceive the team and their role in it. Social identity theory (Hogg & Abrams, 1993; Tajfel & Turner, 1986) and self-categorization theory (Turner, 1987) offer explanations for the cognitive, evaluative, and emotional processes which motivate individuals to join a social group and enhance their ability to contribute to the maximum of their ability, which would be desirable for many team tasks. Social identity theory posits that the motivation for thinking, feeling, and thus working as a cohesive unit is socially constructed. Highly productive teamwork requires that team members recognize the team as a unit and as an attractive work arrangement. Fundamental assumptions of contemporary management, and management research, are challenged to integrate social identity findings.

Author-Name: Onne Janssen

Author-Name: Anton J. Cozijnsen
Abstract: This article reports two studies exploring how cognitive style preferences for adaption-innovation affect the likelihood that employees will voice ideas for organizational change toward their supervisors. As hypothesized, Study 1 demonstrates that innovatively compared to adaptively predisposed police officers are less likely to voice conventional ideas and more likely to voice novel ideas for solving work-related problems. Besides a replication of these findings, Study 2 shows how work satisfaction and the quality of the supervisor as voice manager shape the impact of adaption-innovation on employee likelihood to voice. That is, compared to innovators, adaptors are more likely to voice conventional ideas when they are dissatisfied rather than satisfied with work and perceive their supervisors as effective rather than ineffective voice managers. On the other hand, innovators compared to adaptors report greater likelihood to voice novel ideas when they are satisfied rather than dissatisfied with work and p...

Title: Gender Relations and Identity at Work: A Case Study of Masculinities and Femininities in an Advertising Agency
Author-Name: Mats Alvesson
Abstract: The paper explores gender relations and gender identity, based upon an ethnography of a Swedish advertising agency. The organization is of special interest as it has a strong gender division of labor, where men hold all senior posts, at the same time as creative advertising work seems to have much more similarity with what gender studies describe as "femininity" rather than with forms of "masculinity." The paper discusses how gender is constructed in an organizational context. Emphasis on workplace sexuality is related to identity work of men in response to the highly ambiguous and contested context of advertising work. Tendencies toward the "femininization" of the work and client relationships put some strain on (gender) identity for men, triggering a structuring of gender relations and interaction at the workplace to restore feelings of masculinity. The paper problematizes ideas of masculinities and femininities and argues for a rethinking of their roles in nonbureaucratic organizations. Also assumption...

Abstract: Prior studies of women in management have been conducted primarily from a Western, industrialized, and Anglo-American perspective. Therefore, their findings may not apply to other sociopolitical domains, such as those in transition to market-based economies. This study surveyed Hungarian managers at two different organizational ranks and employed in three different sectors of the economy. Contrary to the "gender-centered" hypothesis, managers' gender did not influence their work-related beliefs, values, or attitudes. However, as suggested by the "situational" hypothesis, the variables of rank and sector had a strong effect on outcomes.

Title: Human Resource Management and the Appropriation-Learning Perspective
Author-Name: Ken Kamoche
Author-Name: Frank Mueller
Abstract: This paper posits the concept of "appropriation" to explain the underlying ethos and rationale for seeking to secure the contribution of people to organizational functioning. Human resource management (HRM) practice is therefore largely underpinned by the objective of appropriating the human resource "value." This is ignored by the practitioner-oriented literature which has a financial interest in helping organizations to secure this value, and by the academic literature which is unwilling to confront the contradictions and uncomfortable truths inherent in such activities. The traditional approach to appropriation is characterized by such concerns as skill-formation, commitment to the organization, shared corporate values, and a reliance on formally constituted governance structures with a putative integrative ethos. This paper advocates a reconstitution of the appropriation regime to incorporate the concepts of knowledge and learning. We draw from the innovation management literature to highlight the pro...

Author-Name: Martin M. Greller
Abstract: A survey of 137 employees provided data on performance appraisal reviews conducted by 38 managers. Participation in the review was influenced more by which manager conducted the review than the circumstances of the specific review. The effect of participation was greater for variables measuring future relationship (potential in the firm and seeking feedback from manager) than immediate decisions (self-evaluation and intention to stay). Reaction to the review was moderated by subordinate experience and prior feedback. The results indicate the importance of understanding the context in which the review occurs and the limited degree to which managers alter their own behavior in the review.

Abstract: A two-phase study employed a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodology to study absenteeism in a complex, hospital setting. The primary focus was to identify the bases of employees' beliefs about what is acceptable and expected in terms of absence behavior. Through a series of employee interviews, two different absence cultures were identified. We found evidence that employees' normative perceptions were influenced by their prior personal absence, and by the average level of absence within both their immediate work group and the absence culture to which they belonged. Perceived norms were also shown to predict future individual absence (total days absent) 1 year later. Theoretical and practical implications of this research were discussed.

Title: Examining Resources in an Occupational Community: Reputation in Canadian Forensic Accounting
Author-Name: Thomas B. Lawrence
Abstract: Occupational communities represent bounded cultures populated by people with similar work identities that transcend organizational settings. In this paper, I examine the relationship between an occupational community's culture and its ability to control strategic resources that advantage its members. Drawing on an empirical examination of the Canadian forensic accounting, I argue that reputation acts as a strategic resource, not only for individual members, but for the community as a whole. The community's practice standards and membership rules work to heighten the importance of individual practitioners' reputations, which in turn benefits client communities by conferring legitimacy on their claims, and restricts entry into forensic accounting. The role of reputation in Canadian forensic accounting serves to illuminate the importance of resources that, rather than being held in some proprietary fashion, are shared among actors who are, ostensibly, in competition with one another.

Abstract: Over the last decade, the search for innovation has become a core component of much social policy formulation and implementation. This search, however, has often been undertaken with little attempt to define the actual nature of innovation or to classify its different modes. This paper reports recent research which has developed a typology of organizational change within which to situate and analyze innovation in social policy. It argues that this typology is an essential tool both for social policymakers and for those concerned with its analysis.

Title: Social Support and Career Optimism: Examining the Effectiveness of Network Groups Among Black Managers
Author-Name: Ray Friedman

Abstract: As companies look for better ways to manage diversity, one of the approaches that is emerging is the use of female and minority network groups. These groups are not well understood, and there has been no quantitative analysis of their impact on minority employees. Social network theory suggests that network groups should enhance the social resources available to women and minorities and in that way enhance their chance of career success, but some critics of network groups suggest that backlash might produce greater social isolation and discrimination. In this paper, we analyze a survey of members of the National Black MBA Association to find out whether network groups have a positive impact on career optimism, what specific effects of these groups are most beneficial, and whether groups enhance isolation or discrimination. Results indicate that network groups have a positive overall impact on career optimism of Black managers, and that this occurs primarily via enhanced mentoring. Network groups have no e...

Title: Agency and Organization: Toward a Cyborg-Consciousness
Author-Name: Martin Wood
Abstract: The presumption that agency is primarily the function or personification of a naturalized human actant can be traced through a Western intellectual tradition which draws upon a dualistic conception of the self as a unified, productive, sovereign subject, and an independent, external, physical other. In this paper, I problematize the prevalence of such Cartesian differentiation. I review an alternative, postfoundational actant ontology, then trace the resemblances in the work on situated knowledges. These orientations challenge the hierarchical division between the internal self and the external other and instead emphasize the relational, material, and performative nature of human being. Drawing on the notion of proximal thinking, I suggest that formal organizations can productively be described as relational spaces, containing multiple and complex frontiers, frames and interfaces, with(in) which ostensibly differentiated and individualistic attitudes toward agency give way to the variety and possibility o...

Title: The Mechanistic Structure Shift and Strategic Reorientation in Declining Firms Attempting Turnarounds
Author-Name: Vincent L. Barker, III
Author-Name: Mark A. Mone
Abstract: Past researchers have observed that declining organizations often experience mechanistic structural changes that centralize authority, increase reliance on formalized procedures, and reduce the amount of information flowing to top managers. Many have proposed that this "mechanistic shift" in declining organizations reduces their adaptive capability by making innovative organizational change in response to decline less likely. However, despite much research on declining firms and their turnaround attempts, many questions about mechanistic shifts remain, such as: (1) To what extent do declining firms become systematically mechanistic when trying to recover from decline? (2) What aspects of declining firms' situations make mechanistic shifts more likely? (3) Do mechanistic shifts reduce the likelihood of large-scale strategic reorientation as declining firms attempt to recover? We sought answers to these questions through an analysis of data from in-depth interviews with top managers (mostly CEOs) at 29 U.S....

Title: Accountability, Impression Management, and Goal Setting in the Performance Evaluation Process
Author-Name: Dwight D. Frink
Author-Name: Gerald R. Ferris
Abstract: Theoretical perspectives from accountability, impression management, goal setting, and performance evaluation suggest that accountability conditions may influence whether goals are used for impression management or performance-directed purposes. Goal theory and research suggest that goals typically are performance-directed, resulting in elevated performance under certain conditions. Alternatively, impression management theory might imply that goals may not always be performance-directed, and the goal-performance relationship may be decoupled in such cases. Accountability is proposed as influencing this relationship in addition to main effects on how people approach tasks. Two studies tested notions of how accountability influences task approaches and goal uses: a laboratory experiment with university students, and a field study of telemarketers. Convergence of results indicates that participants approached tasks and set goals differently according to accountability conditions. Furthermore, the goal-perfor...

Title: Structural Properties, Work Practices, and Control in Asian Businesses: Some Evidence from Singapore and Malaysia
Author-Name: Cecil Pearson
Author-Name: Lanny Entrekin
Abstract: This study explored the level of adoption of Western style management practices in two South East Asian communities. A sample of 203 managers from Malaysian and Singaporean organizations responded to a survey that was designed to capture demographic as well as organizational data in terms of structural dimensions, and employed work setting processes and practices. A strong inference of the findings is that Western assumptions about managerial ideology were not fully endorsed in the study organizations. These findings, which are discussed, were interpreted in conjunction with contributions from Asian managers. The approach outlined in this paper demonstrates the value of qualitative and quantitative procedures for interpreting the results of cross-cultural studies.

Title: The Effects of Diversity on Small Work Group Processes and Performance
Author-Name: James B. Shaw
Author-Name: Elain Barrett-Power
Abstract: Diversity is an increasingly important factor in organizational life as organizations worldwide become more diverse in terms of the gender, race, ethnicity, age, national origin, and other personal characteristics of their members. The exact impact of within-group diversity on small group processes and performance is unclear. Sometimes the effect of diversity seems positive, at other times negative, and in other situations, there seems to be no effect at all. In this article, we suggest that these types of findings might be explained by using a "group-development" model to examine the impact of diversity on group processes and performance. Our model uses concepts from Jackson et al.'s (1995), Milliken and Martins' (1996), and other models, as well as our own concepts, to show how diversity affects group development and performance. Among the concepts included in the model are readily detectable personal attributes, underlying personal attributes, cognitive paradigm dissimilarity, cognitive costs and rewar...

Title: An Introduction to the Social Psychology of Insults in Organizations
Author-Name: Yiannis Gabriel
Abstract: The author argues that insults are an important social and organizational phenomenon, which causes powerful emotions and enters peoplés personal histories. It is suggested that insults involve a perpetrator, a target and, often, an audience. The intention to insult is not necessary, as some insults are the result of misunderstanding or accident. However, the experience of being gratuitously offended and the corresponding feelings of shame, guilt, and anger are fundamental to insults. Several types of insults are observed, such as exclusion, stereotyping, obliteration of significant identity details, ingratitude, scapegoating, rudeness, broken promises, being ignored or kept waiting. Even more potent insults result from the defamation or despoiling of idealized objects, persons, or ideas. Different insult dynamics are noted; these include an apology, a commensurate retaliation, a disproportionate retaliation and possible escalation, a retaliation against a surrogate and weaker target than the perpetrator o...

Title: The Study of Language in Organizations: A Symbolic Interactionist Stance
Author-Name: Pierre Cossette
Abstract: Very few models have been developed from research on language in organizations, and those that exist are usually very general. In addition, the assumptions on which they are based are not always explicit, which means that the limits of the models themselves cannot be seen. After describing the characteristics of research that could be done on language from an objectivist and a subjectivist stance, and specifying the limits of these two fundamental views, this paper proposes an explicit model for understanding language based on a symbolic interactionist stance, with emphasis on ascribing meaning and understanding language in the context of the interactive situation in which it occurs. The interactive situation comprises three fundamental components: the environmental, cognitive, and emotional contexts. In the model, the tongue and psycholinguistic schemata of the individuals concerned inevitably have a restrictive effect on the language used, and the language context may help make the speaker's remarks mea...

Title: Organizational Symbolism as a Social Construction: A Perspective from the Sociology of Knowledge
Author-Name: Antonio Strati
Abstract: This article describes organizational symbolism from a sociology of knowledge perspective and considers both the theoretical and extra-theoretical bases of the symbolic approach. It illustrates the distinctive principles of the symbolic approach with respect to other methods used in the study of organizations, the concepts on which it is based, and the organizational issues on which it has shed significant light. Symbolist studies of organizations have refocused scholarly attention on the multidisciplinary understanding of the logos, ethos, and pathos of organizational life. They have done so by stressing the production of knowledge tout court, rather than concerning themselves with the applicability of the organizational knowledge acquired by this approach for managerial purposes. Organizational symbolism is described in the article as a fluctuating and emerging social construction whose growth and spread has been fostered by support within academia.

Title: Emotional Aspects of Large Group Teaching
Author-Name: David Hogan
Author-Name: Richard Kwiatkowski
Abstract: With the growth of mass education in the U.K. has come the seemingly inevitable growth of large group teaching. Many "technical" solutions to the problems of large group teaching have been proposed (e.g., use of microphones, structured handouts, buzz groups, etc.) but we contend that emotional aspects have been largely neglected and ignored. We argue that it is legitimate to consider the role of emotion in higher education, and its particular effects in large teaching groups. While it is, perhaps, easier and safer to pretend that all is well, there are clear emotional consequences to working in these large groups for both students and lecturers. For instance, students may experience powerful feelings of alienation, anger, and envy in large groups and compensate in various ways, some of which will be antithetical to achieving effective learning and a stimulating educational experience. Similarly, lecturers can also seek to cope with their own feelings of fear and uncertainty by behaving equally maladaptive...

Title: Influence at Work: A 25-Year Program of Research
Author-Name: Frank Heller
Abstract: Organization of any kind, from prehistoric hunting societies to companies working through the worldwide web, operate with a distribution of influence and power among their members. This distribution of influence has consequences at three levels: for the people working in the organization, for the organization itself, and, from time to time, for members of society outside the organization. A series of action-and policy-oriented projects on the distribution of influence were developed by or in collaboration with the Centre for Decision Making Studies of The Tavistock Institute over a quarter of a century. They started with a seven-country comparative research on top management decision making, followed by two 12-country studies on Industrial Democracy and a 5-year longitudinal program in seven companies in three countries. These and two longitudinal projects in Britian, one on a motor car manufacturer and the other on an airport, used a similar conceptual framework. The article draws on the evidence from th...

Title: Engaging New Social Movements
Author-Name: Dione Hills
Abstract: Organizations involved in the development of innovative social programs are coming under increasing pressure to establish structures through which the users, targets, or beneficiaries of program activities can be involved in program planning and implementation. The dynamic that this sets up between the program and its wider environment, particularly in areas in which "new social movements" are operating, can be quite challenging. This article seeks to examine these dynamics, particularly in the context of program evaluation. It is argued that an engaged evaluation approach (drawing on an action research orientation) has particular strengths in such a situation, although the limitations and challenges of such an approach are also outlined. It may, for example, require careful management in terms of the dynamics of the evaluation team. The discussion is illustrated by examples drawn from the evaluation of a European program for disabled people in which the author as member of a research team from The Tavist...

Title: From Altruism to Action: Primary Task and the Not-for-Profit Organization
Author-Name: Tim Dartington
Abstract: This paper examines the concept of primary task, as it has been used in action research and consultancy at The Tavistock Institute and elsewhere. It applies the concept to the not-for-profit organization and argues that primary task should not be thought of opportunistically; it relates to the "mission" of the organization. The three sector model of public, private and voluntary organizations is linked to basic assumptions, as described by Bion and applied to societal institutions. The voluntary sector is considered to have a valency for basic assumption pairing organizational behavior. A case study of a voluntary organization demonstrates the way different stakeholders claim psychological ownership of the enterprise. The paper concludes that the concept of primary task remains important, offering a stable reference point for working with organizations, where the boundary between sectors is increasingly problematic, threatening to overwhelm their original purpose.

Title: A Note on the Protomental System and "Groupishness": Bion's Basic Assumptions Revisited
Author-Name: Eric Miller
Abstract: In identifying the unconscious "basic assumption" behavior of groups, Bion made a significant discovery. Although he toyed with explaining this behavior as instinctive, he ultimately postulated that it was a postnatal defense. However, there is a strong case for the biogenetic explanation. This sharpens our understanding of some group and organizational processes that have been hitherto described in terms of psychoanalytic concepts. It may also have implications for management of, and interventions in, groups and larger systems.

Abstract: How far is it possible to capture the lessons to be drawn from successive projects that involve intervention by social scientists within or between organizations, whether acting as researchers, as consultants, as agents of change, or in some combination of these roles? This paper outlines the way in which a framework was developed, by staff and associates of The Tavistock Institute, for examining the varied and often subtle influences of successive "negotiated project engagements" on the development of wider personal, institutional, and disciplinary programs. This framework is designed to take into account the contrasting perspectives of the investigators themselves, of their organizational hosts, and of any external sponsors whose primary concern will normally be with project outcomes at a more generalized level. As an illustration, particular reference is made to the experience of a pioneering project concerned with policy-making in city government. This project was undertaken to advance the understandi...

Title: The Needle and the Damage Done: Research, Action Research, and the Organizational and Social Construction of Health in the "Information Society"
Author-Name: Joe Cullen
Abstract: This paper critically reviews the action research paradigm that has evolved over the last 50 years within and outside The Tavistock Insitute, with reference to radical shifts in the social construction of medicine and health that are occurring as a result of the transition toward the "information society." The medical domain has been chosen as an appropriate space within which to review the action research paradigm because it bridges both the past and future of the Institute. The paper firstly considers the original conception of action research and sociotechnical systems, and the role of consultants, in relation to Foucualt's analysis of power relations, social control, and "dividing practices." It then describes and analyzes recent developments in the field of medicine and healthcare service provision that, on the one hand, offer opportunities for increased self-management and control by consumers over physical, social, and emotional "self-hood" and on the other could lead to further social surveillance...

Title: The Primary Risk
Author-Name: Larry Hirschhorn
Abstract: In the Tavistock tradition, we understand an organization by first identifying its primary task. We ask, what is this organization set up to do, how is it organized to accomplish this objective, and what unconscious dynamics limit or distort its members' ability to do their work? This approach while powerful, does not help us understand organizations that live at strategic junctures in their life cycles. In these situations, the task is to choose a task. We need a conceptual framework to help us understand the psychodynamics of organizing and deciding in these situations. The following article develops the concept of the "primary risk' to explain how organizations behave in these situations. It links the primary risk to the psychoanalytic idea of ambivalence and the gestalt idea of the figure/ground relationship. It draws on case material to illuminate its concepts.

Author-Name: Aimin Yan
Author-Name: Meryl Reis Louis
Abstract: In this paper, we propose that the locus of organizational boundary activities has migrated from the organization to the work unit level as enterprises reengineer structures, increase the use of cross-functional teams, cut organizational slack and adopt advanced information technologies. From an open systems perspective, we examine how environmental and organizational forces affect this migration process. Three types of boundary activity relevant for work units are identified: buffering, spanning, and bringing up boundaries. A set of preliminary propositions regarding relationships between environmental and organizational changes and boundary activities is offered as a guide for future research.

Abstract: The relationships among mastery and frequency of managerial behaviors, and subunit effectiveness have frequently been confused. This study investigates both main and interactive effects. The results show that the interaction effect can often be the strongest effect and that increasing frequency without improving mastery can sometimes be detrimental. Furthermore, these results offer a possible explanation as to why research of managerial behavior has been so inconclusive. In addition, the results question popular advice given often to managers. Finally, some recommendations are made as to how management development could be made more effective based on the results of this study.

Abstract: In this contribution, we focus on the results of the Belgian Trend Study. The intention of this study was to examine the prevalence of new production concepts within the widest possible range of companies in the automotive, the machine tool, the chemical, and the clothing industries. The Trend Study aimed to answer the following questions: is the Taylorist division of labor a thing of the past? What are the alternatives? Are shifts in the division of labor accompanied by another type of personnel policy, and do traditional industrial relations have to make way for this new approach? The methodological concept used had to guarantee that the findings at the level of each industry could be generalized. Though the picture emerging from the empirical data collected in the four industrial sectors is inevitably diverse, the data make it possible merely to suggest a neorather than a post-Thylorist or -Fordist concept.

Abstract: This article describes a test of Karasek's Job Demand-Control (JD-C) Model using both group and individual level assessments of job characteristics. By group assessments, we mean aggregated individual data. A random sample from general hospitals and nursing homes included 16 institutions, 64 units, and 1489 health care workers (82% response). Because of the hierarchically nested data structure (i.e., institutions, units, and individuals) the research questions and hypothesis were tested in multilevel regression analyses (VARCL). The results revealed both group level and individual level effects with regard to psychological outcomes, and stressed the usefulness of multilevel techniques. Karasek's JID-C Model was partly confirmed by finding two interaction effects at group level and at individual level with regard to job satisfaction and work motivation, respectively. The discussion focuses on theoretical, methodological, and practical implications of multilevel modeling with respect to the JD-C Model.

Author-Name: Maris G. Martinsons
Author-Name: Patrick K. C. Chong
Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in information technology (IT), many computer-based information systems (IS) still fall short of performance expectations. A growing share of these implementation failures are due to nontechnical factors. This article considers the human factors and human resource (HR) management issues associated with IT assimilation. A taxonomy of specialist roles in the IS adoption process is proposed and illustrated in a series of brief case studies. The results from a field investigation are then reported. The relationships between different HR specialist roles and selected IS success measures were examined in more than 60 organizations across East and Southeast Asia. Proactive and supportive HR roles were found to be associated with greater user satisfaction, smoother organizational change and improved productivity, but did not significantly affect perceived output quality. The implications for management practice are discussed and specific areas for further research are identified.

Title: "Come, Join Our Family": Discipline and Integration in Corporate                 Organizational Culture
Author-Name: Catherine Casey
Abstract: This article critically examines primary processes and effects of the so-called "new organizational culture" that is organized on the principles and practices of Total Quality Management (and its variations) and increasingly practiced in corporate organizations in the 1990s. The paper specifically analyzes the effects of the organizational cultural practices of "family" and "team" on the employee and discusses their role in corporate discipline, integration, and control. Data are drawn from field research conducted in a large multinational corporation and the analyses and interpretive propositions are informed by a critical social psychoanalytic perspective. The paper disputes the conventional view that the practices of the "new culture" and its purported reform of the hierarchical, specialized, conflict-ridden workplaces of traditional industrial organizations "empower" employees and provide "meaningful" relationships in the workplace. It is argued, on the contrary, that these new "designer" cultural pra...

Title: Beyond Happy Families: A Critical Reevaluation of the                 Control-Resistance-Identity Triangle
Author-Name: Yiannis Gabriel
Abstract: In this article, the author explores the nature of contemporary organizational controls, the extent to which they can be said to colonize employee subjectivity, and the types of resistance which they generate. Labor process, psychoanalytic, critical theory, and Foucauldian perspectives are juxtaposed and a number of similarities and divergences are noted. It is argued that many of these perspectives prematurely lament the end of employee recalcitrance and exaggerate the magnitude and totality of organizational controls, generating over-managed and overcontrolled images of individuals, organizations, and societies. It is proposed that a rapprochement of psychoanalytic and labor theory approaches can lead to an appreciation of unmanaged and unmanageable terrains in organizations, in which human agency may be rediscovered, neither as a class-conscious proletariat nor as a transcendental subject, but as a struggling, feeling, thinking, suffering subject, one capable of obeying and disobeying, controlling and ...

Abstract: The arguments in this paper are based upon an ethnographic description of the circumstances surrounding the investigation of a complaint against the Governors of a small rural Primary School. This is an empirical study of a local struggle in which the role of the researcher as a prisoner in a web of power is highlighted. The case is first analyzed using structural and functional understandings of power as described by Hardy and Clegg. However, the voluntary nature of the individual engagement of the actors in the case highlights the role of the individual's interpretative frameworks-both in operation and as explanatory mechanisms. Structural and functional analyses of power do not appear to fully account for aspects of this situation, and therefore Hopfl's distinction between the poetic and the rhetoric is considered as part of the explanatory mechanism. This paper suggests that "power" can be seen as an individually interpreted quality, and that feelings of "empowerment" are evoked by consonance between ...

Title: A Case Against Making the Control of Clients a Negotiable Contingency for                 Interdisciplinary Teams
Author-Name: Eli Teram
Abstract: Most discussions of interdisciplinary teams assume that cross-functional teams are desirable. Critical analyses of the fundamental contradictions inherent in bringing together professionals with diverse ideologies, interests, contingencies, and technologies are rare. Even less common are discussions of the negative consequences of these contradictions for clients. Based on observations in an institution for youth-in-trouble, this paper argues that the control of clients is one key process underlying conflicts and dilemmas in interdisciplinary teams; it builds a case against making the control of clients a negotiable contingency for teams. Given the universal nature of control mechanisms, those most directly responsible for control have a superior bargaining position because, in order to be effective, their control routines must be consistent Although these workers may yield to other treatment ideologies regarding particular clients, the overall outcome is the enhancement of their interests. Moreover, the ...

Title: Conflict and Conflict Resolution in a Cooperative: The Case of the Nir Taxi Station
Author-Name: Asaf Darr
Abstract: What conflict resolution mechanisms do democratic worker cooperatives generate and to what extent could these mechanisms be called democratic? This case study tries to address these questions by examining both conflict and conflict resolution in a democratic organization, a 66-year-old taxi cooperative. The conflicts presented stem from three main sources: ethnic origin, local division of labor, and "class" affiliation. These conflicts are resolved through different processes, ranging from a joke-telling ritual to a formal tribunal composed of elected judges. Discussion centers on unique aspects of conflict resolution in a democratic worker cooperative and their implications for studies of conflict resolution in nondemocratic firms.

Title: Cultural and Status Differences in Intergroup Conflict Resolution: A Longitudinal Study of a Middle East Dialogue Group in the United States
Author-Name: Amy S. Hubbard
Abstract: Supporters of the contact hypothesis have argued that positive intergroup contact is facilitated when participants have equal status with one another. However, the exact dimensions of equal status are often unclear, having been defined variously as equal occupational status, having close friends of another race, or having equal roles in the contact situation. This paper argues that cultural differences between groups must be taken into account, particularly when intergroup contact occurs in formal conflict resolution exercises. Non-Western participants will be at a disadvantage when attempting to find common ground with Western participants in conflict resolution exercises based on Western cultural practices. Based on a 6-year participant observation study of a Palestinian-Jewish dialogue group, this paper argues that familiarity and expertise in using the culture-based rules of interaction play an important but often subtle role in intergroup conflict resolution. Participants must have some basic equalit...

Title: Individualism and Collectivism in Israeli Society: Comparing Religious and Secular High-School Students
Author-Name: Shifra Sagy

Author-Name: Dan Bar-On
Abstract: Triandis' theoretical framework, concerning cultural patterns labeled individualism and collectivism, is probed with regard to the religious marker in the Israeli Jewish society. Three methods are used to examine collectivism-individualism constructs in 185 religious and 956 secular high school students: value items, interest in different domains of history, and attitudes toward political issues. A common collective basis of mutual value consensus was found in the two groups; however, as predicted, there were differences between secular and religious students on the three kinds of items, since the religious scored higher than the secular students on items emphasizing collectivist orientation. The differences, however, do not fit the common theoretical framework of collectivism-individualism, but rather tend to reflect the distinction between in-group and universal collectivism.

Title: Power and Politics in Grievance Resolution: Managing Meaning of Due Process in an Organization
Author-Name: Rahul Varman
Author-Name: Deepti Bhatnagar
Abstract: This paper studies the relatively less explored issue of the actual process of grievance resolution from a political perspective. In a steel plant in India, six grievance cases were analyzed from the filing of a grievance to its final resolution. Cases were reconstructed through semistructured interviews and analyzed from a political perspective. The sources of power of the key actors and their influence tactics vis-A-vis one another were found to determine whether the case would be decided in favor of or against the grievant. The understanding of the dynamics in grievance resolution was enhanced when we analyzed cases as episodes nested in the ongoing political process of the organization. A comprehensive understanding of political behavior required analysis at two levels: the explicit-dealing with apparent behavior; and the implicit-exploring the underlying concerns and intents of the actors often manifested through symbols. Implications of multiple levels of political behavior for institutionalizing du...

Abstract: This study examined the Perceptions of Politics Model (Ferris, Russ, & Fandt, 1989) in a three-phase process. In the first phase, the model was examined using Anderson and Gerbing's (1988) two-step approach to structural equations modeling. The model was tested on data collected from 786 employees of a state government agency and 469 employees of an electric utility cooperative. Results from this phase indicated that the model had acceptable fit and was more parsimonious than any of the competing models to which it was compared. In the second phase, understanding as a moderator of the relationships between perceptions of organizational politics and several outcome variables was examined. Results indicated that understanding only moderated the outcome relationship between politics and job satisfaction, not intent to turnover or job anxiety. Finally, in phase three, the additional outcome variables of organizational satisfaction, supervisor effectiveness, and self-reported individual performance were includ...

Title: Response Rate in Academic Studies-A Comparative Analysis
Author-Name: Yehuda Baruch
Abstract: A study was conducted to explore what could and should be a reasonable response rate in academic studies. One hundred and forty-one papers which included 175 different studies were examined. They were published in the Academy of Management Journal, Human Relations, Journal of Applied Psychology, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, and Journal of International Business Studies in the years 1975, 1985, and 1995, covering about 200,000 respondents. The average response rate was 55.6 with a standard deviation of 19.7. Variations among the journals such as the year of publication and other variables were discussed. Most notable is the decline through the years (average 48.4, standard deviation of 20.1, in 1995), the lower level found in studies involving top management or organizational representatives (average 36.1, standard deviation of 13.3), and the predominance of North American studies. It is suggested that the average and standard deviation found in this study should be used as a norm ...

Title: Why Study the Complexity Sciences in the Social Sciences?
Author-Name: K. Michael Mathews
Author-Name: Michael C. White
Author-Name: Rebecca G. Long
Abstract: Over the past two decades, several new perspectives have emerged in the physical and natural sciences and are collectively referred to as the complexity sciences. Insights from these emerging perspectives have implications that merit consideration for developments and extensions of existing work at the metatheoretical, theoretical, and methodological levels in organization theory. The purpose of this manuscript is to: (a) provide an overview of the complexity sciences, (b) provide a justification and rationale for their inclusion into the social sciences, and (c) review the current organizational literature which utilizes and applies concepts from the complexity sciences to organizational phenomena.

Title: Reflexivity

Abstract: Just as the concept "paradigm" energized the human sciences in spite of its many definitions and uses, so now does the concept "reflexive" seem to be of increasing salience, again with many definitions and uses. It is argued that reflexivity, as a fundamental human quality underlies various attempts to understand and intervene in human relationships. By juxtaposing paradigms, reflexivity, and therapeutic progression it is possible to set out several types of reflexivity, some relatively self-contained and others at the edge of our possible "knowledges."

Title: On the Vicissitudes of Cyberspace as Potential-Space
Author-Name: Michael A. Civin
Abstract: This paper examines some issues which emerge from the use of cyberspace within organizations, focusing on the extent to which cyberspace facilitates and/or interferes with individual and organizational growth. It is argued that the Internet has come to facilitate a form of interaction which may appear largely social and related, while remaining relatively isolated, asocial or at best partially social, self-protective, and removed. This is a form of interaction which is often characterized by partial relationships as well as confusion or ambiguity between what is happening and what is imagined. In much of our relational life, we maintain a tension and dynamic interplay between our experience of ourselves and of the world as structured and ordered and our experience of ourselves and of the world as disordered and chaotic. In the organizational Internet interactions explored in this paper, this tension is often suspended, or at times obliterated. However, it is proposed here that, as profoundly ambiguous and...

Title: Cultural Theory and Contemporary Management Organization
Author-Name: John Hendry
Abstract: Mary Douglas's cultural theory of grid and group provides a framework for the description of three distinct cultural types corresponding to three logics for the legitimation of collectivity and collective coercion. Each type is distinguished by characteristic structures of classification, power, and moral order operating at the individual cognitive level. In this paper, the theory is used to illuminate some of the major developments in the structuring of business organizations in the late twentieth century, including the introduction of matrix, project and network organizations, the focus on de-layering, downsizing and outsourcing, and the emergence of concerns with cultural control, organizational learning, and core competence. The problems arising from these developments are discussed in terms of an unresolved conflict between the cognitive frameworks of two of Douglas's cultural types, market, and hierarchy.

Title: The Practice of Multimodal Approaches, the Challenge of Cross-Cultural Communication, and the Search for Responses
Author-Name: Zhichang Zhu
Abstract: The development of multimodal approaches presents an opportunity for human beings to increase their competence in managing complexity, while at the same time brings a challenge of cross-cultural communication. Some claim that two approaches have been proposed for tackling this challenge: an approach of "frameworks" and an approach of "discourse." Some go further to contend dropping frameworks and taking up discourse. This paper argues that, if it is true that there exist these two approaches, neither the "frameworks" nor the "discourse" approach alone is sufficient. It is suggested that researchers and practitioners may be better equipped by participating in discourses with and among frameworks. Employing three metaphors, this paper proposes that, in the way "force-fields" and "constellations" require and imply each other, both frameworks and discourse are necessary for human beings to act as a "Peircian fiber-cable" in social problem-solving.

Title: Politics and Organizational Change: The Lived Experience
Author-Name: David Buchanan
Author-Name: Richard Badham
Abstract: This paper explores the "lived experience" of organizational politics from the standpoint of the change agent. While political behavior appears inevitably to accompany organizational change, the literature of change management seems to adopt an ambivalent approach to this area. The literature of organizational politics, on the other hand, identifies power bases, and offers prescriptive lists of "power tactics" without explaining how these are deployed in the context of driving, shaping, influencing, or implementing change. How do change agents become engaged in political activity, what forms does this take, and can these actions withstand public scrutiny? This paper is based on qualitative, idiographic accounts drawn from five interviews from a pilot study designed to develop a research methodology for advancing understanding of the shaping role of political behavior in organizational change. The case illustrations presented suggest that political behavior is an accepted rather than an objectionable dimen...

Title: The Emotions of Control: A Qualitative Exploration of Environmental Regulation
Author-Name: Stephen Fineman
Author-Name: Andrew Sturdy
Abstract: Processes of control remain central to managerial and critical theories of organization, but their inherently emotional form has been largely neglected. The experience and expression of emotions are more than simply objects and outcomes of control, they also shape its context, processes, and consequences. Drawing upon observations of interpersonal encounters between environmental regulatory inspectors and industrial managers in the U.K., an emotional framing of the dynamics of control is developed. This presents emotion as a condition and consequence of interacting socioeconomic roles and power structures such as those associated with occupations, gender, and capitalism. It also provides a way of analyzing control that is sensitive to its emotional characteristics and may be applied to other, more conventional control contexts.

Title: The Escalator: A Conveyor of Hong Kong's Culture
Author-Name: SIU Kin Wai Michael
Abstract: People believe that escalators provide a more attractive, convenient, and physically less-demanding pedestrian access from one place to another. However, it does not mean all of us have to like them. Escalators do not only affect our perception of speed, but the most important concern is that this urban object also influences our social relationships and human communication. Under the transmission of this urban object, we are treated as components (a what), rather than human beings (a who). Thus, this article discusses how modernist thinking affects how we see this object and ourselves, and examines the relative worth of it, in relation to the social loss incurred in the present or future. This article also discusses how its presence in many of the daily settings of urban life affects the culture, meaning and quality of life.

Title: The Systems Psychodynamics of a Joint Venture: Anxiety Social Defenses, and the Management of Mutual Dependence
Author-Name: Laurence J. Gould

Author-Name: Ross McVicker Clinchy
Abstract: Joint ventures, mergers and other forms of organizational alliances are rapidly becoming a business necessity. However, on an almost daily basis, experience suggests that such alliances often pose critical dilemmas for those entering into them. Central among these are collaborating across differences in organizational cultures and forging a new organizational identity. At a deeper level, there are also often paranoid concerns and fantasies about the long-term lack of equity in the transfer of knowledge and capability. This paper, therefore, outlines a systems psychodynamic perspective on intergroup and interorganizational relationships for developing an in-depth understanding of some common irrational and emotional difficulties alliance relationships face. It then goes on to describe an illustrative case and concludes with an appraisal of the advantages of a systems psychodynamic conceptual perspective-taking both structure and process into account-which has been neglected or minimized in the literature o...

Title: The Tyranny of the Customer and the Cost of Consumerism: An Analysis Using Systems and Psychoanalytic Approaches to Groups and Society
Author-Name: Susan Long
Abstract: This paper argues that an organizational discourse on consumerism is replacing a prior discourse of dependency. This discourse encourages, and is encouraged by, economic rationales for behavior and is marked by the collapse of many complex societal roles into the simpler category of "customer." Moreover, practices emergent from consumerism and economic rationalism often act as organizational and social defences against anxieties about the uncertainties and changes occurring in a world increasingly dominated by global markets where the customer is "sovereign." Six working hypotheses are proposed to explain the operation of these new social defences. Evidence in support of these hypotheses comes from collaborative action research projects in which the author is involved. The argument moves toward a consideration of the new "consumer-provider pair" which, it is proposed, has become a major signifier within the consumer discourse and which might be considered as a transitional pair in dealing with widespread ...

Abstract: This article takes as its point of departure concepts derived from couple therapy to better understand collusive relationships in organizations. As we examine these dysfunctional workplace relationships-these interpersonal "gridlocks"four main types of collusive superior-subordinate interaction patterns are identified-the narcissistic, the controlling, the paranoid, and the sadomasochistic-and the consequences of each such dyad in organizations are explored. In conclusion, the paper presents a number of recommendations on how to recognize the presence of such collusive arrangements (taking leadership behavior as a point of departure) and suggests preventive steps that can be taken.

Title: Psychiatric Services: Organizing Impossibility
Author-Name: Lynette Willshire
Abstract: This paper explores the proposition that elements of the work of psychiatric services are impossible. The notion of impossibility is considered from three perspectives: societal, interpersonal, and organizational. Organizational elements of impossibility are evidenced in attempts to work with madness, a phenomenon that defies clear definition. Resultant confusion in role and task boundaries is exacerbated by mad interpersonal interactions. The situation is compounded by societal conflicts between the mad and the sane. Attempts to house and treat the mad over the past 200 years are reviewed, and recent illustrative case material is presented from two community treatment teams. It is argued that primarily solution-focused approaches to madness have limited success. To acknowledge impossible elements of the work may enable psychiatric institutions to be designed in ways that help make individual and collective madness more bearable rather than something to be controlled and or denied.

However, it tends to obscure deeper psychodynamic elements that are essential to shaping how culture forms, develops, and dies.

An illustrative case is presented to support the argument.

Title: Toward a Cross-Cultural Understanding of Work-Related Beliefs
Author-Name: F. S. Niles
Abstract: Although psychology's contribution to a study of the Protestant Work Ethic (PWE) made a slow start we now have an impressive array of studies which have examined this construct, even cross-culturally, and find that not only is this construct seemingly alive and well, but also that it is espoused more strongly by non-Protestant and non-Western countries. Furnham (1990b) examined a composite of seven scales designed to measure the PWE, and found that several factors could be identified. A study was undertaken to compare the meaning of work in two different cultures, one "Western" Christian (Australian) and the other non-Western Buddhist (Sri Lankan). The results suggest that both cultures have similar perceptions about the meaning of work, but Sri Lankans seem to be more strongly committed to hard work. Although work related beliefs seem to be similar, Sri Lankans do not endorse the belief that hard work leads to success as enthusiastically as Australians do.

Author-Name: Charles W. Mueller

Author-Name: Dong-Gi Jo
Abstract: The justice literature suggests, but has not tested, a positive relationship between met expectations about multiple workplace rewards and distributive justice evaluations (the individual's assessment of whether s/he has been treated fairly). Data from samples of teachers in South Korea (N = 649) and the U.S. (N = 810) are used to examine this relationship. In addition, U.S.-South Korea cultural value differences in individualism, seniority, and hierarchical authority are the basis for hypothesizing that certain reward-specific met expectations will be linked differently to justice evaluations across the two societies. As hypothesized for both societies, the more onés expectations about job-related rewards are met, the greater the perception of just treatment. Also as hypothesized, several societal differences based on cultural differences are found. Met expectations about autonomy are more important in explaining justice evaluations in the U.S., whereas met expectations about advancement opportunities ar...

Abstract: This study examines the relationships between violations of employees' psychological contracts and their exit, voice, loyalty, and neglect behaviors. Using a sample of over 800 managers, this research found that psychological contract violations result in increased levels of exit, voice, and neglect behaviors and decreased levels of loyalty to the organization. In addition, this research examines the moderating effects that situational factors (such as the availability of attractive employment alternatives) have on the relationships between psychological contract violations and managers' behaviors. The results suggest that these situational factors moderate the relationship between psychological contract violations and exit, but not the relationships between psychological contract violations and voice, loyalty, or neglect. Finally, this research also examines differences in the nature of psychological contract violations experienced across three categories of workers: new managers entering the workforce, ...

Abstract: This paper tests three hypotheses on who gets more support from his or her work organization: (1) The validation hypothesis predicts that employees with greater social support from their co-workers and supervisors receive more organizational support, because their support validates or legitimizes organizational support; (2) the positive affectivity hypothesis predicts that employees high on positive affect receive more organizational support, because they are more likable; and (3) the moderation hypothesis predicts that positive affect and social support do not generate organizational support independently, but each acts on the other to affect organizational support. An assessment of the hypotheses over a sample of 1882 hospital employees in Korea provided strong support for the validation hypothesis and partial support for the moderation hypothesis. Contrary to the positive affectivity hypothesis, employees' good disposition in itself works against the bringing forth of relevant organizational support, n...

Title: Predicting Intentions to Report Administrative and Disciplinary Infractions: Applying the Reasoned Action Model
Author-Name: Shmuel Ellis
Author-Name: Shaul Arieli
Abstract: The present study focuses on the reporting of administrative and disciplinary irregularities. The reasoned action model (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980) is applied to predict officers' intentions to report illegal or irregular activities in the Israeli Defense Forces. The findings show that although the model's two predictors (attitude toward reporting and subjective norm) significantly predicted intention to report, the effect of subjective norm was much stronger than the effect of the attitude component. In spite of the military's strong formal system and although social forces have great potential to impose the reporting norm on an organization's members, actual reporting does not meet expectations. The results are discussed in light of the organizational culture that develops as the combat unit struggles to survive in an extremely turbulent environment.

Abstract: This paper proposes a metatheory of work motivation incorporating theories of self-concept that have been proposed in the sociological and psychological literatures. Traditional theories of work motivation are reviewed, and the selfconcept-based sources of motivation are presented. How the self-concept influences behavior in organizations is explained and used to develop a metatheory of motivational sources. Both research and managerial implications of the model are presented.

Title: A Dynamic Model of Work Satisfaction: Qualitative Approaches
Author-Name: Andre Bussing

Author-Name: Klaus-M. Perrari
Abstract: Traditional work satisfaction research is criticized for its personalistic approach in conceptualization and measurement. Its results are doubted because of the artificially high proportions of satisfied. In order to overcome some of these shortcomings, the extended model of different forms of work satisfaction originally proposed by Bruggemann (1974) is validated. Six forms of work satisfaction (progressive, stabilized, resigned satisfaction; constructive, fixated, resigned dissatisfaction) are derived from the constellation of four constituent variables: comparison of the actual work situation and personal aspirations, global satisfaction, changes in level of aspiration, controllability at work. Results from semistructured interviews, a free Q-sort, and a questionnaire for differentiating forms of work satisfaction for 46 nurses provide support for the model. Various methods proved useful in accessing particular aspects of the underlying cognitive and evaluative processes in the formation of different f...

Title: Resistance and Cooperation: A Response to Conflict Over Job Performance
Author-Name: Deborah B. Balser
Author-Name: Robert N. Stern
Abstract: Research literature on job performance from both management oriented and industrial relations/sociology of work models is synthesized to produce a more comprehensive understanding of how supervisors manage employee performance problems. Two assumptions are derived from the synthesis: (1) employees are active in accepting and resisting definitions of performance issues made by supervisor; (2) informal interactions regarding the interpretation of performance issues are pivotal in understanding how performance problems are resolved. In a study of university library supervisors we focus on the informal exchanges and characterize them as negotiations over the definition of job performance. We report results from a qualitative study of supervisors' interactions with employees identified as having performance problems. Three types of interactions in informal negotiations are found. We label the supervisors' interpretations of their interactions with employees as conformist, confrontational, or rebellious, design...

Abstract: The establishment, extension and development of formal mentoring schemes in workplaces have been accompanied by an extensive analysis of the preconditions for successful implementation. These have tended to explore the "mechanics" of formal mentoring schemes; namely policy development, scheme design, mentor competence, and mentor training. These studies tend to be normative and prescriptive. Substantive theoretical analysis of formal mentoring has been either absent, implicit, limited, or underdeveloped.

Author-Name: Arie Shirom

Author-Name: Samuel Melamed
Abstract: We hypothesized that employees' emotional distress would be affected by the degree to which their payment was contingent upon individual performance. Respondents were 2747 blue-collar employees in 21 factories in Israel. They completed questionnaires on company time. We found that, in comparison with those who were paid only according to time worked, being on a performance-contingent pay system was associated with higher levels of depression and somatic complaints, but not of anxiety. As expected, these effects were partially mediated by the extent to which the respondents' work was monotonous.

Author-Name: Gary Blau
Abstract: Using a longitudinal sample of medical technologists (MTs) this study found, after controlling for prior overall job satisfaction, individual difference, and organization-level variables, that task responsibilities and employee performance appraisal satisfaction significantly affected subsequent overall MT job satisfaction. Overall job satisfaction significantly declined for repeat-respondents over the 4-year period. Data also suggested that the impact of task responsibilities on overall job satisfaction can dissipate over time, and that the supervisor's role in affecting employee job satisfaction is important. Results and limitations are discussed.

Abstract: A study into the relationships between candidate self-monitoring ability, interviewer perceptions of candidate personality, and interviewer outcome decisions in the context of actual graduate recruitment interviews (n = 130) is presented. Detailed psychometric norm data is also reported on the Lennox and Wolfe (1984) revised Self-Monitoring (RS-M) scale, together with the results of confirmatory factor analyses into the factor structure of this measure. It was found that candidate self-monitoring ability was only moderately and nonsignificantly related to interviewer outcome evaluations, and that self-monitoring was generally uncorrelated with the positiveness of recruiter impressions of candidate personality. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that a two correlated factor structure for the RS-M scale, in accordance with the original authors' formulation, provided the most parsimonious fit. Norm data for the RS-M scale is reported for this sample of British graduates, including item statistics, item to...

Title: Rethinking Bystander Nonintervention: Social Categorization and the Evidence of Witnesses at the James Bulger Murder Trial
Author-Name: Mark Levine
Abstract: Bystander apathy is a long established phenomenon in social psychology which has yet to be translated into practical strategies for increasing bystander intervention. This paper argues that the traditional paradigm is hampered by a focus on the physical co-presence of others rather than an analysis of the social meanings inherent in (non)intervention. The testimony provided by 38 bystanders at the trial of two 10-year-old boys for the murder of 2-and-a-half-year-old James Bulger is analyzed. It is argued that their failure to intervene can be attributed to the fact that they assumed-or were told-that the three boys were brothers. The way in which this category of "the family" served to prohibit or deflect intervention is analyzed. This approach is contrasted with a traditional bystander apathy account of the bystanders' actions in the Bulger case. It is argued that bystander (non)intervention phenomenon should be analyzed in terms of the construction of social categories in local contexts.

Abstract: This study sought to examine self-reported emotional and behavioral correlates of money pathology, defined as inappropriate behavior with respect to money and associated material goods. In all, 267 British adult subjects completed a battery of questionnaires including Rubinstein's (1981) extensive Psychology Today survey on money and Forman's ipsative measures that describe five Money Pathology Scales (miser, spendthrift, tycoon, bargain hunter, gambler), an overall pathology scale combining the five and his short moneysanity measure. The former measure was factor analyzed and selected factor scores regressed on to the moneysanity measure along with demographic measures in order to attempt to establish which individual difference factors best predicted the different types of money pathology. Thus females were more extravagant, prone to depression, but less likely to take moral risks for money, while richer, more right-wing people tended to be more materialistic. Those with overall less "money sanity" tend...

Title: Underlying Labor Market Dimensions of "Opportunities": The Case of Employee Turnover
Author-Name: Alan Kirschenbaum
Author-Name: Rita Mano-Negrin
Abstract: The underlying labor market and organizational source of alternative job opportunities is re-examined here and applied to investigate employee turnover behavior. We contend that by refining this concept in terms of perceived and objective opportunities and market reference points, a clearer appreciation of this concept and more powerful model of turnover will emerge. To this end, a cross-sectional and multistage longitudinal survey of 700 employees was conducted in eight medical centers at seven distinct labor market locations. Measures of perceived and objective opportunities in internal and external markets were introduced into logistic regressions which clearly showed that objective opportunities are a far better set of explanations of actual turnover behavior than either perceived internal or external market opportunities. This relationship is further explored and its complexity woven into a labor market-oriented turnover model.

Title: Career Commitment as a Complex Moderator of Organizational Commitment and Thrnover Intention

Abstract: This study investigated the moderating role of career commitment on the relationships between employees' perception of company practices and organizational commitment, and between organizational commitment and turnover intention. Using a sample of 225 researchers from eight business-related research institutes in Korea, it was found that (1) career commitment was perceived as distinct from the two dimensions of organizational commitment (affective and continuance) by Korean researchers; (2) career commitment moderated the effect of employees' perception of supervisory support on affective commitment; and (3) career commitment also moderated the effect of affective commitment on turnover intention. The practical and conceptual implications of these results are discussed.

Author-Name: Samuel Aryee
Abstract: This study examined the pay-life satisfaction relationship and the moderating influence of breadwinner role salience among a sample of Hong Kong Chinese professional and managerial employees (N = 255). The results of zero-order correlational and moderated regression analysis revealed support for the pay-life satisfaction relationship. The interaction term of pay satisfaction by breadwinner role salience made a significant but rather modest contribution to the explained variance in life satisfaction and this finding was not gender-specific. Results of a subgroup analysis also revealed that the pay-life satisfaction relationship was significant among the low breadwinner role salience group but was nonsignificant among the high breadwinner role salience group. In general, the findings highlight the importance of breadwinner role salience to employees' reactions to the economic conditions of work.

Abstract: We propose six hypotheses that relate employee, internal, and external inequities to changes in performance. We test these hypotheses with a sample of 362 Major League Baseball players.

Title: Disaggregating the Motives Underlying Tiarnover Intentions: When Do Intentions Predict Thrnover Behavior?
Author-Name: Robert J. Vandenberg
Author-Name: Jodi Barnes Nelson
Abstract: Although intention to quit an organization represents one of the better predictors of actual turnover behavior, the intention-behavior relationship varies widely across studies. This study argues that one reason for the variability is that individuals possess different motives for stating a high intention of leaving, and it is the motive that accounts in part for when the intention will manifest itself in actual turnover. Using a longitudinal design, expectations were supported in that only those intentions motivated by disaffection with the organization and its values resulted in the loss of employees.

Title: On the Use of "Intent to..." Variables in Organizational Research: An Empirical and Cautionary Assessment
Author-Name: Dan R. Dalton

Author-Name: Catherine M. Daily
Abstract: Organizational research often relies on surrogate variables. By "surrogate" we do not refer to family of construct, factor, or latent variables. Rather, we address the situation where one variable is literally the substitute for another variable that is generally unavailable. Consider, for example, the use of "intent to turnover" or "intent to transfer" variables commonly used when actual turnover or transfer data are unavailable. We demonstrate that reliance on such surrogate variables may lead to some misinterpretation. This tendency may be particularly apparent when the relationship between the surrogate and the actual variable is low. This may be further exacerbated when the relationship between the surrogate variable and a third variable is modest as well.

Title: Contextualizing Business Ethics: Anomie and Social Life
Author-Name: Phil Johnson
Author-Name: Ken Smith
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to explore how the current interest in Business Ethics can be located within an analysis of contemporary society which takes into account the prevalence of moral uncertainty along with the concomitant desire to (re)establish some form of normative order. As such, Business Ethics may be seen as a socially constructed "field" of study which reflects broader changes and controversies within society. Yet as a body of knowledge, Business Ethics articulates epistemological doubts. Two distinctive themes in Business Ethics discourse are considered-the modernist/rationalist and the postmodemist/relativist. It is argued that in different ways, each can be seen as both an expression of, and a reaction to, the increasing incidence of anomie in society. The implications for organizational practices are then considered through the example of Corporate Codes of Ethics and the problem of establishing consensus where the grounds for any claim to moral authority are problematic.

Title: Organizational Sleepwalkers: Emotional Distress at Midlife
Author-Name: Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries
Abstract: In this paper, attention is paid to a dysfunctional emotional behavior pattern whereby individuals experience very little (or a total absence of) pleasure. Instead, there is a feeling of emotional numbness. Although this phenomenon touches all parts of life, this paper focuses on the organizational context. For some executives, the stresses and strains of midlife (including stresses involving career issues) become the catalyst for this dysfunctional emotional behavior. Their reactions are of a quasi-alexithymic and anhedonic nature. Some of the characteristics of this dysfunctional emotional pattern are delineated in these pages. In addition, the related experience of depersonalization is highlighted. Some of the factors that contribute to these kinds of phenomena are explored. At the end of the paper, a number of recommendations for dealing with these difficulties are given.

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to explore the specific affective organization of personal meanings in midlife crisis in men. Midlife crisis is described as a process of intensive transition of the self including the reinterpretation of time perspective, reevaluation of life values and goals, confrontation with death as a personal event in the future, and planning of the second half of life. Personal meanings referring to past, present, and future were investigated using a self-confrontation method that is sensitive to the affective properties of individual experiences. The intensity of midlife crisis was investigated by means of a Midlife Crisis Scale in a sample of 104 men in Poland. Three groups, one high in midlife crisis (N = 27), one medium (N = 37), and one low in midlife crisis (N = 40) were compared. It was found that the high crisis group had a lower level of affect referring to self-enhancement, a lower level of positive affect, and a higher level of negative affect than both other groups.

Title: Deep Roles: Twelve Primordial Roles of Mind and Organization
Author-Name: Paul Moxnes
Abstract: The thesis in this paper is that there are 12 archetypal roles in groups and organizations. These "deep roles" have their origin in the roles of the essential family-father, mother, son, and daughter. In groups and organizations, each of these images of family roles will-through the basic defense mechanisms of splitting and projection-be polarized into a good and bad part: The father as God or devil, the mother as queen or witch, the son as crown prince or black sheep, and the daughter as princess or whore. In addition to these eight primary deep roles, there come two secondary ones: the helpers-Shaman and Slave-whose function are to help the family survive spiritually and materially, respectively. The two last deep roles are of a transcendental nature: the hero (winner) and the clown (loser), i.e., the one who has won a good family role, and the one who has lost it-or never gained it. These 12 deep roles are well known from such cultural artifacts as fairy tales and mythology. In groups and organizations...

Author-Name: Sherry K. Schneider
Author-Name: Gregory B. Northcraft
Abstract: This paper explores the relationship among three social dilemmas faced by organizations wishing to attain and maintain workforce diversity: the dilemmas of organizational participation, managerial participation, and individual participation. Functional and social category diversity offer benefits for organizations (creativity, adaptation and innovation, and access to external networks), but there are costs which deter organizations from pursuing these benefits. The costs associated with organizational participation in diversity initiatives arise because managers and their employees perceive organizational conflicts and organize their interactions along social identity lines, so that temporal traps and collective fences surround diversity. Resolving the subordinate dilemmas of managerial and individual participation provides the key to resolving the dilemma of organizational participation. Social identity theory is used to understand the dilemmas and to develop possible resolutions, which should make the b...

Abstract: Individuals with physical disabilities are often stigmatized because their bodies are assumed to vary from norms of physical competence and bodily appearance. Possession of a discrediting attribute may impair social interactions and result in the devaluation of an individual. The purpose of this paper is to explore how involvement in sport and physical activity may be one strategy to manage the stigma of a disabled body. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with 24 male college students with physical disabilities. Findings indicate that respondents believe this context helps them exceed expectations associated with their disability through demonstration of physical skill, a fit healthy body, a muscular body, and a liberated body. Sport and physical activity may be effective in compensating for a spoiled identity as participation in this setting is unexpected and emphasizes an alternative representation of a disabled body.

Author-Name: Beni Lauterbach

Abstract: An examination of 165 top management successions in U.S. firms during 1989-91 reveals that external successions are more likely in small firms, in firms with poor economic performance, and in firms which offer the successor several top positions (for example, Chairman and CEO). This last finding illustrates that successor's interests and demands (such as organizational power) are also important in determining the final match between manager and firm. We also find that, on average, the postsuccession performance of external successors is superior to that of internal successors. This could indicate that the Board of Directors faces an agency problem, leading it to appoint too often from inside.

Author-Name: Sarah J. Freeman
Abstract: This paper develops and examines a framework of downsizing processes at the organizational level. It builds on previous frameworks and literature by introducing new variables found to be important in a field study and by bringing empirical evidence to bear on conceptual underpinnings related to organizational downsizing and change. The framework developed identifies two general approaches that organizations use when undergoing downsizing and redesign, as well as patterns of activities and changes that accompany them. Downsizing driving redesign involves incremental and low-level change, and is associated with less communication and systematic analysis, narrow participation in change efforts, and lower magnitude change in other organizational attributes. Redesign driving downsizing involves more fundamental organizational change, and is associated with high-level changes that involve restructuring, more communication, broad participation in change efforts, advance systematic analysis, and the use of intero...

Abstract: This study tracked the leadership development of 236 male cadets from matriculation through graduation at a military college. Cognitive ability, physical fitness, prior influence experiences, and self-esteem measured in Year I were relevant to predicting those who assumed formal leadership positions in Year 4. Physical fitness and prior influence experiences measured when cadets entered the college predicted leader effectiveness rated in their fourth year. Stress tolerance and moral reasoning levels did not predict leader emergence or effectiveness, though the set of individual difference measures significantly predicted emergence and effectiveness. Physical fitness levels and moral reasoning increased over time for all cadets, though surprisingly, levels of self-esteem and stress tolerance did not increase over time. Overall the study demonstrated that leadership effectiveness and emergence could be predicted from early measures of individual differences.

Title: Advantages of Groups in Market Transactions
Author-Name: Chong Ju Choi
Author-Name: Brian Hilton
Abstract: This paper takes individuals as rational economic decision makers but ones operating within well-defined groups not just today but into the future when a reputation for fair dealing will be of significance. The paper explores the functional advantages which might accrue from group membership in such circumstances. As social science makes clear, most groups come into being for social and cultural reasons independent of any obvious immediate economic advantage. For this reason, this paper is exploratory of the boundary between economic reasoning and that of other social sciences. It explores the "bridge too far," cited by Loveridge in the 1993 special edition of this journal. This is a metaphor for the possibility of a meaningful connector between social psychological and economic reasoning. This paper tentatively looks into the relationships that might be established between the specific economic analysis covered by this paper and that deployed in other social sciences. In essence, the paper suggests that ...

Title: After Eden: Envy and the defences against anxiety                paradigm
Author-Name: Mark Stein
Abstract: Envy has the potential for substantial destructiveness in social systems. Despite its fundamental place in the Kleinian psychoanalytic study of individuals, for several decades, envy has been virtually excluded from psychoanalytic studies of social systems. This paper focuses on this omission, arguing that the Kleinian school established a paradigm focusing on 'social systems as a defence against anxiety'. The implicit delimiting of this paradigm has allowed no room for envy: envy is quite distinct from anxiety; and it is not defensive, involving unwarranted attacks instead. In recent years, envy has emerged as the existing paradigm's anomaly. It is argued here that a new paradigm which has conceptual space for the notion of 'social systems as an envious attack' is required. Group, organizational and societal examples are offered to exemplify the dangerous and malignant potential of envy in such social systems.

Title: Does attitude toward money moderate the relationship between intrinsic                job satisfaction and voluntary turnover?
Author-Name: Thomas Li-Ping Tang
Author-Name: Jwa K. Kim
Author-Name: David Shin-Hsiung Tang
Abstract: The present study expanded Judge's (1993) study and tested the hypotheses that people's Money Ethic endorsement (Tang, 1992, 1995) would moderate the intrinsic job satisfaction-withdrawal cognitions relationship and the intrinsic job satisfaction-voluntary turnover relationship in a sample of mental health and mental retardation professionals. Results suggested that Money Ethic endorsement was a moderator for both relationships. For employees with high Money Ethic endorsement, their voluntary turnover was high regardless of their intrinsic job satisfaction. Employees with low Money Ethic endorsement and low intrinsic job satisfaction had the lowest voluntary turnover. Thus, in this sample, just a pull (high Money Ethic) is needed to experience turnover. Money Ethic endorsement predicted actual turnover behavior, but withdrawal cognitions did not. Money Ethic endorsement was not a mediator of the intrinsic job satisfaction and turnover relationship. Results are discussed in terms of the small, but growing ...

Title: Crowds, context and identity: Dynamic categorization processes in the                'poll tax riot'
Author-Name: Clifford Stott
Author-Name: John Drury
Abstract: Reicher has recently developed the social identity model of crowd behaviour based on self-categorization theory (SCT). This model begins to tackle the thorny theoretical problems posed by the dynamic nature of crowd action (Reicher, 1996b). The present paper describes an ethnographic study of a crowd event in which there were changes in the inter-group relationships over time. It is suggested that the laboratory evidence in support of SCT is complemented by ethnographic research of this type. By exploring situations in which definitions of context and/or categories are not purposefully manipulated, we can demonstrate the explanatory power of a dynamic and interactive approach to social categorization.

Title: Measures of five aspects of affective well-being at work
Author-Name: Kevin Daniels
Abstract: Validation evidence is provided for scales that measure five aspects of affective well-being in relation to the work context: anxiety-comfort, depression-pleasure, bored-enthusiastic, tiredness-vigour and angry-placid. Confirmatory factor analysis is used to test four alternative structures for the items in the scales in two samples (n = 871, n = 1915). Analyses in both samples support one structure. The final scales have acceptable internal reliability. The unique explanatory power of each scale is suggested by partial correlations with theoretically related variables. Confirmatory factor analysis indicates that the five factor solution has a better fit with the data than other first order solutions with fewer factors. Second order factor analysis shows that two superordinate factors, corresponding to negative and positive affect, can account for the relationships amongst the five first order factors.

Title: Morals, money, ethical investing and economic psychology
Author-Name: Alan Lewis
Author-Name: Craig Mackenzie
Abstract: This paper reports on a questionnaire survey of 1146 ethical investors in the UK. Ethical investing usually means that certain companies are excluded from one's portfolio on non-economic grounds, e.g. because they manufacture armaments, test chemicals on live animals, or have poor pollution records. Is this an example where moral commitment rather than economics is driving economic decision making? Ethical investors were found to be neither cranks nor saints holding both ethical and not so ethical investments at the same time. A case is made that people are prepared to put their money where their morals are although there is no straightforward trade-off between principles and money. A broader analysis than that based on rational economic man is recommended: an economic psychology.

Title: Discourse and the study of organization: Toward a structurational                perspective
Author-Name: Loizos Heracleous
Author-Name: John Hendry
Abstract: Existing approaches to organizational discourse, which we label as 'managerialist', 'interpretive' and 'critical', either privilege agency at the expense of structure or the other way around. This tension reflects that between approaches to discourse in the social sciences more generally but is sharper in the organizational context, where discourse is typically temporally and contextually specific and imbued with attributions of instrumental intent. As the basis for a more sophisticated understanding of organizational discourse, we draw on the work of Giddens to develop a structurational conceptualization in which discourse is viewed as a duality of communicative actions and structural properties, recursively linked through the modality of actors' interpretive schemes. We conclude by exploring some of the theoretical implications of this conceptualization and its consequences for the methodology of organizational discourse analysis.abs>

Title: Trust and inter-organizational networking
Author-Name: Susan Newell
Author-Name: Jacky Swan
Abstract: Inter-organizational and multi-functional networking are increasingly portrayed as new and potentially more effective forms of organization, especially where innovation is important. This is as true for academic work undertaken within universities as it is for business organizations; multi-disciplinary and inter-institutional collaboration being specified as highly desirable by the major research funding bodies. Integrating mechanisms are essential if such networks are to be effective in co-ordinating the work of a diverse range of partners. Importantly, they are required for the development of trust. Thus, the literature stresses that trust between the parties is central to the effective operation of such networks. This paper explores the evolution of trust within a particular inter-university, multi-disciplinary research team, and develops a model depicting the development and interrelation of different types of trust within this network. The difficulties this research network experienced in developing ...

Abstract: This field study used structural equation modeling to investigate the relationships among: (1) distributive and procedural justice; (2) justice components and organizational commitment; and (3) justice components and behaviors/behavioral intentions. The results suggest that, over time, procedural justice judgments are likely to influence perceptions of distributive justice, but not vice versa. In addition, the results suggest that both distributive justice and procedural justice have reciprocal relationships with commitment and turnover intentions, although in some cases they are contingent on lagged effects. Relationships between procedural justice and behaviors (i.e. compliance, performance) were unidirectional, significant only in the justice-to-behavior direction.

Author-Name: Michelle Kaminski

Author-Name: Thomas G. Robins
Abstract: Many organizations are interested in empowerment, believing that empowered workers will be more effective in reaching their goals. What does it mean to be empowered, and how do people achieve this state? Using qualitative data, we applied the developmental model proposed by Kieffer to a sample of 14 worker-trainers. We found that Kieffer's model worked well with this sample, with some modification. One is that workers did not have to feel personally threatened in order to become activists, as did Kieffer's original sample. A second is that not all workers followed the four stages in the order proposed. Our data also suggested that worker-trainers who had reached a more advanced stage of empowerment were more successful at their task. Finally, based on the model, we also highlight ways to design interventions to help people further develop their stage of empowerment.

Title: The fantasy of inevitability in organizations
Author-Name: David P. Levine
Abstract: This article explores the fantasy that an organization must exist, that the world outside cannot go on in its absence, and that the organization is somehow woven into the fabric of society so as to make it inevitable. Inevitability is part of a grandiose fantasy expressed in the idea that, however many competitors the organization may face, it remains the one true organization, while the others must be judged false claimants. Operation of the fantasy suggests, therefore, the presence of a narcissistic disturbance in the organization. Inevitability is contrasted with indeterminacy, which expresses the organization's capacity to suspend assumptions and preformed knowledge about itself and its world. The article considers indeterminacy an emotional capacity and inevitability the result of the inability of the organization to have access to that capacity. The distinction between inevitability and indeterminacy is seen to have important implications for the possibility and nature of organizational change.

Title: Cultural values and management ethics: A 10-nation study
Author-Name: Terence Jackson
Abstract: There is currently a lack of empirical work on cross-cultural differences in ethical attitudes towards day-to-day management decision-making in organizations. Work that currently exists in the area of management ethics also lacks cultural explanations of differences. The present study tries to overcome these deficiencies by providing a model of ethical decision-making that is based on cultural antecedents, which may explain differences in judgements of ethicality, and consequential ethical attitudes or professed behaviour. This article reports a 10-nation empirical study that focuses on ethical 'grey areas' that form part of the day-to-day decision-making in organizations across the globe. Countries were selected to represent variation along two cultural dimensions of 'collectivism-individualism', and 'uncertainty avoidance'. These dimensions were then used to explain national cultural differences in judgements of ethicality of decision items concerned with relations with external stakeholders, with the c...

Title: Coping with change: The contribution of postdichotomous ontologies
Author-Name: Nicholas Beech

Abstract: This article seeks to conceptualize interactions surrounding organizational change. Four ideal types of reality(ies) are presented here using the metaphor of language. Actors' representations of experience are presented in order to illustrate these concepts. We argue that types 1 and 2, which are epitomized by dichotomous thought, are unlikely to provide adequate managerial insight in coping with complex change, whereas types 3 and 4, which are typified by 'postdichotomous' thought, hold greater possibilities as frameworks for coping with such social situations. The concept of 'coping', as opposed to 'managing', as a way of 'acting thinkingly' in and around organizational change is explored.

Title: Power and emotion in organizational learning
Author-Name: Russ Vince
Abstract: This article explores the difference between learning in an organization and organizational learning. I construct a conceptual framework for understanding organizational learning at an organizational level of analysis. This framework is based on the proposition that organizational learning is visible in the organizational dynamics created from the interaction between politics (power relations) and emotion within an organization. Using a combination of psychodynamic theory and reflections on the politics of organizing I develop the idea that organizations are learning when the 'establishment' that is being created through the very process of organizing can be identified and critically reflected upon. I use a case example of a change initiative within Hyder PLC, a multinational company, to identify organizational dynamics that limit organizational learning. In the final part of the article, I discuss the conclusions that emerged from the case example and the implications of these conclusions for the theory ...

Title: Managerial behavior in a multiplex role system
Author-Name: P. Monique Valcour
Abstract: This article uses ethnographic data gathered from a parent cooperative nursery school to examine the strategies managers use to resolve role conflict in a multiplex role system, that is, a setting in which the relationship between managers and the people they supervise is based on more than one set of roles. In the organization under study, teachers functioned as both managers of, and service providers to, the parent volunteers they were charged with supervising. Parents' volunteer worker role was subject to conflict with and interruption by the expectations of their organizational client role, which constrained teachers' ability to direct parents' work in the classroom. Managerial effectiveness required responding to the demands and expectations of both sets of roles through a process of adaptive self-regulation. Teachers used several discrepancy detection strategies to gather information on parent volunteers' relative role salience, role transition readiness, and volunteer skills. Based on the informati...

Title: The politics of imagined stability: A psychodynamic understanding of change at Hyder plc
Author-Name: Russ Vince
Abstract: The aim of this article is to show how psychodynamic theory and its application can inform the management of change in organizations. The article outlines a psychodynamic framework for the management of change, emphasizing the interrelation between individual and collective emotional experience and power relations. The phrase a politics of imagined stability is used to describe the role that social and strategic politics play in the perpetuation of emotions and fantasies that have an impact on organizing. The framework involves understanding how the organization is imagined, experienced and maintained through the influence of social and strategic politics, as well as the resulting emotional and political relations within which attempts at change have to be managed. The conceptual framework is illustrated and developed through a case example from Hyder plc, formerly the largest private company in Wales, UK. The discussion and conclusion outline the articles contribution to knowledge concerning psychodynami...

Abstract: Our aim in this article is to explore and explain the concept of 'negative capability', in the context of the current resurgence of interest in organizational leadership. We suggest that negative capability can create an intermediate space that enables one to continue to think in difficult situations. Where positive capability supports 'decisive action', negative capability supports 'reflective inaction', that is, the ability to resist dispersing into defensive routines when leading at the limits of one's knowledge, resources and trust. The development of negative capability is discussed but it is suggested that its status is problematic in the context of a societal and organizational culture dominated by control and performativity. The practice of negative capability is illustrated throughout the article, using a case study of the leadership of an international joint venture.

Author-Name: Nicolay Am Worren

Abstract: In this article we discuss the characteristics of knowledge that lead to practical utility. We first review previous efforts at identifying the characteristics of useful knowledge. These contributions are grouped into three perspectives according to which representational mode they imply: propositional, narrative, or visual. We develop a framework for pragmatic validity that encompasses knowledge represented in all three modes. However, we also note an over-reliance on the propositional mode in academia, which contrasts with a preference for narrative and visual knowledge among practitioners. Explicit and propositional knowledge are key criteria for achieving scientific validity, but more ambiguous knowledge serves important functions in organizational life and may thus possess pragmatic validity. We highlight the role of conceptual models expressed in a visual format, a representational mode that has received little attention in the literature. We end with suggestions for further research that may extend...

Title: Thinking about doing: On learning from experience and the flight from thinking
Author-Name: David P Levine
Abstract: This article explores the relationship between learning, thinking, and doing. A case study of a course in group dynamics is presented, and the desire of students in that course to learn about groups simply by being in a group is considered. The article argues that the desire to learn simply by having an experience expresses a conservative impulse. If all we have is an experience, all we can learn is the inevitability of repeating it. This makes learning from experience the enemy of creativity as its purpose is not to discover what might be, but to assure the reproduction of what is. Learning from experience in this sense means failing to learn from experience. Failure to learn from experience is linked to fear of thinking. When the group is imagined to be a refuge from thinking, appeal to learning by doing expresses the need to replace learning with belonging.
