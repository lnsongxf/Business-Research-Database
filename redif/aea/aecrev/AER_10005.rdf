Title: Sudden Stops, Financial Crises, and Leverage 
Abstract:
 Financial crashes were followed by deep recessions in the Sudden Stops of
 emerging economies. An equilibrium business cycle model with a collateral 
 constraint explains this phenomenon as a result of the amplification and
 asymmetry that the constraint induces in the responses of macro-aggregates
 to  shocks. Leverage rises during expansions, and when it rises enough it
 triggers the constraint, causing a Fisherian deflation that reduces credit
 and the price and quantity of collateral assets. Output and factor
 allocations fall because access to working capital financing is also
 reduced. Precautionary saving makes Sudden Stops low probability events
 nested within normal cycles, as observed in the data. (JEL E21, E23, E32,

Title: The Political Economy of the US Mortgage Default Crisis 
Abstract:
 We examine the effects of constituents, special interests, and ideology on
 congressional voting on two of the most significant pieces of legislation
 in US economic history. Representatives whose constituents experience a
 sharp increase  in mortgage defaults are more likely to support the
 Foreclosure Prevention Act, especially in competitive districts.
 Interestingly, representatives are more sensitive to defaults of their
 own-party constituents. Special interests in the form ofhigher campaign
 contributions from the financial industry increase the likelihood  of
 supporting the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. However,
 ideologically conservative representatives are less responsive to both
 constituent and special interests. (JEL D72, G21, G28)

Title: Margins of Multinational Labor Substitution 
Abstract:
 Employment at a multinational enterprise (MNE) responds to wages at the
 extensive margin, when an MNE enters a foreign location, and at the
 intensive margin, when an MNE operates existing affiliates. We present an
 MNE model and conditions for parametric and nonparametric identification.
 Prior studies rarely found wages to affect MNE employment. Our integrated
 approach documents salient labor substitution for German manufacturing
 MNEs and removes bias. In Central and Eastern Europe, most employment
 responds at the extensive margin, while in Western Europe the extensive
 margin accounts for around two-thirds of employment shifts. At distant
 locations, MNEs respond to wages only at the extensive margin. (JEL F23,

Title: An Exploration of Technology Diffusion 
Abstract:
 We develop a model that, at the aggregate level, is similar to the
 one-sector neoclassical growth model; at the disaggregate level, it has
 implications for the path of observable measures of technology adoption.
 We estimate it using data on the diffusion of 15 technologies in 166
 countries over the last two centuries. Our results reveal that, on
 average, countries have adopted technologies 45  years after their
 invention. There is substantial variation across technologies and
 countries. Newer technologies have been adopted faster than old ones. The
 cross-country variation in the adoption of technologies accounts for at
 least 25  percent of per capita income differences. (JEL O33, O41, O47)

Title: Inherited Trust and Growth 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a new method to uncover the causal effect of trust on
 economic growth by focusing on the inherited component of trust and its
 time variation. We show that inherited trust of descendants of US
 immigrants is significantly influenced by the country of origin and the
 timing of arrival of their forebears. We thus use the inherited trust of
 descendants of US immigrants as a time-varying measure of inherited trust
 in their country of origin. This strategy allows to identify the sizeable
 causal impact of inherited trust on worldwide growth during the twentieth
 century by controlling for country fixed effects. (JEL N11, N12, N31, N32,

Title: International Trade and Income Differences 
Abstract:
 I develop a novel view of the trade frictions between rich and poor
 countries by arguing that to reconcile bilateral trade volumes and price
 data within a standard gravity model, the trade frictions between rich and
 poor countries must be systematically asymmetric, with poor countries
 facing higher costs to export relative to rich countries. I provide a
 method to model these asymmetries and demonstrate the merits of my
 approach relative to alternatives in the trade literature. I then argue
 that these trade frictions are quantitatively important to understanding
 the large differences in standards of living and total factor 
 productivity across countries. (JEL F11, F13, F14, O19 )

Title: Early Admissions at Selective Colleges 
Abstract:
 Early admissions are widely used by selective colleges and universities.
 We identify some basic facts about early admissions policies, including
 the admissions advantage enjoyed by early applicants and patterns in
 application behavior, and propose a game-theoretic model that matches
 these facts. The key feature of the model is that colleges want to admit
 students who are enthusiastic about attending, and early admissions
 programs give students an opportunity to signal this enthusiasm. (JEL C78,

Title: The Changing Incidence of Geography 
Abstract:
 The incidence of bilateral trade costs is calculated here using neglected
 properties of the structural gravity model, disaggregated by commodity and
 region, and re-aggregated into forms useful for economic geography. For
 Canada's provinces, 1992-2003, sellers' incidence is on average some five
 times higher than buyers' incidence. Sellers' incidence falls over time
 due to specialization, despite constant gravity coefficients. This
 previously unrecognized globalizing force drives big reductions in
 "constructed home bias," the disproportionate predicted share of local
 trade; and large but varying gains in real GDP. (JEL F11, F14, R12)

Title: Is Reputation Good or Bad? An Experiment 
Abstract:
 We investigate the impact of reputation in a laboratory experiment. We do
 so by varying whether the past choices of a long-run player are observable
 by the short-run players. Our framework allows for reputation to have
 either a beneficial  or a harmful effect on the long-run player. We find
 that reputation is seldom harmful and its beneficial effects are not as
 strong as theory suggests. When reputational concerns are at odds with
 other-regarding preferences, we find th latter overwhelm the former. (JEL

Title: Institutions and Behavior: Experimental Evidence on the Effects of Democracy 
Abstract:
 A novel experiment is used to show that the effect of a policy on the
 level of cooperation is greater when it is chosen democratically by the
 subjects than when it is exogenously imposed. In contrast to the previous
 literature, our experimental design allows us to control for selection
 effects (e.g., those who choose the policy may be affected differently by
 it). Our finding implies that democratic institutions may affect behavior
 directly in addition to having effects through the choice of policies. Our
 findings have implications for the generalizability of the results of
 randomized policy interventions. (JEL C91, D02, D12, D72)

Title: Asymmetric Contests with Conditional Investments 
Abstract:
 This paper studies equilibrium behavior in a class of games that models
 asymmetric competitions with unconditional and conditional investments.
 Such competitions include lobbying settings, labor-market tournaments, and
 R& races, among others. I provide an algorithm that constructs the unique
 equilibrium in these games and apply it to study competitions in which a
 fraction of each competitor's investment is sunk and the rest is paid only
 by the winners. Complete-information all-pay auctions are a special case.

Title: Social Preferences and Strategic Uncertainty: An Experiment on Markets and Contracts 
Abstract:
 This paper reports a three-phase experiment on a stylized labor market. In
 the first two phases, agents face simple games, which we use to estimate
 subjects' social and reciprocity concerns. In the last phase, four
 principals compete by offering agents a contract from a fixed menu. Then,
 agents "choose to work" for a principal by selecting one of the available
 contracts. We find that (i) (heterogeneous) social preferences are
 significant determinants of choices, (ii) for both principals and agents,
 strategic uncertainty aversion is a stronger determinant of choices than
 fairness, and (iii) agents display a marked propensity to work for
 principals with similar distributional concerns. (JEL D82, D86, J41)

Title: Exploiting Naivete about Self-Control in the Credit Market 
Abstract:
 We analyze contract choices, loan-repayment behavior, and welfare in a
 model of a competitive credit market when borrowers have a taste for
 immediate gratification. Consistent with many credit cards and subprime
 mortgages, for most types of nonsophisticated borrowers the baseline
 repayment terms are cheap,  but they are also inefficiently front loaded
 and delays require paying large penalties. Although credit is for future
 consumption, nonsophisticated consumers overborrow, pay the penalties, and
 back load repayment, suffering large welfare losses. Prohibiting large
 penalties for deferring small amounts of repayment--akin to recent
 regulations in the US credit-card and mortgage markets--can raise
 welfare. (JEL D14, D18, D49, D86)

Title: Inventories, Lumpy Trade, and Large Devaluations 
Abstract:
 We document that delivery lags and transaction-level economics of scale
 matter for international trade, leading importers to import infrequently
 and hold additional inventory. In a model with these frictions calibrated
 to empirical measures of inventory and trade lumpiness, these frictions
 have a large (20 percent) tariff equivalent, mostly due to inventory
 carrying costs. These frictions also alter the dynamics of imports and
 prices. Consistent with evidence from large devaluation episodes in six
 developing economies, following terms-of-trade and interest  rate shocks,
 the model generates a short-term implosion of imports and a gradual
 increase in the retail price of imports. (JEL D92, F14, G31, L81, M11)

Title: Do We Follow Others When We Should? A Simple Test of Rational Expectations 
Abstract:
 The paper presents a meta dataset covering 13 experiments on social
 learning games. It is found that in situations where it is empirically
 optimal to follow others and contradict one's own information, the players
 err in the majority of cases, forgoing substantial parts of earnings. The
 average player contradicts her own signal only if the empirical odds ratio
 of the own signal being wrong, conditional on all available information,
 is larger than 2:1, rather than 1:1 as would be implied by rational
 expectations. A regression analysis formulates a straightforward test of
 rational expectations which strongly rejects the null. (JEL D82, D83, D84)

Title: Persuasion by Cheap Talk 
Abstract:
 We consider the credibility, persuasiveness, and informativeness of
 multidimensional cheap talk by an expert to a decision maker. We find that
 an expert with state-independent preferences can always make credible
 comparative statements that trade off the expert's incentive to exaggerate
 on each dimension. Such communication benefits the expert--cheap talk
 is "persuasive"--if her preferences are quasiconvex. Communication
 benefits a decision maker by allowing for a more informed decision, but
 strategic interactions between multiple decision  makers can reverse this
 gain. We apply these results to topics including product recommendations,
 voting, auction disclosure, and advertising. (JEL D44, D72, D82, D83, M37)

Title: Can Higher Prices Stimulate Product Use? Evidence from a Field Experiment in Zambia 
Abstract:
 The controversy over how much to charge for health products in the
 developing  world rests, in part, on whether higher prices can increase
 use, either by targeting distribution to high-use households (a screening
 effect), or by stimulating use psychologically through a sunk-cost effect.
 We develop a methodology for separating these two effects. We implement
 the methodology in a field experiment in Zambia using door-to-door
 marketing of a home water purification solution. We find evidence of
 economically important screening effects. By contrast, we find no
 consistent evidence of sunk-cost effects. (JEL C93, D12, I11, M31, O12)

Title: Inheritance Law and Investment in Family Firms 
Abstract:
 Entrepreneurs may be legally bound to bequeath a minimal stake to
 noncontrolling heirs. The size of this stake can reduce investment in
 family firms, by reducing the future income they can pledge to external
 financiers. Using a purpose-built indicator of the permissiveness of
 inheritance law and data for 10,004 firms from 38 countries in 1990-2006,
 we find that stricter inheritance law is associated with lower investment
 in family firms but does not affect investment in nonfamily firms.
 Moreover, as the model predicts, inheritance law affects investment only
 in family firms that experience a succession. (JEL G31, G32, K22, L26,

Title: Binary Payment Schemes: Moral Hazard and Loss Aversion 
Abstract:
 We modify the principal-agent model with moral hazard by assuming that the
  agent is expectation-based loss averse according to Koszegi and
 Rabin (2006, 2007). The optimal contract is a binary payment scheme even
 for a rich performance measure, where standard preferences predict a fully
 contingent contract. The logic is that, due to the stochastic reference
 point, increasing the number of different wages reduces the agent's
 expected utility without providing strong additional incentives. Moreover,
 for diminutive occurrence probabilities for all signals the agent is
 rewarded with the fixed bonus if his performance exceeds a certain
 threshold. (JEL D82, D86, J41, M52, M12)

 communication. The data support our main predictions: (1) horizontal,
 averaging structures are more ethical than vertical structures (where
 subordinates do not feel responsible) and than consensual structures
 (where responsibility is dynamically diffused); (2) communication makes
 vertical structures more ethical (subordinates with voice feel
 responsible); (3) with communication, vertical structures are more ethical
 than consensual structures (where in-group bias hurts the outsider). (JEL

Title: Doing Well by Doing Good? Green Office Buildings 
Abstract:
 This paper provides the first credible evidence on the economic value of
 "green buildings" derived from impersonal market transactions rather than
 engineering estimates. We analyze clusters of certified green and nearby
 buildings, establishing that "rated" buildings command substantially
 higher rents and selling prices than otherwise identical buildings.
 Variations in premiums are systematically related to energy-saving
 characteristics. Increased energy efficiency is associated with increased
 selling prices -- beyond the premiums paid for a labeled building.
 Evidence suggests that the intangible effects of the label itself may also
 play a role in determining the values of green buildings in the
 marketplace. (JEL G31, M14, Q52, R33)

Title: Real Business Cycles in Emerging Countries? 
Abstract:
 We use more than a century of Argentine and Mexican data to estimate the
 structural parameters of a small-open-economy real-business-cycle model
 driven by nonstationary productivity shocks. We find that the RBC model
 does a poor job of explaining business cycles in emerging countries. We
 then estimate an augmented model that incorporates shocks to the country
 premium and financial frictions. We find that the estimated
 financial-friction model provides a remarkably good account of business
 cycles in emerging markets and, importantly, assigns a negligible role to
 nonstationary productivity shocks. (JEL E13, E32, E44, F43, O11, O16)

Title: Negative Marginal Tax Rates and Heterogeneity 
Abstract:
 Heterogeneity is an important determinant of the shape of optimal tax
 schemes. This is shown here in a model a la Mirrlees. The agents
 differ in their productivities and opportunity costs of work, but their
 labor supplies depend only on a given unidimensional combination of these
 two characteristics. Conditions are provided under which marginal tax
 rates are everywhere nonnegative. This is the case when work opportunity
 costs are distributed independently of income. But one can also get
 negative marginal tax rates, in particular at the bottom of the income
 distribution. A numerical illustration is given, based on UK data. (JEL

Title: Psychological Pressure in Competitive Environments: Evidence from a Randomized Natural Experiment 
Abstract:
 Emotions can have important effects on performance and socioeconomic
 outcomes. We study a natural experiment where two teams of professionals
 compete in a tournament taking turns in a sequence. As the sequential
 order is determined by the random outcome of a coin flip, the treatment
 and control groups are determined via explicit randomization. Hence,
 absent any psychological effects, both teams should have the same
 probability of winning. Yet, we find a systematic first-mover advantage.
 Further, professionals are self-aware of their own psychological effects
 and, when given the chance, they rationally react by systematically taking
 advantage of these effects. (JEL C93, D03, D82, L83)
