Title: The Economic History of the <em>American Economic Review</em>: A Century's Explosion of Economics Research 
Abstract:
 Written in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the <em>American
 Economic Review</em>, this paper recounts the history of the journal. The
 recounting has an analytic core that sees the American Economic
 Association as an organization supplying goods and services to its
 members, one of which is the <em>Review</em>. Early in its history the
 <em>Review</em> was a multipurpose publication with highly disparate
 content. Over time the economics profession expanded and more economics
 research was produced, primarily in the form of journal articles. Editors
 accommodated this shift by allocating more resources to the refereeing and
 editing process and more space to research papers. (JEL A14, B19, B29)

Title: Reflections on "Some Unsettled Problems of Irrigation" 
Abstract:
 It is instructive to read the article that Katharine Coman published in
 the first issue of the American Economic Review to gain insight into the
 problems of collective action related to irrigation in the American West.
 One gains further understanding of the problems Coman identifies by using
 a social-ecological system (Ostrom 2007, 2009) to organize the diverse
 variables identified by Coman. One gains a general lesson from this
 analysis that changing the formal governance structure of irrigation is
 not sufficient to ensure efficient investment in facilities or that
 farmers are able to acquire property and make a reasonable living.
 Building knowledge and trust are, however, essential for solving
 collective-action problems. (JEL B31, N51, Q15, Q25)

Title: Institutional Path Dependence in Climate Adaptation: Coman's "Some Unsettled Problems of Irrigation" 
Abstract:
 Katharine Coman's "Some Unsettled Problems of Irrigation," published in
 March 1911 in the first issue of the <em>American Economic Review</em>,
 addressed issues of water supply, rights, and organization. These same
 issues have relevance today, in the face of growing concern about the
 availability of fresh water worldwide. The central point of this article
 is that appropriative water rights and irrigation districts that emerged
 in the American West in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
 in response to aridity to facilitate agricultural water delivery, use, and
 trade raise the transaction costs today of water markets. These markets
 are vital for smooth reallocation of water to higher-valued uses elsewhere
 in the economy and for flexible response to greater hydrological
 uncertainty. This institutional path dependence illustrates how past
 arrangements to meet conditions of the time constrain contemporary
 economic opportunities. They cannot be easily significantly modified or
 replaced ex post. (JEL N51, Q15, Q25, Q54)

Title: The Problem of the Commons: Still Unsettled after 100 Years 
Abstract:
 The problem of the commons is more important to our lives and thus more
 central to economics than a century ago when Katharine Coman led off the
 first issue of the American Economic Review. As the US and other economies
 have grown, the carrying capacity of the planet--in regard to natural
 resources and environmental quality--has become a greater concern,
 particularly for common-property and open-access resources. The focus of
 this article is on some important, unsettled problems of the commons.
 Within the realm of natural resources, there are special challenges
 associated with renewable resources, which are frequently characterized by
 open-access. An important example is the degradation of openaccess
 fisheries. Critical commons problems are also associated with
 environmental quality. A key contribution of economics has been the
 development of market-based approaches to environmental protection. These
 instruments are key to addressing the ultimate commons problem of the
 twenty-first century-global climate change. (JEL Q15, Q21, Q22, Q25, Q54)

Title: Two Illustrations of the Quantity Theory of Money: Breakdowns and Revivals 
Abstract:
 By extending his data, we document the instability of low-frequency
 regression coefficients that Lucas (1980) used to express the quantity
 theory of money. We impute the differences in these regression
 coefficients to differences in monetary policies across periods. A DSGE
 model estimated over a subsample like Lucas's implies values of the
 regression coefficients that confirm Lucas's results for his sample
 period. But perturbing monetary policy rule parameters away from the
 values estimated over Lucas's subsample alters the regression coefficients
 in ways that reproduce their instability over our longer sample. (JEL C51,

Title: Is Tiger Woods Loss Averse? Persistent Bias in the Face of Experience, Competition, and High Stakes 
Abstract:
 Although experimental studies have documented systematic decision errors,
 many leading scholars believe that experience, competition, and large
 stakes will reliably extinguish biases. We test for the presence of a
 fundamental bias, loss aversion, in a high-stakes context: professional
 golfers' performance on the PGA Tour. Golf provides a natural setting to
 test for loss aversion because golfers are rewarded for the total number
 of strokes they take during a tournament, yet each individual hole has a
 salient reference point, par. We analyze over 2.5 million putts using
 precise laser measurements and find evidence that even the best
 golfers--including Tiger Woods--show evidence of loss aversion. (JEL D03,

Title: The Effect of Female Education on Fertility and Infant Health: Evidence from School Entry Policies Using Exact Date of Birth 
Abstract:
 This paper uses age-at-school-entry policies to identify the effect of
 female education on fertility and infant health. We focus on sharp
 contrasts in schooling, fertility, and infant health between women born
 just before and after the school entry date. School entry policies affect
 female education and the quality of a woman's mate and have generally
 small, but possibly heterogeneous, effects on fertility and infant health.
 We argue that school entry policies manipulate primarily the education of
 young women at risk of dropping out of school. (JEL I12, I21, J13, J16)

Title: Growing Like China 
Abstract:
 We construct a growth model consistent with China's economic transition:
 high output growth, sustained returns on capital, reallocation within the
 manufacturing sector, and a large trade surplus. Entrepreneurial firms use
 more productive technologies, but due to financial imperfections they must
 finance investments through internal savings. State-owned firms have low
 productivity but survive because of better access to credit markets.
 High-productivity firms outgrow low-productivity firms if entrepreneurs
 have sufficiently high savings. The downsizing of financially integrated
 firms forces domestic savings to be invested abroad, generating a foreign
 surplus. A calibrated version of the theory accounts quantitatively for
 China's economic transition. (JEL E21, E22, E23, F43, L60, O16, O53, P23,

Title: Reference Prices, Costs, and Nominal Rigidities 
Abstract:
 We assess the importance of nominal rigidities using a new weekly scanner
 dataset. We find that nominal rigidities take the form of inertia in
 reference prices and costs, defined as the most common prices and costs
 within a given quarter. Reference prices are particularly inertial and
 have an average duration of roughly one year, even though weekly prices
 change roughly once every two weeks. We document the relation between
 prices and costs and find sharp evidence of state dependence in prices. We
 use a simple model to argue that reference prices and costs are useful
 statistics for macroeconomic analysis. (JEL L11, L25, L81)

Title: Bundle-Size Pricing as an Approximation to Mixed Bundling 
Abstract:
 Multiproduct firms can set separate prices for all possible bundled
 combinations of its products "mixed bundling"). However, this is
 impractical for firms with more than a few products, because the number of
 prices increases exponentially with the number of products. We find that
 simple pricing strategies are often nearly optimal. Specifically, we show
 that bundle-size pricing--setting prices that depend only on the size of
 bundle purchased--tends to be more profitable than offering the individual
 products priced separately and tends to closely approximate the profits
 from mixed bundling. (JEL D24, D42, L11, L13, L25)

Title: Trade Liberalization, Exports, and Technology Upgrading: Evidence on the Impact of MERCOSUR on Argentinian Firms 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the impact of a regional free trade agreement,
 MERCOSUR, on technology upgrading by Argentinean firms. To guide empirical
 work, I introduce technology choice in a model of trade with heterogeneous
 firms. The joint treatment of the technology and exporting choices shows
 that the increase in revenues produced by trade integration can induce
 exporters to upgrade technology. An empirical test of the model reveals
 that firms in industries facing higher reductions in Brazil's tariffs
 increase investment in technology faster. The effect of tariffs is highest
 in the upper-middle range of the firm-size distribution, as predicted by
 the model. (JEL F13, F15, O19, O24, O33)

Title: Monetary Policy, Trend Inflation, and the Great Moderation: An Alternative Interpretation 
Abstract:
 With positive trend inflation, the Taylor principle does not guarantee a
 determinate equilibrium. We provide new theoretical results on determinacy
 in New Keynesian models with positive trend inflation and new empirical
 findings on the Federal Reserve's reaction function before and after the
 Volcker disinflation to find that, (i) while the Fed likely satisfied the
 Taylor principle before Volcker, the US economy was still subject to
 self-fulfilling fluctuations in the 1970s, (ii) the US economy switched to
 determinacy during the Volcker disinflation, and (iii) the switch
 reflected changes in the Fed's response to macroeconomic variables and the
 decline in trend inflation. (JEL E12, E23, E31, E32, E52)

Title: Inflation and Unemployment in the Long Run 
Abstract:
 We study the long-run relation between money (inflation or interest rates)
 and unemployment. We document positive relationships between these
 variables at low frequencies. We develop a framework where money and
 unemployment are modeled using explicit microfoundations, providing a
 unified theory to analyze labor and goods markets. We calibrate the model
 and ask how monetary factors account for labor market behavior. We can
 account for a sizable fraction of the increase in unemployment rates
 during the 1970s. We show how it matters whether one uses monetary theory
 based on the search-and-bargaining approach or on an ad hoc
 cash-in-advance constraint. (JEL E24, E31, E41, E43, E52)

Title: Resolving Conflicting Preferences in School Choice: The "Boston Mechanism" Reconsidered 
Abstract:
 Despite its widespread use, the Boston mechanism has been criticized for
 its poor incentive and welfare performances compared to the Gale-Shapley
 deferred acceptance algorithm (DA). By contrast, when students have the
 same ordinal preferences and schools have no priorities, we find that the
 Boston mechanism Pareto dominates the DA in ex ante welfare, that it may
 not harm but rather benefit participants who may not strategize well, and
 that, in the presence of school priorities, the Boston mechanism also
 tends to facilitate greater access than the DA to good schools for those
 lacking priorities at those schools. (JEL D82, I21, I28)

Title: The Evolution of Cooperation in Infinitely Repeated Games: Experimental Evidence 
Abstract:
 A usual criticism of the theory of infinitely repeated games is that it
 does not provide sharp predictions since there may be a multiplicity of
 equilibria. To address this issue, we present experimental evidence on the
 evolution of cooperation in infinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma games
 as subjects gain experience. We show that cooperation may prevail in
 infinitely repeated games, but the conditions under which this occurs are
 more stringent than the subgame perfect conditions usually considered or
 even a condition based on risk dominance. (JEL C71, C73)
