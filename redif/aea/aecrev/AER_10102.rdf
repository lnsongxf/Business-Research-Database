Title: The Long Slump 
Abstract:
 In a market-clearing economy, declines in demand from one sector do not
 cause large declines in aggregate output because other sectors expand. The
 key price mediating the response is the interest rate. A decline in the
 rate stimulates all categories of spending. But in a low-inflation
 economy, the room for a decline in the rate is small, because of the
 notorious lower limit of zero on the nominal interest rate. In the Great
 Depression, substantial deflation caused the real interest rate to reach
 high levels. In the Great Slump that began at the end of 2007, low
 inflation resulted in an only slightly negative real rate when full
 employment called for a much lower real rate because of declines in
 demand. Fortunately, the inflation rate hardly responded to conditions in
 product and labor markets, else deflation might have occurred, with an
 even higher real interest rate. I concentrate on three closely related
 sources of declines in demand: the buildup of excess stocks of housing and
 consumer durables, the corresponding expansion of consumer debt that
 financed the buildup, and financial frictions that resulted from the
 decline in real-estate prices. (JEL E23, E24, E31, E32, E65)

Title: Reference Points and Effort Provision 
Abstract:
 A key open question for theories of reference-dependent preferences is:
 what determines the reference point? One candidate is expectations: what
 people expect could affect how they feel about what actually occurs. In a
 real-effort experiment, we manipulate the rational expectations of
 subjects and check whether this manipulation influences their effort
 provision. We find that effort provision is significantly different
 between treatments in the way predicted by models of expectation-based,
 reference-dependent preferences: if expectations are high, subjects work
 longer and earn more money than if expectations are low. (JEL D12, D84,

Title: Contracts as Reference Points--Experimental Evidence 
Abstract:
 Hart and John Moore (2008) introduce new behavioral assumptions that can
 explain long-term contracts and the employment relation. We examine
 experimentally their idea that contracts serve as reference points. The
 evidence confirms the prediction that there is a trade-off between
 rigidity and flexibility. Flexible contracts--which would dominate rigid
 contracts under standard assumptions--cause significant shading in ex post
 performance, while under rigid contracts much less shading occurs. The
 experiment appears to reveal a new behavioral force: ex ante competition
 legitimizes the terms of a contract, and aggrievement and shading occur
 mainly about outcomes within the contract. (JEL D44, D86, J41)

Title: The Economics of Credence Goods: An Experiment on the Role of Liability, Verifiability, Reputation, and Competition 
Abstract:
 Credence goods markets are characterized by asymmetric information between
 sellers and consumers that may give rise to inefficiencies, such as under-
 and overtreatment or market breakdown. We study in a large experiment with
 936 participants the determinants for efficiency in credence goods
 markets. While theory predicts that liability or verifiability yield
 efficiency, we find that liability has a crucial, but verifiability at
 best a minor, effect. Allowing sellers to build up reputation has little
 influence, as predicted. Seller competition drives down prices and yields
 maximal trade, but does not lead to higher efficiency as long as liability
 is violated. (JEL D12, D82)

Title: Performance Pay and Multidimensional Sorting: Productivity, Preferences, and Gender 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the impact of incentives on worker self-selection in a
 controlled laboratory experiment. Subjects face the choice between a fixed
 and a variable payment scheme. Depending on the treatment, the variable
 payment is a piece rate, a tournament, or a revenue-sharing scheme. We
 find that output is higher in the variable-payment schemes compared to the
 fixed-payment scheme. This difference is largely driven by productivity
 sorting. In addition, different incentive schemes systematically attract
 individuals with different attitudes, such as willingness to take risks
 and relative self-assessment as well as gender, which underlines the
 importance of multidimensional sorting. (JEL C91, D81, D82, J16, J31)

Title: Are Risk Preferences Stable across Contexts? Evidence from Insurance Data 
Abstract:
 Using a unique dataset, we test whether households' deductible choices in
 auto and home insurance reflect stable risk preferences. Our test relies
 on a structural model that assumes households are objective expected
 utility maximizers and claims are generated by household-coverage specific
 Poisson processes. We find that the hypothesis of stable risk preferences
 is rejected by the data. Our analysis suggests that many households
 exhibit greater risk aversion in their home deductible choices than their
 auto deductible choices. Our results are robust to several alternative
 modeling assumptions. (JEL D11, D83)

Title: Collaborating 
Abstract:
 This paper examines moral hazard in teams over time. Agents are
 collectively engaged in a project whose duration and outcome are
 uncertain, and their individual efforts are unobserved. Free-riding leads
 not only to a reduction in effort, but also to procrastination.
 Collaboration among agents dwindles over time, but does not cease as long
 as the project has not succeeded. In addition, the delay until the project
 succeeds, if it ever does, increases with the number of agents. We show
 why deadlines, but not necessarily better monitoring, help to mitigate
 moral hazard. (JEL D81, D82, D83)

Title: Heterogeneity in Risky Choice Behavior in a Broad Population 
Abstract:
 We analyze risk preferences using an experiment with real incentives in a
 representative sample of 1,422 Dutch respondents. Our econometric model
 incorporates four structural parameters that vary with observed and
 unobserved characteristics: utility curvature, loss aversion, preferences
 toward the timing of uncertainty resolution, and the propensity to choose
 randomly rather than on the basis of preferences. We find that all four
 parameters contribute to explaining choice behavior. The structural
 parameters are significantly associated with socioeconomic variables, but
 it is essential to incorporate unobserved heterogeneity in each of them to
 match the rich variety of choice patterns in the data. (JEL D12, D81)

Title: The Rich Domain of Uncertainty: Source Functions and Their Experimental Implementation 
Abstract:
 We often deal with uncertain events for which no probabilities are known.
 Several normative models have been proposed. Descriptive studies have
 usually been qualitative, or they estimated ambiguity aversion through one
 single number. This paper introduces the source method, a tractable method
 for quantitatively analyzing uncertainty empirically. The theoretical key
 is the distinction between different sources of uncertainty, within which
 subjective (choice-based) probabilities can still be defined. Source
 functions convert those subjective probabilities into willingness to bet.
 We apply our method in an experiment, where we do not commit to particular
 ambiguity attitudes but let the data speak. (JEL D81)

Title: Procedural Analysis of Choice Rules with Applications to Bounded Rationality 
Abstract:
 I study how limited abilities to process information affect choice
 behavior. I model the decision-making process by an automaton, and measure
 the complexity of a specific choice rule by the minimal number of states
 an automaton implementing the rule uses to process information. I
 establish that any choice rule that is less complicated than utility
 maximization displays framing effects. I then prove that choice rules that
 result from an optimal trade-off between maximizing utility and minimizing
 complexity are history-dependent satisficing procedures that display
 primacy and recency effects. (JEL D01, D03, D11, D83)

Title: The Bidder's Curse 
Abstract:
 We employ a novel approach to identify overbidding in auctions. We compare
 online auction prices to fixed prices for the same item on the same
 webpage. In detailed data on auctions of a board game, 42 percent of
 auctions exceed the simultaneous fixed price. The result replicates in a
 broad cross-section of auctions (48 percent overbidding). A small fraction
 of overbidders, 17 percent of bidders, suffices to generate the large
 fraction of auctions with overbidding. We show that the observed behavior
 is inconsistent with rational behavior, even allowing for uncertainty
 about prices and switching costs, since the expected auction price also
 exceeds the fixed price. Limited attention best explains our results. (JEL

Title: Falsifiability 
Abstract:
 We examine Popper's falsifiability within an economic model in which a
 tester hires a potential expert to produce a theory. Payments are
 contingent on the performance of the theory vis-a-vis data. We show that
 if experts are strategic, falsifiability has no power to distinguish
 scientific theories from worthless theories. The failure of falsification
 in screening informed and uninformed experts motivates questions on the
 broader concepts of refutation and verification. We demonstrate an
 asymmetry between the two concepts. Like falsification, verification
 contracts have no power to distinguish between informed and uninformed
 experts, but some refutation contracts are capable of screening experts.

Title: Deferred Compensation in Multiperiod Labor Contracts: An Experimental Test of Lazear's Model 
Abstract:
 This paper provides the first experimental test of Edward Lazear's (1979)
 model of deferred compensation. We examine the relationship between firms'
 wage offers and workers' effort supply in a multi-period environment. If
 firms can ex ante commit to a wage schedule with deferred compensation,
 workers should respond by supplying sufficient effort to avoid dismissal.
 We contrast this full-commitment case to controls with no commitment and
 computer-generated wages in order to examine the roles of monetary
 incentives, social preferences, and reciprocity. Finally, we examine a
 setup without formal commitment, but where firms can build a reputation
 for paying deferred wages. (JEL D86, J22, J31, J33, J41)

Title: Sales and Monetary Policy 
Abstract:
 A striking fact about pricing is the prevalence of "sales": large
 temporary price cuts followed by prices returning to exactly their former
 levels. This paper builds a macroeconomic model with a rationale for sales
 based on firms facing customers with different price sensitivities. Even
 if firms can adjust sales without cost, monetary policy has large real
 effects owing to sales being strategic substitutes: a firm's incentive to
 have a sale is decreasing in the number of other firms having sales. Thus
 the flexibility seen in individual prices due to sales does not translate
 into flexibility of the aggregate price level. (JEL E13, E31, E52, L11,

Title: The Cyclical Behavior of Debt and Equity Finance 
Abstract:
 Debt and equity issuance are procyclical for most size-sorted firm
 categories of listed US firms and the procyclicality of equity issuance
 decreases monotonically with firm size. At the aggregate level, however,
 the results for equity issuance are not conclusive due to different
 behavior of the largest firms, especially those in the top one percent.
 During a deterioration in economic conditions, firms limit the impact of
 the reduction in external financing on investment by shedding financial
 assets. This is true for a worsening in aggregate as well as firm-specific
 conditions. (JEL E32, G32, L11, L25)

 the search process that combines features of optimal search and
 satisficing, and that subjects search more often in certain focal regions

Title: Coordination in the Presence of Asset Markets 
Abstract:
 We explore the relationship between outcomes in a coordination game and a
 pre-play asset market where asset values are determined by outcomes in the
 subsequent coordination game. Across two experiments, we vary the payoffs
 from the market relative to the game, the degree of interdependence in the
 game, and whether traders' asset payoffs are dependent on outcomes in
 their own or another game. Markets lead to significantly lower efficiency
 across treatments, even when they produce no distortion of incentives in
 the game. Market prices forecast game outcomes. Our experiments shed light
 on how financial markets may influence affiliated economic outcomes. (JEL

Title: Real-Time Search in the Laboratory and the Market 
Abstract:
 While widely accepted labor market search models imply a constant
 reservation wage policy, empirical evidence strongly suggests that
 reservation wages decline in search duration. This paper reports the
 results of the first real-time-search laboratory experiment. The
 controlled environment subjects face is stationary, and the
 payoff-maximizing reservation wage is constant. Nevertheless, subjects'
 reservation wages decline sharply over time. We investigate two hypotheses
 to explain this decline: 1. Searchers respond to the stock of accruing
 search costs. 2. Searchers experience non-stationary subjective costs of
 time spent searching. Our data support the latter hypothesis, and we
 substantiate this conclusion both experimentally and econometrically. (JEL

Title: Checkmate: Exploring Backward Induction among Chess Players 
Abstract:
 Although backward induction is a cornerstone of game theory, most
 laboratory experiments have found that agents are not able to successfully
 backward induct. We analyze the play of world-class chess players in the
 centipede game, which is ill-suited for testing backward induction, and in
 pure backward induction games--Race to 100 games. We find that chess
 players almost never play the backward induction equilibrium in the
 centipede game, but many properly backward induct in the Race to 100
 games. We find no systematic within-subject relationship between choices
 in the centipede game and performance in pure backward induction games.

Title: The Willingness to Pay&#8212;Willingness to Accept Gap, the "Endowment Effect," Subject Misconceptions, and Experimental Procedures for Eliciting Valuations: Comment 
Abstract:
 Plott and Zeiler (2005) report that the
 willingness-to-pay/willingness-to-accept disparity is absent for mugs in a
 particular experimental setting, designed to neutralize misconceptions
 about the procedures used to elicit valuations. This result has received
 sustained attention in the literature. However, other data from that same
 study, not published in that paper, exhibit a significant and persistent
 disparity when the same experimental procedures are applied to lotteries.
 We report new data confirming both results, thereby suggesting that the
 presence or absence of a disparity may be a more complex issue than some
 may have supposed. (JEL C91, D12, D81, D83)

Title: The Willingness to Pay--Willingness to Accept Gap, the "Endowment Effect," Subject Misconceptions, and Experimental Procedures for Eliciting Valuations: Reply 
Abstract:
 Isoni, Loomes, and Sugden (2011) assert that Plott and Zeiler (2005)
 reported inaccurate results. Placing ILS's selective quotes into context
 demonstrates otherwise. Additionally, examining the data closely yields
 three conclusions. First, all mug data reject endowment effect theory.
 Second, lottery gaps are associated with unstable attitudes toward
 uncertainty, a finding consistent with PZ's (2005) lottery data
 description, explicit warnings about procedure limitations and the data
 supplement, which reports the lottery data and cautions. Third, lottery
 outcome beliefs are influenced by whether WTP or WTA is reported,
 suggesting that changing beliefs, as opposed to the shape of preferences,
 produce lottery gaps. (JEL C91)

Title: Stationary Concepts for Experimental 2 X 2 Games: Comment 
Abstract:
 Reinhard Selten and Thorsten Chmura (2008) recently reported laboratory
 results for completely mixed 2 X 2 games used to compare Nash equilibrium
 with four other stationary concepts: quantal response equilibrium,
 action-sampling equilibrium, payoff-sampling equilibrium, and impulse
 balance equilibrium. We reanalyze their data, correct some errors, and
 find that Nash clearly fits worst while the four other concepts perform
 about equally well. We also report new analysis of other previous
 experiments that illustrate the importance of the loss aversion hardwired
 into impulse balance equilibrium: when the other non-Nash concepts are
 augmented with loss aversion, they outperform impulse balance equilibrium.

Title: Stationary Concepts for Experimental 2 X 2 Games: Reply 
Abstract:
 This is a reply to "Stationary Concepts for Experimental 2 X 2 Games:
 Comment" by Brunner, Camerer, and Goeree which corrects some computational
 errors in Selten and Chmura (2008) and extends the comparison of five
 stationary concepts to data from previous experimental studies. We
 critically discuss their new findings and relate them to the data of
 Selten and Chmura (2008). We conclude that the parametric concepts of
 action-sampling equilibrium and payoff-sampling equilibrium perform better
 than quantal response equilibrium, and that the non-parametric concept of
 impulse-balance equilibrium performs at least as well as quantal response
 equilibrium. (JEL C70)
