Title: International Migration and Gender Discrimination among Children Left Behind 
Abstract:
 This paper considers how international migration of the head of household
 affects the allocation of resources toward boys relative to girls within
 households remaining in the home country. I address the endogeneity of
 migration with a differences-in-differences style regression model that
 compares those households in which migrants have already returned home
 with those in which migrants are still away. The evidence suggests that
 while the head of household is away a greater fraction of resources are
 spent on girls relative to boys, but upon his return, this pattern is
 reversed.

Title: Have Gender Gaps in Insurance Coverage and Access to Care Narrowed under Health Reform? Findings from Massachusetts 
Abstract:
 Under its health reform legislation, Massachusetts has achieved near
 universal insurance coverage, along with significant gains in health care
 access and affordability. This paper examines the impacts of health reform
 in Massachusetts on differences in coverage, access, and affordability for
 women and men. We find that both women and men gained under health reform,
 with the gender gap in insurance coverage narrowed as men's coverage
 increased relative to that of women. However, the gaps in access and
 affordability of care have not narrowed--women in Massachusetts continue
 to report more unmet need for care and problems affording care than men.

Title: Chipping Away at the Glass Ceiling: Gender Spillovers in Corporate Leadership 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the role of women helping women in corporate America.
 Using a merged panel of directors and executives for large US corporations
 between 1997 and 2009, we find a positive association between the female
 share of the board of directors in the previous year and the female share
 among current top executives. The relationship's timing suggests that
 causality runs from boards to managers and not the reverse. This pattern
 of women helping women at the highest levels of firm leadership highlights
 the continued importance of a demand-side "glass ceiling" in explaining
 the slow progress of women in business.

Title: Compensating Differentials for Sexual Harassment 
Abstract:
 Workplace sexual harassment is illegal, but many workers report that they
 have been sexually harassed. Exposure to the risk of sexual harassment may
 decrease productivity, which would reduce wages. Alternatively, workers
 may receive a compensating differential for exposure to sexual harassment,
 which would increase wages. Data on claims of sexual harassment filed with
 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission are used to calculate the
 first measures of sexual harassment risks by industry, age group, and sex.
 Female workers face far higher sexual harassment risks. On balance,
 workers receive a compensating wage differential for exposure to the risk
 of sexual harassment.

Title: Estimating the Willingness to Pay to Avoid Violent Crime: A Dynamic Approach 
Abstract:
 The hedonic model, which has been used extensively in the Environmental,
 Urban, and Real Estate literatures, allows for the estimation of the
 implicit prices of housing and neighborhood attributes, as well as
 households' demand for these non-marketed amenities. A recognized drawback
 of the existing hedonic literature is that the models assume a myopic
 decision-maker. In this paper, we estimate a dynamic hedonic model and
 find that the average household is willing to pay $472 per year for a ten
 percent reduction in violent crime. In addition, we find that the
 traditional, myopic model suffers from a 21 percent negative bias.

Title: House Prices and Marital Stability 
Abstract:
 We investigate the effect of house price changes on divorce using data for
 1991-2010 from the Current Population Survey and the Federal Housing
 Finance Agency. Our findings suggest that changing house prices
 significantly affect the share of a cohort that is divorced, and that
 these effects are asymmetric with respect to housing gains versus losses.
 In addition, we find differential effects for groups that are more likely
 to be homeowners versus renters. Some of this evidence is consistent with
 homeowners being locked into their homes--and hence marriages--by
 increased transactions costs in down markets.

Title: Hazardous Waste Cleanup, Neighborhood Gentrification, and Environmental Justice: Evidence from Restricted Access Census Block Data 
Abstract:
 We test for residential sorting and changes in neighborhood
 characteristics in response to the cleanup of hazardous waste sites using
 restricted access fine-geographical-resolution block data. We examine
 changes between 1990 and 2000 in blocks within 5km of sites that are
 proposed to the National Priority List that fall in a narrow interval of
 Hazardous Ranking Scores, comparing blocks near sites that were cleaned
 with those near sites that were not. Cleanup leads to increases in
 population density and housing unit density; increases in mean household
 income and shares of college-educated; but also to increases in the shares
 of minorities.

Title: Owner-Occupied Housing: Life-Cycle Implications for the Household Portfolio 
Abstract:
 The paper constructs a model of optimal portfolio allocation incorporating
 the role of housing as collateral. Current house value is a state variable
 in the portfolio decision due to a nonconvex adjustment cost. Holding risk
 aversion constant, the percentage of the portfolio held in stocks is
 decreasing in the ratio of house value to net wealth; thus an older
 household with a lower ratio of house value to net wealth will generally
 hold more its portfolio in stocks than younger households. Empirical
 results using the Survey of Consumer Finances confirm the quantitative and
 statistical significance of the housing state variable.

Title: Tracking Intergenerational Progress for Immigrant Groups: The Problem of Ethnic Attrition 
Abstract:
 In tracking the later-generation descendants of immigrants, measurement
 biases can arise from "ethnic attrition" (e.g., US-born individuals who do
 not self-identify as Mexican despite having ancestors who immigrated from
 Mexico). We present evidence that such ethnic attrition is sizeable and
 selective for the third-generation populations of key Hispanic and Asian
 immigrant groups. In addition, our results suggest that ethnic attrition
 generates biases that vary across national origin groups in direction as
 well as magnitude, and that correcting for these biases will raise the
 socioeconomic standing of the US-born descendants of most Hispanic
 immigrants relative to their Asian counterparts.

Title: Estimating the Ex Ante Expected Returns to College 
Abstract:
 Rather than estimating the returns to obtaining a college degree, this
 paper treats the college education decision as an uncertain investment
 involving varying likelihoods of successful graduation. We predict
 earnings conditional on both graduating and not graduating from both
 selective and non-selective institutions, and incorporate estimated
 individual-specific graduation rates in calculating the ex ante expected
 returns from college attendance for individuals across the ability
 distribution. Our results suggest that, especially for lower ability
 students, ex ante returns may differ substantially from typical estimates
 of the returns to a college degree, and typical estimates of the
 selectivity premium may be underestimated.

Title: Does Mestizaje Matter in the US? Economic Stratification of Mexican Immigrants 
Abstract:
 Using data from the 2003 New Immigrant Survey, this paper examines whether
 stratification as reflected by skin shade exists among newly legalized
 Mexican immigrants in the US. While we do not find evidence that skin
 color directly related to employment probabilities, complexion appeared to
 play a role in the likelihood of owning a home, having a bank account, and
 occupational status. As these outcomes partly reflect immigrants'
 pre-migration experiences, our findings suggest that the social
 stratification structure in Mexico might be sustained in the US among
 Mexican-origin populations.

Title: Applying Fixed Effects to Hierarchical Segregation Models 
Abstract:
 This paper expands the empirical implementation of hierarchical
 segregation models to allow for the use of panel methods. We use firm
 level data collected between 1977 and 1985 from a regional grocery store
 that faced a title VII class-action lawsuit over gender discrimination
 much the same as Wal-Mart and Costco. Special problems arise in
 implementing decompositions in a fixed effects and random effects setting,
 especially when analyzing wage-level differences. We develop a variation
 of wage decompositions that takes into consideration an unbalanced design
 and extends the literature by explicitly formalizing the inclusion of the
 unobserved heterogeneous effects.

Title: Remittances and Income Smoothing 
Abstract:
 Due to inadequate savings and binding borrowing constraints, income
 volatility can make households in developing countries particularly
 susceptible to economic hardship. We examine the role of remittances in
 either alleviating or increasing household income volatility using Mexican
 household level data over the 2000 through 2008 period. We correct for
 reverse causality and endogeneity and find that while income smoothing
 does not appear to be the main motive for sending remittances in a
 non-negligible share of households, remittances do indeed smooth household
 income on average. Other variables surrounding income volatility are also
 considered and evaluated.

Title: Global Financial Crisis and Africa: Is the Impact Permanent or Transitory? Time Series Evidence from North Africa 
Abstract:
 We utilize time series tests with structural breaks to test for an adverse
 impact on economic growth rates in North Africa associated with the recent
 US financial crisis and global recession. One or two breaks are identified
 for each country, except for Morocco where no break is found, while breaks
 coincide with the 2008 financial crisis in only two of the six countries
 (Libya and Mauritania). These findings suggest that, in general, shocks
 from the recent financial crisis have only temporary effects on economic
 growth in these countries. Impulse response functions with breaks confirm
 these results. We conclude by suggesting explanations for these findings.

Title: The Impact of the Transatlantic Slave Trade on Ethnic Stratification in Africa 
Abstract:
 In the last 15 years, economists and economic historians have argued that
 Africa has undergone a "reversal of fortune" and that ethnic fragmentation
 is a significant cause of Africa's underdevelopment. In this article, we
 join these narratives by arguing that the transatlantic slave trade
 increased the degree of ethnic heterogeneity in Africa today. Using both
 correlational and causal instrumental variables analysis, we find an
 economically and statistically significant positive relationship between
 slave exports and ethnic heterogeneity. This relationship is robust to
 changes in the scheme for drawing ethnic boundaries and the choice of
 observational unit.

Title: Real Wage Index Numbers 
Abstract:
 Real wage index numbers have been used to measure movements in the
 standard of living of the typical worker. This paper describes some of
 these indicators for the United States and England. A new real wage index
 is proposed that resembles the sliding scale used to adjust wages in
 certain industries years ago. This new index is applied to US
 manufacturing industry and it implies a fall in real wages by about 40
 percent since 1960. Workers' distributional position in US manufacturing
 has deteriorated considerably.

Title: The Lerner Index of Monopoly Power: Origins and Uses 
Abstract:
 Abba Lerner's paper in the <em>Review of Economic Studies</em> (1934) is
 the source of what is now referred to as the Lerner Index of monopoly
 power. The Lerner Index has become the standard measure of monopoly power
 and one of the most widely cited indexes in the discipline of economics.
 This paper traces the origins of the index, sets out its strengths and
 weaknesses, and examines its role in antitrust enforcement. The Index is a
 better indicator of a firm's price-setting discretion than its ability to
 sustain monopoly prices.

Title: Origins of the Unemployment Rate: The Lasting Legacy of Measurement without Theory 
Abstract:
 The modern definition of unemployment emerged in the late 1930s from
 research conducted at the Works Progress Administration and the Census
 Bureau. According to this definition, people who are not working but
 actively searching for work are counted as unemployed. This concept was
 first used in the Enumerative Check Census, a follow-up sample for the
 1937 Census of Unemployment, and continued with the Monthly Report on the
 Labor Force survey, begun in December 1939 by the Works Progress
 Administration. A similar definition is now used to measure unemployment
 around the world.

Title: Flexible Estimation of Treatment Effect Parameters 
Abstract:
 A variety of identification strategies have a common cell structure, in
 which the observed heterogeneity of the regression defines a partition of
 the sample into cells. Typically in the presence of exogenous covariates
 that define the cell structure, identification assumptions are imposed
 conditional on each value of the covariate, or cell by cell. Treatment
 effects across cells are typically heterogeneous. Researchers might be
 interested in unconditional parameters which are the averaged treatment
 effects across the cells. Alternatively, treatment effects can be
 estimated more efficiently if researchers are willing to impose additional
 parametric and semiparametric structures on the heterogeneous treatment
 effects across cells.

Title: Oaxaca-Blinder as a Reweighting Estimator 
Abstract:
 The classic regression based estimator of counterfactual means studied by
 Ronald Oaxaca (1973) and Alan Blinder (1973) is shown to constitute a
 propensity score reweighting estimator based upon a linear model for the
 conditional odds of being treated.

Title: Robustness to Parametric Assumptions in Missing Data Models 
Abstract:
 We consider estimation of population averages when data are missing at
 random. If some cells contain few observations, there can be substantial
 gains from imposing parametric restrictions on the cell means, but there
 is also a danger of misspecification. We develop a simple empirical Bayes
 estimator, which combines parametric and unadjusted estimates of cell
 means in a data-driven way. We also consider ways to use knowledge of the
 form of the propensity score to increase robustness. We develop an
 empirical Bayes extension of a double robust estimator. In a small
 simulation study, the empirical Bayes estimators perform well. They are
 similar to fully nonparametric methods and robust to misspecification when
 cells are moderate to large in size, and when cells are small they
 maintain the benefits of parametric methods and can have lower sampling
 variance.

Title: Learn English, Not the Local Language! Ethnic Russians in the Baltic States 
Abstract:
 This paper analyzes the return to dominant language fluency for ethnic
 Russians in the Baltic States. We look at male workers using Estonian
 Labor Force Survey for years 2000-2010 and the 1998 wave of a panel of
 high-school graduates of 1982. The results indicate that the ethnic
 Russian men enjoy little income premium on their skills of the dominant
 language. We identify positive returns only in the low end of the income
 distribution and in public administration sector. Surprisingly, the
 returns to English fluency are far larger. These outcomes point toward
 segregation and discrimination at the upper-end hiring.

Title: Gender Gap in Performance under Competitive Pressure: Admissions to Czech Universities 
Abstract:
 Do women perform worse than equally able men in stressful competitive
 settings? We ask this question for competitions with a high
 payoff--admissions to tuition-free selective universities. With data on an
 entire cohort of Czech students graduating from secondary schools and
 applying to universities, we show that, compared to men of similar general
 skills and subject-of-study preferences, women perform similarly well when
 competition is less intense, but perform substantially worse (are less
 likely to be admitted) when applying to very selective universities.

Title: The Roma/Non-Roma Test Score Gap in Hungary 
Abstract:
 This paper documents and decomposes the test score gap between Roma and
 non-Roma 8th graders in Hungary in 2006. Our data connect national
 standardized test scores to an individual panel survey with detailed data
 on ethnicity and family background. The test score gap is approximately
 one standard deviation for both reading and mathematics, which is similar
 to the gap between African-American and White students of the same age
 group in the US in the 1980s. After accounting for on health, parenting,
 school fixed effects and family background, the gap disappears in reading
 and drops to 0.15 standard deviation in mathematics.

Abstract:
 We conduct a series of dictator games in which the status of the dictator
 relative to other players varies across treatments. Experiments are
 conducted in a conventional university lab and in villages in rural Kenya.
 We find that status is an important determinant of dictator game giving,

Title: The Weight of History on European Cultural Integration: A Gravity Approach 
Abstract:
 The cultural gravity model proposed in this paper uses micro-level survey
 data of 21,000 households to estimate the contribution to cultural
 heterogeneity of a long history of division between the Ottoman, Habsburg,
 Russian or Prussian Empires since the year 1300 in 21 European countries.
 By exploiting the variation in the duration of integration of localities
 in different empires, this paper sheds light on the influence of political
 integration on cultural integration and on the rate of cultural change.
 History matters and cultural values change very slowly: long lasting
 effects on social trust comes after 400 years of common imperial rule.

Title: Which Dimensions of Culture Matter for Long-Run Growth? 
Abstract:
 We present empirical evidence that, among a variety of cultural
 dimensions, the individualism-collectivism dimension, based on Hofstede's
 (2001) data, is the most important and robustly significant effect of
 culture on long run growth. Other dimensions that have a significant
 effect, albeit less robust, are generally strongly correlated with
 individualism and convey similar information. We found no significant or
 robust effect on growth from cultural dimensions that are independent from
 the individualism-collectivism cleavage.

Title: A Labor Supply Elasticity Accord? 
Abstract:
 A dispute about the size of the aggregate labor supply elasticity has been
 fortified by a contentious aggregation theory used by real business cycle
 theorists. The replacement of that aggregation theory with one more
 congenial to microeconomic observations opens possibilities for an accord
 about the aggregate labor supply elasticity. The new aggregation theory
 drops features to which empirical microeconomists objected and replaces
 them with life-cycle choices. Whether the new aggregation theory
 ultimately indicates a small or large macro labor supply elasticity will
 depend on how shocks and government institutions interact to put workers
 at interior solutions for career length.

Title: Labor Supply and the Extensive Margin 
Abstract:
 In this paper we propose a systematic way of examining the importance of
 the extensive and the intensive margins of labor supply in order to
 explain the overall movements in total hours of work over time. We show
 how informative bounds can be developed on each of these margins. We apply
 this analysis to the evolution of hours of work in the US, the UK, and
 France and show that both the extensive and intensive margins matter in
 explaining changes in total hours.

Title: Interpreting Labor Supply Regressions in a Model of Full- and Part-Time Work 
Abstract:
 We construct a family model of labor supply that features adjustment along
 both the intensive and extensive margin. Intensive margin adjsutment is
 restricted to two values: full-time work and part-time work. Using
 simulated data from the steady state of the calibrated model, we examine
 whether standard labor supply regressions can uncover the true value of
 the intertemporal elasticity of labor supply parameter. We find positive
 estimated elasticities that are larger for women and that are highly
 significant, but they bear virtually no relationship to the underlying
 preference parameters.

Title: Are Micro and Macro Labor Supply Elasticities Consistent? A Review of Evidence on the Intensive and Extensive Margins 
Abstract:
 We evaluate whether state-of-the-art macro models featuring indivisible
 labor are consistent with modern quasi-experimental micro evidence by
 synthesizing evidence on both the intensive and extensive margins. We find
 that micro estimates are consistent with macro estimates of the
 steady-state (Hicksian) elasticities relevant for cross-country
 comparisons on both the extensive and intensive margins. However, micro
 estimates of intertemporal substitution (Frisch) elasticities are an order
 of magnitude smaller than the values needed to explain business cycle
 fluctuations in aggregate hours by preferences. The key puzzle to be
 resolved is why micro and macro estimates of the Frisch extensive margin
 elasticity are so different.

Title: Negative Returns to Seniority and Job Mobility across the Program Quality Distribution: Are Top Public PhD-Granting Programs Different? 
Abstract:
 We analyze a unique data set containing annual salary and detailed job and
 publication histories for a sample of 1,009 faculty members drawn from 53
 public Ph.D.-granting economics departments. Empirical results suggest
 that all else equal: (1) statistically significant negative returns to
 seniority exist within lower-ranked but not top 15 programs; (2) more
 frequent movers observe statistically higher annual salaries in
 lower-ranked but not top 15 programs; and (3) for each level of seniority,
 faculty in top 15 programs are more likely to move at any point in the
 career than faculty in lower-ranked programs.

Title: Teacher Mobility Responses to Wage Changes: Evidence from a Quasi-natural Experiment 
Abstract:
 This paper utilizes a Norwegian experiment with exogenous wage changes to
 study teachers' turnover decisions. Within a completely centralized wage
 setting system, teachers in schools with a high degree of teacher
 vacancies in the past got a wage premium of about 10 percent during the
 period 1993-94 to 2002-03. The empirical strategy exploits that several
 schools switched status during the empirical period. In a fixed effects
 framework, I find that the wage premium reduces the probability of
 voluntary quits by six percentage points, which implies a short run labor
 supply elasticity of about 1 1/4 .

Title: Monopsony, Mobility, and Sex Differences in Pay: Missouri School Teachers 
Abstract:
 We examine the sex differences in the pay of school teachers in Missouri.
 In Missouri school districts, pay is determined by a salary schedule that
 maps teaching experience and education level of an individual to a salary
 level. In spite of this apparently mechanical rule for determining pay,
 female teachers earn less than male teachers, after controlling for
 experience and education. We explore how such a difference could arise
 from differential job mobility and find some evidence to support this
 idea. However, within district differences in pay are a more important
 source of differences in pay between men and women.

Title: Water Quality Violations and Avoidance Behavior: Evidence from Bottled Water Consumption 
Abstract:
 We examine the impact of poor water quality on avoidance behavior by
 estimating the change in bottled water purchases in response to drinking
 water violations. Using data from a national grocery chain matched with
 water quality violations, we find an increase in bottled water sales of 22
 percent from violations due to microorganisms and 17 percent from
 violations due to elements and chemicals. Back-of-the envelope
 calculations yield costs of avoidance behavior at roughly $60 million for
 all nationwide violations in 2005, which likely reflects a significant
 understatement of the total willingness to pay to eliminate violations.

 This paper uses newly available data on plant level regulatory status
 linked to the Census Longitudinal Business Database to measure the impact

 and both employment growth and levels in the affected sectors. The
 preferred estimates suggest that changes in county level regulatory status
 due to the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments reduced the size of the regulated
 sector by as much as 15 percent in the 10 years following the changes.

Title: Superfund Cleanups and Infant Health 
Abstract:
 We are the first to examine the effect of Superfund cleanups on infant
 health rather than focusing on proximity to a site. We study singleton
 births to mothers residing within 5km of a Superfund site between
 1989-2003 in five large states. Our "difference in differences" approach
 compares birth outcomes before and after a site clean-up for mothers who
 live within 2,000 meters of the site and those who live between
 2,000-5,000 meters of a site. We find that proximity to a Superfund site
 before cleanup is associated with a 20 to 25% increase in the risk of
 congenital anomalies.

Title: The Financial Education Fallacy 
Abstract:
 Research to date does not demonstrate a causal chain from financial
 education to welfare-enhancing financial behavior, in part due to biases,
 heuristics, and emotional influences on decisions. Yet the search for
 effective financial education continues. But it is time to ask whether
 giving every person effective financial education would make us better
 off. Two reasons it might not are discussed here. First, the time,
 expense, and invasion of privacy required would be enormous. Second, such
 a world would entail a decrease in individual autonomy. Alternative tools
 could potentially increase household financial welfare and security at
 lower social and individual expense.

Title: Helping Consumers Know Themselves 
Abstract:
 Firms sometimes know more about a consumer's expected usage than the
 consumer herself. We explore the consequences of this reversal in the
 information asymmetry. We analyze the consequences of making consumers
 more informed about themselves. While making consumers more informed
 decreases their expenditure conditional on a given set of prices,
 equilibrium prices may increase, offsetting the direct benefit of
 information. We discuss theoretical and practical issues surrounding
 so-called RECAP regulation that would require firms to provide each
 consumer with information about her own usage of the firm's product.

Title: The Limits of Transparency: Pitfalls and Potential of Disclosing Conflicts of Interest 
Abstract:
 We review evidence from our published and ongoing research that disclosing
 conflicts of interest has unintended consequences, helping conflicted
 advisors and harming their advisees: With disclosure, advisors feel
 comfortable giving more biased advice, but advisees do not properly adjust
 for this and generally fail to sufficiently discount biased advice.
 Disclosure also increases pressure on advisees to comply with advice;
 following disclosure, advisees feel more uncomfortable in turning down
 advice (e.g., it signals distrust of the advisor's motives). Finally, we
 examine the effectiveness of policy interventions aimed at reducing these
 unintended consequences and discuss how to realize potential benefits of
 disclosure.

Title: Leverage and the Financial Accelerator in a Liquidity Trap 
Abstract:
 We show that the financial accelerator may be very large in a liquidity
 trap. We study a sticky price model with real estate and a financial
 friction specified as a collateral constraint. Expectations can lead the
 economy to a self-fulfilling liquidity trap equilibrium where the lower
 bound on the nominal interest rate binds. We model these equilibria as
 stochastic sunspots. As in the Great Depression, a liquidity trap entails
 house price depreciation and potentially large output losses. Higher
 leverage implies much larger output losses but at the same time rules out
 the existence of short-lived liquidity traps.

 There has been a long debate about whether speculators are stabilizing or
 not. We consider a model where speculators have a stabilizing role in
 normal times, but may also provoke large risk panics. The very feature
 that makes arbitrageurs liquidity providers in normal times, namely their
 tolerance of risk, enables a large increase in asset price risk during a
 financial panic. We show that a policy that discourages balance sheet risk
 reduces the magnitude of financial panics, as well as asset price risk in
 both normal and panic states.

Title: Disasterization: A Simple Way to Fix the Asset Pricing Properties of Macroeconomic Models 
Abstract:
 A central difficulty in economics is to create a model with both good
 business cycle properties and asset pricing properties. I show how to
 solve this difficulty by a simple portable modeling device: the
 "disasterization" of models. Take an economy with good business cycle
 properties and create a new, "disasterized" economy, which is essentially
 identical to the original one except that disasters can destroy part of
 the capital stock and productivity. In such a disasterized economy, asset
 prices exhibit high and volatile risk premia, but macro variables remain
 unchanged. Perturbations of this benchmark allow for feedback from finance
 to macro.

Title: Market Sentiment: A Tragedy of the Commons 
Abstract:
 We present a model in which investors decide whether or to what degree
 they want to allow their behavior to be influenced by "market sentiment."
 Investors who choose to insulate their decisions from market sentiment
 earn higher expected returns, but incur a small mental cost. We show that
 if information is moderately dispersed across investors, even a very small
 mental cost may result in a significant amount of sentiment in
 equilibrium: Individuals who choose to be swayed by sentiment increase
 uncertainty about the future and make it less costly for others to be
 swayed by sentiment as well.

Title: Are Drugs Substitutes or Complements for Intensive (and Expensive) Medical Treatment 
Abstract:
 Little is known about the relationship between variation in drug and
 non-drug medical treatment and how areas may substitute one type of care
 for the other. Using pharmacy and medical claims data for Medicare
 beneficiaries, we examine whether areas with more drug use have lower
 non-drug medical costs and how the quality of prescribing and primary care
 are associated with medical costs. We find that areas with higher drug
 spending do not have lower non-drug medical spending; however,
 poorer-quality prescribing and primary care are associated with higher
 medical spending in general and inpatient spending in particular.

Title: The Medium-Term Impact of Medicare Part D on Pharmaceutical Prices 
Abstract:
 Medicare Part D began coverage of prescription drugs in 2006. Using data
 from the first year of the program we found that Part D reduced
 pharmaceutical prices for Medicare recipients, with these effects driven
 by enrollees previously without drug coverage. In this paper we extend our
 analysis through 2009, the fourth year of the program, to investigate
 whether plans continued to extract price concessions in return for
 favorable formulary placement, or if consumer inertia or other factors
 caused prices to bounce back after their initial decline. We find price
 declines persisted through at least the third year of the program.

Title: Part D Formulary and Benefit Design as a Risk-Steering Mechanism 
Abstract:
 Medicare Part D relies upon drug plan competition. Plans have enormous
 scope to design benefits and to set premiums, but they may not charge
 differential premiums based on risk. We use the formulary and benefit
 design of all Medicare prescription drug plans and pharmacy claims data to
 construct a simulation model of out-of-pocket drug spending. We use this
 simulation model to examine individual incentives in Medicare Part D for
 adverse selection. We find that high drug users have much stronger
 incentives to enroll in generous plans than do low users, thus there is
 significant scope for adverse selection.

Title: Heterogeneity in Choice Inconsistencies among the Elderly: Evidence from Prescription Drug Plan Choice 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the degree to which choice inconsistencies
 documented in the context of Medicare Part D plan choice vary across
 consumers and geographic regions. Our main finding is that there is
 surprisingly little variation: regardless of age, gender, predicted drug
 expenditures or the predictability of drug demand consumers underweight
 out of pocket costs relative to premiums and fail to consider the
 individualized consequences of plan characteristics; as a result, they
 frequently choose plans which are dominated in the sense that an
 alternative plan provides better risk protection at a lower cost. We find
 limited evidence that the sickest individuals had more difficulty with
 plan choice, and we document that much of the variation in potential cost
 savings across states comes from variation in choice sets, not variation
 in consumers ability to choose.

Title: Land and Racial Wealth Inequality 
Abstract:
 Could racial wealth inequality have been reduced if freed slaves had been
 granted land following the Civil War? This paper exploits a plausibly
 exogenous variation in policies of the Cherokee Nation and southern United
 States to identify the impact of free land on the size of the racial
 wealth gap. Using data on land, livestock, and home ownership, I find
 evidence that former slaves who had access to free land were absolutely
 wealthier and experienced lower levels of racial wealth inequality in 1880
 than former slaves who did not. Furthermore, their children continued to
 experience these advantages in 1900.

Title: The New Deal, Race, and Home Ownership in the 1920s and 1930s 
Abstract:
 Many federal government housing policies began during the New Deal of the
 1930s. Many claim that minorities benefited less from these policies than
 whites. We estimate the relationships between policies in the 1920s and
 1930s and black and white home ownership in farm and nonfarm settings
 using a pseudo-panel of repeated cross-sections of households in 1920,
 1930, and 1940 matched with policy measures in 460 state economic areas.
 The policies examined include FHA mortgage insurance, HOLC loan
 refinancing, state mortgage moratoria, farm loan programs, public housing,
 public works and relief, and payments to farmers to take land out of
 production.

Title: Covenants without Courts: Enforcing Residential Segregation with Legally Unenforceable Agreements 
Abstract:
 Racial restrictive covenants are private agreements prohibiting sale,
 rental, use or occupancy of properties by persons of designated races,
 ethnicities, nationalities and religions. Widely acknowledged for
 facilitating residential segregation, the Supreme Court ruled covenants
 unenforceable in 1948. Yet they remained legal to write and reference,
 allowing realtors, banks, insurers, title companies and government
 agencies to continue to rely on unenforceable covenants in their decisions
 and policies. Beyond legal enforceability, covenants were essentially
 signals that coordinated the behavior of a variety of private individual
 and institutional actors--signals that remained effective without the
 courts. Evidence is presented to support this claim.

Title: Race and Home Ownership from the End of the Civil War to the Present 
Abstract:
 We present new estimates of home ownership for black and white households
 from 1870 to 2007. Black ownership increased by 46 percentage points,
 whereas white ownership increased by 20 points. Remarkably, 25 of the 26
 point narrowing occurred between 1870 and 1910. Part of this early
 convergence is accounted for by falling white ownership due to movement
 out of agriculture, but most is accounted for by post-emancipation gains
 among blacks. After 1910, white and black households increased ownership,
 but the racial gap barely changed. We discuss the influence of residential
 segregation, public policy, and permanent income on the ownership gap.

Title: The War at Home: Effects of Vietnam-Era Military Service on Postwar Household Stability 
Abstract:
 Prior researchers have deployed the Vietnam-era draft lottery as an
 instrument to estimate causal effects of military service on health and
 earnings. However, household and residential outcomes may be more
 sensitive to the psychological effects of military service. Using 2SLS
 analyses of the 2000 Census and the 2005 American Community Survey, we
 find mixed results for residential stability, housing tenure, and extended
 family residence. While in the ACS white veterans are less mobile, veteran
 status has no effect on homeownership. Veteran status reduces extended
 family living for whites in the Census but increases it for ACS veterans
 of "other" races.

Title: Long-Run Mortality Effects of Vietnam-Era Army Service: Evidence from Australia's Conscription Lotteries 
Abstract:
 We estimate the effect of Vietnam-era Army service on mortality,
 exploiting Australia's conscription lotteries for identification. We
 utilize population data on deaths during 1994-2007 and military personnel
 records. The estimates are identified by over 51,000 compliers induced to
 enlist in the Army. We find no statistically significant effects on
 mortality overall, nor for any cause of death. The estimated relative risk
 (RR) of death associated with Army service is 1.03 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.19).
 On the assumption that Army service affected mortality only for those who
 served in Vietnam, the estimated RR is 1.06 (95% CI: 0.81, 1.51).

Title: Battle Scars? The Puzzling Decline in Employment and Rise in Disability Receipt among Vietnam Era Veterans 
Abstract:
 Using Current Population Survey and US Army administrative data, we
 document that between 2000 and 2010, the employment rate of Vietnam era
 veterans fell markedly relative to non-veterans of the same cohorts while
 simultaneously their enrollment increased steeply in the Veterans
 Disability Compensation (DC) program, which provides healthcare and
 transfer payments to veterans with service-connected disabilities. Thirty
 percent of Vietnam era Army veterans enrolled in DC in 2006 received
 benefits for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, with median annual payments
 of $25,500. The declining employment and rising transfer payments to
 Vietnam era veterans underscore the long-term private and public costs of
 wartime service, potentially stemming from both adverse health
 consequences and policies that have expanded benefits eligibility.

Title: Long-Term Consequences of Vietnam-Era Conscription: New Estimates Using Social Security Data 
Abstract:
 We use the draft lottery to construct instrumental variables (IV)
 estimates of the impact of Vietnam-era military service on veterans'
 Social Security (SSA) earnings through 2007. We also use SSA data to
 construct IV estimates for employment (as measured by an indicator for
 positive earnings) and disability status (as measured by an indicator for
 social security disability program application). New findings for recent
 years show surprisingly rapid convergence in veteran and nonveteran
 earnings: by the early 1990s, there was no longer a substantial
 Vietnam-era conscription penalty. The IV estimates also show no effect on
 employment or disability rates.

 We implement a public goods game and a social intervention modeled after a

 also collect demographic, economic and forest conservation data on

 preferences from the artefactual field experiment (AFE) into real world
 behavior. We find evidence of heterogeneity in shifting factors between
 the AFE, the field experiment, and conservation outcomes. We also find
 evidence that social controls like war violence and witchcraft may explain
 some of this correlation.

Title: Can Tailored Communications Motivate Environmental Volunteers? A Natural Field Experiment 
Abstract:
 Volunteering is a significant component of economic activity, especially
 for environmental organizations. Environmental organizations that rely on
 volunteers communicate with them using a variety of media, such as
 newsletters. This is a field experiment investigating whether tailoring
 the content of these communications to the stated motivations of a
 volunteer has a positive effect on the number of hours he/she volunteers.
 For the non-profit in our study, we find that such tailoring has an effect
 only for volunteers motivated primarily by career concerns. We also find
 this to be robust to the volunteers being aware that the tailoring is
 occurring.

Title: The Persistence of Treatment Effects with Norm-Based Policy Instruments: Evidence from a Randomized Environmental Policy Experiment 
Abstract:
 Policymakers increasingly use norm-based messages to promote conservation
 efforts. Despite the apparent success of such strategies, empirical
 analyses have thus far focused exclusively on short-run effects. From a
 policy perspective, however, whether and how such strategies influence
 behavior in the long-run is of equal interest. We partner with a
 metropolitan water utility to implement a natural field experiment
 examining the effect of such messages on longer-run patterns of water use.
 Empirical results are striking. While appeals to pro-social preferences
 affect short-run patterns of water use, only messages augmented with
 social comparisons have a lasting impact on water demand.

 A vibrant literature has emerged that suggests willingness to pay and

 experience is endogenous. This study presents a framed field experiment
 that exogenously induces market experience. Empirical findings support the

Title: Vertical Linkages and the Collapse of Global Trade 
Abstract:
 A common view is that cross-border vertical linkages played a key role in
 the 2008-2009 collapse of global trade. This paper presents two accounting
 results from a global input-output framework that shed light on this
 channel. We feed in observed changes in final demand and find that trade
 in final goods fell by twice as much as trade in intermediate goods.
 Nevertheless, intermediate goods account for more than two-fifths of the
 trade collapse. We also find that vertical specialization trade fell 13
 percent, while value-added trade fell by 10 percent, because declines in
 demand were largest in highly vertically-specialized sectors.

Title: US Trade and Inventory Dynamics 
Abstract:
 We examine the source of the large fall and rebound in US trade in the
 recent recession. While trade fell and rebounded more than expenditures or
 production of traded goods, we find that relative to the magnitude of the
 downturn, these trade fluctuations were in line with those in previous
 business cycle fluctuations. We argue that the high volatility of trade is
 attributed to more severe inventory management considerations of firms
 involved in international trade. We present empirical evidence for autos
 as well as at the aggregate level that the adjustment of inventory
 holdings help explain these fluctuations in trade.

 about 70 to 80 percent of the decline in world trade that occurred in the
 2008-2009 crisis. We review evidence that shows financial factors also
 contributed to the great trade collapse and uncover two new stylized facts
 in support of it. First, we show that the prices of manufactured exports
 rose relative to domestic prices during the crisis. Second, we show that
 US seaborne exports and imports, which are likely to be more sensitive to
 trade finance problems, saw their prices rise relative to goods shipped by
 air or land.

Title: Predicting and Preventing Shootings among At-Risk Youth 
Abstract:
 Each year, more than 250 students in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) are
 shot. The authors of this paper worked with the leadership of CPS to build
 a predictive model of shootings that helped determine which students would
 be included in a highly targeted and resource intensive mentorship
 program. This paper describes our predictive model and offers a
 preliminary evaluation of the mentoring intervention performed by Youth
 Advocate Programs, Inc. (YAP). We find little evidence that the
 intervention reduces school misconducts or improves educational outcomes.
 The scale of intervention was too small to generate meaningful findings on
 shootings.

Title: The "Collapse in Quality" Hypothesis 
Abstract:
 This paper evaluates the hypothesis that during the 2008-2009 collapse in
 international trade, imports of higher quality goods experienced larger
 reductions compared to low-quality imports, using data on US imports
 disaggregated by HS-10 product category and source country. We find
 little, if any, robust econometric evidence in support of this hypothesis.

Title: Trust in Public Institutions over the Business Cycle 
Abstract:
 We document that trust in public institutions--and particularly trust in
 banks, business and government--has declined over recent years. US time
 series evidence suggests that this partly reflects the pro-cyclical nature
 of trust in institutions. Cross-country comparisons reveal a clear legacy
 of the Great Recession, and those countries whose unemployment grew the
 most suffered the biggest loss in confidence in institutions, particularly
 in trust in government and the financial sector. Finally, analysis of
 several repeated cross-sections of confidence within US states yields
 similar qualitative patterns, but much smaller magnitudes in response to
 state-specific shocks.

Title: Optimal Proof Burdens, Deterrence, and the Chilling of Desirable Behavior 
Abstract:
 The optimal stringency of the burden of proof is characterized in a model
 in which relaxing the proof burden enhances deterrence but also chills
 desirable behavior. The result are strikingly different from those in
 prior work that uses a simpler model in which individuals only choose
 whether to commit a harmful act (so only deterrence is at stake).
 Moreover, the qualitative differences between the optimal rule and the
 familiar preponderance of the evidence rule--and related rules that look
 to Bayesian posteriors--are great, much more so than revealed by prior
 work.

Title: Corrective Taxation versus Liability 
Abstract:
 Taxation and liability are compared as means of controlling harmful
 externalities, with a view toward explaining why the use of liability
 predominates over taxation. Taxation suffers from a disadvantage in the
 analysis: because taxes do not reflect all the variables affecting
 expected harm, inefficiency results, whereas efficiency under liability
 requires only assessment of actual harm. However, liability also suffers
 from a disadvantage: incentives are diluted because injurers escape suit.
 Joint use of taxation and liability is examined, and it is shown that
 liability should be employed fully, with taxation taking up the slack due
 to escape from suit.

Title: The Effect of Allowing Pollution Offsets with Imperfect Enforcement 
Abstract:
 Public policies for pollution control, including climate change policies,
 sometimes allow polluters in one sector subject to an emissions cap to
 offset excessive emissions with pollution abatement in another sector. The
 government may find it more costly to verify offset claims than to verify
 compliance with emissions caps. Concerns about such enforcement
 difficulties may lead regulators to restrict the use of offsets. We
 demonstrate that allowing offsets may increase pollution abatement and
 reduce illegal pollution, even if the government has a fixed enforcement
 budget. We explore circumstances that may make allowing pollution offsets
 an attractive option when enforcement is costly.

Title: Vertical Targeting and Leakage in Carbon Policy 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the intersection between two aspects of climate policy
 design. The first is the point of regulation: should it be placed on
 pollution sources, carbon-rich inputs, or consumers? The second aspect
 concerns the external effects of a local climate policy. Leakage occurs
 when partial regulation results in an increase in emissions in unregulated
 parts of the economy. Our model demonstrates how directly regulating
 polluters can increase foreign emissions while indirect regulation (either
 upstream or downstream of the pollution source) will decrease foreign
 emissions. The net effect on combined domestic and foreign emissions will
 depend on market elasticities.

Title: The Role of Trade and Competitiveness Measures in US Climate Policy 
Abstract:
 We review the proposed measures for addressing competitiveness and carbon
 leakage concerns in recent US climate policy legislation. For eligible
 energy-intensive, trade-exposed sectors, output-based rebates would
 initially dampen cost increases; later, border adjustments would ensure
 that imports face comparable cost burdens. Both measures can in theory
 enhance the economic efficiency of carbon reduction efforts, but both pose
 some interesting economic and practical trade-offs. This paper discusses
 our recent research into the welfare and carbon leakage effects of using
 output-based allocation and trade measures in conjunction with climate
 policies.

Title: Challenges from State-Federal Interactions in US Climate Change Policy 
Abstract:
 With a focus on two sorts of regulation--renewable electricity and clean
 energy standards, and automobile fuel-economy standards--we analyze
 problematic interactions that arise when state policies are nested within
 the domain of Federal policy. Here state efforts may fail to reduce
 greenhouse gas emissions nationally, and may compromise
 cost-effectiveness. Difficulties from overlapping regulations are
 avoidable through price- (as opposed to quantity-) based Federal policy.
 We identify some potentially positive interactions between state and
 Federal policies, and identify rationales for state action when Federal
 and state policies do not overlap.

Title: Measuring the Benefits of Greater Spatial Granularity in Short-Term Pricing in Wholesale Electricity Markets 
Abstract:
 Hourly generation unit-level output levels, detailed information on the
 technological characteristics of generation units, and daily delivered
 natural gas prices to all generation units for the California wholesale
 electricity market before and after the implementation of locational
 marginal pricing are used to measure the impact of introducing greater
 spatial granularity in short-term energy pricing. The average hourly
 number of generation unit starts increases, but both the total hourly
 energy consumed and total hourly operating costs for all natural gas-fired
 generation units fall by more than 2 percent after the implementation of
 locational marginal pricing.

Title: Financial Regulatory Reform: Challenges Ahead 
Abstract:
 Today's financial system is dominated by markets with institutions
 connected by short-term financing, securitization, derivatives, and other
 means. Yet regulations have focused on depositories, leaving regulators
 unprepared for the 2008 crisis. We suggest two key principles for
 regulatory reform. First, some changes in the financial system came as
 institutions lowered the burden of regulations through "regulatory
 arbitrage." Reform needs to avoid driving businesses "into the shadows,"
 where risks may accumulate and sow seeds of future crises. Second, reform
 ought to improve transparency to reduce uncertainty and inter-linkages
 between players. We evaluate some of Dodd-Frank Act in light of these
 principles.

Title: Comparing the Costs of Intermittent and Dispatchable Electricity Generating Technologies 
Abstract:
 Economic evaluations of alternative electric generating technologies
 typically rely on comparisons between their expected "levelized cost" per
 MWh supplied. I demonstrate that this metric is inappropriate for
 comparing intermittent generating technologies like wind and solar with
 dispatchable generating technologies like nuclear, gas combined cycle, and
 coal. It overvalues intermittent generating technologies compared to
 dispatchable base load generating technologies. It also likely overvalues
 wind generating technologies compared to solar generating technologies.
 Integrating differences in production profiles, the associated variations
 in wholesale market prices of electricity, and life-cycle costs associated
 with different generating technologies is necessary to provide meaningful
 comparisons between them.

Title: Why Can't US Airlines Make Money? 
Abstract:
 US airlines have lost nearly $60 billion ($2009) in domestic markets since
 the 1978 deregulation, most of it in the last decade. The dismal financial
 record challenges the economics of deregulation. I examine some of the
 common explanations among industry participants and researchers--including
 high taxes and fuel costs, weak demand, and competition from lower-cost
 airlines. Major drivers seem to be the demand downturn after 9/11--demand
 remains much weaker today than in 2000--and the large cost differential
 between legacy and low-cost carriers, which has persisted even as the
 price differential between them has greatly declined.

Title: Optimal Learning Patterns for Creativity Generation in a Field 
Abstract:
 I present a model of optimal learning for creativity generation in a
 field. The field is defined as a knowledge structure. A creative
 contribution is based on combining two previously unconnected elements,
 generating a new element. Individuals may possess private
 information/intuition about new combinations. Individuals contribute the
 maximum creative contribution they are able to produce based on the set of
 elements they have learned. In equilibrium individuals learn different
 elements, with some degree of overlap, effectively pursuing distinct
 creative interests. The model illustrates a general approach for analyzing
 the creative development of fields and, in a broader sense, cultural
 innovation.

Title: Art and Money 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the impact of equity markets and top incomes on
 art prices. Using a newly constructed art market index, we demonstrate
 that equity market returns have had a significant impact on the price
 level in the art market over the last two centuries. We also find evidence
 that an increase in income inequality may lead to higher prices for art.
 Finally, the results of Johansen's cointegration tests strongly suggest
 the existence of a long-run relation between top incomes and art prices.

Title: Sale Rates and Price Movements in Art Auctions 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the relationship between sale rates and price shocks
 in art auctions. Using data on contemporary and impressionist art, we show
 that while sale rates appear to have little relationship to current
 prices, there exists a strong negative relationship of sale rates to
 unexpected price shocks, which is reminiscent of a Phillips curve. We
 estimate an empirical model that suggests that the reserve price is set on
 average at about 70% of the low estimate.

Title: Rock and Roll Bands, (In)complete Contracts, and Creativity 
Abstract:
 Members of a rock and roll band are endowed with different amounts of
 creativity. They match, compose songs, and share credit. The presence of
 more creative members increases the probability of success, but those more
 creative members may also claim a larger share of the pie. In our
 theoretical model, the nature of matching as well as the covariation
 between the probability of success and the allocation of credit among
 individual members are a function of the completeness of contracting. The
 data show that rock bands tend to enter into incomplete contracts and
 positive assortative matching.

Title: Quality Adjustment for Health Care Spending on Chronic Disease: Evidence from Diabetes Treatment, 1999-2009 
Abstract:
 Although US health care expenditures reached 17.6 percent of GDP in 2009,
 quality measurement in this important service sector remains limited.
 Studying quality changes associated with 11 years of health care for
 patients with diabetes, we find that the value of reduced mortality and
 avoided treatment spending, net of the increase in annual spending, was
 $9,094 for the average patient. These results suggest that the unit cost
 of diabetes treatment, adjusting for the value of health outcomes, has
 been roughly constant. Since input prices have not been declining, our
 results are consistent with productivity improvement in health care.

Title: Does Quality Adjustment Matter for Technologically Stable Products? An Application to the CPI for Food 
Abstract:
 Most indexes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) use a form of the
 "matched-model" approach. It is frequently assumed that this approach
 accurately reflects inflation for items that have no major trend in
 quality. In this paper we investigate that hypothesis using CPI data for
 retail food items. We find that CPI analysts may be correct on average
 when they decide that new and replacement items are similar in quality. We
 also find, however, that when sample items are replaced by items of
 significantly different quality the CPI imputation procedures may
 underestimate price change and overstate quality change.

 The quantity of human-generated light visible from outer space reflects
 variation in both population density and income per capita. In this paper
 we explore the usefulness of the change in visible light as a measure of
 GDP growth. We discuss the data, and then present a statistical framework
 that uses lights growth to augment existing income growth measures,
 assuming that measurement errors in the two series are uncorrelated. For
 some countries with very poor income measurement, we significantly revise
 estimates of growth. Our technique also produces growth estimates for
 cities or regions where no other data are available.

 This paper describes the progress, eight years after matriculating, of 586
 individuals who entered one of 27 economics Ph.D. programs in fall 2002.
 By October 2010, 59 percent of the fall 2002 entering cohort had earned a
 Ph.D. in economics at the university where they initially matriculated, 37
 percent had dropped out, and 4 percent were still writing their
 dissertations.We examine student outcomes by Ph.D. program tier and
 investigate factors associated with completion and time to degree. We
 document and describe the rise in median time to degree from 5.0 to 5.6
 years during the period 1996-2010.

Title: Economists as Worldly Philosophers 
Abstract:
 While leading figures in the early history of economics conceived of it as
 inseparable from philosophy and other humanities, there has been movement,
 especially in recent decades, towards its becoming an essentially
 technical field with narrowly specialized areas of inquiry. Certainly,
 specialization has allowed for great progress in economic science.
 However, recent events surrounding the financial crisis support the
 arguments of some that economics needs to develop forums for
 interdisciplinary interaction and to aspire to broader vision.

Title: Economics: A Moral Inquiry with Religious Origins 
Abstract:
 In contrast to the standard interpretation of the origins of economics out
 of the secular European Enlightenment of the 18th century, the transition
 in thinking that we rightly identify with Adam Smith and his
 contemporaries and followers, which gave us economics as we now know it,
 was powerfully influenced by then-controversial changes in religious
 belief in the English-speaking Protestant world in which they lived: in
 particular, key aspects of the movement away from orthodox Calvinism.
 Further, those at-the-outset influences of religious thinking not only
 fostered the subsequent spread of Smithian thinking, especially in
 America, but shaped the course of its reception. The ultimate result was a
 variety of fundamental resonances between economic thinking and religious
 thinking that continue to influence our public discussion of economic
 issues, and our public debate over economic policy, today.

Title: Markets and Morality 
Abstract:
 The paper addresses two issues. First, economics has evolved both as a
 positive science and, from moral philosophy, also as a normative
 discipline. Advancing the public good requires that public policy walk on
 both these legs. Second, the criticism has been forcefully made that
 markets undermine morality. This contention is refuted in several ways.

Title: The Restoration of Welfare Economics 
Abstract:
 This paper argues that welfare economics should be restored to a prominent
 place on the agenda of economists, and should occupy a central role in the
 teaching of economics. Economists should provide justification for the
 ethical criteria underlying welfare statements, and these criteria require
 constant re-evaluation in the light of developments in economic analysis
 and in moral philosophy. Economists need to be more explicit about the
 relation between welfare criteria and the objectives of governments,
 policy-makers and individual citizens. Moreover, such a restoration of
 welfare economics should be accompanied by consideration of the adoption
 of an ethical code for the economics profession.

Title: What Is the Value of Terroir? 
Abstract:
 We examine the value of terroir--the set of special characteristics of a
 location that impart unique qualities to the wine produced. We conduct a
 hedonic analysis of vineyard sales in the Willamette Valley of Oregon to
 ascertain whether site attributes--such as slope, aspect, elevation, and
 soil types&#8212;or designated appellations are more important
 determinants of price. We find that prices are strongly determined by
 appellation designations, but not by specific site attributes. These
 results indicate that the concept of terroir matters economically, but
 that the reality of terroir--as proxied by locational attributes--is not
 significant.

Title: Isolating the Symbolic Implications of Employee Mobility: Price Increases after Hiring Winemakers from Prominent Wineries 
Abstract:
 Because wines are aged for several years before they are released, newly
 hired winemakers arrive as wines made by their predecessors enter the
 market. An analysis of winemaker hiring events reveals that wines released
 right after a new winemaker's arrival from a prominent competitor are
 priced significantly higher than corresponding wines released in the
 preceding year. However, the wines released before and after the hiring
 event are indistinguishable in terms of quality. These findings isolate a
 "purely symbolic" effect of employee mobility, which affirm sociological
 accounts of markets--under conditions of uncertainty, inter-organizational
 affiliations condition producers' returns to quality demonstrations.

Title: Climate, Grapevine Phenology, Wine Production, and Prices: Pauillac (1800-2009) 
Abstract:
 This paper analyzes 19th and 20th century data from a well-known chateau
 in Bordeaux. The dataset includes information on weather conditions,
 starting dates of three phenological stages of grapevine, prices, and
 yields. We discuss how these variables have evolved over the last two
 centuries. We also study to what extent the impact of climate on yields
 and prices has changed over time. Our regression analysis suggests that
 the effect of temperature on yields has become weaker since the 19th
 century. The influence on prices has, on the contrary, become stronger.

Title: Wine Retail Price Dispersion in the United States: Searching for Expensive Wines? 
Abstract:
 Similar to other markets in which deviations from Jevons' "law of one
 price" is the norm rather than the exception, the retail wine market in
 the United States is characterized by large price dispersions. Drawing on
 a large sample of retail prices from wine-searcher.com we find an average
 per-wine coefficient of variation of 23 percent. Some of this is due to
 differential market conditions, especially state regulations. Our evidence
 suggests that dispersion also depends positively on price levels, after
 controlling for consumer, market, and state heterogeneity.

Title: Credit Ratings and the Evolution of the Mortgage-Backed Securities Market 
Abstract:
 We compare the structure and performance of private (non-GSE)
 mortgage-backed securities sold by large issuers vs. those sold by small
 issuers over the period 2000-2006. Securities sold by large issuers have
 less subordination--a greater fraction of the deal receiving AAA
 rating--than those sold by small issuers. Prices for AAA-rated and non-AAA
 rated tranches sold by large issuers fell more when the market turned down
 than those sold by small issuers, and this difference was concentrated
 among tranches issued between 2004 and 2006. These results suggest that
 rating agencies grant favorable ratings to large issuers, especially
 during market booms.

Title: Did Credit Rating Agencies Make Unbiased Assumptions on CDOs? 
Abstract:
 We compare key CDO assumptions from two departments within the same rating
 agency but with different financial incentives. Assumptions made by the
 ratings division are more favorable than those by the surveillance
 department. The differences are not explained by collateral switching
 during the ramp-up period, a long time gap between reports, nor the
 collapse of the CDO market in 2007 Additionally, CDOs rated with more
 favorable assumptions by the ratings group were more likely to be
 subsequently downgraded. As the useful signals from the surveillance group
 were seemingly ignored, these findings suggest rating agencies bias
 towards high ratings.

Title: Credit Ratings Accuracy and Analyst Incentives 
Abstract:
 The financial crisis has brought a new focus on the accuracy of credit
 rating agencies (CRAs). In this paper, we highlight the incentives of
 analysts at the CRAs to provide accurate ratings. We construct a model in
 which analysts initially work at a CRA and can then either remain or move
 to a bank. The CRA uses incentive contracts to motivate analysts, but does
 not capture the benefits if the analyst moves. We find that rating agency
 accuracy increases with CRA monitoring, bank profitability (a positive
 "revolving door" effect), and can be non-monotonic in the probability of
 an analyst leaving.

Title: Forecasting Gasoline Prices Using Consumer Surveys 
Abstract:
 This paper analyzes the predictive power of a new data set of consumer
 gasoline price forecasts taken from the Michigan Survey of Consumers
 (MSC). MSC data generally perform as well as a no-change forecast in
 predicting future gasoline prices, and they substantially out-perform the
 no-change forecast during the recent economic crisis, during which time
 they track futures market prices. Finally, the cross-respondent dispersion
 of the MSC forecasts increases substantially during the economic crisis,
 paralleling the large increase in price volatility at this time.

Title: Credit Ratings and Security Prices in the Subprime MBS Market 
Abstract:
 We present and discuss preliminary evidence suggesting that credit ratings
 significantly influenced prices for subprime mortgage-backed securities
 issued in the period leading up to the recent financial crisis. Ratings
 are closely correlated with prices even controlling for a rich set of
 security- and loan-level controls. This incremental variation in ratings
 has much less predictive power for security defaults, however, based on
 findings to date from our ongoing research, suggesting prices were
 excessively sensitive to ratings relative to their informational content.

Title: Fuel Economy, Car Class Mix, and Safety 
Abstract:
 Fuel economy standards change the composition of the vehicle fleet,
 potentially influencing accident fatality risks. I estimate the direction
 and magnitude of this impact, introducing a correction for selection on
 driver behavior. A policy application using my new estimates shows that
 the present distinction between light trucks and cars in fuel economy
 rules has very negative consequences for overall safety: Each MPG
 increment to the standard results in an additional 150 fatalities per year
 in expectation. My correction for selection is pivotal in this finding. I
 then demonstrate a simple alternative regulation that can produce
 near-zero changes in accident fatalities.

Title: Consumers' Perceptions and Misperceptions of Energy Costs 
Abstract:
 This paper presents three initial stylized facts from the Vehicle
 Ownership and Alternatives Survey (VOAS), a nationally representative
 survey that elicits consumers' beliefs about gasoline prices and the
 relative energy costs of autos with different fuel economy ratings. First,
 American consumers devote little attention to fuel costs when purchasing
 autos. Second, consistent with a cognitive bias called "MPG Illusion,"
 consumers underestimate the fuel cost differences between low-MPG vehicles
 and overestimate the differences between high-MPG vehicles. Third,
 Americans' mean and median expected future gas prices were above current
 prices and predictions of the futures market at the time of the survey.
 Although it is often argued that misperceived energy costs justify
 policies to encourage the sale of energy efficient durable goods, these
 results show that misperceptions and expectations that differ from market
 information could either increase or decrease energy efficiency.

Title: Is an Automaker's Road to Bankruptcy Paved with Customers' Beliefs? 
Abstract:
 We explore the role the feedback loop between firms' financial health and
 consumers' demand for their products plays in the auto market. We
 construct a simple model of an automaker making pricing and debt service
 (continuation) decisions while recognizing that consumers are sensitive to
 whether it stays in business. We show that multiple equilibria can exist
 in such a model, and calibrate it to match stylized facts surrounding GM's
 recent bankruptcy. The results suggest that while the impact of financial
 distress on demand substantially reduced GM's profit, bank-run-like
 multiple equilibria do not appear likely in this market.

Title: Electricity Consumption and Durable Housing: Understanding Cohort Effects 
Abstract:
 We find that households living in California homes built in the 1960s and
 1970s had high electricity consumption in 2000 relative to houses of more
 recent vintages because the price of electricity at the time of home
 construction was low. Homes built in the early 1990s had lower electricity
 consumption than homes of earlier vintages because the price of
 electricity was higher. The elasticity of the price of electricity at the
 time of construction was -0.22. As homes built between 1960 and 1989
 become a smaller share of the housing stock, average household electricity
 purchases will fall.

 in the District of Columbia to determine whether the reduction in demand
 associated with an hourly price signal is economically different from the
 demand reduction associated with an equivalent price signal that is four
 times longer in duration. For both regular and all-electric customers, the
 percentage demand reduction associated with a given percentage increase in
 the hourly price is approximately equal to the percentage demand reduction
 associated with the same percentage price increase of a much longer
 duration.

Title: The Diffusion of Energy Efficiency in Building 
Abstract:
 We analyze the diffusion of buildings certified for energy efficiency
 across US property markets. Using a panel of 48 metropolitan areas (MSAs)
 observed over the last 15 years, we model the geographic patterns and
 dynamics of building certification, relating industry composition, changes
 in economic conditions, characteristics of the local commercial property
 market, and the presence of human capital, to the cross-sectional
 variation in energy-efficient building technologies and the diffusion of
 those technologies over time. Understanding the determinants and the rate
 at which energy-efficient building practices diffuse is important for
 designing policies to affect resource consumption in the built
 environment.

Abstract:
 This paper summarizes a two-country model that solves for optimal tax
 rates to achieve efficiency in an economy with international trade in used
 consumer electronics. If only the developed nation can tax the disposal of
 e-waste, then the global Pareto Optimum can be obtained by either imposing
 an import tariff on used consumer electronics or subsidizing the return of
 e-waste for disposal in the developed country. The global Pareto Optimum
 can also be obtained by reducing the disposal tax in the developed country
 to a level below the external marginal cost of disposal should no other
 policy option be available.

Title: Promoting Recycling: Private Values, Social Norms, and Economic Incentives 
Abstract:
 Evidence from a nationally representative sample of households illuminates
 the determinants of recycling behavior for plastic water bottles. Private
 values of the environment are influential in promoting recycling, as are
 personal norms for pro-environmental behavior. However, social norms with
 respect to the assessment of the household's recycling behaviors by others
 have little independent effect. Particularly influential are policies that
 create economic incentives to promote recycling either through state
 recycling laws that reduce the time and inconvenience costs of recycling
 or through bottle deposits. Effective policies can have a discontinuous
 effect at the individual level, transforming non-recyclers into avid
 recyclers.

Title: The Effect of Bottle Laws on Income: New Empirical Results 
Abstract:
 Eleven US states have "bottle laws," deposit-refund programs that combine
 a consumption tax with a recycling rebate. When states set the bottle
 deposit low enough it becomes a tax on high wage earners, for whom the
 opportunity cost of their time prevents them from returning containers for
 their deposit. However, this bottle deposit will still be high enough that
 harvesting recyclables provides employment for low wage earners. Using
 individual data on observed cash recycling behavior, this paper shows that
 an unintended consequence of bottle laws is that they have the potential
 to increase the incomes of very low wage workers.

 from different combinations of optimization algorithms and starting values
 lead to substantial differences in post-merger market outcomes using

 acquisition of Tambrands by Proctor and Gamble to provide evidence on the
 efficacy of merger simulation. Two simple demand systems are estimated
 under several identification assumptions and combined with a static model
 of price competition. Simulations predict small price effects of about 1
 percent for the merging firms' brands, while direct estimates indicate the
 merger raised prices by 5-8 percent.

Title: Does Concentration Matter? Measurement of Petroleum Merger Price Effects 
Abstract:
 We have estimated the price effects of two changes in market structure
 resulting from two changes in the ownership of gasoline refineries in the
 San Francisco Bay area: Tosco's purchase of Unocal's Rodeo refinery in
 April 1997 and UDS's purchase of Tosco's Avon refinery in August 2000.
 These events provide a relatively unique opportunity to test a price
 concentration relationship. If market concentration is related to price,
 then we should observe prices increase and then decrease by a similar
 amount following these transactions. We do not find evidence of a
 consistent price concentration relationship.

Title: Crash and Wait? The Impact of the Great Recession on the Retirement Plans of Older Americans 
Abstract:
 This study uses data from pre- and post-crash surveys from the Cognitive
 Economics study to examine the impact of recent stock and labor market
 wealth losses on the planned retirement ages of older Americans.
 Regression estimates imply that the average wealth loss between July 2008
 and May/June 2009 is associated with an increase in planned retirement age
 of approximately 2.5 months. Furthermore, pessimism about future stock
 market returns is found to amplify the impact of wealth losses on
 retirement timing.

Title: Time to Retire? The Effect of State Fiscal Policies on Retirement Decisions 
Abstract:
 Our research addresses the importance of state fiscal policies on the
 probability of retirement using a panel of individual tax return data.
 Results indicate that a one percentage point increase in the income or
 sales tax rate reduces the probability of retirement by about 8.7 percent.
 The evidence suggests that state spending might also affect retirement
 decisions but magnitudes are inconclusive. In general, the results suggest
 that the income effect dominates; that is, higher tax rates at the
 state-level reduce disposable income and decrease the probability of
 retiring. Results are similar in models examining single and married
 filers separately.

Title: What Explains Changes in Retirement Plans during the Great Recession? 
Abstract:
 We examine changes in subjective probabilities regarding retirement
 between the 2006 and 2008 waves of the Health and Retirement Study. Using
 a first-difference approach to eliminate individual heterogeneity, we find
 that the steep drop in asset prices in 2008 increased the reported
 probability of working at age 62 during the Great Recession. Increasing
 unemployment at least partly attenuated this effect, but subjective
 probabilities of working did not respond to changes in housing markets.
 Older workers' probabilities of working were more sensitive to
 fluctuations in the stock market, but less responsive to changes in labor
 market conditions.

Title: Recessions, Retirement, and Social Security 
Abstract:
 This paper examines how labor market fluctuations around the time of
 retirement affect the labor force status and Social Security receipt of
 individuals ages 55 to 69 and the income of retirees in their 70s, using
 data from the March Current Population Survey, Census, and American
 Community Surveys. We find that workers are more likely to leave the labor
 force, to collect Social Security earlier, and to have lower Social
 Security income when they face a recession near retirement. The impact is
 greatest for the less-educated, who are more susceptible to job loss and
 rely more heavily on Social Security.
