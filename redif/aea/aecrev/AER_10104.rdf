Title: The Role of Trading Frictions in Real Asset Markets 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates how trading frictions vary with the thickness of
 the asset market by examining patterns of asset allocations and prices in
 commercial aircraft markets. The empirical analysis indicates that assets
 with a thinner market are less liquid -- i.e., more difficult to sell.
 Thus, firms hold on longer to them amid profitability shocks. Hence, when
 markets for assets are thin, firms' average productivity and capacity
 utilization are lower, and the dispersions of productivity and of capacity
 utilization are higher. In turn, prices of assets with a thin market are
 lower and have a higher dispersion. (JEL A12, L11, L93)

Title: Read All about It!! What Happens Following a Technology Shock? 
Abstract:
 Existing indicators of technical change are plagued by shortcomings. I
 present new measures based on books published in the field of technology
 that resolve many of these problems and use them to identify the impact of
 technology shocks on economic activity. They are positively linked to
 changes in R&D and scientific knowledge, and capture the new technologies'
 commercialization dates. Changes in information technology are found to be
 important sources of economic fluctuations in the post-WWII period, and
 total factor productivity, investment, and, to a lesser extent, labor are
 all shown to increase following a positive technology shock. (JEL E22,

Title: Choice Inconsistencies among the Elderly: Evidence from Plan Choice in the Medicare Part D Program 
Abstract:
 We evaluate the choices of elders across their insurance options under the
 Medicare Part D Prescription Drug plan, using a unique dataset of
 prescription drug claims matched to information on the characteristics of
 choice sets. We document that elders place much more weight on plan
 premiums than on expected out-of-pocket costs; value plan financial
 characteristics beyond any impacts on their own financial expenses or
 risk; and place almost no value on variance- reducing aspects of plans.
 Partial equilibrium welfare analysis implies that welfare would have been
 27 percent higher if patients had all chosen rationally. (JEL D12, I11,

Title: Participation 
Abstract:
 We show experimentally that whether and how communication achieves

 crucially on whether low-talent agents can participate in a
 Pareto-improving outcome. Communication is effective (and patterns of lies
 and truth quite systematic) when this is feasible, but otherwise
 completely ineffective. We examine the data in light of two potentially
 relevant behavioral models: cost-of-lying and guilt-fromblame. (JEL D82,

Title: What Do Trade Negotiators Negotiate About? Empirical Evidence from the World Trade Organization 
Abstract:
 According to the terms-of-trade theory, governments use trade agreements
 to escape from a terms-of-trade-driven prisoner's dilemma. We use the
 terms-of-trade theory to develop a relationship that predicts negotiated
 tariff levels on the basis of pre-negotiation data: tariffs, import
 volumes and prices, and trade elasticities. We then confront this
 predicted relationship with data on the outcomes of tariff negotiations
 associated with the accession of new members to the World Trade
 Organization. We find strong and robust support for the central
 predictions of the terms-of-trade theory in the observed pattern of
 negotiated tariff cuts. (JEL F11, F13)

Title: Electoral Accountability and Corruption: Evidence from the Audits of Local Governments 
Abstract:
 We show that political institutions affect corruption levels. We use audit
 reports in Brazil to construct new measures of political corruption in
 local governments and test whether electoral accountability affects the
 corruption practices of incumbent politicians. We find significantly less
 corruption in municipalities where mayors can get reelected. Mayors with
 reelection incentives misappropriate 27 percent fewer resources than
 mayors without reelection incentives. These effects are more pronounced
 among municipalities with less access to information and where the
 likelihood of judicial punishment is lower. Overall our findings suggest
 that electoral rules that enhance political accountability play a crucial
 role in constraining politician's corrupt behavior. (JEL D72, K42, O17)

Title: R&D Investment, Exporting, and Productivity Dynamics 
Abstract:
 This paper estimates a dynamic structural model of a producer's decision
 to invest in R&D and export, allowing both choices to endogenously affect
 the future path of productivity. Using plant-level data for the Taiwanese
 electronics industry, both activities are found to have a positive effect
 on the plant's future productivity. This in turn drives more plants to
 self-select into both activities, contributing to further productivity
 gains. Simulations of an expansion of the export market are shown to
 increase both exporting and R&D investment and generate a gradual
 within-plant productivity improvement. (JEL D24, F14, G31, L63, O31, O33)

Title: Using Loopholes to Reveal the Marginal Cost of Regulation: The Case of Fuel-Economy Standards 
Abstract:
 Estimating the cost of regulation is difficult. Firms sometimes reveal
 costs indirectly, however, when they exploit loopholes to avoid
 regulation. We apply this insight to fuel economy standards for
 automobiles. These standards feature a loophole that gives automakers a
 bonus when they equip a vehicle with flexible-fuel capacity.
 Profitmaximizing automakers will equate the marginal cost of compliance
 using the loophole, which is observable, with the unobservable costs of
 strategies that genuinely improve fuel economy. Based on this insight, we
 estimate that tightening standards by one mile per gallon would have cost
 automakers just $9-$27 per vehicle in recent years. (JEL L51, L62, Q48)

Title: Strike Three: Discrimination, Incentives, and Evaluation 
Abstract:
 Major League Baseball umpires express their racial/ethnic preferences when
 they evaluate pitchers. Strikes are called less often if the umpire and
 pitcher do not match race/ethnicity, but mainly where there is little
 scrutiny of umpires. Pitchers understand the incentives and throw pitches
 that allow umpires less subjective judgment (e.g., fastballs over home
 plate) when they anticipate bias. These direct and indirect effects bias
 performance measures of minorities downward. The results suggest how
 discrimination alters discriminated groups' behavior generally. They imply
 that biases in measured productivity must be accounted for in generating
 measures of wage discrimination. (JEL J15, J31, J44, J71, L83)

Title: The Inflation-Output Trade-Off with Downward Wage Rigidities 
Abstract:
 The macroeconomic implications of downward nominal wage rigidities are
 analyzed via a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model featuring
 aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks. A closed-form solution for a long-run
 Phillips curve relates average output gap to average wage inflation: it is
 virtually vertical at high inflation and flattens at low inflation.
 Macroeconomic volatility shifts the curve outwards and reduces output. The
 results imply that stabilization policies play an important role, and that
 optimal inflation may be positive and differ across countries with
 different macroeconomic volatility. Results are robust to relaxing the
 wage constraint, for example, when large idiosyncratic shocks arise. (JEL

Title: Education and Labor Market Discrimination 
Abstract:
 Using a model of statistical discrimination and educational sorting, we
 explain why blacks get more education than whites of similar cognitive
 ability, and we explore how the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT),
 wages, and education are related. The model suggests that one should
 control for both AFQT and education when comparing the earnings of blacks
 and whites, in which case a substantial black-white wage differential
 emerges. We reject the hypothesis that differences in school quality
 between blacks and whites explain the wage and education differentials.
 Our findings support the view that some of the black-white wage
 differential reflects the operation of the labor market. (JEL I21, J15,

Title: Face Value 
Abstract:
 People pay attention to the appearance of others, and personal

 informational value in a face in a situation where trust and reciprocity
 can increase earnings? We use a laboratory trust game experiment where
 subjects are unable to observe a counterpart, must observe a counterpart,
 or can pay to reveal a counterpart's photograph. Both senders and
 responders are willing to pay to observe the photos, and we show that
 behavior, earnings, and efficiency are affected. When subjects are "face
 to face," efficiency is enhanced, and senders have higher earnings. (JEL

Title: Term Premia and Inflation Uncertainty: Empirical Evidence from an International Panel Dataset 
Abstract:
 This paper provides cross-country empirical evidence on term premia. I
 construct a panel of zero-coupon nominal government bond yields spanning
 ten industrialized countries and nearly two decades. I hence compute
 forward rates and use two different methods to decompose these forward
 rates into expected future short-term interest rates and term premiums.
 The first method uses an affine term structure model with macroeconomic
 variables as unspanned risk factors; the second method uses surveys. I
 find that term premiums declined internationally over the sample period,
 especially in countries that apparently reduced inflation uncertainty by
 making substantial changes in their monetary policy frameworks. (JEL E13,

Title: Asymmetric Information, Adverse Selection and Online Disclosure: The Case of eBay Motors 
Abstract:
 Since Akerlof (1970), economists have understood the adverse selection
 problem that information asymmetries can create in used goods markets. The
 remarkable growth in online used goods auctions thus poses a puzzle. Part
 of the solution is that sellers voluntarily disclose their private
 information on the auction web page. This defines a precise contract -- to
 deliver the car shown for the closing price -- which helps protect the
 buyer from adverse selection. I test this theory using data from eBay
 Motors, finding that online disclosures are important price determinants,
 and that disclosure costs impact both the level of disclosure and prices.

Title: Ambiguity Models and the Machina Paradoxes 
Abstract:
 Machina (2009) introduced two examples that falsify Choquet expected
 utility, presently one of the most popular models of ambiguity. This
 article shows that Machina's examples falsify not only the model
 mentioned, but also four other popular models for ambiguity of the
 literature, namely maxmin expected utility, variational preferences,
 &#945;-maxmin, and the smooth model of ambiguity aversion. Thus, Machina's
 examples pose a challenge to most of the present field of ambiguity.
 Finally, the paper discusses how an alternative representation of
 ambiguity-averse preferences works to accommodate the Machina paradoxes
 and what drives the results. (JEL D81)

Title: Optimal Policy Intervention and the Social Value of Public Information 
Abstract:
 Svensson (2006) argues that Morris and Shin (2002) is, contrary to what is
 claimed, pro-transparency. This paper reexamines the issue but with an
 important modification to the original Morris and Shin framework.
 Recognizing that central banks impact the economy not only indirectly via
 public announcements, but also directly through policy actions, we
 consider the social value of public information in the presence of active
 policy intervention. Our results strengthen Morris and Shin's conclusions
 considerably: in particular, we find that public disclosure of the central
 bank's information is unambiguously, i.e., regardless of parameter values,
 undesirable.  (JEL D82, D83, E52, E58)

Title: Why Do Payment Card Networks Charge Proportional Fees? 
Abstract:
 This paper explains why payment card networks charge fees that are
 proportional to the transaction values instead of charging fixed
 per-transaction fees. We show that, when card networks and merchants both
 have market power, card networks earn higher profits by charging
 proportional fees. It is also shown that competition among merchants
 reduces card networks' gains from using proportional fees relative to
 fixed per-transaction fees. Merchants are found to earn lower profits
 under proportional fees, whereas consumer utility and social welfare are
 higher. Our welfare results are then evaluated with respect to the current
 regulatory policy debates. (JEL E42, G21, G28)

Title: Information and Prices with Capacity Constraints 
Abstract:
 In the theoretical literature on consumer search, one conclusion is nearly
 universal: as buyers become better able to observe and compare prices ex
 ante, sellers will set lower prices in equilibrium. In this paper, I
 examine a standard consumer search model with one small -- yet often
 relevant -- additional restriction: I assume that sellers are capacity
 constrained. In this environment, I illustrate that the conventional
 wisdom regarding information and prices does not necessarily hold: having
 more informed consumers can lead to a decrease in prices, have no effect
 at all, or even lead to an increase in prices.

Title: Group Size and Incentives to Contribute: A Natural Experiment at Chinese Wikipedia 
Abstract:
 The literature on the private provision of public goods suggests an
 inverse relationship between incentives to contribute and group size. We
 find, however, that after an exogenous reduction of group size at Chinese
 Wikipedia, the nonblocked contributors decrease their contributions by
 42.8 percent on average. We attribute the cause to social effects:
 contributors receive social benefits that increase with both the amount of
 their contributions and group size, and the shrinking group size weakens
 these social benefits. Consistent with our explanation, we find that the
 more contributors value social benefits, the more they reduce their
 contributions after the block.  (JEL H41, L17, L82)

Title: Fertility and the Personal Exemption: Comment 
Abstract:
 One of the most commonly cited studies on the effect of child subsidies on
 fertility, Whittington, Alm, and Peters (1990), claimed a large positive
 effect of child tax benefits on fertility using time series methods. We
 revisit this question in light of recent increases in child tax benefits
 by replicating this earlier study and extending the analysis. We do not
 find strong evidence to justify the model specification from the original
 paper. Moreover, even if the original specification is appropriate, we
 show that the results are not robust to more general measures of child tax
 benefits. (JEL H24, J13)

Title: Returns to Education: Evidence from UK Twins: Comment 
Abstract:
 In an article published in the American Economic Review, Dorothe Bonjour
 et al. (2003) used a dataset  on female monozygotic twins and showed that
 the within-twin estimated return to one year of education was 7.7 percent
 and statistically significant at the 5 percent level. This comment
 illustrates that the point estimate conclusion is driven by one twin pair,
 which is an outlier in the dataset. If one eliminates this twin pair, then
 the estimated return to education is 5.1 percent and statistically
 significant at the 10 percent level only.  (JEL I21, J16, J24, J31)
