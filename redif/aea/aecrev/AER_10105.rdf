Title: Environmental Accounting for Pollution in the United States Economy 
Abstract:
 This study presents a framework to include environmental externalities
 into a system of national accounts. The paper estimates the air pollution
 damages for each industry in the United States. An integrated-assessment
 model quantifies the marginal damages of air pollution emissions for the
 US which are multiplied times the quantity of emissions by industry to
 compute gross damages. Solid waste combustion, sewage treatment, stone
 quarrying, marinas, and oil and coal-fired power plants have air pollution
 damages larger than their value added. The largest industrial contributor
 to external costs is coal-fired electric generation, whose damages range
 from 0.8 to 5.6 times value added. (JEL E01, L94, Q53, Q56)

Title: From Financial Crash to Debt Crisis 
Abstract:
 Newly developed historical time series on public debt, along with data on
 external debts, allow a deeper analysis of the debt cycles underlying
 serial debt and banking crises. We test three related hypotheses at both
 "world" aggregate levels and on an individual	country basis. First,
 external debt surges are an antecedent to banking crises. Second, banking
 crises (domestic and those in financial centers) often precede or
 accompany sovereign debt crises; we find they help predict them. Third,
 public borrowing surges ahead of external sovereign default, as
 governments have "hidden domestic debts" that exceed the better documented
 levels of external debt. (JEL E44, F34, F44, G01, H63, N20)

Title: An Experimental Component Index for the CPI: From Annual Computer Data to Monthly Data on Other Goods 
Abstract:
 The CPI component indices are obtained from comparing price quotes at a
 given store in different periods. If we omit comparisons from goods in the
 store in the initial, but not in the comparison, period we generate a
 selection bias: goods that exit are disproportionately  obsolete goods
 that have falling prices. Building on Pakes (2003), we  explain why
 standard hedonic predictions for second-period prices	of exiting goods do
 not account for this bias. New hedonic methods are derived, shown to have
 desirable properties, and are applied to three CPI samples where they
 generate significant selection corrections. (JEL C43, E31)

Title: Peer Effects, Teacher Incentives, and the Impact of Tracking: Evidence from a Randomized Evaluation in Kenya 
Abstract:
 To the extent that students benefit from high-achieving peers, tracking
 will help strong students and hurt weak ones. However, all students may
 benefit if tracking allows teachers to better tailor their instruction
 level. Lower-achieving pupils are particularly likely to benefit from
 tracking when teachers have incentives to teach to the top of the
 distribution. We propose a simple model nesting these effects and  test
 its implications in a randomized tracking experiment conducted with 121
 primary schools in Kenya. While the direct effect of high-achieving peers
 is positive, tracking benefited lower-achieving pupils indirectly by
 allowing teachers to teach to their level. (JEL I21, J45, O15)

Title: The Impact of Regulations on the Supply and Quality of Care in Child Care Markets 
Abstract:
 We examine the impact of state child care regulations on the supply and
 quality of care in child care markets. We exploit panel data on both
 individual establishments and local markets to control for state, time,
 and, where possible, establishment-specific fixed effects to mitigate the
 potential bias due to policy endogeneity. We find that the imposition of
 regulations reduces the number of center-based child care establishments,
 especially in lower income markets. However, such regulations increase the
 quality of services provided, especially in higher income areas. Thus,
 there are winners and losers from the regulation of child care services.

Title: Competition among Sellers in Securities Auctions 
Abstract:
 We study simultaneous security-bid second-price auctions with competition 
 among sellers for potential bidders. The sellers compete by designing
 ordered sets of securities that the bidders can offer as payment for the
 assets. Upon observing auction designs, potential bidders decide which
 auctions to enter. We characterize all symmetric  equilibria and show that
 there always exist equilibria in which auctions are in standard securities
 or their combinations. In large markets the unique equilibrium is auctions
 in pure cash. We extend the model for competition in reserve prices and
 show that binding reserve prices never constitute equilibrium as long as
 equilibrium security designs are not call options. (JEL D44, D82, G10)

Title: Unhealthy Insurance Markets: Search Frictions and the Cost and Quality of Health Insurance 
Abstract:
 We analyze the effect of search frictions in the market for commercial 
 health insurance. Frictions increase insurance premiums (enough to
 transfer 13.2 percent of consumer surplus from fully insured employer
 groups to insurers&#8212;approximately $34.4 billion in 1997); and
 increase insurance turnover (by 64 percent for the average policy).  This
 rent transfer harms consumers and&#8212;when combined with heightened
 turnover&#8212;reduces incentives to invest in future health. We also find
 that a publicly financed insurance option can improve the efficiency of
 private insurance markets by reducing search friction induced distortions
 in pricing and marketing efforts. (JEL D83 G22, I18)

Title: Segregation and the Quality of Government in a Cross Section of Countries 
Abstract:
 We provide a new compilation of data on ethnic, linguistic, and religious
 composition at the subnational level for a large number of countries.
 Using these data, we measure segregation of groups within the country. To
 overcome the endogeneity problem that arises  because of mobility and
 endogenous internal borders, we construct an instrument for segregation.
 We find that more ethnically and linguistically  segregated countries,
 i.e., those where groups live more spatially separately, have a lower
 quality of government; there is no relationship between religious
 segregation and governance. Trust is an important channel of influence; it
 is lower in more segregated countries. (JEL H11, H77, J15, O17, Z12, Z13)

Title: New York City Cab Drivers' Labor Supply Revisited: Reference-Dependent Preferences with Rational-Expectations Targets for Hours and Income 
Abstract:
 This paper proposes a model of cab drivers' labor supply, building on
 Henry S. Farber's (2005, 2008) empirical analyses and Botond Koszegi and
 Matthew Rabin's (2006; henceforth "KR") theory of reference-dependent
 preferences. Following KR, our model has targets for hours as well as
 income, determined by proxied rational  expectations. Our model, estimated
 with Farber's data, reconciles his finding that stopping probabilities are
 significantly related to hours but not income with Colin Camerer et al.'s
 (1997) negative "wage" elasticity of hours; and avoids Farber's criticism
 that estimates of drivers' income targets are too unstable to yield a
 useful model of labor supply. (JEL J22, J31, L92)

Title: Climbing atop the Shoulders of Giants: The Impact of Institutions on Cumulative Research 
Abstract:
 While cumulative knowledge production is central to growth, little
 empirical research investigates how institutions shape whether existing
 knowledge can be exploited to create new knowledge. This paper assesses
 the impact of a specific institution, a biological resource  center, whose
 objective is to certify and disseminate knowledge. We disentangle the
 marginal impact of this institution on cumulative research from the impact
 of selection, in which the most important discoveries are endogenously
 linked to research-enhancing institutions. Exploiting exogenous shifts of
 biomaterials across institutional settings and employing a
 difference-in-differences approach, we find that effective institutions
 amplify the cumulative impact of individual scientific discoveries. (JEL

Title: Finance and Development: A Tale of Two Sectors 
Abstract:
 We develop a quantitative framework to explain the relationship between
 aggregate/sector-level total factor productivity (TFP) and financial
 development across countries. Financial frictions distort the allocation
 of capital and entrepreneurial talent across production units, adversely
 affecting measured productivity. In our model, sectors with larger scales
 of operation (e.g., manufacturing) have more financing needs, and are
 hence disproportionately vulnerable to financial frictions. Our
 quantitative analysis shows that financial frictions  account for a
 substantial part of the observed cross-country differences in output per
 worker, aggregate TFP, sector-level relative productivity, and
 capital-to-output ratios. (JEL E23, E44, O41, O47)

Title: Dynamics and Stagnation in the Malthusian Epoch 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the central hypothesis of the influential Malthusian
 theory, according to which improvements in the technological environment
 during the preindustrial era had generated only temporary gains in income
 per capita, eventually leading to a larger, but not significantly richer,
 population. Exploiting exogenous sources of cross-country variations in
 land productivity and the level of technological advancement, the analysis
 demonstrates that, in accordance with the theory, technological
 superiority and higher  land productivity had significant positive effects
 on population density	but insignificant effects on the standard of
 living, during the time  period 1-1500 CE. (JEL N10, N30, N50, O10, O40,

Title: Bargaining in Stationary Networks 
Abstract:
 We study an infinite horizon game in which pairs of players connected in a
 network are randomly matched to bargain. Players who reach agreement are
 replaced by new players at the same positions in the network. We show that
 all equilibria are payoff equivalent. The payoffs and the set of agreement
 links converge as players become  patient. Several new
 concepts&#8212;mutually estranged sets, partners, and shortage
 ratios&#8212;provide insights into the relative strengths of the positions
 in the network. We develop a procedure to determine the limit equilibrium
 payoffs for all players. Characterizations  of equitable and
 nondiscriminatory networks are also obtained. (JEL C78, D85)

Title: State Misallocation and Housing Prices: Theory and Evidence from China 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the equilibrium price effects of the privatization of
 housing assets that were previously owned and allocated by the state. I
 develop a theoretical framework that shows that privatization can have
 ambiguous effects on prices in the private market, and tha the degree of
 misallocation of the assets prior to privatization determines the
 subsequent price effects. I test the predictions of the model using a
 large-scale housing reform in China. The results suggest that the removal
 of price distortions allowed households to increase their consumption of
 housing and led to an increase in equilibrium housing prices. (JEL L33,

Title: Forced Sales and House Prices 
Abstract:
 This paper uses data on all house transactions in Massachusetts over the
 last 20 years to show that houses sold after foreclosure, or close in time
 to the death or bankruptcy of a seller, are sold at lower prices than
 other houses. Foreclosure discounts are on average at 27 percent of the
 value of a house. Moreover, foreclosures that take place within small
 local geographies of a house lower the price at which it is sold. Our
 preferred estimate is that a foreclosure at a distance of 0.05 miles
 lowers the price of a house by about 1 percent.

Title: House Prices, Home Equity-Based Borrowing, and the US Household Leverage Crisis 
Abstract:
 Borrowing against the increase in home equity by existing homeowners was
 responsible for a significant fraction of the rise in US household
 leverage from 2002 to 2006 and the increase in defaults from 2006 to 2008.
 Instrumental variables estimation shows that homeowners extracted 25 cents
 for every dollar increase in home equity. Home equity-based borrowing was
 stronger for younger households and households with low credit scores. The
 evidence suggests that borrowed funds were used for real outlays. Home
 equity-based borrowing added $1.25 trillion in household debt from 2002 to
 2008, and accounts for at least 39 percent of new defaults from 2006 to
 2008. JEL: D14, R31

Title: Panic on the Streets of London: Police, Crime, and the July 2005 Terror Attacks 
Abstract:
 In this paper we study the causal impact of police on crime, looking at
 what happened to crime and police before and after the terror attacks that
 hit central London in July 2005. The attacks resulted in a large
 redeployment of police officers to central London as compared to outer
 London. During this time, crime fell significantly in central relative to
 outer London. The instrumental variable approach we use uncovers an
 elasticity of crime with respect to police of approximately -0.3 to -0.4,
 so that a 10 percent increase in police activity reduces crime by around 3
 to 4 percent.	JEL: K42

Title: Barriers to Investment in Polarized Societies 
Abstract:
 I present a tractable dynamic model of political economy where
 disagreements about the composition of public spending result in
 implementation of short-sighted policies. Excessive taxation reduces the
 return to physical capital and hence investment rates,  which slows down
 growth along the transition. In the long run, output, consumption and
 welfare are inefficiently low. The larger is the degree of polarization,
 the greater is the inefficiency. Political stability mitigates the effects
 of polarization by making the incumbent internalize the dynamic
 inefficiencies introduced by the choice of growth-retarding policies.

Title: The Area and Population of Cities: New Insights from a Different Perspective on Cities 
Abstract:
 The distribution of city populations has attracted much attention, in part
 because it constrains models of local growth. However, there is no
 consensus on the distribution below the very upper tail, because available
 data need to rely on "legal" rather than "economic" definitions for medium
 and small cities. To remedy this difficulty, we construct cities "from the
 bottom up" by clustering populated areas obtained from high-resolution

 5,000 inhabitants in Great Britain and 12,000 inhabitants in the US. We
 also find a Zipf's law for areas.  JEL: R11, R12, R23

Title: The Effects of Lottery Prizes on Winners and Their Neighbors: Evidence from the Dutch Postcode Lottery 
Abstract:
 Each week, the Dutch Postcode Lottery (PCL) randomly selects a postal
 code, and distributes cash and a new BMW to lottery participants in that
 code. We study the effects of these shocks on lottery winners and their
 neighbors. Consistent with the life-cycle hypothesis, the effects on
 winners' consumption are largely confined to cars and other durables.
 Consistent with the theory of in-kind transfers, the vast majority of BMW
 winners liquidate their BMWs. We do, however, detect substantial social
 effects of lottery winnings: PCL nonparticipants who live next door to
 winners have significantly higher levels of car consumption than other
 nonparticipants.  JEL: D14, D91, H23, H27

Title: Did Household Consumption Become More Volatile? 
Abstract:
 I show that after accounting for predictable variation arising from
 movements in real interest rates, preferences and income shocks, liquidity
 constraints and measurement errors, volatility of household consumption in
 the US increased by 25 percent between 1970 and 2004. The increase was
 lower than that of volatility of family income. Nonwhite and those with
 less than 13 years of education, for whom there was no differential
 increase in income volatility, experienced a significantly larger increase
 in volatility of household consumption. Substantial differences in wealth
 and access to credit markets point to the main reason for this divide.

Title: Strotz Meets Allais: Diminishing Impatience and the Certainty Effect: Comment 
Abstract:
 Halevy (2008) states the equivalence between diminishing impatience (i.e.,
 quasi-hyperbolic discounting) and the common ratio effect. The present
 paper shows that one way of the equivalence is false and shows the correct
 and general relationships: diminishing impatience is equivalent to the
 certainty effect and that strong diminishing impatience (i.e., hyperbolic
 discounting) is equivalent to the common ratio effect.  JEL: D81
