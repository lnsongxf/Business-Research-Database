Title: Searching and Learning by Trial and Error 
Abstract:
 I study a dynamic model of trial-and-error search in which agents do not
 have complete knowledge of how choices are mapped into outcomes. Agents
 learn about the mapping by observing the choices of earlier agents and the
 outcomes that are realized. The key novelty is that the mapping is
 represented as the realized path of a Brownian motion. I characterize for
 this environment the optimal behavior each period as well as the
 trajectory of experimentation and learning through time. Applied to new
 product development, the model shares features of the data with the
 well-known Product Life Cycle. (JEL D81, D83, D92, L26)

Title: Trends in Quality-Adjusted Skill Premia in the United States, 1960-2000 
Abstract:
 This paper presents new evidence that increases in college enrollment lead
 to a decline in the average quality of college graduates between 1960 and
 2000, resulting in a decrease of 6 percentage points in the college
 premium. A standard demand and supply framework can qualitatively account
 for the trend in the college and age premia over this period, but
 substantial quantitative adjustments are needed to account for changes in
 quality. (JEL I23, J24, J31)

Title: Nudging Farmers to Use Fertilizer: Theory and Experimental Evidence from Kenya 
Abstract:
 We model farmers as facing small fixed costs of purchasing fertilizer and
 assume some are stochastically present biased and not fully sophisticated
 about this bias. Such farmers may procrastinate, postponing fertilizer
 purchases until later periods, when they may be too impatient to purchase
 fertilizer. Consistent with the model, many farmers in Western Kenya fail
 to take advantage of apparently profitable fertilizer investments, but
 they do invest in response to small, time-limited discounts on the cost of
 acquiring fertilizer (free delivery) just after harvest. Calibration
 suggests that this policy can yield higher welfare than either
 laissez-faire policies or heavy subsidies. (JEL Q13, Q12, Q16, Q18)

Title: Aggregation and the PPP Puzzle in a Sticky-Price Model 
Abstract:
 We study the purchasing power parity (PPP) puzzle in a multisector,
 two-country, sticky-price model. Sectors differ in the extent of price
 stickiness, leading to heterogeneous sectoral real exchange rate dynamics.
 Deviations from PPP are more volatile and persistent than in an otherwise
 identical one-sector world economy with the same average frequency of
 price changes. Under the empirical distribution of price stickiness of the
 US economy, the model produces PPP deviations with a half-life of 39
 months. We provide a structural interpretation of the approaches found in
 the empirical literature on aggregation and PPP, and reconcile its
 apparently conflicting findings. (JEL F31, G31)

Title: Private Monitoring and Communication in Cartels: Explaining Recent Collusive Practices 
Abstract:
 Motivated by recent cartel practices, a stable collusive agreement is
 characterized when firms' prices and quantities are private information.
 Conditions are derived whereby an equilibrium exists in which firms
 truthfully report their sales and then make transfers within the cartel
 based on these reports. The properties of this equilibrium fit well with
 the cartel agreements in a number of markets including citric acid,
 lysine, and vitamins. (JEL D43, D82, K21, L12, L61, L65)

Title: International Prices, Costs, and Markup Differences 
Abstract:
 Relative cross-border retail prices, in a common currency, comove closely
 with the nominal exchange rate. Using product-level prices and wholesale
 costs from a grocery chain operating in the United States and Canada, we
 decompose this variation into relative costs and markup components. The
 high correlation of nominal and real exchange rates is driven mainly by
 changes in relative costs. National borders segment markets. Retail prices
 respond to changes in costs in neighboring stores within the same country
 but not across the border. Prices have a median discontinuous change of 24
 percent at the border and 0 percent at state boundaries. (JEL F31, L11,

Title: The Nature of Credit Constraints and Human Capital 
Abstract:
 We develop a human capital model with borrowing constraints explicitly
 derived from government student loan (GSL) programs and private lending
 under limited commitment. The model helps explain the persistent strong
 positive correlation between ability and schooling in the United States,
 as well as the rising importance of family income for college attendance.
 It also explains the increasing share of undergraduates borrowing the GSL
 maximum and the rise in student borrowing from private lenders. Our
 framework offers new insights regarding the interaction of government and
 private lending, as well as the responsiveness of private credit to
 economic and policy changes. (JEL D14, H52, I22, I23, J24)

Title: Risk Matters: The Real Effects of Volatility Shocks 
Abstract:
 We show how changes in the volatility of the real interest rate at which
 small open emerging economies borrow have an important effect on variables
 like output, consumption, investment, and hours. We start by documenting
 the strong evidence of time-varying volatility in the real interest rates
 faced by four emerging economies: Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and
 Venezuela. We estimate a stochastic volatility process for real interest
 rates. Then, we feed this process in a standard small open economy
 business cycle model. We find that an increase in real interest rate
 volatility triggers a fall in output, consumption, investment, hours, and
 debt. (JEL E13, E20, E32, E43, F32, F43, 011)

Title: The Potential of Social Identity for Equilibrium Selection 
Abstract:
 When does a common group identity improve efficiency in coordination
 games? To answer this question, we propose a group-contingent social
 preference model and derive conditions under which social identity changes
 equilibrium selection. We test our predictions in the minimum-effort game
 in the laboratory under parameter configurations which lead to an
 inefficient low-effort equilibrium for subjects with no group identity.
 For those with a salient group identity, consistent with our theory, we
 find that learning leads to ingroup coordination to the efficient
 high-effort equilibrium. Additionally, our theoretical framework
 reconciles findings from a number of coordination game experiments. (JEL

Title: Bayesian Persuasion 
Abstract:
 When is it possible for one person to persuade another to change her
 action? We consider a symmetric information model where a sender chooses a
 signal to reveal to a receiver, who then takes a noncontractible action
 that affects the welfare of both players. We derive necessary and
 sufficient conditions for the existence of a signal that strictly benefits
 the sender. We characterize sender-optimal signals. We examine comparative
 statics with respect to the alignment of the sender's and the receiver's
 preferences. Finally, we apply our results to persuasion by litigators,
 lobbyists, and salespeople. (JEL D72, D82, D83, K40, M31)

Title: The Fundamental Law of Road Congestion: Evidence from US Cities 
Abstract:
 We investigate the effect of lane kilometers of roads on
 vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) in US cities. VKT increases
 proportionately to roadway lane kilometers for interstate highways and
 probably slightly less rapidly for other types of roads. The sources for
 this extra VKT are increases in driving by current residents, increases in
 commercial traffic, and migration. Increasing lane kilometers for one type
 of road diverts little traffic from other types of road. We find no
 evidence that the provision of public transportation affects VKT. We
 conclude that increased provision of roads or public transit is unlikely
 to relieve congestion. (JEL R41, R48)

Title: Clearing the Air? The Effects of Gasoline Content Regulation on Air Quality 
Abstract:
 This paper examines whether US gasoline content regulations, which impose
 substantial costs on consumers, have successfully reduced ozone pollution.
 We take advantage of spatial and temporal variation in the regulations'
 implementation to show that federal gasoline standards, which allow
 refiners flexibility in choosing a compliance mechanism, did not improve
 air quality. This outcome occurred because minimizing the cost of
 compliance does not reduce emissions of those compounds most prone to
 forming ozone. In California, however, we find that precisely targeted,
 inflexible regulations requiring the removal of particularly harmful
 compounds significantly improved air quality. (JEL L51, L71, L78, Q53,

Title: The Chinese Warrants Bubble 
Abstract:
 In 2005-2008, over a dozen put warrants traded in China went so deep out
 of the money that they were almost certain to expire worthless.
 Nonetheless, each warrant was traded more than three times each day at
 substantially inflated prices. This bubble is unique in that the
 underlying stock prices make warrant fundamentals publicly observable and
 that warrants have predetermined finite maturities. This sample allows us
 to examine a set of bubble theories. In particular, our analysis
 highlights the joint effects of short-sales constraints and heterogeneous
 beliefs in driving bubbles and confirms several key findings of the
 experimental bubble literature. (JEL G12, G13, O16, P34)

Title: Estimating Marginal Returns to Education 
Abstract:
 This paper estimates marginal returns to college for individuals induced
 to enroll in college by different marginal policy changes. The recent
 instrumental variables literature seeks to estimate this parameter, but in
 general it does so only under strong assumptions that are tested and found
 wanting. We show how to utilize economic theory and local instrumental
 variables estimators to estimate the effect of marginal policy changes.
 Our empirical analysis shows that returns are higher for individuals with
 values of unobservables that make them more likely to attend college. We
 contrast our estimates with IV estimates of the return to schooling. (JEL

Title: How Demanding Is the Revealed Preference Approach to Demand? 
Abstract:
 A well-known problem with revealed preference methods is that when data
 are found to satisfy their restrictions it is hard to know whether this
 should be viewed as a triumph for economic theory, or a warning that these
 conditions are so undemanding that almost anything goes. This paper allows
 researchers to make this distinction. Our approach uses an axiomatic
 characterization of a measure of predictive success due to Selten (1991).
 We illustrate the idea using a panel dataset. The results show that this
 approach can lead us to radically reassess our view of the empirical
 performance of economic theory. (JEL  D11, D12)

Title: Currency Misalignments and Optimal Monetary Policy: A Reexamination 
Abstract:
 This paper examines optimal monetary policy in an open-economy two-country
 world with sticky prices under pricing to market. We show that currency
 misalignments are inefficient and lower world welfare. We find that
 optimal policy must target consumer price inflation, the output gap, and
 the currency misalignment. The paper derives the loss function of a
 cooperative monetary policymaker and the optimal targeting rules. The
 model is a modified version of Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (JME, 2002). The
 key change is that we allow pricing to market or local-currency pricing
 and consider the policy implications of currency misalignments. (JEL E52,

Title: Aggregate and Idiosyncratic Risk in a Frictional Labor Market 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a tractable extension of a Mortensen-Pissarides style
 matching model that allows for risk averse workers with limited ability to
 smooth consumption. I show that this leads to a form of equilibrium wage
 rigidity, as the inability of workers to smooth their consumption across
 unemployment and employment spells changes how unemployed workers value
 wage offers, and hence also the offers that employers find profitable to
 make. In the model risk-averse entrepreneurs use optimal long-term
 contracts to attract risk averse workers facing limited access to asset
 markets. A simple analytic representation for the equilibrium is derived.

Title: Expectations, Learning, and Business Cycle Fluctuations 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a theory of expectations-driven business cycles based
 on learning. Agents have incomplete knowledge about how market prices are
 determined and shifts in expectations of future prices affect dynamics.
 Learning breaks the tight link between fundamentals and equilibrium
 prices, inducing periods of erroneous optimism or pessimism about future
 returns to capital and wages which subsequent data partially validate. In
 a real business cycle model, the theoretical framework amplifies and
 propagates technology shocks. Moreover, it produces agents' forecast
 errors consistent with business cycle properties of forecast errors for a
 wide range of variables from the Survey of Professional Forecasters. (JEL
