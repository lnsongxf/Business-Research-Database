Title: Frictional Wage Dispersion in Search Models: A Quantitative Assessment 
Abstract:
 We propose a new measure of frictional wage dispersion: the mean-min wage
 ratio. For a large class of search models, we show that this measure is
 independent of the wage-offer distribution but depends on statistics of
 labor-market turnover and on preferences. Under plausible preference
 parameterizations, observed magnitudes for worker flows imply that in the
 basic search model, and in most of its extensions, frictional wage
 dispersion is very small. Notable exceptions are some of the most recent
 models of on-the-job search. Our new measure allows us to rationalize the
 diverse empirical findings in the large literature estimating structural
 search models. (JEL D81, D83, J31, J41, J64)

Title: Search and Satisficing 
Abstract:
 Many everyday decisions are made without full examination of all available
 options, and, as a result, the best available option may be missed. We
 develop a search-theoretic choice experiment to study the impact of
 incomplete consideration on the quality of choices. We find that many
 decisions can be understood using the satisficing model of Herbert Simon
 (1955): most subjects search sequentially, stopping when a "satisficing"
 level of reservation utility is realized. We find that reservation
 utilities and search order respond systematically to changes in the
 decision making environment. (JEL D03, D12, D83)

Title: Sources of Lifetime Inequality 
Abstract:
 Is lifetime inequality mainly due to differences across people established
  early in life or to differences in luck experienced over the working
 lifetime? We answer this question within a model that features
 idiosyncratic shocks to human capital, estimated directly from data, as
 well as heterogeneity in ability to learn, initial human capital, and
 initial wealth. We find that, as of age 23, differences in initial
 conditions account for more of the variation in lifetime earnings,
 lifetime wealth, and lifetime utility than do differences in shocks
 received  over the working lifetime. (JEL D31, D91, J24, J31)

Title: Endogenous Information Flows and the Clustering of Announcements 
Abstract:
 We consider the strategic timing of information releases in a dynamic
 disclosure model. Because investors don't know whether or when the firm is
 informed, the firm will not necessarily disclose immediately. We show that
 bad market news can trigger the immediate release of information by firms.
 Conversely, good market news slows the  release of information by firms.
 Thus, our model generates clustering of negative announcements.
 Surprisingly, this result holds only when firms can preemptively disclose
 their own information prior to the arrival of external information. These
 results have implications for conditional variance and skewness of stock
 returns. (JEL D21, D83, G12, G14, L11)

Title: The Effect of Newspaper Entry and Exit on Electoral Politics 
Abstract:
 We use new data on entries and exits of US daily newspapers from 1869 to
 2004 to estimate effects on political participation, party vote shares,
 and electoral competitiveness. Our identification strategy exploits the
 precise timing of these events and allows for the possibility of
 confounding trends. We focus our analysis on the years 1869-1928, and we
 use the remaining years of data to look at changes over time. We find that
 newspapers have a robust positive effect on political participation, with
 one additional newspaper increasing both  presidential and congressional
 turnout by approximately 0.3 percentage points. Newspaper competition is
 not a key driver of turnout: our effect is driven mainly by the first
 newspaper in a market, and the effect of a second or third paper is
 significantly smaller. The effect on presidential turnout diminishes after
 the introduction of radio and television, while the estimated effect on
 congressional turnout remains similar up to recent years. We find no
 evidence that partisan  newspapers affect party vote shares, with
 confidence intervals that rule out even moderate-sized effects. We find no
 clear evidence that newspapers systematically help or hurt incumbents.

Title: School Desegregation, School Choice, and Changes in Residential Location Patterns by Race 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the residential location and school choice responses
 to the desegregation of large urban public school districts. We decompose
 the well documented decline in white public enrollment following
 desegregation into migration to suburban districts and increased private
 school enrollment and find that migration was the more prevalent response.
 Desegregation caused black public enrollment to increase significantly
 outside of the South, mostly by slowing decentralization of black
 households to the suburbs, and large black private school enrollment
 declines in southern districts. Central district school desegregation
 generated only a small portion of overall urban population
 decentralization between 1960 and 1990. (JEL H75, I21, J15, R23)

Title: Dynamic Inefficiencies in an Employment-Based Health Insurance System: Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
 We investigate the effects of the institutional settings of the US health 
 care system on individuals' life-cycle medical expenditures. Health is a
 form of general human capital; labor turnover and labor-market frictions
 prevent an employer-employee pair from capturing the entire surplus from
 investment in an employee's health. Thus, the pair underinvests in health
 during working years, thereby increasing  medical expenditures during
 retirement. We provide empirical evidence consistent with the comparative
 statics predictions of our model using the Medical Expenditure Panel
 Survey (MEPS) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Our estimates
 suggest significant  inefficiencies in health investment in the United
 States. (JEL D14, D91, G22, I11, J32)

Title: The Effects of Rural Electrification on Employment: New Evidence from South Africa 
Abstract:
 This paper estimates the impact of electrification on employment growth by
 analyzing South Africa's mass roll-out of electricity to rural households.
 Using several new data sources and two different identification strategies
 (an instrumental variables strategy and a fixed effects approach), I find
 that electrification significantly raises female employment within five
 years. This new infrastructure appears to increase hours of work for men
 and women, while reducing female wages and increasing male earnings.
 Several pieces of evidence suggest that household electrification raises
 employment by releasing women from home production and enabling
 microenterprises. Migration behavior may also be affected. (JEL H54, L94,

Title: Happiness and Time Preference: The Effect of Positive Affect in a Random-Assignment Experiment 
Abstract:
 We conduct a random-assignment experiment to investigate whether positive
 affect impacts time preference, where time preference denotes a preference
 for present over future utility. Our result indicates that, compared to
 neutral affect, mild positive affect significantly reduces time preference
 over money. This result is robust to various specification checks, and
 alternative interpretations of the result are considered. Our result has
 implications for the effect of happiness on time preference and the role
 of emotions in economic decision making, in general. Finally, we reconfirm
 the ubiquity of time preference and start to explore its determinants.

Title: Who Thinks about the Competition? Managerial Ability and Strategic Entry in US Local Telephone Markets 
Abstract:
 We examine US local telephone markets shortly after the Telecommunications
 Act of 1996. The data suggest that more experienced, better-educated
 managers tend to enter markets with fewer  competitors. This motivates a
 structural econometric model based on behavioral game theory that allows
 heterogeneity in managers' ability to conjecture competitor behavior. We
 find that manager characteristics are key determinants in managerial
 ability. This estimate of ability predicts out-of-sample success. Also,
 the measured level of ability rises following a shakeout, suggesting that
 our behavioral assumptions may be most relevant early in the industry's
 life cycle. (JEL L96, L98, M10)

Title: Buffalo Hunt: International Trade and the Virtual Extinction of the North American Bison 
Abstract:
 In the sixteenth century, North America contained 25 to 30 million
 buffalo; by the late nineteenth century fewer than 100 remained. While
 removing the buffalo east of the Mississippi took over 100 years, the
 remaining 10 to 15 million buffalo on the Great Plains  were killed in a
 punctuated slaughter lasting little more than ten years. I employ theory,
 international trade statistics, and first-person accounts to argue the
 slaughter was initiated by a foreign-made innovation and fueled by a
 foreign demand for industrial leather.  European demand and American
 policy failure are jointly responsible for the "Slaughter on the Plains."

Title: Extreme Walrasian Dynamics: The Gale Example in the Lab 
Abstract:
 We study David Gale's (1963) economy using laboratory markets. 
 Tatonnement theory predicts prices will diverge from an equitable 
 interior equilibrium toward infinity or zero depending only on initial 
 prices. The inequitable equilibria determined by these dynamics give  all
 gains from exchange to one side of the market. We show surprisingly 
 strong support for these predictions. In most sessions one side  of the
 market eventually outgains the other by more than 20 times,  leaving the
 disadvantaged side to trade for mere pennies. We also	find preliminary
 evidence that these dynamics are sticky, resisting  exogenous
 interventions designed to reverse their trajectories. (JEL  C92, D50)

Title: The Slave Trade and the Origins of Mistrust in Africa 
Abstract:
 We show that current differences in trust levels within Africa can be
 traced back to the transatlantic and Indian Ocean slave trades. Combining
 contemporary individual-level survey data with historical data on slave
 shipments by ethnic group, we find that individuals whose ancestors were
 heavily raided during the slave trade are less trusting today. Evidence
 from a variety of identification strategies  suggests that the
 relationship is causal. Examining causal mechanisms,  we show that most of
 the impact of the slave trade is through factors that are internal to the
 individual, such as cultural norms, beliefs, and values. (JEL J15, N57,

Title: The Consequences of Radical Reform: The French Revolution 
Abstract:
 The French Revolution had a momentous impact on neighboring countries. It
 removed the legal and economic barriers protecting oligarchies,
 established the principle of equality before the law, and prepared
 economies for the new industrial opportunities of the second half of the
 19th century. We present within-Germany evidence on the long-run
 implications of these institutional reforms. Occupied areas appear to have
 experienced more rapid urbanization growth, especially after 1850. A
 two-stage least squares strategy provides evidence consistent with the
 hypothesis that the reforms instigated by the French had a positive impact
 on growth. (JEL: N13, N43, O47)

Title: Trends in Employment and Earnings of Allowed and Rejected Applicants to the Social Security Disability Insurance Program 
Abstract:
 Longitudinal administrative data show that rejected male applicants to the
 Disability Insurance (DI) program who are younger or have low-mortality
 impairments such as back pain and mental health problems exhibit
 substantial labor force attachment. While we confirm that employment rates
 of older rejected applicants are low, continued high numbers of younger
 and low-mortality beneficiaries have raised the potential employment of DI
 beneficiaries. Three findings support economic inducement to apply. Mean
 preapplication earnings have fallen, rejected applicants experience
 preapplication declines in earnings, and beneficiaries whose first
 applications were rejected at the DDS level but who ultimately received
 benefits exhibit substantial employment. (JEL: H55, J14, J28, J31)

Title: Relative Earnings and Giving in a Real-Effort Experiment 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the relationship between relative earnings and
 giving in a two-stage, real-effort experiment. In the first stage, four
 players compete in a tournament that determines their earnings. In the
 second stage, they decide whether to make a transfer to one or more of
 their group members. Our main finding is that those ranked first are
 significantly less likely to give than those ranked second. This
 difference disappears if individuals learn about the second stage after
 earning their income or if earnings are randomly determined. This 
 suggests that our main finding is driven by selection based on
 other-regarding preferences. (JEL: D64, J31)

Title: Relational Contracts and the Value of Loyalty 
Abstract:
 This paper characterizes the optimal contract for a principal who
 repeatedly chooses among N potential agents under the threat of holdup.
 Over time, the principal would like to trade with different agents;
 however, the possibility of ex-post opportunism allows agents to collect
 rents and creates a fixed cost of initiating new relationships. In the
 optimal contract, the principal divides agents into "insiders" with whom
 she trades efficiently, and "outsiders" whom she is biased against. The
 optimal contract is self-enforcing if the principal is sufficiently
 patient and can be implemented by an "employment contract" that is robust
 to asymmetric information. (JEL: C73, D82, D83, D86)

Title: Automobiles on Steroids: Product Attribute Trade-Offs and Technological Progress in the Automobile Sector 
Abstract:
 This paper estimates the technological progress that has occurred since
 1980 in the automobile industry and the trade-offs faced when choosing
 between fuel economy, weight, and engine power characteristics. The
 results suggest that if weight, horsepower, and torque were held at their
 1980 levels, fuel economy could have increased by nearly 60 percent from
 1980 to 2006. Once technological progress is considered, meeting the CAFE
 standards adopted in 2007 will require halting the trend in weight and

 recently announced by the new administration, while attainable, require
 nontrivial "downsizing." (JEL: L50, L60)

Title: Overborrowing and Systemic Externalities in the Business Cycle 
Abstract:
 Credit constraints linking debt to market-determined prices embody a
 systemic credit externality that drives a wedge between competitive and
 constrained socially optimal equilibria, inducing private agents to
 overborrow. This externality arises because private agents fail to
 internalize the financial amplification effects of carrying a large amount
 of debt when credit constraints bind. We conduct a quantitative analysis
 of this externality in a two-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
 (DSGE) model of a small open economy calibrated to emerging markets.
 Raising the cost of borrowing during tranquil times restores constrained
 efficiency and significantly reduces the incidence and severity of
 financial crises. (JEL: E13, E32, E44, F41, G01)

Title: Stakes Matter in Ultimatum Games 
Abstract:
 One of the most robust findings in experimental economics is that
 individuals in one-shot ultimatum games reject unfair offers. Puzzlingly,
 rejections have been found robust to substantial increases in stakes. By
 using a novel experimental design that elicits frequent low offers and
 uses much larger stakes than in the literature, we are able to examine
 stakes' effects over ranges of data that are heretofore unexplored. Our
 main result is that proportionally equivalent offers are less likely to be
 rejected with high stakes. In fact, our paper is the first to present
 evidence that as stakes increase, rejection rates approach zero. (JEL:

Title: US International Equity Investment and Past and Prospective Returns 
Abstract:
 Counter to extant stylized facts, using newly available data on country
 allocations in US investors' foreign equity portfolios we find that (i) US
 investors do not exhibit returns-chasing behavior, but, consistent with
 partial portfolio rebalancing, tend to sell past winners; and (ii) US
 investors increase portfolio weights on a country's equity market just
 prior to its strong performance, behavior inconsistent with an
 informational disadvantage. Over the past two decades, US investors'
 foreign equity portfolios outperformed a value-weighted foreign benchmark
 by 160 basis points per year. (JEL: C58, G11, G15)

Title: The Cross Section of Foreign Currency Risk Premia and Consumption Growth Risk: Comment 
Abstract:
 Lustig and Verdelhan (2007) argue that the excess returns to borrowing US
 dollars and lending in foreign currency "compensate US investors for
 taking on more US consumption growth risk," yet the stochastic discount
 factor corresponding to their benchmark model is approximately
 uncorrelated with the returns they study. Hence, one cannot reject the
 null hypothesis that their model explains none of the cross sectional
 variation of the expected returns. Given this finding, and other evidence,
 I argue that the forward premium puzzle remains a puzzle. (JEL: C58, E21,

Title: The Cross-Section of Foreign Currency Risk Premia and Consumption Growth Risk: Reply 
Abstract:
 The consumption growth beta of an investment strategy that goes long in
 high interest rate currencies and short in low interest rate currencies is
 large and significant. Consumption risk price differs significantly from
 zero, even after accounting for the sampling uncertainty introduced by the
 estimation of the consumption betas. The constant in the regression of
 average returns on consumption betas is not significant. Additionally,
 this investment strategy's consumption and market betas increase during
 recessions and times of crisis, when risk prices are high, implying that
 the unconditional betas understate its riskiness. (JEL: C58, E21, F31,
 G11, G12)
