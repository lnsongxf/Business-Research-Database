Title: Optimal Interventions in Markets with Adverse Selection 
Abstract:
 We study the design of interventions to stabilize financial markets
 plagued by adverse selection. Our contribution is to analyze the
 information revealed by participation decisions. Taking part in  a
 government program carries a stigma, and outside options are mechanism
 dependent. We show that the efficiency of an intervention can be assessed
 by its impact on the market interest rate. The presence of an outside
 market determines the nature of optimal interventions and the choice of
 financial instruments (debt guarantees in our model), but it does not
 affect implementation costs. (JEL D82, D86, G01, G20, G31)

Title: Overcoming Adverse Selection: How Public Intervention Can Restore Market Functioning 
Abstract:
 The paper provides a first analysis of market jump starting and its
 two-way interaction between mechanism design and participation
 constraints. The government optimally overpays for the legacy assets and
 cleans up the market of its weakest assets, through a mixture of buybacks
 and equity injections, and leaves the firms with the strongest legacy
 assets to the market. The government reduces adverse  selection enough to
 let the market rebound, but not too much, so as to limit the cost of
 intervention. The existence of a market imposes no welfare cost. (JEL D82,

Title: Collective Moral Hazard, Maturity Mismatch, and Systemic Bailouts 
Abstract:
 The article shows that time-consistent, imperfectly targeted support to
 distressed institutions makes private leverage choices strategic
 complements. When everyone engages in maturity mismatch, authorities have
 little choice but intervening, creating both current and deferred (sowing
 the seeds of the next crisis) social costs. In turn, it is profitable to
 adopt a risky balance sheet. These insights have important consequences,
 from banks choosing to correlate their risk exposures to the need for
 macro-prudential supervision.	(JEL D82, E52, E58, G01, G21, G28)

Title: New Trade Models, Same Old Gains? 
Abstract:
 Micro-level data have had a profound influence on research in
 international trade over the last ten years. In many regards, this
 research agenda has been very successful. New stylized facts have been
 uncovered and new trade models have been developed to explain these facts.
 In this paper we investigate to what extent answers to new micro-level
 questions have affected answers to an old and central question in the
 field: how large are the welfare gains from trade? A crude summary of our
 results is: "So far, not much." (JEL F11, F12)

Title: The Environment and Directed Technical Change 
Abstract:
 This paper introduces endogenous and directed technical change in a growth
 model with environmental constraints. The final good is produced from
 "dirty" and "clean" inputs. We show that: (i) when inputs are sufficiently
 substitutable, sustainable growth can be achieved with temporary
 taxes/subsidies that redirect innovation toward clean inputs; (ii) optimal
 policy involves both "carbon taxes" and research subsidies, avoiding
 excessive use of carbon taxes; (iii) delay in intervention is costly, as
 it later necessitates a longer transition phase with slow growth; and (iv)
 use of an exhaustible resource in dirty input	production helps the switch
 to clean innovation under laissez-faire. (JEL O33, O44, Q30, Q54, Q56,

Title: Americans Do IT Better: US Multinationals and the Productivity Miracle 
Abstract:
 US productivity growth accelerated after 1995 (unlike Europe's),
 particularly in sectors that intensively use information technologies 
 (IT). Using two new micro panel datasets we show that US multinationals 
 operating in Europe also experienced a "productivity miracle." US
 multinationals obtained higher productivity from IT than non-US
 multinationals, particularly in the same sectors responsible for the US
 productivity acceleration. Furthermore, establishments taken over by US
 multinationals (but not by non-US multinationals) increased the
 productivity of their IT. Combining pan-European firm-level IT data with
 our management practices survey, we find  that the US IT related
 productivity advantage is primarily due to its tougher "people management"
 practices. (JEL D24, E23, F23, M10, M16, O30)

Title: The Value of Information in the Court: Get It Right, Keep It Tight 
Abstract:
 We estimate an equilibrium model of decision making in the US Supreme
 Court that takes into account both private information and ideological
 differences between justices. We measure the value  of information in the
 court by the probability that a justice votes differently from how she
 would have voted without case-specific information. Our results suggest a
 sizable value of information: in 44 percent of cases, justices' initial
 leanings are changed by their personal assessments of the case. Our
 results also confirm the increased politicization of the Supreme Court in
 the last quarter century. Counterfactual simulations provide implications
 for institutional design. (JEL D72, D82, D83, K10)

Title: Macroeconomic Effects of Financial Shocks 
Abstract:
 We document the cyclical properties of US firms' financial flows and show
 that equity payout is procyclical and debt payout is countercyclical. We
 then develop a model with debt and equity financing to explore how the
 dynamics of real and financial variables are affected by "financial
 shocks." We find that financial shocks contributed significantly to the
 observed dynamics of real and financial variables. The recent events in
 the financial sector show up as a tightening of firms' financing
 conditions which contributed to the 2008-2009 recession. The downturns in
 1990-1991 and 2001 were also influenced by changes in credit conditions.

Title: The Effects of Housing Assistance on Labor Supply: Evidence from a Voucher Lottery 
Abstract:
 This study estimates the effects of means-tested housing programs on labor
 supply using data from a randomized housing voucher wait-list lottery in
 Chicago. Economic theory is ambiguous about the expected sign of any labor
 supply response. We find that among working-age, able-bodied adults,
 housing voucher use reduces labor force participation by around 4
 percentage points (6 percent) and quarterly earnings by $329 (10 percent),
 and increases Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program
 participation by around 2 percentage points (15 percent). We find no
 evidence that the housing-specific mechanisms hypothesized to promote
 work, such as neighborhood quality or residential stability, are important
 empirically. (JEL I38, J22, R23, R38)

Title: Standard Setting Committees: Consensus Governance for Shared Technology Platforms 
Abstract:
 Voluntary Standard Setting Organizations (SSOs) use a consensus process to
 create new compatibility standards. Practitioners have suggested that SSOs
 are increasingly politicized and perhaps incapable of producing timely
 standards. This article develops a simple model of standard setting
 committees and tests its predictions using data from the Internet
 Engineering Task Force, an SSO that produces many of the standards used to
 run the Internet. The results show that  an observed slowdown in standards
 production between 1993 and 2003 can be linked to distributional conflicts
 created by the rapid commercialization of the Internet. (JEL C78, L15,

Title: A Continuous Dilemma 
Abstract:
 We study prisoners' dilemmas played in continuous time with flow payoffs
 accumulated over 60 seconds. In most cases, the median rate of mutual
 cooperation is about 90 percent. Control sessions with repeated matchings
 over eight subperiods achieve less than half as much cooperation, and
 cooperation rates approach zero in one-shot sessions. In follow-up
 sessions with a variable number of subperiods, cooperation rates increase
 nearly linearly as the grid size decreases, and, with one-second
 subperiods, they approach continuous levels. Our data support a strand of
 theory that explains how capacity to respond rapidly stabilizes
 cooperation and destabilizes defection in the prisoner's dilemma. (JEL

Title: Understanding International Prices: Customers as Capital 
Abstract:
 The article develops a new theory of pricing to market driven by dynamic
 frictions of building market shares. Our key innovation is a capital
 theoretic model of marketing in which relations with customers are
 valuable. We discipline the introduced friction using data on differences
 between short-run and long-run price elasticity of international  trade
 flows. We show that the model accounts for several pricing "puzzles" of
 international macroeconomics. (JEL E13, F14, F31, F41, F44, M31)

Title: Testing Efficient Risk Sharing with Heterogeneous Risk Preferences 
Abstract:
 We propose a method that enables one to test efficient risk sharing even
 when households have different risk preferences. The method is composed of
 three tests. The first one determines whether in the data households have
 homogeneous risk preferences. The second and third tests evaluate
 efficient risk sharing when the hypothesis of homogeneous risk preferences
 is rejected. We use this method to test efficient risk sharing in rural
 India. Using the first test, we strongly reject the hypothesis of
 identical risk preferences. Using the second and third tests, we reject
 efficiency at the village but not at the caste level. (JEL D12, D86, G22,

Title: A Structural Analysis of Disappointment Aversion in a Real Effort Competition 
Abstract:
 We develop a novel computerized real effort task, based on moving sliders

 averse when they compete in a real effort sequential-move tournament. We
 predict that a disappointment averse agent, who is loss averse around her
 endogenous choice-acclimating expectations-based reference point, responds
 negatively to her rival's effort. We find significant evidence for this
 discouragement effect, and use the Method of Simulated Moments to estimate
 the strength of disappointment aversion on average and the heterogeneity
 in disappointment aversion across the population. (JEL C91, D12, D81, D84)

Title: Why Don't We See Poverty Convergence? 
Abstract:
 Average living standards are converging among developing countries and
 faster growing economies see more progress against poverty. Yet we do not
 find poverty convergence; countries starting with higher poverty rates do
 not see higher proportionate rates of poverty reduction. The paper tries
 to explain why. Analysis of a new dataset suggests that, at given mean
 consumption, high initial poverty has an adverse effect on  consumption
 growth and also makes growth less poverty-reducing. Thus, for many poor
 countries, the growth advantage of starting out with a low mean is lost
 due to a high incidence of poverty. (JEL D63, I31, I32, O15)

Title: Was the New Deal Contractionary? 
Abstract:
 Can government policies that increase the monopoly power of firms and the
 militancy of unions increase output? This paper shows that the answer is
 yes under certain "emergency" conditions. These emergency conditions--zero
 interest rates and deflation--were satisfied during the Great Depression
 in the United States. The New Deal, which facilitated monopolies and union
 militancy, was therefore expansionary in  the model presented. This
 conclusion is contrary to a large previous literature. The main reason for
 this divergence is that this paper incorporates rigid prices and the zero
 bound on the short-term interest rate.  (JEL E23, E32, E52, E62, J51, N12,

Title: The Internet and Local Wages: A Puzzle 
Abstract:
 How did the diffusion of the internet affect regional wage inequality? We
 examine the relationship between business investment in advanced internet
 technology and local variation in US wage growth between 1995 and 2000. We
 identify a puzzle. The internet  is widespread, but the economic payoffs
 are not. Advanced internet technology is only associated with substantial
 wage growth in the 6 percent of counties that were already highly wealthy,
 educated, and populated and had IT-intensive industry. Advanced internet
 and wage growth appear unrelated elsewhere. Overall, advanced internet
 explains over half the difference in wage growth between already well-off
 counties and all others. (JEL J31, L86, O33, R11, R23)

Title: The Impact of Shrouded Fees: Evidence from a Natural Experiment in the Indian Mutual Funds Market 
Abstract:
 We study a natural experiment in the Indian mutual funds sector that
 created a 22-month period in which closed-end funds were allowed to charge
 an arguably shrouded fee, whereas open-end funds were forced to charge
 entry loads. Forty-five new closed-end funds were started during this
 period, collecting $7.6 billion US, whereas only two closed-end funds were
 started in the 66 months prior to this period, collecting $42 billion US,
 and no closed-end funds were started in the 20 months after this period.
 We estimate that investors lost and fund firms gained approximately $350
 million US due to this shrouding. (JEL D14, G23, G28, O16)

Title: Efficient Pollution Regulation: Getting the Prices Right: Comment 
Abstract:
 The cost-effectiveness of cap-and-trade emissions regulations has become
 widely  accepted. A 2009 proposal by Muller and Mendelsohn would replace
 conventional ton-for-ton trading with trading based on estimates of
 marginal damages by pollutant and by source. This proposal faces
 difficulties arising from the negative marginal damage
 estimates--neglected in Muller and Mendelsohn (2009)--for nitrogen oxide
 (NO<sub>x</sub>) emissions from many urban counties. Such estimates imply
 nonconvexities in air chemistry that complicate trading and could result
 in trades that increase emissions by both buyer and seller. Uncertainty in
 source-specific damages also creates rent-seeking opportunities and the
 potential for costly litigation. (JEL H53, Q53, Q58)

Title: Efficient Pollution Regulation: Getting the Prices Right: Reply 
Abstract:
 Fraas and Lutter raise two important points in their comment on Muller and
 Mendelsohn (2009): How to design policies for sources that yield negative
 marginal damages? How does statistical uncertainty in the marginal damages
 affect the trading ratios across emitters? We address both issues in this
 response. (JEL H53, Q53, Q58)
