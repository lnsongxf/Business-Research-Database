Title: Comparing Real Wage Rates: Presidential Address 
Abstract:
 A real wage rate is a nominal wage rate divided by the price of a good and
 is a transparent measure of how much of the good an hour of work buys. It
 provides an important indicator of the living standards of workers, and
 also of the productivity of workers. In this paper I set out the
 conceptual basis for such measures, provide some historical examples, and
 then provide my own preliminary analysis of a decade long project designed
 to measure the wages of workers doing the same job in over 60
 countries--workers at McDonald's  restaurants. The results demonstrate
 that the wage rates of workers using the same skills and doing the same
 jobs differ by as much as 10 to 1, and that these gaps declined over the
 period 2000-2007, but with much less progress since the Great Recession.

Title: The Welfare Effects of Bundling in Multichannel Television Markets 
Abstract:
 We measure how the bundling of television channels affects short-run 
 welfare. We estimate an industry model of viewership, demand, pricing,
 bundling, and input-market bargaining using data on ratings, purchases,
 prices, bundles, and input costs. We conduct simulations of a la carte
 policies that require distributors to offer individual channels for sale
 to consumers. We estimate that negotiated input costs rise by 103.0
 percent under a la carte. These higher input costs offset consumer
 benefits from purchasing individual channels. Mean consumer and total
 surplus change by an estimated -- 5.4 to 0.2 percent and -- 1.7 to 6.0
 percent, respectively. (JEL D12, L11, L51, L82, M31)

Title: The Use of Full-Line Forcing Contracts in the Video Rental Industry 
Abstract:
 Bundling is at the forefront of many policy debates as new technologies 
 allow firms to implement more complex bundling arrangements. Realistic
 analyses of bundling--particularly between suppliers and
 retailers--require detailed data on both supply arrangements and consumer
 demand. We analyze firms' use of bundling as a vertical restraint (known
 as full-line forcing) using extensive supply and demand data from the
 video rental industry. Our model captures key details of the market that
 determine firms' contractual choices, and sheds light on the implications
 of these decisions. The empirical approach provides a model for how to
 analyze bundling when detailed data are available. (JEL D86, L14, L81,

Title: Slow to Anger and Fast to Forgive: Cooperation in an Uncertain World 
Abstract:
 We study the experimental play of the repeated prisoner's dilemma when
 intended actions are implemented with noise. In treatments where
 cooperation is an equilibrium, subjects cooperate substantially more than
 in treatments without cooperative equilibria. In all  settings there was
 considerable strategic diversity, indicating that subjects had not fully
 learned the distribution of play. Furthermore, cooperative strategies
 yielded higher payoffs than uncooperative strategies in the treatments
 with cooperative equilibria. In these treatments successful strategies
 were "lenient" in not retaliating for the first defection, and many were
 "forgiving" in trying to return to cooperation after inflicting a
 punishment. (JEL C72, C73, D81)

Title: Relational Contracts and the Value of Relationships 
Abstract:
 This article studies optimal relational contracts when the value of the
 relationship between contracting parties is not commonly known. I consider
 a principal-agent setting where the principal has persistent  private
 information about her outside option. I show that if the principal has the
 bargaining power, she wants to understate her outside option to provide
 strong incentives and then renege on promised payments, while if the
 uninformed agent has the bargaining  power, the principal wants to
 overstate her outside option to capture more surplus. I characterize how
 information is revealed, how the relationship evolves, and how this
 depends on bargaining power. (JEL C78, D82, D83, D86)

Title: Competition through Commissions and Kickbacks 
Abstract:
 In markets for retail financial products and health services, consumers 
 often rely on the advice of intermediaries to decide which specialized
 offering best fits their needs. Product providers, in turn, compete to
 influence the intermediaries' advice through hidden kickbacks or disclosed
 commissions. Motivated by the controversial role of these widespread
 practices, we formulate a model to analyze competition  through
 commissions from a positive and normative standpoint. The model highlights
 the role of commissions in making the advisor responsive to supply-side
 incentives. We characterize situations when commonly adopted policies such
 as mandatory disclosure  and caps on commissions have unintended welfare
 consequences. (JEL D21, D82, D83, G21, L15, L25)

Title: Screening, Competition, and Job Design: Economic Origins of Good Jobs 
Abstract:
 High-performance work systems give workers more discretion, thereby
 increasing effort productivity but also shirking opportunities. We show
 experimentally that screening for work attitude and labor market
 competition are causal determinants of the viability of high-performance
 work systems, and we identify the complementarities between discretion,
 rent-sharing, and screening that render them profitable. Two fundamentally
 distinct job designs emerge endogenously in our experiments: "bad" jobs
 with low discretion, low wages, and little rent-sharing, and "good" jobs
 with high discretion, high wages, and substantial rent-sharing. Good jobs
 are profitable only if employees can be screened, and labor market
 competition fosters their dissemination. (JEL D12, D82, J24, J31, J41,

Title: Thar She Bursts: Reducing Confusion Reduces Bubbles 
Abstract:
 To explore why bubbles frequently emerge in the experimental asset market
 model of Smith, Suchanek, and Williams (1988), we vary the fundamental
 value process (constant or declining) and the cash-to-asset value ratio
 (constant or increasing). We observe high mispricing  in treatments with a
 declining fundamental value, while overvaluation emerges when coupled with
 an increasing C/A ratio. A questionnaire reveals that the declining
 fundamental value process  confuses subjects, as they expect the
 fundamental value to stay constant. Running the experiment with a
 different context ("stocks of a depletable gold mine" instead of "stocks")
 significantly reduces mispricing and overvaluation as it reduces
 confusion. (JEL C91, D14, G11, G12)

Title: Information and Industry Dynamics 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a model of industry dynamics where firms compete to

 on firm and industry dynamics. As an application of the model, the effects
 of a decline in the cost of information dissemination on firm and industry
 dynamics are explored. (JEL D11, D83, L11, L81, M37)

Title: Carrot or Stick? The Evolution of Reciprocal Preferences in a Haystack Model 
Abstract:
 We study the evolution of both characteristics of reciprocity: the 
 willingness to reward and the willingness to punish. First, both 
 preferences for rewarding and preferences for punishing can survive 
 provided that individuals interact within separate groups. Second,
 rewarders survive only in coexistence with self-interested preferences,
 but punishers either vanish or dominate the population entirely. Third,
 the evolution of preferences for rewarding and the evolution of
 preferences for punishing influence each other decisively. Rewarders can
 invade a population of self-interested players.  The existence of
 rewarders enhances the evolutionary success of punishers, who then crowd
 out all other preferences. (JEL C71, C72, C73, D64, K42)

Title: Violent Conflict and Behavior: A Field Experiment in Burundi 
Abstract:
 We use a series of field experiments in rural Burundi to examine the
 impact of exposure to conflict on social, risk, and time preferences. We
 find that conflict affects behavior: individuals exposed to violence
 display more altruistic behavior towards their neighbors, are more
 risk-seeking, and have higher discount rates. Large adverse shocks can
 thus alter savings and investments decisions, and potentially have
 long-run consequences--even if the shocks themselves are temporary. (JEL

Title: What Do Emissions Markets Deliver and to Whom? Evidence from Southern California's NOx Trading Program 
Abstract:
 An advantage of cap-and-trade programs over more prescriptive
 environmental regulation is that compliance flexibility and cost
 effectiveness can make more stringent emissions reductions politically
 feasible. However, when markets (versus regulators) determine where
 emissions occur, it becomes more difficult to assure that mandated
 emissions reductions are equitably achieved. We investigate these issues
 in the context of Southern California's RECLAIM program  by matching
 facilities in RECLAIM with similar California facilities also in
 nonattainment areas. Our results indicate that average emissions fell 20
 percent at RECLAIM facilities relative to our counterfactual. Furthermore,
 observed changes in emissions do not vary significantly with neighborhood
 demographic characteristics. (JEL H23, L51, Q53, Q58)

Title: Measuring Economic Growth from Outer Space 
Abstract:
 We develop a statistical framework to use satellite data on night lights
 to augment official income growth measures. For countries with poor
 national income accounts, the optimal estimate of growth is a composite
 with roughly equal weights on conventionally measured growth and growth
 predicted from lights. Our estimates differ from official data by up to
 three percentage points annually. Using lights, empirical analyses of
 growth need no longer use countries as the unit of analysis; we can
 measure growth for sub- and supranational regions. We show, for example,
 that coastal areas  in sub-Saharan Africa are growing slower than the
 hinterland. (JEL E01, E23, O11, 047, 057)

Title: Credit Booms Gone Bust: Monetary Policy, Leverage Cycles, and Financial Crises, 1870-2008 
Abstract:
 The financial crisis has refocused attention on money and credit
 fluctuations, financial crises, and policy responses. We study the
 behavior of money, credit, and macroeconomic indicators over the long run
 based on a new historical dataset for 14 countries over the years
 1870-2008. Total credit has increased strongly relative to output and
 money in the second half of the twentieth century. Monetary policy
 responses to financial crises have also been more aggressive, but the
 output costs of crises have remained large. Credit growth is a powerful
 predictor of financial crises, suggesting that policymakers ignore credit
 at their peril. (JEL E32, E44, E52, G01, N10, N20)

Title: What Drives US Foreign Borrowing? Evidence on the External Adjustment to Transitory and Permanent Shocks 
Abstract:
 The joint dynamics of US net output, consumption, and (the market value
 of) foreign assets and liabilities, characterized empirically following
 Lettau and Ludvigson (2004), is shown to be consistent with current
 account theory. US consumption is virtually insulated from transitory
 shocks, while these contribute to variations in net output and gross
 foreign positions--consumption is smoothed against temporary fluctuations
 in returns. A single permanent shock--naturally interpreted as a supply
 shock--raises consumption swiftly while causing net output to adjust
 gradually. This leads to persistent, procyclical external deficits, while
 moving gross assets and liabilities in the same direction. (JEL E21, E23,

Title: International Income Inequality: Measuring PPP Bias by Estimating Engel Curves for Food 
Abstract:
 Purchasing power-adjusted incomes applied in cross-country comparisons are
 measured with bias. This paper estimates the purchasing power parity (PPP)
 bias in Penn World Table incomes and provides corrected incomes. The bias
 is substantial and systematic: the poorer a country, the more its income
 tends to be overestimated. Consequently, international income inequality
 is substantially underestimated. The methodological contribution is to
 exploit the analogies between PPP bias and the bias in consumer price
 index (CPI) numbers. The PPP bias and subsequent corrected incomes are
 measured by estimating Engel curves for food, an established method of
 measuring CPI bias. (JEL C43, D31, E31, O11, O12)

Title: Behavioral Foundations of Microcredit: Experimental and Survey Evidence from Rural India 
Abstract:
 We use experimental measures of time discounting and risk aversion for
 villagers in south India to highlight behavioral features of microcredit,
 a financial tool designed to reduce poverty and fix credit market
 imperfections. The evidence suggests that microcredit contracts may do
 more than reduce moral hazard and adverse selection by imposing new forms
 of discipline on borrowers. We find that, conditional on borrowing from
 any source, women with present-biased preferences are more likely than
 others to borrow through microcredit institutions. Another particular
 contribution of microcredit may thus be to provide helpful structure for
 borrowers seeking self-discipline. (JEL G21, I38, O15, O16, O18)

Title: Search, Design, and Market Structure 
Abstract:
 The Internet has made consumer search easier, with consequences for
 prices, industry structure, and the kinds of products offered. We provide
 an industry model with strategic design choices that explores these
 issues. A polarized market structure results: some firms choose designs
 aimed at broad-based audiences, while others target narrow niches. We
 analyze the effect of reduced search costs, finding results consistent
 with the reported prevalence of niche goods and long-tail and superstar
 phenomena. In particular, the model suggests that long-tail effects arise
 when there is a wide range of potential designs, relative to vertical
 heterogeneity among firms. (JEL D11, D21, D83, L11, L86, M31)

Title: Paying a Premium on Your Premium? Consolidation in the US Health Insurance Industry 
Abstract:
 We examine whether and to what extent consolidation in the US health
 insurance industry has contributed to higher employer-sponsored insurance
 premiums. We exploit the differential impact across local markets of a
 national merger of two insurers to identify the causal effect of
 concentration on premiums. Using data for large groups, we estimate
 premiums in average markets were approximately seven percentage points
 higher by 2007 due to increases in local concentration from 1998-2006. We
 also find evidence consolidation facilitates the exercise of monopsonistic
 power vis-a-vis physicians, leading to reductions in their absolute
 employment and earnings relative to other healthcare workers. (JEL G22,
