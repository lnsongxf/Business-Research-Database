Title: Simple Market Equilibria with Rationally Inattentive Consumers 
Abstract:
 We study a market with rationally inattentive consumers who are unsure of
 the terms of the offers made by firms, but can acquire information about
 the terms at a cost.  In a symmetric equilibrium, the price set by firms
 is continuously increasing in the cost of information for consumers and
 decreasing in the number of firms operating.  In addition, favorable a
 priori information about a firm leads it to set a higher price, and a new
 entrant can increase demand for incumbents.  When consumers have
 heterogeneous costs of information, firms selling low-quality products may
 choose to set the highest prices.

Title: Information Processing and Limited Liability 
Abstract:
 Decision-makers often face limited liability and thus know that their loss
 will be bounded. We study how limited liability affects the behavior of an
 agent who chooses how much information to acquire and process in order to
 take a good decision. We find that an agent facing limited liability
 processes less information than an agent with unlimited liability. The
 informational gap between the two agents is larger in bad times than in
 good times and when information is more costly to process.

Title: Information Choice Technologies 
Abstract:
 Theories based on information costs or frictions have become increasing
 popular in macroeconomics and macro-finance. The literature has used
 various types of information choices, such as rational inattention,
 inattentiveness, information markets and costly precision. Using a unified
 framework, we compare these different information choice technologies and
 explain why some generate increasing returns and others, particularly
 those where agents choose how much public information to observe, generate
 multiple equilibria. The results can help applied theorists to choose the
 appropriate information choice technology for their application and to
 understand the consequences of that modeling choice.

Title: Prospect Theory as Efficient Perceptual Distortion 
Abstract:
 The paper proposes a theory of efficient perceptual distortions, in which
 the statistical relation between subjective perceptions and the objective
 state minimizes the error of the state estimate, subject to a constraint
 on information processing capacity. The theory is shown to account for
 observed limits to the accuracy of visual perception, and then postulated
 to apply to perception of options in economic choice situations as well.
 When applied to choice between lotteries, it implies reference-dependent
 valuations, and predicts both risk-aversion with respect to gains and
 risk-seeking with respect to losses, as in the prospect theory of Kahneman
 and Tversky (1979).

Title: Salience in Experimental Tests of the Endowment Effect 
Abstract:
 We provide a novel account of experimental evidence for the endowment
 effect using the salience mechanism (Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer,
 2011). The two-stage procedure implemented in experiments implies that the
 endowed good and other goods are evaluated in different contexts.  We
 describe conditions under which the standard effect occurs, but also
 account for recent evidence such as a reverse endowment effect for bads
 and a role for reference prices in modulating the WTA-WTP gap.

Title: Getting at Systemic Risk via an Agent-Based Model of the Housing Market 
Abstract:
 Systemic risk must include the housing market, though economists have not
 generally focused on it.  We begin construction of an agent-based model of
 the housing market with individual data from Washington, DC.  Twenty years
 of success with agent-based models of mortgage prepayments give us hope
 that such a model could be useful. Preliminary analysis suggests that the
 housing boom and bust of 1997-2007 was due in large part to changes in
 leverage rather than interest rates.

Title: Capital Shortfall: A New Approach to Ranking and Regulating Systemic Risks 
Abstract:
 The financial crisis of 2007-2009 has given way to the sovereign debt
 crisis of 2010-2012, yet many of the banking issues remain the same.  We
 discuss a method to estimate the capital that a financial firm would need
 to raise if we have another financial crisis.	This measure of capital
 shortfall is based on publicly available information but is conceptually
 similar to the stress tests conducted by US and European regulators.  We
 argue that this measure summarizes the major characteristics of systemic
 risk and provides a reliable interpretation of the past and current
 financial crises.

Title: Privacy-Preserving Methods for Sharing Financial Risk Exposures 
Abstract:
 The financial industry relies on trade secrecy to protect its business
 processes and methods, which can obscure critical financial risk exposures
 from regulators and the public.  Using results from cryptography, we
 develop computationally tractable protocols for sharing and aggregating
 such risk exposures that protect the privacy of all parties involved,
 without the need for trusted third parties.  Financial institutions can
 share aggregate statistics such as Herfindahl indexes, variances, and
 correlations without revealing proprietary data.  Potential applications
 include: privacy-preserving real-time indexes of bank capital and leverage
 ratios; monitoring delegated portfolio investments; financial audits; and
 public indexes of proprietary trading strategies.

Title: Fiscal Policy and the Great Recession in the Euro Area 
Abstract:
 How much did fiscal policy contribute to euro area real GDP growth during
 the Great Recession? We estimate that discretionary fiscal measures have
 increased annualized quarterly real GDP growth during the crisis by up to
 1.6 percentage points. We obtain our result by using an extended version
 of the European Central Bank's New Area-Wide Model with a rich
 specification of the fiscal sector. A detailed modeling of the fiscal
 sector and the incorporation of as many as eight fiscal time series appear
 pivotal for our result.

Title: Fiscal Policy in a Financial Crisis: Standard Policy versus Bank Rescue Measures 
Abstract:
 A key dimension of fiscal policy during the financial crisis was massive
 government support for the banking system. The macroeconomic effects of
 that support have, so far, received little attention in the literature.
 This paper fills this gap, using a quantitative dynamic model with a
 banking sector. Our results suggest that state aid for banks may have a
 strong positive effect on real activity. Bank state aid multipliers are in
 the same range as conventional fiscal spending multipliers. Support for
 banks has a positive effect on investment, while a rise in government
 purchases crowds out investment.

Title: Bubbles and Total Factor Productivity 
Abstract:
 This paper presents an infinite-horizon model of production economies in
 which firms face idiosyncratic productivity shocks and are subject to
 endogenous credit constraints. Credit-driven stock price bubbles can arise
 which can relax credit constraints and reallocate capital more efficiently
 among firms. The collapse of bubbles causes a fall of total factor
 productivity.

Title: Debt Financing in Asset Markets 
Abstract:
 We study rollover risk and collateral value in a dynamic asset pricing
 model with endogenous debt financing by extending the framework of
 Geanakoplos (2009) with a generic binomial tree and time-varying
 heterogeneous beliefs. Optimistic borrowers face rollover risk if the
 belief dispersion between the borrowers and the pessimistic lenders widens
 after interim bad news. We demonstrate the optimality of the maximum
 riskless short-term debt financing for optimistic borrowers even in the
 presence of the rollover risk. We also highlight the role of interim
 trading which, by allowing creditors to sell seized collateral to other
 optimists with saved cashes, boosts the asset's collateral value and
 equilibrium price.

Title: Understanding Bubbly Episodes 
Abstract:
 Over the last two decades US aggregate wealth has fluctuated
 substantially. Against the backdrop of the Great Recession, the effects of
 these boom-and-bust cycles have come to dominate academic and policy
 discussions. How can we explain these fluctuations in wealth? Why are
 these fluctuations associated with changes in consumption, investment and
 output? In this note, we argue that answers to these questions entail the
 addition of two ingredients to existent macroeconomic models: rational
 bubbles and financial frictions. We explain why each of these building
 blocks is crucial to understand recent events and how they can be
 seamlessly integrated in standard models.

Title: The Safe-Asset Share 
Abstract:
 We document that the percentage of all U.S. assets that are "safe" has
 remained stable at about 33 percent since 1952.  This stable ratio is a
 rare example of calm in a rapidly changing financial world.  Over the same
 time period, the ratio of U.S. assets to GDP has increased by a factor of
 2.5, and the main supplier of safe financial debt has shifted from
 commercial banks to the "shadow banking system."  We analyze this pattern
 of stylized facts and offer some tentative conclusions about the
 composition of the safe-asset share and its role within the overall
 economy.

Title: Limited-Purpose Banking--Moving from "Trust Me" to "Show Me" Banking 
Abstract:
 There are many alleged culprits for the bank runs of 2008 and their
 devastating economic fallout.	But proprietary information and leverage
 top our list. Claims of proprietary information forced financial markets
 to operate on trust, while providing the perfect breeding ground for
 fraud.  And leverage permitted creditors to run at the first whiff of
 fraud, leveling one financial giant after another.  Limited Purpose
 Banking (LPB), presented here, is a financial reform that sharply curtails
 proprietary information and eliminates leverage and, thus, the possibility
 of financial collapse.  LPB's adoption is supported by our simple model
 showing how fraud can destroy finance.

Abstract:
 When a city experiences a decline in income or population, do all
 neighborhoods within the city decline equally? Or, do some neighborhoods
 decline more than others?  What are the characteristics of the
 neighborhoods that decline the most?	We answer these questions by
 looking at what happened to neighborhoods within Detroit as Detroit
 experienced a sharp decline in income and population from the 1980s to the
 late 2000s. We find patterns of changes in income and population that are
 consistent with the model and empirical patterns of gentrification
 presented in Guerrieri, Hartley, and Hurst (2011), only playing out in
 reverse.

Title: Housing Booms and City Centers 
Abstract:
 Popular discussions often treat the great housing boom of the 1996-2006
 period as if it were a national phenomenon with similar impacts across
 locales, but across metropolitan areas, price growth was dramatically
 higher in warmer, less educated cities with less initial density and
 higher initial housing values.  Within metropolitan areas, price growth
 was faster in neighborhoods closer to the city center.  The centralization
 of price growth during the boom was particularly dramatic in those
 metropolitan areas where income is higher away from the city center.  We
 consider a number of different explanations for this connection, and find
 that the connection between centralized price growth and decentralized
 income seems to be most explained by the faster price growth in central
 cities that use relatively more public transit.

Title: Heterogeneity in Neighborhood-Level Price Growth in the United States, 1993-2009 
Abstract:
 Examination of detailed geographical information on U.S. housing
 transactions from 1993 to 2009 find much heterogeneity at the neighborhood
 level in when the recent boom began, how big the initial jumps in price
 growth were, how long the booms lasted, and what types of neighborhoods
 boomed first.	There is less neighborhood-level heterogeneity in when the
 bust began and in aggregate price appreciation during the boom.  This
 heterogeneity suggests that there was no one dominant cause of the boom. 
 We also comment on how very local data may help understand the role of
 contagion, among other housing market phenomena.

Title: Market Prices of Risk with Diverse Beliefs, Learning, and Catastrophes 
Abstract:
 We compare market prices of risk in economies with identical patterns of
 endowments, priors, and information flows, but two different market
 structures, one with complete markets, another in which consumers can
 trade only a single risk-free bond. We study how opportunities to
 speculate, uncommon priors, and learning  affect market prices of risk.
 Two types of consumers have diverse beliefs about the law of motion for a
 random exogenous endowment. One type knows the true law of motion while
 the other type learns about it via Bayes' theorem. Less-well-informed
 consumers are pessimistic, initially overestimating the probability of a
 catastrophic state. Learning dynamics and the wealth dynamics that they
 drive contribute to differences in evolutions of market prices of risk
 across market structures.

Title: Financial Innovation and Asset Price Volatility 
Abstract:
 We compare asset prices in an overlapping generations model for incomplete
 and complete markets. Individuals within a generational cohort have
 heterogeneous beliefs about future states of the economy and thus would
 like to make bets against each other. In the incomplete-markets economy,
 agents cannot make such bets. Asset price volatility is very small. The
 situation changes dramatically when markets are completed through
 financial innovations as the set of available securities now allows agents
 with different beliefs to place bets against each other. Wealth shifts
 across agents and generations. Such changes in the wealth distribution
 lead to substantial asset price volatility.

 We characterize the equilibrium of a two-country, two-good economy in
 which agents have opposite preference bias toward one of the two
 consumption goods and fear model misspecification. We document that
 disagreement about endowments' growth prospects is a persistent endogenous
 outcome of this class of economies.

Title: Heterogeneous Beliefs, Wealth Distribution, and Asset Markets with Risk of Default 
Abstract:
 We study asset markets and wealth dynamics in the economy with
 heterogeneous beliefs and risk of default. Agents can trade a full set of
 Arrow securities but are allowed to default on their delivery promises.
 Financial markets rationally subject agents to the endogenous "no-default"
 borrowing limits. Because of the rich menu of financial assets traded in
 the market speculation opportunities are plentiful. Financial wealth is
 volatile and the endogenous borrowing limits are always active. Variance
 of the asset returns is amplified. The asset trading volume is substantial
 and volatile.

Title: Estimating Sovereign Default Risk 
Abstract:
 This paper uses Bayesian methods to estimate the sovereign default
 probability for Greece and Italy in the post-EMU period. We build a real
 business cycle model that allows for interactions among fiscal policy
 instruments, sovereign default risk, and a "fiscal limit," which measures
 the maximum level of debt the government is willing to finance. We
 estimate the full nonlinear model using likelihood inference methods.
 Although we find that Greece historically had a lower default probability
 than Italy for a given debt level, our estimates suggest that the Italian
 government is more willing to service debt than the Greek government.

Title: Evolving Monetary/Fiscal Policy Mix in the United States 
Abstract:
 A micro-founded model that allows for changes in the monetary/fiscal
 policy mix and in the volatility of structural shocks is fit to US
 post-WWII data. Agents are aware of the possibility of regime changes and
 their beliefs have an impact on the law of motion of the macroeconomy. The
 results show that the '60s and the '70s were characterized by a prolonged
 period of active fiscal policy and passive monetary policy. The
 appointment of Volcker marked a change in the conduct of monetary policy,
 but it took almost ten years for the fiscal authority to start
 accommodating this regime change.

Title: Monetary-Fiscal Policy Interactions and Indeterminacy in Postwar US Data 
Abstract:
 Using a micro-founded model and a likelihood-based inference method, we
 show that while a passive monetary and passive fiscal policy regime
 prevailed in the U.S. before Paul Volcker's chairmanship at the Federal
 Reserve, an active monetary and passive fiscal policy regime prevailed
 after his appointment.  Since both monetary and fiscal policies were
 passive pre-Volcker, equilibrium indeterminacy was a feature of the
 economy. Finally, pre-Volcker, the effects of unanticipated policy shifts
 were substantially different from those predicted by conventional monetary
 models: unanticipated increases in interest rates increased inflation and
 output, while unanticipated increases in lump-sum taxes decreased
 inflation and output.

Title: Real Exchange Rate Adjustment in and out of the Eurozone 
Abstract:
 It is often suggested that currency unions unduly inhibit the efficient
 adjustment of real exchange rates. Recently, this has been seen as a key
 failure of the Eurozone. This paper presents evidence that throws doubt on
 this conclusion. Our evidence suggests that real exchange rate movement
 within the Eurozone was at least as compatible with efficient adjustment
 as the behavior of real exchange rates for the floating rate countries
 outside the Eurozone. This interpretation is consistent with a model in
 which nominal exchange rate movements give rise to persistent deviations
 from the law of one price in traded goods.

Title: Fiscal Consolidation in an Open Economy 
Abstract:
 his paper uses a New Keynesian DSGE model of a small open economy to
 compare how the effects of fiscal consolidation differ depending on
 whether monetary policy is constrained by currency union membership or by
 the zero lower bound on policy rates. We show that there are important
 differences in the impact of fiscal shocks across these monetary regimes
 that depend both on the duration of the zero lower bound and on features
 that determine the responsiveness of inflation.

Title: Managing Currency Pegs 
Abstract:
 The combination of a fixed exchange rate and downward nominal wage
 rigidity creates a real rigidity.  In turn, this real rigidity makes the
 economy prone to involuntary unemployment  during external crises. This
 paper presents a graphical analysis of alternative policy strategies aimed
 at mitigating this source of inefficiency.  First- and second-best
 monetary and fiscal solutions are analyzed.  Second-best solutions are
 prudential, whereas first-best solutions  are not.

Title: Can Asia Overcome the IMF Stigma? 
Abstract:
 Asian countries still have the IMF stigma, which originates from the
 experiences of the Asian crisis of 1997-98. The feeling of being unfairly
 treated grew even stronger afterward. The Asian countries built large
 foreign reserves, carried out structural reforms, and became even stronger
 than pre- crisis period. Asians are confident in not repeating the same
 mistake of falling into a crisis with too much external borrowing. Whether
 IMF can entice Asia to new precautionary liquidities facilities remains
 uncertain. Asia may choose either to focus on completing a regional safety
 net or to engage in IMF, demanding for a greater voice and votes.

Title: International Liquidity in a Multipolar World 
Abstract:
 Today's global monetary and financial system, to a remarkable extent,
 continues to rely on the U.S. dollar for international liquidity.  This
 reflects the currency's historic role, the liquidity of American financial
 markets, and the absence of alternatives.  But with the emergence of
 emerging markets, the capacity of the United States to provide safe assets
 will be outstripped by the growth of international transactions.  It is
 thus likely that other large economies, presumably Europe and China, will
 eventually join the United States as sources of international liquidity
 and that other currencies will come to share the dollar's reserve-currency
 status.

Title: Follow the Money: Quantifying Domestic Effects of Foreign Bank Shocks in the Great Recession 
Abstract:
 Foreign banks pulled significant funding from their US branches during the
 Great Recession. We estimate that the average-sized branch experienced a
 twelve percent net internal fund "withdrawal," with the fund transfer
 disproportionately bigger for larger branches. This internal shock to the
 balance sheet of US branches of foreign banks had sizable effects on their
 lending. On average, for each dollar of funds transferred internally to
 the parent, branches decreased lending supply by about forty to fifty
 cents. However, the extent of the lending effects was very different
 across branches depending on their pre-crisis modes of operation in the
 United States.

Title: Flight Home, Flight Abroad, and International Credit Cycles 
Abstract:
 This paper shows that banks exhibit a weaker (stronger) home bias in the
 extension of new loans when funding conditions in their home country
 improve (deteriorate). We refer to these changes in home bias as flight
 abroad and flight home effects, respectively, and show that they are
 unrelated to the better known flight to quality effect that arises during
 periods of market turmoil. Our results also indicate that global banks
 amplify the effect of homegrown shocks on foreign countries while they are
 a stabilizing factor for the supply of credit in their home countries.

Title: From Financial Crisis to Great Recession: The Role of Globalized Banks 
Abstract:
 This paper provides evidence of the role of globalized banks in
 transmitting financial stresses to the real economy during the global
 financial crisis. A novel dataset is constructed from quarterly balance
 sheet reports provided by all UK-resident banks to the Bank of England. I
 find that the shock to bank funding from non-resident creditors was
 transmitted domestically through a significant reduction in bank credit
 supply. Resident subsidiaries and branches of foreign-owned banks reduced
 lending by a larger amount than domestically-owned banks, while the latter
 calibrated the reduction in domestic lending more closely to the size of
 the funding shock.

Title: International Shock Transmission after the Lehman Brothers Collapse: Evidence from Syndicated Lending 
Abstract:
 After Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, cross-border
 bank lending contracted sharply. To explain the severity and variation in
 this contraction, we analyze detailed data on cross-border syndicated
 lending by 75 banks to 59 countries. We find that banks which had to write
 down sub-prime assets, refinance large amounts of long-term debt, and
 which experienced sharp declines in their market-to-book ratio,
 transmitted these shocks across borders by curtailing their lending
 abroad. While shocked banks differentiated between countries in much the
 same way as less constrained banks, they restricted their lending more to
 small borrowers.

Title: Moving to Higher Ground: Migration Response to Natural Disasters in the Early Twentieth Century 
Abstract:
 Areas differ in their propensity to experience natural disasters. Exposure
 to disaster risks can be reduced either through migration (i.e.,
 self-protection) or through public infrastructure investment (e.g.,
 building seawalls). Using migration data from the 1920s and 1930s, this
 paper studies how the population responded to disaster shocks in an era of
 minimal public investment. We find that, on net, young men move away from
 areas hit by tornados but are attracted to areas experiencing floods.
 Early efforts to protect against future flooding, especially during the
 New Deal era of the late 1930s, may have counteracted an individual
 migration response.

Title: Nature versus Nurture: The Environment's Persistent Influence through the Modernization of American Agriculture 
Abstract:
 Technological innovation in agriculture was substantial during the 20th
 century.  Is "modern" technological control of the environment replacing a
 "primitive" dependency on natural advantages and disadvantages, or has
 agricultural production remained persistently dependent on the
 environment?  This paper estimates how the 20th century modernization of
 United States Plains' agriculture changed the impact of environmental
 characteristics on agricultural land values.  Despite substantial
 technological innovation and rising land values from 1945 to 2002,
 counties' environmental characteristics largely maintained influence on
 land values.  Environmental change has become no less costly, as
 technological innovation has not reduced the importance of natural
 advantages or disadvantages.

Title: Adaptation to Climate Change in Preindustrial Iceland 
Abstract:
 We investigate the effect of climate change on population growth in 18th
 and 19th century Iceland. We find that annual temperature changes help
 determine the population growth rate in pre-industrial Iceland: a year 1
 degree Celsius cooler than average drives down population growth rates by
 1.14%. We also find that 18th and 19th century Icelanders adapt to
 prolonged changes in climate after 20 years. These adaptations reduce the
 short run effect of annual change in temperature by about 60%. Finally, a
 1 degree Celsius sustained decrease in temperature decreases the steady
 state population by 10% to 26%.

Title: Race and Gender Differences under Federal Sentencing Guidelines 
Abstract:
 Using data from the United States Sentencing Commission, we examine how
 judicial biases may have influenced sentences during the era of the
 Federal criminal sentencing guidelines. Our utility maximization model of
 judicial sentencing preferences leads to a partially censored ordered
 probit model that accounts for mass points in the sentencing distribution
 that occur at the upper and lower guideline limits and at sentences
 involving no prison time. Our results indicate that racial- and
 gender-based discrepancies exist, even after controlling for circumstances
 such as the severity of the offense and past criminal history.

Title: Terrorism and Patriotism: On the Earnings of US Veterans following September 11, 2001 
Abstract:
 Using data from the 2000 census and the 2001-08 American Community
 Surveys, this paper examines the impact of 9/11 on the earnings of US
 veteran men. Our hypothesis is that the surge in patriotism after 9/11
 improved their relative earnings, but this earnings effect was
 short-lived. In addition, we further consider whether this effect was
 equally felt across race/ethnicity and along regional dimensions.
 Consistent with our hypothesis, we find a significant short-term
 improvement in the relative earnings of US veteran men following 9/11.
 However, additional analyses suggest that this earnings effect did not
 evenly occur across demographic and geographic dimensions.

Title: The Nonlinear Relationship between Terrorism and Poverty 
Abstract:
 In spite of the common wisdom that poverty breeds terrorism, econometric
 tests usually find that terrorism is influenced by population and various
 measures of democratic freedom, but not per capita GDP. Unlike previous
 studies, we use a data set containing separate measures of domestic and
 transnational terrorism and estimate models allowing for a nonlinear
 relationship between terrorism and poverty. When we account for the
 nonlinearities in the data and distinguish between the two types of
 terrorist events, we find that poverty has as a very strong influence on
 domestic terrorism and a small, but significant, effect on transnational
 terrorism.

Title: War and Stature: Growing Up during the Nigerian Civil War 
Abstract:
 The Nigerian civil war of 1967-70 was precipitated by secession of the
 Igbo-dominated south-eastern region to create the state of Biafra. It was
 the first civil war in Africa, the predecessor of many. We investigate the
 legacies of this war four decades later. Using variation across ethnicity
 and cohort, we identify significant long-run impacts on human health
 capital. Individuals exposed to the war at all ages between birth and
 adolescence exhibit reduced adult stature and these impacts are largest in
 adolescence. Adult stature is portentous of reduced life expectancy and
 lower earnings.

Title: Nation Building and Economic Growth 
Abstract:
 Over the past half-century there have been over three hundred instances of
 nation building initiatives, episodes where countries jointly give
 military and economic aid to a country embroiled in conflict.	Despite the
 prevalence and expense of this foreign policy, little research has
 explored the potential growth effects from these operations. This project
 uses a standard growth regression framework to quantify the effects of
 nation building on GDP per capita growth of the recipient nation. The
 research considers how the characteristics of conflict zones and the
 interaction of diverse types of both military and economic aid impact the
 development process.

 School choice systems designed to help disadvantaged groups might be

 students make school choice errors. Girls, students with lower test
 scores, and students from public and low quality schools are more likely
 to make such errors. Net of observable demographic characteristics, these
 errors are associated with a decrease in the probability that a student is
 admitted to an elite secondary school, relegating them to schools of lower
 quality.

Title: Kinship and Financial Networks, Formal Financial Access, and Risk Reduction 
Abstract:
 Kinship networks are beneficial for smoothing consumption and investment,
 but the channels are not well understood. We study the financing devices
 used for consumption and investment by Thai households. Households that
 are connected to banks achieve significantly better consumption smoothing
 than unconnected households; indirect connections via inter-household
 borrowing are as effective as direct borrowing. Investment appears to be
 facilitated by kinship: households with kin in the village display reduced
 sensitivity of investment to income, while connections to banks do not
 significantly reduce sensitivity. Kin may act as "implicit collateral,"
 permitting borrowing that would violate repayment constraints in its
 absence.

Title: Child Health and Conflict in Cote d'Ivoire 
Abstract:
 We examine the impact of the 2002-07 civil conflict in Cote d'Ivoire on
 children's health status measured by height-for-age. We use pre- and
 post-war survey data coupled with information on the location of violent
 incidents to capture exposure to the conflict of children born during
 1997-2007. Our results indicate that children from regions more affected
 by the conflict suffered significant health setbacks compared with
 children from less affected regions. Further, household-level
 victimization -- such as war-related economic stress, health stress, and
 displacement -- has a large and negative effect on child health in
 conflict-affected regions.

Title: How Financial Literacy Affects Household Wealth Accumulation 
Abstract:
 This study isolates the causal effects of financial literacy and schooling
 on wealth accumulation using a new household dataset and an instrumental
 variables (IV) approach. Financial literacy and schooling attainment are
 both strongly positively associated with wealth outcomes in linear
 regression models, whereas the IV estimates reveal even more potent
 effects of financial literacy. They also indicate that the schooling
 effect only becomes positive when interacted with financial literacy.
 Estimated impacts are substantial enough to imply that investments in
 financial literacy could have large wealth payoffs.

Title: Financial Education and Timely Decision Support: Lessons from Junior Achievement 
Abstract:
 Using data from a finance theme park at Junior Achievement of Southern
 California, we explore how timely decision support is impacted by previous
 exposure to financial education. Some students received a 19-hour
 curriculum before participating, and some did not. Trained students were
 more frugal, paid off debt faster, and relied less on credit financing.
 However, trained students purchased less comprehensive health insurance,
 exposing themselves to greater financial risk and wealth volatility. This
 disparity can be explained by differences in decision support within the
 park. As such, it appears that education and decision support should be
 considered complements, not substitutes.

Title: Financial Knowledge and Financial Literacy at the Household Level 
Abstract:
 There is evidence of a relation between numeracy and wealth held outside
 of pensions and Social Security. With pensions and Social Security
 accounting for half of wealth at retirement, and evidence that those with
 pensions save more in other forms, one would expect to find knowledge of
 pensions and Social Security influencing retirement saving. Yet we find no
 evidence that knowledge of pensions and Social Security is related to
 nonpension, non-Social Security wealth, to numeracy, or that it plays an
 intermediate role in the numeracy-wealth relation. Our findings raise
 questions about policies that would enhance numeracy to increase
 retirement saving.

Title: Effectiveness of Employer-Provided Financial Information: Hiring to Retiring 
Abstract:
 Workers plan and save for retirement throughout their careers. Individuals
 must navigate complex financial instruments and understand public and
 employer-provided retirement plan characteristics. Beginning when a worker
 is first hired, most employers provide the option to contribute to
 retirement saving plans. As workers near retirement, they face many
 choices that have considerable consequences for their retirement income
 security.  At these two important periods, employers can provide timely
 information assisting workers in making choices that optimize lifetime
 wellbeing. Our research, conducted in cooperation with several large
 employers, illustrates the importance of employer-provided education in
 increasing worker understanding of several retirement-related issues.

Title: Efficient Auctions and Interdependent Types 
Abstract:
 We consider the efficient allocation of a single good with interdependent
 values in a quasi-linear environment. We present an approach to modeling
 interdependent preferences distinguishing between "payoff types" and
 "belief types" and report a characterization of when the efficient
 allocation can be partially Bayesian implemented on a finite type space.
 The characterization can be used to unify a number of sufficient
 conditions for efficient partial implementation in this classical auction
 setting. We report how a canonical language for discussing interdependent
 types - developed in a more general setting by Bergemann, Morris and
 Takahashi (2011) - applies in this setting and note by example that this
 canonical language will not allow us to distinguish some types in the
 payoff type - belief type language.

Title: Robustly Ranking Mechanisms 
Abstract:
 For a mechanism designer with an objective such as welfare we propose a
 method for robustly ranking mechanisms. The method is based on eliminating
 weakly dominated strategies only, and thus does not require any
 assumptions about agents' beliefs about each other except full support. We
 illustrate the usefulness of this method in two examples: bilateral
 trading and voting. In both examples we show that there are mechanisms
 that are ranked by our method above dominant strategy mechanisms. These
 examples question the literature's focus on dominant strategy mechanisms
 in cases when such mechanisms yield undesirable outcomes.

Title: Approximation in Mechanism Design 
Abstract:
 This paper considers three challenge areas for mechanism design and
 describes the role approximation plays in resolving them. Challenge 1:
 optimal mechanisms are finely tuned to precise details of the distribution
 on agent preferences.	Challenge 2: in environments with multi-dimensional
 agent preferences economic analysis has failed to provide general
 characterizations optimal mechanisms. Challenge 3: optimal mechanisms are
 parameterized by unrealistic knowledge of the distribution of agents'
 private preferences.  This paper surveys positive resolutions to these
 challenges with emphasis on basic techniques and their relevance to theory
 and practice.

Title: Is Wikipedia Biased? 
Abstract:
 This study empirically examines whether Wikipedia has a neutral point of
 view. It develops a method for measuring the slant of 28 thousand articles
 about US politics. In its earliest years, Wikipedia's political entries
 lean Democrat on average. The slant diminishes during Wikipedia's decade
 of experience. This change does not arise primarily from revision of
 existing articles. Most articles arrive with a slant, and most articles
 change only mildly from their initial slant. The overall slant changes due
 to the entry of articles with opposite slants, leading toward neutrality
 for many topics, not necessarily within specific articles.

Title: Shifts in Privacy Concerns 
Abstract:
 This paper explores how digitization and the associated use of customer
 data have affected the evolution of consumer privacy concerns. We measure
 privacy concerns by reluctance to disclose income in an online marketing
 research survey. Using over three million responses over eight years, our
 data show: (1) Refusals to reveal information have risen over time, (2)
 Older people are less likely to reveal information, and (3) The difference
 between older and younger people has increased over time. Our results
 suggest that the trends over time are partly due to broadening perceptions
 of the contexts in which privacy is relevant.

Title: New Challenges in Multihospital Kidney Exchange 
Abstract:
 The growth of kidney exchange presents new challenges for the design of
 kidney exchange clearinghouses. The players now include directors of
 transplant centers, who see sets of patient-donor pairs, and can choose to
 reveal only difficult-to-match pairs to the clearinghouse, while
 withholding easy-to-match pairs to transplant locally. This reduces the
 number of transplants. We discuss how the incentives for hospitals to
 enroll all pairs in kidney exchange can be achieved, and how the
 concentration of hard to match pairs increases the importance of long,
 non-simultaneous nondirected donor chains.

Title: Holdout in the Assembly of Complements: A Problem for Market Design 
Abstract:
 Holdout problems prevent private (voluntary and self-financing) assembly
 of complementary goods--such as land or dispersed spectrum--from many
 self-interested sellers. While mechanisms that fully respect sellers'
 property rights cannot alleviate these holdout problems, traditional
 solutions, such as the use of coercive government powers of "eminent
 domain" to expropriate property, can encourage wasteful and unfair
 assemblies. We discuss the problems holdout creates for the efficient
 operation of markets and how previous approaches have used regulated
 coercion to address these challenges.	We then investigate when
 encouraging competition can partially or fully substitute for coercion,
 focusing particularly on questions of spectrum allocation.

Title: Stability and Strategy-Proofness for Matching with Constraints: A Problem in the Japanese Medical Match and Its Solution 
Abstract:
 Real matching markets are subject to constraints. For example, the
 Japanese government introduced a new medical matching system in 2009 that
 imposes a "regional cap" in each of its 47 prefectures, which regulates
 the total number of medical residents who can be employed in each region.
 Based on Kamada and Kojima (2011), this paper studies	matching markets
 with such constraints by examining in great detail  the Japanese medical
 matching market. Specifically, we show that the new  system introduced in
 2009 has problems in terms of stability and strategy-proofness, and
 provide an alternative mechanism that does better.

Title: Understanding Price Controls and Nonprice Competition with Matching Theory 
Abstract:
 We develop a quality competition model to understand how price controls
 affect market outcomes in buyer-seller markets with discrete goods of
 varying quality. While competitive equilibria do not necessarily exist in
 such markets when price controls are imposed, we show that stable outcomes
 do exist and characterize the set of stable outcomes in the presence of
 price restrictions. In particular, we show that price controls induce
 non-price competition: price floors induce the trade of inefficiently high
 quality goods, while price ceilings induce the trade of inefficiently low
 quality goods.

Title: After Airline Deregulation and Alfred E. Kahn 
Abstract:
 Among Alfred E. "Fred" Kahn's many accomplishments, none is better
 remembered than his pivotal role in deregulation of the US airline
 industry. Kahn's commitment to marry core microeconomic principles with
 institutional analysis, willingness as Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics
 Board to step outside the "regulation as usual box," and appealing wit
 made him the face of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, one of the
 great microeconomic policy triumphs. Lessons drawn from Kahn's work and
 the airline deregulation experience remain instructive for current
 academic research and regulatory policy design across broad sectors of the
 economy.

Title: Dynamic Pricing of Electricity 
Abstract:
 As both a regulator and an academic, Fred Kahn argued that end-use
 electricity consumers should face prices that reflect the time-varying
 marginal costs of generating electricity. This has been very slow to
 happen in the US, even in light of recent technological advances that have
 lowered costs and improved functionality for meters and automated demand
 response technologies. We describe these recent developments and discuss
 the remaining barriers to the proliferation of time-varying electricity
 pricing.

Title: Telecommunications Deregulation 
Abstract:
 From Fred Kahn's writings and experiences as a telecommunications
 regulator and commenter, we draw the following conclusions: prices must be
 informed by costs; costs are actual incremental costs; costs and prices
 are an outcome of a Schumpeterian competitive process, not the starting
 point; excluding incumbents from markets is fundamentally anticompetitive;
 and a regulatory transition to deregulation entails propensities to
 micromanage the process to generate preferred outcomes, visible
 competitors and expedient price reductions. And most important, where
 effective competition takes place among platforms characterized by sunk
 investment--land-line telephony, cable and wireless--traditional
 regulation is unnecessary and likely to be anticompetitive.

Title: Government Policy for a Partially Deregulated Industry: Deregulate It Fully 
Abstract:
 Alfred Kahn was a major force behind regulatory reform that initially
 benefited air travelers and subsequently consumers in other industries by
 placing greater reliance on markets than on regulators to allocate
 resources. Kahn also believed that effective governance was important for
 deregulation's success. In this paper, I argue that such governance has
 not occurred in practice and that problems that persist in partially
 deregulated industries are more likely to be solved by full deregulation
 and, if necessary, privatization than by government intervention.

Title: Global Supply Chains and Wage Inequality 
Abstract:
 A salient feature of globalization in recent decades is the emergence of
 "global supply chains" in which different countries specialize in
 different stages of a sequential production process. In Costinot, Vogel
 and Wang (2011) (CVW hereafter), we have developed a simple theory of
 trade with sequential production to shed light on how global supply chains
 affect the interdependence of nations. In this paper we develop a
 multi-factor extension of CVW to explore how the emergence of global
 supply chains may affect wage inequality within countries.

Title: Sustaining Production Chains through Financial Linkages 
Abstract:
 The technological constraints on sustaining production chains have been
 discussed extensively by development economists, but the role of financial
 linkages has received less attention. In a model of recursive moral hazard
 for a manufacturing supply chain, we show that the structure of
 interlocking receivables and payables serve as the glue for the production
 chain that sustains complex manufacturing output. The inefficiency
 associated with recursive moral hazard can be mitigated through optimal
 delays in payments along the chain. However, efficiency requires large
 stocks of working capital, and invoice prices are high due to implicit
 amortization costs of inter-firm credit.

 Using data on gross and value added trade from 1970-2009, we present three
 results supporting this conjecture. First, value added to export ratios
 are lower and falling more rapidly within geographic regions than between
 them. Second, gross trade travels shorter distances from source to
 destination than value added trade, and this gap is growing over time.
 Third, bilateral value added to export ratios have fallen most among
 nearby trading partners.

Title: Measuring the Upstreamness of Production and Trade Flows 
Abstract:
 We propose two distinct approaches to the measurement of industry
 upstreamness (or average distance from final use) and show that they yield
 an equivalent measure. Furthermore, we provide two additional
 interpretations of this measure, one of them related to the concept of
 forward linkages. We construct this measure for 426 industries using the
 2002 US input-output Tables. We also construct our measure using data from
 selected countries in the OECD STAN database. Finally, we present an
 application of our measure that explores the determinants of the average
 upstreamness of exports at the country level using trade flows for 2002.

Title: Trade, Labor Market Frictions, and Residual Wage Inequality across Worker Groups 
Abstract:
 Using a matched employer-employee data set, we study the effects of trade
 liberalization on wage dispersion in Brazil across heterogeneous worker
 groups, keeping in mind that the assignment of workers to firms may be
 non-random and determined by the time-invariant productivity of workers
 specific to the firms with which they are matched. We find differential
 effects of trade reform on residual wage inequality across worker groups.
 High education workers experience greater increases in wage dispersion
 relative to low education workers following trade liberalization. This
 finding is broadly consistent with the theoretical predictions that emerge
 from models with heterogeneous firms, heterogeneous workers, and labor
 market frictions.

Title: Offshoring, Transition, and Training: Evidence from Danish Matched Worker-Firm Data 
Abstract:
 We combine matched Danish worker-firm-trade data with detailed
 individual-worker training data. We find: 1) workers displaced from
 offshoring firms take up more vocational-training and have a harder time
 getting re-attached to the labor-force than other displaced workers, and
 they also exhibit higher vocational-training take-up rates 2 years before
 layoffs; 2) the staying workers with offshoring firms take up more
 vocational-training than those with non-offshoring firms; and 3) the
 post-secondary-training take-up rates for displaced workers are no
 different than for the general population.

Title: Liberalized Trade and Worker-Firm Matching 
Abstract:
 Recent theoretical analysis suggests that a reduction in the cost of
 exporting increases the degree of assortative matching between workers and
 firms in export-oriented industries. Changes that reduce the cost of
 imports have an ambiguous impact on matching. We combine detailed Swedish
 matched worker-firm data from 1995-2005 with tariff data to test these
 hypotheses. The data cover 94 sectors subject to international competition
 and include all firms with at least 20 employees.  Our findings strongly
 support the theoretical predictions.

Title: Exports and Within-Plant Wage Distributions: Evidence from Mexico 
Abstract:
 This short paper examines the effect of exporting on within-plant wage
 distributions in employer-employee data on Mexican manufacturing plants.
 Using the late-1994 peso devaluation interacted with initial plant size as
 a source of exogenous variation in exporting and focusing on wages at the
 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentiles within each plant, we document
 three patterns: (1) there is no evidence of an effect of exporting on
 wages at the 10th percentile; (2) the wage effects of exporting are larger
 at higher percentiles, up to the 75th; and (3) there is no evidence of an
 increase in dispersion within the top quartile.

Title: Village Economic Accounts: Real and Financial Intertwined 
Abstract:
 We propose a framework to create village economic and balance of payments
 accounts from a micro-level household survey. Using the Townsend Thai
 data, we create the accounts for villages in rural and semi-urban areas of
 Thailand. We then study these village economies as small open countries,
 exploring in particular the relationship between the real and financial
 variables. We examine cross-village risk-sharing and the Feldstein-Horioka
 puzzle. Our results suggest that within-village risk-sharing is better
 than across-village and, while there is smoothing in both, the mechanisms
 are different. We also find that, unlike countries, the cross-village
 capital markets are highly integrated.

Title: Innovation in Space 
Abstract:
 This paper shows how competition for land may lead firms to optimally
 innovate in spite of the market being perfectly competitive. When bidding
 for a location, firms can enhance their bid by investing in innovations
 that make the land more valuable. Firms are willing to innovate because
 the non-replicability of land implies that they will not be undercut by
 some other producer leading to losses as in the standard theory. In the
 absence of spillovers over space and over time, firms will optimally
 innovate. Empirical evidence from U.S. metropolitan areas supports the
 predictions of the theory.

Title: Ricardo's Theory of Comparative Advantage: Old Idea, New Evidence 
Abstract:
 When asked to name one proposition in the social sciences that is both
 true and non-trivial, Paul Samuelson famously replied: 'Ricardo's theory
 of comparative advantage'. Truth, however, in Samuelson's reply refers to
 the fact that Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage is mathematically
 correct, not that it is empirically valid. In this paper we develop and
 implement an empirical test of Ricardo's ideas. We use novel agricultural
 data that describe the productivity in 17 crops of 1.6 million parcels of
 land in 55 countries around the world. We find that a regression of log
 observed output on log predicted output has a (precisely estimated) slope
 of 0.84 and an R-squared of 0.93. In our view, these findings offer
 considerable support for Ricardo's ideas.

Title: Tariff Revenue and Tariff Caps 
Abstract:
 We characterize the design of an optimal trade agreement when governments
 are privately informed about the value of tariff revenue. We show that the
 problem of designing an optimal trade agreement in this setting can be
 represented as an optimal delegation problem when a money burning
 instrument is available. In a specification with quadratic payoffs and a
 uniform distribution, we find that the tariff cap and the probability of
 binding overhang are higher when the upper bound of the support
 distribution is higher and when the support distribution has greater
 width.

Title: Profits in the "New Trade" Approach to Trade Negotiations

 I highlight two advantages of adopting a "new trade" approach to trade
 negotiations. First, it allows for a view of trade negotiations in which
 producer interests play a prominent role. And second, it lends itself
 naturally to quantitative analyses of non-cooperative and cooperative
 trade policy. My specific focus is on profit shifting effects through
 which countries can gain at the expense of one another.

Title: Trade Agreements and the Nature of Price Determination 
Abstract:
 According to the terms-of-trade theory, negotiations over tariffs alone,
 coupled with an effective market access preservation rule, can bring
 governments to the efficiency frontier. In this paper, we show that the
 nature of international price determination is important for this central
 result of the terms-of-trade theory. While the received theory assumes
 that international prices are fully disciplined by aggregate market
 clearing conditions, we show here that support for "shallow" integration
 is overturned, and instead a need for "deep" integration is suggested ?
 wherein direct negotiations occur over both border and behind-the-border
 policies ? if international prices are determined through bargaining.

Title: On the Use of Holdout Samples for Model Selection 
Abstract:
 Researchers often hold out data from the estimation of econometric models
 to use for external validation. However, the use of holdout samples is
 suboptimal from a Bayesian perspective, which prescribes using the entire
 sample to form posterior model weights. This paper examines a possible
 rationale for the use of holdout samples: data-inspired modifications of
 structural models are likely to lead to an exaggeration of model fit. The
 use of holdout samples can, in principle, set an incentive for the modeler
 not to exaggerate model fit.

Title: Prediction with Misspecified Models 
Abstract:
 The assumption that one of a set of prediction models is a literal
 description of reality formally underlies many formal econometric methods,
 including Bayesian model averaging and most approaches to model selection.
  Prediction pooling does not invoke this assumption and leads to
 predictions that improve on those based on Bayesian model averaging, as
 assessed by the log predictive score.	The paper shows that the
 improvement is substantial using a pool consisting of a dynamic stochastic
 general equilibrium model, a vector autoregression, and a dynamic factor
 model, in conjunction with standard US postwar quarterly macroeconomic
 time series.

Title: Assumptions Matter: Model Uncertainty and the Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment 
Abstract:
 This paper examines how estimates of the deterrent effect of capital
 punishment depend on alternate choices of assumptions concerning the
 homicide process. Specific models of the homicide process represent
 bundles of these assumptions, which involve the unobserved heterogeneity,
 the relevant penalty probabilities for homicide choices, possible
 cross-polity parameter variation, and exchangeability between polity-time
 pairs that do and do not experience positive numbers of murders. We
 demonstrate how various assumptions have driven the conflicting findings
 from studies on capital punishment, and isolate a particular set of
 assumptions that are required to find a positive deterrent effect.

Title: Heuristics and Heterogeneity in Health Insurance Exchanges: Evidence from the Massachusetts Connector 
Abstract:
 We examine heuristic decision rules in consumer choice on health insurance
 exchanges using data from the Massachusetts Connector.  Consumers may have
 difficulty making optimal choices in a complex environment. The heuristic
 "choose the cheapest plan" is suggested by the decision context, previous
 research, and the data: about 20% of enrollees choose the cheapest plan
 possible. We find evidence of this heuristic in many models, but while
 heuristics may play a role, preference heterogeneity is also important. 
 Our most flexible models find an insignificant heuristic effect. In part
 because holding context fixed, this heuristic is observationally
 equivalent to extreme price sensitivity.

Title: Health Reform, Health Insurance, and Selection: Estimating Selection into Health Insurance Using the Massachusetts Health Reform 
Abstract:
 We implement an empirical test for selection into health insurance using
 changes in coverage induced by the introduction of mandated health
 insurance in Massachusetts. Our test examines changes in the cost of the
 newly insured relative to those who were insured prior to the reform. We
 find that counties with larger increases in insurance coverage over the
 reform period face the smallest increase in average hospital costs for the
 insured population, consistent with adverse selection into insurance
 before the reform. Additional results, incorporating cross-state variation
 and data on health measures, provide further evidence for adverse
 selection.

Title: The Impact of the Massachusetts Health Care Reform on Health Care Use among Children 
Abstract:
 In 2006 Massachusetts enacted a major health care reform aimed at
 achieving near-universal coverage in the state. While other studies have
 found that this reform substantially affected the use of health services
 in general, the impact of the reform on children is largely unexplored.
 Children are of special interest to policymakers because it is widely
 believed that better health in early childhood results in large payoffs to
 adult health and achievement. I analyze how the reform affected the
 insurance coverage, health care utilization patterns, and health outcomes
 of children under 18 years old.

Title: How Did Health Care Reform in Massachusetts Impact Insurance Premiums? 
Abstract:
 It is widely recognized that the 2006 Massachusetts health reforms served
 as a blueprint for national reform under the 2010 Affordable Care Act
 (ACA).  As such, there is interest in using the Massachusetts experience
 to understand how insurance premiums might change under the ACA.  In this
 paper, we analyze changes in private insurance premiums in Massachusetts
 between 2002 and 2010.  In contrast to earlier estimates from
 Massachusetts (Cogan, Hubbard and Kessler 2010), we find no statistical
 evidence of changes in group premiums.  By contrast, we find large
 reductions in non-group premiums in Massachusetts relative to the rest of
 the U.S.

 The majority of papers analyzing the employment effects of unemployment
 insurance (UI) benefit durations focus on the duration of the first

 use a regression discontinuity design to analyze the long-term effects of
 extensions in UI durations. These estimates differ from standard estimates
 in that they incorporate differences in UI benefit receipt and employment
 due to recurrent unemployment spells. Second, we derive a welfare formula
 of UI extensions that incorporates recurrent nonemployment spells.

Title: Unemployment in the Great Recession: Did the Housing Market Crisis Prevent the Unemployed from Moving to Take Jobs? 
Abstract:
 The labor market in the Great Recession and its aftermath is characterized
 by great difficulty in escaping unemployment. I present two empirical
 analyses of a particular explanation for that difficulty, that the housing
 market crisis has prevented the unemployed from selling their homes and
 moving to take new jobs. First, I examine post-job-loss mobility rates by
 home ownership status using data from the Displaced Workers Survey.
 Second, I examine mobility rates for unemployed homeowners and renters
 from the month-to-month CPS match. Neither analysis provides any support
 for the idea that the housing market crisis has reduced mobility of the
 unemployed.

Title: Contract Form, Wage Flexibility, and Employment 
Abstract:
 We begin with two uncontroversial hypotheses - firm productivity is
 expensive to measure and employment entails relationship-specific
 investments. These assumptions imply that firms would optimally choose
 fixed-wage contracts, and complement these with bonus pay when measuring
 employee performance is not too costly. These assumptions imply that under
 an optimal employment contract hours of work is less responsive, while
 total compensation is more responsive to shocks under bonus-pay contracts
 compared to fixed wage contracts. Using data from the Panel Study of
 Income Dynamics (PSID) where shocks are proxied using the local
 unemployment rate, we find strong support for these two implications.

Title: Coming to America: Does Having a Developed Home Country Matter for Self-Employment in the United States? 
Abstract:
 This research examines the relationship between the economic status of an
 immigrant's home country and the probability of self-employment in the US.
 We find that immigrants from developing countries on average have lower
 self-employment probabilities relative to immigrants from developed
 countries. Similarly, we find a positive correlation between the current
 HDI of an immigrant's home country and the probability of self-employment
 in the US. These result are unexpected given that past research suggests
 immigrants from countries with high levels of self-employment (developing
 countries) are more likely to be self-employed in the US. We provide a 
 possible explanation for these results.

Title: The Labor Market Impact of Mandated Employment Verification Systems 
Abstract:
 Employment verification systems covered about one out of four people hired
 in the United States in 2010. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of
 state-level employment verification mandates on the employment and wages
 of likely unauthorized workers across the entire United States between
 2004 and 2010. We find that E-Verify mandates, particularly those covering
 all employers, significantly curtail the employment likelihood of likely
 unauthorized male and female workers. However, they appear to have mixed
 effects on wages and may redistribute likely unauthorized labor towards
 industries often benefiting from specific exclusions, such as agriculture
 or food services.

Title: The Employment of Low-Skilled Immigrant Men in the United States 
Abstract:
 Using microdata from the 2000 Census, we analyze how the employment rates
 of foreign-born and US-born men vary with education. After a period of
 adjustment during the first few years upon arrival, the overall employment
 rate of immigrant men quickly approaches that of US natives. Among those
 with the lowest education levels, immigrants exhibit substantially higher
 rates of employment than comparable natives. This pattern is consistent
 with a simple theoretical model of migrant selectivity that jointly
 considers a potential migrant's decisions regarding where to locate and
 whether to work.

Title: Love and Money by Parental Matchmaking: Evidence from Urban Couples in China 
Abstract:
 Parental involvement in marriage matchmaking may distort the optimal
 spouse choice because parents are willing to substitute love for money.
 The rationale is that the joint income of married children can be shared
 among extended family members more easily than mutual attraction felt by
 the couple themselves, and as a result, the best spouse candidate in the
 parents' eyes can differ from what is optimal to the individual, even
 though parents are altruistic and care dearly about their children's
 welfare. We find supporting evidence for this prediction using a unique
 sample of urban couples in China in the early 1990s.

Title: Business Cycles and Gender Diversification: An Analysis of Establishment-Level Gender Dissimilarity 
Abstract:
 During recessions, the focus on male job losses may overshadow other
 important outcome variables. We examine the effects of economic downturns
 on occupational segregation by gender, using staffing data from over 6
 million private-sector US establishments from 1966-2010. Consistent with
 the literature, we find a downward trend in occupational segregation that
 is diminishing over time. Drawing upon Rubery's (1988) work on women and
 recessions, we find support for both the buffer and the segmentation
 hypotheses. On net, however, the buffer hypothesis appears to dominate
 providing evidence that in periods of economic decline the trend of
 decreasing economic dissimilarity is interrupted.

Title: Birth Rates and the Vietnam Draft 
Abstract:
 The Vietnam conflict was the defining event for a generation, with nearly
 8 million Americans serving in the armed forces. A large literature in
 economics has focused on effects of Vietnam-Era service post-war, while
 little research looks at contemporaneous effects of the mobilization,
 despite the potential for this mobilization to change marriage markets for
 particular cohorts. We use exogenous variation across states and over time
 in men drafted per 100 men 19-25 to look at the effects of the wartime
 mobilization on birth rates. We find robust evidence that higher rates of
 inducted men led to significantly lower birth rates.

Title: Identification of the Effect of Depression on Risky Sexual Behavior: Exploiting a Natural Experiment 
Abstract:
 Depression is pervasive in the US particularly among women. The costs in
 terms of direct medical costs and forgone earnings are substantial. This
 paper investigates an additional cost of depression. Using data from the
 National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health, we use a unique
 instrument, the attacks of September 11, which have been linked to
 depression, to identify the effect of depression on risky sexual
 behaviors. We find that depressed women are more likely to be sexually
 active, to engage in oral sex and to have sex without a condom, even after
 controlling for a rich set of covariates.

Title: Hiring, Churn, and the Business Cycle 
Abstract:
 Hires occur for two reasons - to grow a business and to replace those who
 have left (churn). Churn is an important part of employment dynamics,
 allowing workers to move to their most productive use. We present evidence
 on churn from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). Churn is
 procyclical. During the 2007-09 recession, four-fifths of hiring
 reductions are associated with reduced churn, not with reductions in job
 creation. We estimate that the cost of reduced churn is about two-fifths
 of a percentage point of GDP annually throughout the three-and-one-half
 year period since the beginning of the recession.

Title: Job-to-Job Flows in the Great Recession 
Abstract:
 We develop prototype job-to-job flow measures to provide new evidence on
 labor turnover and earnings dynamics in the Great Recession. We find a
 sharp drop in job mobility in the Great Recession, much sharper than the
 previous recession, and higher earnings penalties for job transitions with
 an intervening nonemployment spell. Focusing on residential construction
 separators in particular, we find increasing rates of industry change and
 higher earnings penalties from job change in the Great Recession.

Title: Recruiting Intensity during and after the Great Recession: National and Industry Evidence 
Abstract:
 We measure job-filling rates and recruiting intensity per vacancy at the
 national and industry levels from January 2001 to September 2011 using
 data from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Industry-level
 movements in these variables are at odds with implications of the standard
 matching function in labor search theory but consistent with a generalized
 function that incorporates an important role for recruiting intensity.
 Construction makes up less than five percent of employment but accounts
 for more than 40 percent of the large swings in the job-filling rate
 during and after the Great Recession.

Title: Did the Housing Price Bubble Clobber Local Labor Market Job and Worker Flows When It Burst? 
Abstract:
 We use the Census Bureau's Quarterly Workforce Indicators and the Federal
 Housing Finance Agency's House Price Indices to study the effects of the
 housing price bubble on local labor markets. We show that the 35 MSAs in
 the top decile of the house price boom were most severely impacted. Their
 stable job employment fell much more than the national average. Their real
 wage rates did not fall as fast as the national average. Accessions fell
 much faster than average while separations were constant. Job creations
 fell substantially while destructions rose slightly.

Title: Time Use, Emotional Well-Being, and Unemployment: Evidence from Longitudinal Data 
Abstract:
 This paper provides new evidence on the time use and emotional well-being
 of unemployed individuals in the weeks before and after starting a new
 job. The major findings are: (1) time spent on home production drops
 sharply at the time of re-employment, even when controlling for individual
 fixed effects; (2) time spent on leisure-related activities, which the
 unemployed find less enjoyable, drops on re-employment, but less so when
 controlling for individual fixed effects; (3) the unemployed report higher
 levels of sadness during specific episodes of the day than the employed;
 and (4) sadness decreases abruptly at the time of re-employment.

Title: Retirement and Home Production: A Regression Discontinuity Approach 
Abstract:
 Existing studies show that individuals who retire replace some private
 consumption with home production, but do not consider joint behavior of
 couples. Here we analyze the causal effect of retirement of each partner
 on hours of home production for both partners in a couple. Our
 identification strategy exploits the earliest age retirement laws in
 France, enabling a fuzzy regression discontinuity approach. We find that
 own retirement significantly increases own hours of home production and
 the effect is larger for men than for women. Moreover, retirement of the
 female partner significantly reduces male hours of home production but not
 vice versa.

Title: The Role of Preferences and Opportunity Costs in Determining the Time Allocated to Housework 
Abstract:
 Research on intrahousehold time allocations has assumed that housework is
 a necessary evil and focused exclusively on the causal role of opportunity
 costs. In fact, agents likely act to maximize happiness, and preferences
 regarding even mundane household chores differ considerably. I use
 information from the 2000-01 UK Time Use Survey to examine time spent on
 laundry, ironing, cleaning, and food shopping.  Joint multivariate
 analysis of his and her time on weekend and weekday days as well as maid
 service reveals that her opportunity cost of time matters more than his,
 but that his preferences play a greater role than hers.

Title: Aggregate Impacts of a Gift of Time 
Abstract:
 How would people spend additional time if confronted by permanent declines
 in market work? We examine the impacts of cuts in legislated standard
 hours which raised employers' overtime costs in Japan around 1990 and in
 Korea in the early 2000s. Using time-diaries from before and after, we
 show the shocks were effective -- per-capita hours of market work declined
 discretely. The economy-wide drops in market work were reallocated solely
 to leisure and personal maintenance. In the absence of changing household
 technology a permanent time gift leads to no increase in time spent in
 household production by the average individual.
