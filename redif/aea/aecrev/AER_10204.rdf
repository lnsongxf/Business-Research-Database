Title: Targeting the Poor: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Indonesia 
Abstract:
 This paper reports an experiment in 640 Indonesian villages on three
 approaches to target the poor: proxy means tests (PMT), where assets are
 used to predict consumption; community targeting, where villagers rank
 everyone from richest to poorest; and a hybrid. Defining  poverty based on
 PPP$2 per capita consumption, community targeting and the hybrid perform
 somewhat worse in identifying the poor than PMT, though not by enough to
 significantly affect poverty outcomes for a typical program. Elite capture
 does not explain these  results. Instead, communities appear to apply a
 different concept of poverty. Consistent with this finding, community
 targeting results in higher satisfaction. (JEL C93, I32, I38, O12, O15,

Title: Incentives Work: Getting Teachers to Come to School 
Abstract:
 We use a randomized experiment and a structural model to test whether
 monitoring and financial incentives can reduce teacher absence and
 increase learning in India. In treatment schools, teachers' attendance was
 monitored daily using cameras, and their salaries were made a nonlinear
 function of attendance. Teacher absenteeism in the treatment group fell by
 21 percentage points relative to the control group, and the children's
 test scores increased by 0.17 standard deviations. We estimate a
 structural dynamic labor supply model and find that teachers respond
 strongly to financial incentives. Our model is used to compute
 cost-minimizing compensation policies. (JEL I21, J31, J45, O15)

Title: Selective Trials: A Principal-Agent Approach to Randomized Controlled Experiments 
Abstract:
 We study the design of randomized controlled experiments when outcomes are
 significantly affected by experimental subjects' unobserved  effort
 expenditure. While standard randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are
 internally consistent, the unobservability of effort compromises external
 validity. We approach trial design as a principal-agent problem and show
 that natural extensions of RCTs--which we call selective trials--can help
 improve external validity. In particular, selective trials can disentangle
 the effects of treatment, effort, and the interaction of treatment and
 effort. Moreover, they can help identify when treatment effects are
 affected by erroneous beliefs and inappropriate effort expenditure. (JEL

Title: Ethnicity and Conflict: An Empirical Study 
Abstract:
 We examine empirically the impact of ethnic divisions on conflict, by
 using a specification based on Esteban and Ray (2011). That theory links
 conflict intensity to three indices of ethnic distribution: polarization,
 fractionalization, and the Gini-Greenberg index. The empirical  analysis
 verifies that these distributional measures are significant correlates of
 conflict. These effects persist as we introduce country-specific  measures
 of group cohesion and of the importance of public goods, and combine them
 with the distributional measures exactly as described by the theory. (JEL

Title: Information, Animal Spirits, and the Meaning of Innovations in Consumer Confidence 
Abstract:
 Innovations to consumer confidence convey incremental information about
 economic activity far into the future. Does this reflect a causal effect
 of animal spirits on economic activity, or news about exogenous future
 productivity received by consumers? Using indirect inference, we study the
 impulse responses to confidence innovations in conjunction with an
 appropriately augmented New Keynesian	model. While news, animal spirits,
 and pure noise all contribute to confidence innovations, the relationship
 between confidence and subsequent activity is almost entirely reflective
 of the news component. Confidence innovations are well characterized as
 noisy measures  of changes in expected productivity growth over a
 relatively long horizon. (JEL D12, D83, D84, E12)

Title: Why Does Trend Growth Affect Equilibrium Employment? A New Explanation of an Old Puzzle 
Abstract:
 That the employment rate appears to respond to changes in trend growth is
 an enduring macroeconomic puzzle. This paper shows that, in the presence
 of a return to experience, a slowdown in productivity growth raises
 reservation wages, thereby lowering aggregate	employment. The paper
 develops new evidence that shows this mechanism is important for
 explaining the growth-employment puzzle. The combined effects of changes
 in aggregate wage growth and returns to experience account for all the
 increase from 1968 to 2006 in nonemployment among low-skilled men and for
 approximately half the increase in nonemployment among all men. (JEL E24,

Title: Understanding Bank Runs: The Importance of Depositor-Bank Relationships and Networks 
Abstract:
 We use unique depositor-level data for a bank that faced a run to
 understand the factors that affect depositor behavior. We find uninsured
 depositors are most likely to run. Deposit insurance helps, but is only
 partially effective. Bank-depositor relationships mitigate runs,
 suggesting that relationship with depositors help banks reduce fragility.
 In addition, we also find that social networks matter. Finally, we find
 long-term effects of a solvent bank run in that depositors  who run do not
 return back to the bank. Our results help understand the underlying
 dynamics of bank runs and hold important policy implications. (JEL D12,

Title: Dynamics and Stability of Constitutions, Coalitions, and Clubs 
Abstract:
 In dynamic collective decision making, current decisions determine the
 future distribution of political power and influence future decisions. We
 develop a general framework to study this class of problems. Under
 acyclicity, we characterize dynamically stable states as functions of the
 initial state and obtain two general insights. First, a social arrangement
 is made stable by the instability of alternative arrangements that are
 preferred by sufficiently powerful groups. Second, efficiency-enhancing
 changes may be resisted because of further changes they will engender. We
 use this framework to analyze dynamics of political rights in a society
 with different types of extremist views. (JEL D71, D72, K10)

Title: The Enduring Impact of the American Dust Bowl: Short- and Long-Run Adjustments to Environmental Catastrophe 
Abstract:
 The 1930s American Dust Bowl was an environmental catastrophe that greatly
 eroded sections of the Plains. The Dust Bowl is estimated to have
 immediately, substantially, and persistently reduced agricultural land
 values and revenues in more-eroded counties relative to  less-eroded
 counties. During the Depression and through at least the 1950s, there was
 limited relative adjustment of farmland away from activities that became
 relatively less productive in more-eroded areas. Agricultural adjustments
 recovered less than 25 percent of the initial difference in agricultural
 costs for more-eroded counties. The economy adjusted predominantly through
 large relative population declines in more-eroded counties, both during
 the 1930s and through the 1950s. (JEL N32, N52, Q15, Q18, Q54)

Title: The Origins of Ethnolinguistic Diversity 
Abstract:
 This study explores the determinants of ethnolinguistic diversity within
 as well as across countries, shedding light on its geographic origins. The
 empirical analysis conducted across countries, virtual countries, and
 pairs of contiguous regions establishes that geographic variability,
 captured by variation in regional land quality  and elevation, is a
 fundamental determinant of contemporary linguistic  diversity. The
 findings are consistent with the proposed hypothesis that differences in
 land endowments gave rise to location-specific human capital, leading to
 the formation of localized ethnicities. (JEL J15, J24, Z13)

Title: Competitive Pressure and the Adoption of Complementary Innovations 
Abstract:
 Liberalization of the European automobile distribution system in  2002
 limits the ability of manufacturers to impose vertical restraints, leading
 to a substantial increase in competitive pressure among  dealers. We
 estimate an equilibrium model of profit maximization to evaluate how
 dealers change their innovation adoption strategies  following the
 elimination of exclusive territories. Using French data we evaluate the
 existence of complementarities between the adoption  of software
 applications and the scale of production. Firms view these innovations as
 substitutes and concentrate their effort in one type of software as they
 expand their scale of production. Results are robust to the existence of
 unobserved heterogeneity. (JEL D24, K21, L21, L22, L62, O32)

Title: Evaluating Microfoundations for Aggregate Price Rigidities: Evidence from Matched Firm-Level Data on Product Prices and Unit Labor Cost 
Abstract:
 Using matched data on product-level prices and the producing firm's unit
 labor cost, we find a moderate pass-through of current idiosyncratic
 marginal-cost changes. Also, the  response does not vary across firms
 facing very different idiosyncratic shock variances, but identical
 aggregate conditions. These results do not fit the predictions of
 Mackowiak  and Wiederholt (2009). Neither do firms react strongly to
 predictable marginal-cost changes, as expected from Mankiw and Reis
 (2002). We find that firms consider both current and expected future
 marginal cost when setting prices. This points toward impediments to
 continuous price adjustments as a key driver of monetary non-neutrality.

Title: On the Timing and Pricing of Dividends 
Abstract:
 We present evidence on the term structure of the equity premium. We
 recover prices of dividend strips, which are short-term assets that pay
 dividends on the stock index every  period up to period T and nothing
 thereafter. It is short-term relative to the index because the index pays
 dividends in perpetuity. We find that expected returns, Sharpe ratios, and
  volatilities on short-term assets are higher than on the index, while
 their CAPM betas are below one. Short-term assets are more volatile than
 their realizations, leading to excess	volatility and return
 predictability. Our findings are inconsistent with many leading theories.

Title: The Finnish Great Depression: From Russia with Love 
Abstract:
 Why did Finland experience, in 1991-1993, the deepest recession observed
 in an industrialized country since the 1930s? Using a dynamic general
 equilibrium model with  labor frictions, we argue that the collapse of the
 Soviet-Finnish trade was a major contributor to the contraction. Finland's
 experience mirrors that of the transition  economies of Eastern Europe,
 which suffered similar deep recessions coupled with institutional changes.
 By focusing on the Finnish case, we isolate the effects of the
 Finnish-Soviet trade collapse and shed new light on the sources of
 recessions in transition economies.

Title: The Currency of Reciprocity: Gift Exchange in the Workplace 
Abstract:
 What determines reciprocity in employment relations? We conducted a
 controlled field experiment to measure the extent to which monetary and
 nonmonetary gifts affect workers' performance. We find that nonmonetary
 gifts have a much stronger impact than  monetary gifts of equivalent
 value. We also observe that when workers are offered the choice, they
 prefer receiving money, but reciprocate as if they received a nonmonetary
 gift. This result is consistent with the common saying, "it's the thought
 that counts." We underline this point by showing that monetary gifts can
 effectively trigger reciprocity if the employer invests more time and
 effort into the gift's presentation.

Title: Risk Aversion and the Labor Margin in Dynamic Equilibrium Models 
Abstract:
 The household's labor margin has a substantial effect on risk aversion,
 and hence asset prices, in dynamic equilibrium models even when utility is
 additively separable between consumption and labor. This paper derives
 simple, closed-form expressions for risk aversion that take into account
 the household's labor margin. Ignoring this margin can dramatically
 overstate the household's true aversion to risk. Risk premia on assets
 priced  with the stochastic discount factor increase essentially linearly
 with risk aversion, so measuring risk aversion correctly is crucial for
 asset pricing in the model.

Title: Credit Spreads and Business Cycle Fluctuations 
Abstract:
 Using micro-level data, we construct a credit spread index with
 considerable predictive power for future economic activity. We decompose
 the credit spread into a component that captures firm-specific information
 on expected defaults and a residual component--the excess bond premium.
 Shocks to the excess bond premium that are orthogonal to the  current
 state of the economy lead to declines in economic activity and asset
 prices. An increase in the excess bond premium appears to reflect a
 reduction in the risk-bearing capacity of the financial sector, which
 induces a contraction in the supply of credit and a deterioration in
 macroeconomic conditions.

Title: Do Matching Frictions Explain Unemployment? Not in Bad Times 
Abstract:
 This paper proposes a search-and-matching model of unemployment in which
 jobs are rationed: the labor market does not clear in the absence of
 matching frictions. This job shortage arises in an economic equilibrium
 from the combination of some wage rigidity  and diminishing marginal
 returns to labor. In recessions, job rationing is acute, driving the rise
 in unemployment, whereas matching frictions contribute little to
 unemployment. Intuitively in recessions, jobs are lacking, the labor
 market is slack, and recruiting is easy  and inexpensive, so matching
 frictions do not matter much. In a calibrated model, cyclical fluctuations
 in the composition of unemployment are large.

 (2006) using: appropriate clustered standard errors, a larger sample from
 the same years and survey as the data in Adda and Cornaglia (2006),
 cigarette-prices instead of and in addition to cigarette-taxes, and
 sampling weights. The empirical findings of Adda and Cornaglia (2006) are
 not robust. Further, little systematic evidence of compensatory  behavior
 is found among subsamples of smokers.
