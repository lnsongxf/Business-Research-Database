Title: A Field Study on Matching with Network Externalities 
Abstract:
 We study the effects of network externalities within a protocol for 
 matching faculty to offices in a new building. Using web and survey data
 on faculty's attributes and choices, we identify the different layers of
 the social network: institutional affiliation, coauthorships, and
 friendships. We quantify the effects of network externalities on choices
 and outcomes, disentangle the layers of the networks, and quantify their
 relative influence. Finally, we assess the protocol used from a welfare
 perspective. Our study suggests the importance and feasibility of
 accounting for network externalities in assignment problems and evaluates
 techniques that can be employed to this end. (JEL C78, C93, D62, D85, Z13)

Title: Pay for Percentile 
Abstract:
 We propose an incentive scheme for educators that links compensation to
 the ranks of their students within comparison sets. Under certain
 conditions, this scheme induces teachers to allocate socially optimal
 levels of effort. Moreover, because this scheme employs only ordinal
 information, it allows education authorities to employ completely new
 assessments at each testing date without ever having to equate various
 assessments. This removes incentives for teachers to teach to a particular
 assessment form and eliminates opportunities to influence reward pay by
 corrupting assessment scales. Education authorities can employ separate
 no-stakes assessment systems to  track trends in scaled measures of
 student achievement. (JEL I21, I28, J33, J45)

Title: Europe's Tired, Poor, Huddled Masses: Self-Selection and Economic Outcomes in the Age of Mass Migration 
Abstract:
 During the age of mass migration (1850-1913), one of the largest migration
 episodes in history, the United States maintained a nearly open border,
 allowing the study of migrant decisions unhindered by entry restrictions.
 We estimate the return to migration while accounting for migrant selection
 by comparing Norway-to-US migrants with their brothers who stayed in
 Norway in the late nineteenth century. We also compare fathers of migrants
 and nonmigrants by wealth and	occupation. We find that the return to
 migration was relatively low (70 percent) and that migrants from urban
 areas were negatively selected from the sending population. (JEL J11, J61,

Title: Social Capital and Social Quilts: Network Patterns of Favor Exchange 
Abstract:
 We examine the informal exchange of favors in societies such that any two
 individuals interact too infrequently to sustain exchange, but such that
 the social pressure of the possible loss of multiple relationships can
 sustain exchange. Patterns of exchange that are locally enforceable and
 renegotiation-proof necessitate that all links are "supported": any two
 individuals exchanging favors have a common friend. In symmetric settings,
 such robust networks are "social  quilts": tree-like unions of completely
 connected subnetworks. Examining favor exchange networks in 75 villages in
 rural India, we find high levels of support and identify characteristics
 that correlate with support. (JEL D85, O12, O18, Z13)

Title: A Rational Expectations Approach to Hedonic Price Regressions with Time-Varying Unobserved Product Attributes: The Price of Pollution 
Abstract:
 We propose a new strategy for a pervasive problem in the hedonics
 literature: recovering hedonic prices in the presence of time-varying
 correlated unobservables. Our approach relies on an assumption about home
 buyer rationality, under which prior sales prices can be used to control
 for time-varying unobservable attributes of the house or neighborhood.
 Using housing transactions data from California's Bay Area between 1990
 and 2006, we apply our estimator to recover  marginal willingness to pay
 for reductions in three of the EPA's "criteria" air pollutants. Our
 findings suggest that ignoring bias from  time-varying correlated
 unobservables considerably understates the benefits of a pollution
 reduction policy. (JEL D12, D84, Q53, Q58, R21)

Title: The Impact of Family Income on Child Achievement: Evidence from the Earned Income Tax Credit 
Abstract:
 Using an instrumental variables strategy, we estimate the causal effect of
 income on children's math and reading achievement. Our identification
 derives from the large, nonlinear changes in the Earned Income Tax Credit.
 The largest of these changes increased family income by as much as 20
 percent, or approximately $2,100,  between 1993 and 1997. Our baseline
 estimates imply that a $1,000 increase in income raises combined math and
 reading test scores by 6 percent of a standard deviation in the short run.
 Test gains are larger for children from disadvantaged families and robust
 to a variety of alternative specifications. (JEL H24, H31, I21, I38, J13)

Title: Bundling and Competition for Slots 
Abstract:
 We consider competition between sellers selling multiple distinct products
 to a buyer having k slots. Under independent pricing, a pure strategy
 equilibrium often does not exist, and equilibrium in  mixed strategy is
 never efficient. When bundling is allowed, each seller has an incentive to
 bundle his products, and an efficient "technology-renting" equilibrium
 always exists. Furthermore, in the case of digital goods or when sales
 below marginal cost are banned, all equilibria are efficient. Comparing
 the mixed-strategy equilibrium with the technology-renting equilibrium
 reveals that bundling often increases the buyer's surplus. Finally, we
 derive clear-cut policy implications.(JEL D43, D86, K21, L13, L14, L41,

Title: Fund Managers, Career Concerns, and Asset Price Volatility 
Abstract:
 We propose a model of delegated portfolio management with career concerns.
 Investors hire fund managers to invest their capital either in risky bonds
 or in riskless assets. Some managers have superior information on default
 risk. Based on past performance, investors update beliefs on managers and
 make firing decisions. This leads to career concerns that affect managers'
 investment decisions, generating a countercyclical "reputational premium."
 When default risk is high, return on bonds is high to compensate
 uninformed managers for the high risk of being fired. As default risk
 changes over time, the reputational premium amplifies price volatility.

Title: Organ Allocation Policy and the Decision to Donate 
Abstract:
 Organ donations from deceased donors provide the majority of transplanted
 organs in the United States, and one deceased donor can save numerous
 lives by providing multiple organs. Nevertheless, most Americans are not
 registered organ donors despite the relative ease of becoming one. We
 study in the laboratory an experimental game modeled on the decision to
 register as an organ donor and investigate how changes in the management
 of organ waiting lists might impact donations. We find that an organ
 allocation policy giving priority on waiting lists to those who previously
 registered as donors has a significant positive impact on registration.

Title: Katrina's Children: Evidence on the Structure of Peer Effects from Hurricane Evacuees 
Abstract:
 In 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita forced many children to relocate
 across the Southeast. While schools quickly enrolled evacuees, families in
 receiving schools worried about the impacts on incumbent students. We find
 no effect, on average, of the inflow of evacuees on achievement in
 Houston. In Louisiana we find little impact on  average and we reject
 linear-in-means models. Moreover, we find that student achievement
 improves with high achieving peers and worsens with low achieving peers.
 Finally, an increase in the inflow of evacuees raised incumbent
 absenteeism and disciplinary problems in Houston's secondary schools. (JEL

Title: What Do You Think Would Make You Happier? What Do You Think You Would Choose? 
Abstract:
 Would people choose what they think would maximize their subjective
 well-being (SWB)? We present survey respondents with hypothetical
 scenarios and elicit both choice and predicted SWB rankings of two
 alternatives. While choice and predicted SWB rankings usually coincide in
 our data, we find systematic reversals. We identify  factors--such as
 predicted sense of purpose, control over one's life,  family happiness,
 and social status--that help explain hypothetical choice controlling for
 predicted SWB. We explore how our findings vary by SWB measure and by
 scenario. Our results have implications  regarding the use of SWB survey
 questions as a proxy for utility. (JEL  D03, I31)

Title: Industrial Structure and Capital Flows 
Abstract:
 This paper provides a new theory of international capital flows. In a
 framework that integrates factor-proportions-based trade and financial 
 capital flows, a novel force emerges: capital tends to flow toward
 countries that become more specialized in capital-intensive industries.
 This "composition" effect competes with the standard force that channels
 capital toward the location where it is scarcer. If the composition effect
 dominates, capital flows away from the country hit by a positive labor
 force/productivity shock--a flow "reversal." Extended to a quantitative
 framework, the model generates sizable current account imbalances between
 developing and developed countries  broadly consistent with the data. (JEL

Title: Spatial Differentiation and Vertical Mergers in Retail Markets for Gasoline 
Abstract:
 This paper studies an empirical model of spatial competition applied to
 gasoline markets. The main feature is to specify commuting paths as the
 "locations" of consumers in a Hotelling-style model. As a result, spatial
 differentiation depends in an intuitive way on the structure of the road
 network and the direction of traffic flows. The model is estimated using
 panel data on the Quebec City gasoline market and used to evaluate the
 consequences of a recent vertical merger. Difference-in-difference and
 counterfactual simulation methods are	compared, and the results, to a
 large extent, validate the assumptions of the demand model. (JEL G34, L13,

Title: Revealed Attention 
Abstract:
 The standard revealed preference argument relies on an implicit assumption
 that a decision maker considers all feasible alternatives.  The marketing
 and psychology literatures, however, provide well-established evidence
 that consumers do not consider all brands in a given market before making
 a purchase (Limited Attention). In this paper, we illustrate how one can
 deduce both the decision maker's preference and the alternatives to which
 she pays attention and inattention from the observed behavior. We
 illustrate how seemingly compelling welfare judgments without specifying
 the underlying choice	procedure are misleading. Further, we provide a
 choice theoretical foundation for maximizing a single preference relation
 under limited attention. (JEL D11, D81)

Title: Heuristic Thinking and Limited Attention in the Car Market 
Abstract:
 Can heuristic information processing affect important product markets?
 Analyzing over 22 million wholesale used-car transactions, we find
 evidence of left-digit bias in the processing of odometer values, whereby
 individuals focus on the number's leftmost digits. The bias leads to
 discontinuous drops in sale prices at 10,000-mile odometer  thresholds,
 along with smaller drops at 1,000-mile thresholds. These findings reveal
 that information-processing heuristics matter even in markets with large
 stakes and easily observed information. We model left-digit bias in an
 inattention framework and structurally estimate the inattention parameter.
 Empirical patterns suggest the results are driven by final customers
 rather than professional agents. (JEL D12, D44, D83, L81)

Title: The Multi-unit Assignment Problem: Theory and Evidence from Course Allocation at Harvard 
Abstract:
 We use theory and field data to study the draft mechanism used to allocate
 courses at Harvard Business School. We show that the draft is manipulable
 in theory, manipulated in practice, and that these manipulations cause
 significant welfare loss. Nevertheless, we find that welfare is higher
 than under its widely studied strategyproof  alternative. We identify a
 new link between fairness and welfare that explains why the draft performs
 well despite the costs of strategic behavior, and then design a new draft
 that reduces these costs. We draw several broader lessons for market
 design, regarding Pareto efficiency, fairness, and strategyproofness. (JEL

Title: Durable Consumption and Asset Management with Transaction and Observation Costs 
Abstract:
 The empirical evidence on rational inattention lags the theoretical
 developments: micro evidence on one of the most immediate consequences of
 observation costs--the infrequent observation of state variables--is not
 available in standard datasets. We contribute to filling the gap using new
 household surveys. To match these data we modify existing models, shifting
 the focus from nondurable to durable consumption. The model features both
 observation and transaction costs and implies a mixture of time-dependent
 and state-dependent rules. Numerical simulations explain the frequencies
 of trading and observation of the median investor with small observation
 costs and larger transaction costs. (JEL D12, D14, E21, G11)

Title: Credit Supply and Monetary Policy: Identifying the Bank Balance-Sheet Channel with Loan Applications 
Abstract:
 We analyze the impact of monetary policy on the supply of bank credit.
 Monetary policy affects both loan supply and demand, thus making
 identification a steep challenge. We therefore analyze a novel,
 supervisory dataset with loan applications from Spain. Accounting for
 time-varying firm heterogeneity in loan demand, we find that tighter
 monetary and worse economic conditions substantially reduce loan granting,
 especially from banks with lower capital or liquidity ratios; responding
 to applications for the same loan, weak banks are less likely to grant the
 loan. Finally, firms cannot offset the resultant credit restriction by
 applying to other banks. (JEL E32, E44, E52, G21, G32)

Title: Skill Dispersion and Trade Flows 
Abstract:
 Is skill dispersion a source of comparative advantage? In this paper we
 use microdata from the International Adult Literacy Survey to show that
 the effect of skill dispersion on trade flows is quantitatively similar to
 that of the aggregate endowment of human capital. In particular we
 investigate, and find support for, the hypothesis that countries with a
 more dispersed skill distribution specialize in industries characterized
 by lower complementarity of workers' skills. The result is robust to the
 introduction of controls for alternative sources of comparative advantage,
 as well as to alternative measures of industry-level skill

Title: Interjurisdictional Spillovers, Decentralized Policymaking, and the Elasticity of Capital Supply 
Abstract:
 This paper points to the important role that the elasticity of aggregate
 capital supply with respect to the net rate of return to capital plays for
 the efficiency of policymaking in a decentralized economy with mobile
 capital and spillovers among jurisdictions. In accordance with previous
 studies, we show that under the assumption of a fixed capital supply (zero
 capital supply elasticity) the decentralized policy choice is optimal. If
 the capital supply elasticity is strictly positive, however, capital tax
 rates are inefficiently low in the decentralized equilibrium. (JEL E22,

Title: The Hidden Advantage of Delegation: Pareto Improvements in a Gift Exchange Game 
Abstract:
 This paper analyzes the effect on performance and earnings of delegating
 the wage choice to employees. Our results show that such delegation
 significantly increases effort levels. Moreover, we observe a Pareto
 improvement, as the earnings of both employers and employees increase when
 employers delegate than when they do not. Interestingly, we also find that
 the employees' performance under delegation is higher than under
 nondelegation, even for similar wages. While there is strong evidence that
 behavior reflects strategic considerations, this result also holds for
 one-shot interactions. A possible nonstrategic motivation explaining the
 positive reaction to delegation is a sense of enhanced responsibility.
