Title: The Collateral Channel: How Real Estate Shocks Affect Corporate Investment 
Abstract:
 What is the impact of real estate prices on corporate investment? In  the
 presence of financing frictions, firms use pledgeable assets as collateral
 to finance new projects. Through this collateral channel, shocks to the
 value of real estate can have a large impact on aggregate investment. To
 compute the sensitivity of investment to collateral value, we use local
 variations in real estate prices as shocks to the collateral value of
 firms that own real estate. Over the 1993-2007 period, the representative
 US corporation invests $0.06 out of each  $1 of collateral. (JEL D22, G31,

Title: Modeling the Change of Paradigm: Non-Bayesian Reactions to Unexpected News 
Abstract:
 Bayes' rule has two well-known limitations: 1) it does not model the 
 reaction to zero-probability events; 2) a sizable empirical evidence
 documents systematic violations of it. We characterize axiomatically an
 alternative updating rule, the Hypothesis Testing model. According  to it,
 the agent follows Bayes' rule if she receives information to which she
 assigned a probability above a threshold. Otherwise, she looks at a prior
 over priors, updates it using Bayes' rule for second-order  priors, and
 chooses the prior to which the updated prior over priors assigns the
 highest likelihood. We also present an application to equilibrium
 refinement in game theory. (JEL D11, D81, D83)

Title: Markups and Firm-Level Export Status 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we develop a method to estimate markups using plant-level 
 production data. Our approach relies on cost-minimizing producers and the
 existence of at least one variable input of production. The suggested
 empirical framework relies on the estimation of a production function and
 provides estimates of plant-level markups without specifying how firms
 compete in the product market. We rely on our method to explore the
 relationship between markups and export behavior. We find that markups are
 estimated significantly higher when controlling for unobserved
 productivity; that exporters charge, on average, higher markups and that
 markups increase upon export entry. (JEL D22, D24, F14, L11, L60)

Title: The Evolution of Brand Preferences: Evidence from Consumer Migration 
Abstract:
 We study the long-run evolution of brand preferences, using new data on
 consumers' life histories and purchases of consumer packaged goods.
 Variation in where consumers have lived in the past allows us to isolate
 the causal effect of past experiences on current purchases, holding
 constant contemporaneous supply-side factors. We  show that brand
 preferences form endogenously, are highly persistent, and explain 40
 percent of geographic variation in market shares. Counterfactuals suggest
 that brand preferences create large entry barriers and durable advantages
 for incumbent firms and can explain the persistence of early-mover
 advantage over long periods. (JEL D12, L11, M31, M37)

Title: The Contribution of Large and Small Employers to Job Creation in Times of High and Low Unemployment 
Abstract:
 We document a negative correlation, at business cycle frequencies, between
 the net job creation rate of large employers and the level of aggregate
 unemployment that is much stronger than for small employers. The
 differential growth rate of employment between initially large and small
 employers has an unconditional correlation of -0.5 with the unemployment
 rate, and varies by about 5 percent over the business cycle. We exploit
 several datasets from the United States, Denmark, and France, both
 repeated cross sections and job flows with employer longitudinal
 information, spanning the last four decades and several business cycles.
 We discuss implications for theories of factor demand. (JEL D22, E23, E32,

Title: The Rise of the Service Economy 
Abstract:
 This paper analyzes the role of specialized high-skilled labor in the
 disproportionate growth of the service sector. Empirically, the importance
 of skill-intensive services has risen during a period of increasing
 relative wages and quantities of high-skilled labor. We develop a theory
 in which demand shifts toward more skill-  intensive output as
 productivity rises, increasing the importance of market services relative
 to home production. Consistent with the data, the theory predicts a rising
 level of skill, skill premium, and relative price of services that is
 linked to this skill premium. (JEL J24, L80, L90)

Title: Liquidity, Monetary Policy, and the Financial Crisis: A New Monetarist Approach 
Abstract:
 A model of public and private liquidity integrates financial
 intermediation  theory with a New Monetarist monetary framework.
 Non-passive fiscal policy and costs of operating a currency system imply
 that an optimal policy deviates from the Friedman rule. A liquidity trap
 can exist in equilibrium away from the Friedman rule, and there exists a
 permanent nonneutrality of money, driven by an illiquidity effect.
 Financial frictions can produce a financial-crisis phenomenon that can be
 mitigated by conventional open market operations working in an
 unconventional manner. Private asset purchases by the central bank are
 either irrelevant or they reallocate credit and redistribute income. (JEL

Title: How General Are Risk Preferences? Choices under Uncertainty in Different Domains 
Abstract:
 We analyze the extent to which individuals' choices over five
 employer-provided insurance coverage decisions and one 401(k) investment
 decision exhibit systematic patterns, as would be implied by a general
 utility component of risk preferences. We provide evidence consistent with
 an important domain-general component that operates across all insurance
 choices. We find a considerably weaker relationship between one's
 insurance decisions and 401(k) asset allocation, although this
 relationship appears larger for more "financially sophisticated"
 individuals. Estimates from a stylized coverage choice model suggest that
 up to 30 percent of our sample makes choices that may be consistent across
 all 6 domains. (JEL D12, D14, D81, G22, J33)

Title: Sinking, Swimming, or Learning to Swim in Medicare Part D 
Abstract:
 Under Medicare Part D, senior citizens choose prescription drug insurance
 offered by numerous private insurers. We examine nonpoor enrollees-
 actions in 2006 and 2007 using panel data. Our sample reduced overspending
 by $298 on average, with gains by 81 percent of them. The greatest
 improvements were by those who overspent most in 2006 and by those who
 switched plans. Decisions to switch depended on individuals' overspending
 in 2006 and on individual-specific effects of changes in their current
 plans. The oldest consumers and those initiating medications for
 Alzheimer's disease improved by more than average, suggesting that
 real-world institutions help overcome cognitive limitations. (JEL D14,

Title: Maturity, Indebtedness, and Default Risk 
Abstract:
 We advance quantitative-theoretic models of sovereign debt by proving	the
 existence of a downward sloping equilibrium price function for long-term
 debt and implementing a novel method to accurately compute it. We show
 that incorporating long-term debt allows the model to match Argentina's
 average external debt-to-output ratio,  average spread on external debt,
 the standard deviation of spreads, and simultaneously improve upon the
 model's ability to account for Argentina's other cyclical facts. We also
 investigated the welfare properties of maturity length and showed that if
 the possibility of self-fulfilling rollover crises is taken into account,
 long-term debt is superior to short-term debt. (JEL E23, E32, F34, O11,

Title: Trade Costs, Asset Market Frictions, and Risk Sharing 
Abstract:
 I use bilateral import data to test for and quantify the importance of
 trade costs and asset market frictions in explaining the failure of
 perfect international consumption risk sharing. I find that while
 frictions in international asset markets significantly impede optimal
 consumption risk sharing between developed and developing countries  over
 the period 1970-2000, developed countries are close to optimal risk
 sharing with each other. Trade costs, in contrast, significantly impede
 risk sharing for all countries. (JEL E21, E44, F14, F41, G15)

Title: Disaster Risk and Business Cycles 
Abstract:
 Motivated by the evidence that risk premia are large and countercyclical, 
 this paper studies a tractable real business cycle model with a small risk
 of economic disaster, such as the Great Depression. An increase in
 disaster risk leads to a decline of employment, output, investment, stock
 prices, and interest rates, and an increase in the  expected return on
 risky assets. The model matches well data on quantities, asset prices, and
 particularly the relations between quantities and prices, suggesting that
 variation in aggregate risk plays a significant role in some business
 cycles. (JEL E13, E32, E44, G32)

Title: But Who Will Monitor the Monitor? 
Abstract:
 Suppose that providing incentives for a group of individuals in a
 strategic context requires a monitor to detect their deviations. What
 about the monitor's deviations? To address this question, I propose a
 contract that makes the monitor responsible for monitoring, and thereby
 provides incentives even when the monitor's observations are not only
 private, but costly, too. I also characterize exactly when such a contract
 can provide monitors with the right incentives to perform. In doing so, I
 emphasize virtual enforcement and suggest its implications for the theory
 of repeated games. (JEL C78, D23, D82, D86)

Title: Reset Price Inflation and the Impact of Monetary Policy Shocks 
Abstract:
 Many business cycle models use a flat short-run Phillips curve, due to
 time-dependent pricing and strategic complementarities, to explain
 fluctuations in real output. But, in doing so, these models predict
 unrealistically high persistence and stability of US inflation in recent
 decades. We calculate "reset price inflation"--based on new prices chosen
 by the subsample of price changers--to dissect this discrepancy. We find
 that the models generate too much persistence and stability both in reset
 price inflation and in the way reset price inflation is converted into
 actual inflation. Our findings present a challenge to existing
 explanations for business cycles. (JEL E31, E52)

Title: Physician Agency and Adoption of Generic Pharmaceuticals 
Abstract:
 I examine physician agency in health care services in the context of the
 choice between brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals. I examine
 micro-panel data from Japan, where physicians can legally make profits by
 prescribing and dispensing drugs. The results indicate  that physicians
 often fail to internalize patient costs, explaining  why cheaper generics
 are infrequently adopted. Doctors respond to markup differentials between
 the two versions, indicating another agency problem. However, generics'
 markup advantages are shortlived, which limits their impact on increasing
 generic adoption.  Additionally, state dependence and heterogeneous doctor
 preferences  affected generics' adoption. Policy makers can target these
 factors to improve static efficiency. (JEL D82, I11, J44, L65)

Title: Is the Volatility of the Market Price of Risk Due to Intermittent Portfolio Rebalancing? 
Abstract:
 Our paper examines whether the failure of unsophisticated investors to
 rebalance their portfolios can help to explain the countercyclical
 volatility of aggregate risk compensation in financial markets. To answer
 this question, we set up a model in which a large mass of investors do not
 rebalance their portfolio shares in response to aggregate shocks, while a
 smaller mass of active investors do. We find that intermittent rebalancers
 more than double the effect of aggregate shocks on the time variation in
 risk premia by forcing active traders to sell more shares in good times
 and buy more shares in bad times. (JEL D14, E32, G11, G12)

Title: The Strategy of Manipulating Conflict 
Abstract:
 Two players choose hawkish or dovish actions in a conflict game with
 incomplete information. An "extremist," who can either be a hawk or a
 dove, attempts to manipulate decision making. If actions are strategic
 complements, a hawkish extremist increases the likelihood of conflict, and
 reduces welfare, by sending a public message  which triggers hawkish
 behavior from both players. If actions are strategic substitutes, a dovish
 extremist instead sends a public message which causes one player to become
 more dovish and the other more hawkish. A hawkish (dovish) extremist is
 unable to manipulate decision making if actions are strategic substitutes
 (complements). (JEL D74, D82)

Title: Credit Market Consequences of Improved Personal Identification: Field Experimental Evidence from Malawi 
Abstract:
 We implemented a randomized field experiment in Malawi examining borrower
 responses to being fingerprinted when applying for loans. This
 intervention improved the lender's ability to implement dynamic repayment
 incentives, allowing it to withhold future loans from past defaulters
 while rewarding good borrowers with better loan terms. As predicted by a
 simple model, fingerprinting led to substantially higher repayment rates
 for borrowers with the highest ex ante default risk, but had no effect for
 the rest of the borrowers. We provide unique evidence that this
 improvement in repayment rates is accompanied by behaviors consistent with
 less adverse selection and lower moral hazard. (JEL D14, D82, G21, O12,

Title: Testing Models of Consumer Search Using Data on Web Browsing and Purchasing Behavior 
Abstract:
 Using a large dataset on web browsing and purchasing behavior we test to
 what extent consumers are searching in accordance to various search
 models. We find that the benchmark model of sequential search with a known
 price distribution can be rejected based on recall patterns found in the
 data as well as the absence of dependence of search decisions on prices.
 Our findings suggest fixed sample size search provides a more accurate
 description of search behavior. We then utilize the fixed sample size
 search model to estimate demand elasticities of online bookstores in an
 environment where store preferences are heterogeneous. (JEL D12, D83, L81)

Title: Inequality at Work: The Effect of Peer Salaries on Job Satisfaction 
Abstract:
 We study the effect of disclosing information on peers' salaries on
 workers' job satisfaction and job search intentions. A randomly chosen
 subset of University of California employees was informed about a new
 website listing the pay of University employees. All employees were then
 surveyed about their job satisfaction and job search intentions. Workers
 with salaries below the median for their pay unit and occupation report
 lower pay and job satisfaction and a significant increase in the
 likelihood of looking for a new job. Above-median earners are unaffected.
 Differences in pay rank matter more than differences in pay levels. (JEL

Title: Credit Traps 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the limitations of monetary policy in stimulating
 credit and investment. We show that, under certain circumstances,
 unconventional monetary policies fail in that liquidity  injections into
 the banking sector are hoarded and not lent out. We use the term "credit
 traps" to describe such situations and show how they can arise due to the
 interplay between financing  frictions, liquidity, and collateral values.
 We show that small contractions in monetary policy can lead to a collapse
 in lending. Our analysis demonstrates how quantitative easing may be
 useful in increasing collateral prices, bank lending, and aggregate
 investment. (JEL E44, E52, E58, G01)

Title: Economic Growth with Bubbles 
Abstract:
 We develop a stylized model of economic growth with bubbles in which
 changes in investor sentiment lead to the appearance and collapse of
 macroeconomic bubbles or pyramid schemes. These bubbles mitigate the
 effects of financial frictions. During bubbly episodes, unproductive
 investors demand bubbles while productive investors supply them. These
 transfers of resources improve economic efficiency thereby expanding
 consumption, the capital stock and output. When bubbly episodes end, there
 is a fall in consumption, the capital stock and output. We argue that the
 stochastic equilibria of the model provide a natural way of introducing
 bubble shocks into business cycle models. (JEL E22, E23, E32, E44, O41)

Title: The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation: Comment 
Abstract:
 Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson's (2001) seminal article argues
 property-rights institutions powerfully affect national income, using
 estimated mortality rates of early European settlers to instrument capital
 expropriation risk. However, 36 of the 64 countries in the sample are
 assigned  mortality rates from other countries, often based on mistaken or
 conflicting evidence. Also, incomparable mortality rates from populations
 of laborers, bishops, and soldiers--often on campaign--are combined in a
 manner that favors the hypothesis. When these data issues are controlled
 for, the relationship between mortality and expropriation risk lacks
 robustness, and  instrumental-variable estimates become unreliable, often
 with infinite confidence intervals. (JEL D02, E23, F54, I12, N40, O43,

Title: The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation: Reply 
Abstract:
 Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001) established that economic
 institutions today are correlated with expected mortality of European
 colonialists. David Albouy argues this relationship is not robust. He
 drops all data from Latin America and much of the data from  Africa,
 making up almost 60 percent of our sample, despite much information on the
 mortality of Europeans in those places during the colonial period. He also
 includes a "campaign" dummy that  is coded inconsistently; even modest
 corrections undermine his claims. We also show that limiting the effect of
 outliers strengthens our results, making them robust to even extreme
 versions of Albouy's critiques. (JEL D02, E23, F54, I12, N40, O43, P14)
