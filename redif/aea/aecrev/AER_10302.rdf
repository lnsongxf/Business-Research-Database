Title: Paper Money
Abstract: Drastic changes in central bank operations and monetary institutions
in recent years have made previously standard approaches to explaining the determination of the price level obsolete. Recent
expansions of central bank balance sheets and of the levels of rich-country sovereign debt, as well as the evolving political economy of the European Monetary Union, have made it clear that fiscal policy
and monetary policy are intertwined. Our thinking and teaching
about inflation, monetary policy, and fiscal policy should be based on
models that recognize fiscal-monetary policy interactions. (JEL E31,

Title: Designing Random Allocation Mechanisms: Theory and Applications
Abstract: Randomization is commonplace in everyday resource allocation. We
generalize the theory of randomized assignment to accommodate
multi-unit allocations and various real-world constraints, such as
group-specific quotas ("controlled choice") in school choice and
house allocation, and scheduling and curriculum constraints in
course allocation. We develop new mechanisms that are ex ante efficient and fair in these environments, and that incorporate certain
non-additive substitutable preferences. We also develop a "utility
guarantee" technique that limits ex post unfairness in random allocations, supplementing the ex ante fairness promoted by randomization. This can be applied to multi-unit assignment problems and certain two-sided matching problems. (JEL C78, D82)

Title: Inferring Strategic Voting
Abstract: We estimate a model of strategic voting and quantify the impact it
has on election outcomes. Because the model exhibits multiplicity of
outcomes, we adopt a set estimator. Using Japanese general-election
data, we find a large fraction (63.4 percent, 84.9 percent) of strategic
voters, only a small fraction (1.4 percent, 4.2 percent) of whom voted
for a candidate other than the one they most preferred (misaligned
voting). Existing empirical literature has not distinguished between
the two, estimating misaligned voting instead of strategic voting.
Accordingly, while our estimate of strategic voting is high, our
estimate of misaligned voting is comparable to previous studies.

Title: Dynamic Matching and Bargaining Games: A General Approach
Abstract: Dynamic matching and bargaining games are models of decentralized
markets with trading frictions. A central objective is to investigate
how equilibrium outcomes depend on the level of frictions. In
particular, does the trading outcome become Walrasian when frictions
become small? Existing specifications of such games provide
divergent answers. This paper presents a new characterization result
for competitive allocations in quasilinear economies. The characterization result is used to investigate what causes these differences and to generalize insights from the analysis of specific matching and bargaining games. (JEL C73, C78, D82, D83)

Title: The Effect of Language on Economic Behavior: Evidence from Savings Rates, Health Behaviors, and Retirement Assets
Abstract: Languages differ widely in the ways they encode time. I test the
hypothesis that the languages that grammatically associate the future
and the present, foster future-oriented behavior. This prediction
arises naturally when well-documented effects of language structure
are merged with models of intertemporal choice. Empirically, I
find that speakers of such languages: save more, retire with more
wealth, smoke less, practice safer sex, and are less obese. This
holds both across countries and within countries when comparing
demographically similar native households. The evidence does not
support the most obvious forms of common causation. I discuss
implications for theories of intertemporal choice. (JEL D14, D83,

Title: Intermediary Asset Pricing
Abstract: We model the dynamics of risk premia during crises in asset markets
where the marginal investor is a financial intermediary. Intermediaries face an equity capital constraint. Risk premia rise
when the constraint binds, reflecting the capital scarcity. The calibrated model matches the nonlinearity of risk premia during crises
and the speed of reversion in risk premia from a crisis back to precrisis
levels. We evaluate the effect of three government policies: reducing intermediaries borrowing costs, injecting equity capital, and purchasing distressed assets. Injecting equity capital is particularly
effective because it alleviates the equity capital constraint that
drives the model's crisis. (JEL E44, G12, G21, G23, G24)

Title: Job Selection and Wages over the Business Cycle
Abstract: We consider a model with on-the-job search where current wages
depend only on current aggregate labor market conditions and idiosyncratic match-specific productivities. We show theoretically that
the model replicates the findings in Bils (1985) and Beaudry and
DiNardo (1991) on the history dependence in wages. We develop a
method to measure match qualities in the data and show empirically
that various variables summarizing past aggregate labor market
conditions have explanatory power for current wages only because
they are correlated with match qualities. They lose any predictive
power once match qualities are accounted for. (JEL E3, E24, J3)

Title: Optimal Expectations and Limited Medical Testing: Evidence from Huntington Disease
Abstract: We use novel data to study genetic testing among individuals at
risk for Huntington disease (HD), a hereditary disease with limited
life expectancy. Although genetic testing is perfectly predictive and
carries little economic cost, presymptomatic testing is rare. Testing
rates increase with increases in ex ante risk of having HD. Untested
individuals express optimistic beliefs about their health and make
decisions (e.g., retirement) as if they do not have HD, even though
individuals with confirmed HD behave differently. We suggest that
these facts can be reconciled by an optimal expectations model
(Brunnermeier and Parker 2005). (JEL D84, I12)

Title: Public Monopoly and Economic Efficiency: Evidence from the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board's Entry Decisions
Abstract: We estimate a spatial model of liquor demand to analyze the impact of
government-controlled retailing on entry patterns. In the absence of
the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, the state would have roughly
2.5 times the current number of stores, higher consumer surplus, and
lower payments to liquor store employees. With just over half the
number of stores that would maximize welfare, the government system is instead best rationalized as profit maximization with profit sharing. Government operation mitigates, but does not eliminate, free entry's bias against rural consumers. We find only limited evidence of political influence on entry. (JEL D42, D72, L11, L12, L43, L81)

Title: Commercial Imperialism? Political Influence and Trade during the Cold War
Abstract: We provide evidence that increased political influence, arising from
CIA interventions during the Cold War, was used to create a larger
foreign market for American products. Following CIA interventions,
imports from the US increased dramatically, while total exports to
the US were unaffected. The surge in imports was concentrated in
industries in which the US had a comparative disadvantage, not a
comparative advantage. Our analysis is able to rule out decreased
trade costs, changing political ideology, and an increase in US loans
and grants as alternative explanations. We provide evidence that the
increased imports arose through direct purchases of American products by foreign governments. (JEL D72, F14, F54, N42, N72)

Title: Assessing the Incidence and Efficiency of a Prominent Place Based Policy
Abstract: This paper empirically assesses the incidence and efficiency of
Round I of the federal urban Empowerment Zone (EZ ) program
using confidential microdata from the Decennial Census and the
Longitudinal Business Database. Using rejected and future applicants
to the EZ program as controls, we find that EZ designation
substantially increased employment in zone neighborhoods and
generated wage increases for local workers without corresponding
increases in population or the local cost of living. The results suggest
the efficiency costs of first Round EZs were relatively modest.

Title: Selection, Agriculture, and Cross-Country Productivity Differences
Abstract: Cross-country labor productivity differences are larger in agriculture
than in non-agriculture. We propose a new explanation for these
patterns in which the self-selection of heterogeneous workers
determines sector productivity. We formalize our theory in a general-equilibrium Roy model in which preferences feature a subsistence
food requirement. In the model, subsistence requirements induce
workers that are relatively unproductive at agricultural work to
nonetheless select into the agriculture sector in poor countries. When
parameterized, the model predicts that productivity differences are
roughly twice as large in agriculture as non-agriculture even when
countries differ by an economy-wide efficiency term that affects both
sectors uniformly. (JEL J24, J31, J43, O11, O13, O40)

Title: Testing for Racial Differences in the Mental Ability of Young Children
Abstract: Using a new nationally representative dataset, we find minor differences in test outcomes between black and white infants that disappear with a limited set of controls. However, relative to whites, all other races lose substantial ground by age two. Combining our estimates with results in prior literature, we show that a simple model with assortative mating fits our data well, implying that differences in children's environments between racial groups can fully explain gaps in intelligence. If parental ability influences a child's test scores both genetically and through environment, then our findings are less informative and can be reconciled with a wide range of racial differences in inherited intelligence.

Title: Merger Policy with Merger Choice
Abstract: We analyze the optimal policy of an antitrust authority towards horizontal mergers when merger proposals are endogenous and firms choose among alternative mergers. In our model, the optimal policy of an antitrust authority that seeks to maximize expected consumer surplus imposes a tougher standard on "larger" mergers, i.e., those involving firms with a larger pre-merger market share. The optimal policy is a response to a bias in firms' proposal incentives: firms always propose a larger merger when it is better for consumers than a smaller one, but sometimes will propose the larger one even when it is worse for consumers.

Title: Inferior Good and Giffen Behavior for Investing and Borrowing
Abstract: The standard assumption that asset demand increases in income and decreases in price has its origin in Arrow's classic model with one risky and one risk free asset, where both are held long, and preferences exhibit decreasing absolute and increasing relative risk aversion. However if one allows shorting of the risk free asset or decreasing relative risk aversion, the risk free asset can not only fail to be a normal good but can be a Giffen good. This behavior can occur even for members of the popular HARA utility family. More generally, Giffen behavior can occur over multiple income ranges.

Title: Misclassification Errors and the Underestimation of the US Unemployment Rate
Abstract: Using recent results in the measurement error literature, we show that the official US unemployment rate substantially underestimates the true level of unemployment, due to misclassification errors in the labor force status in the Current Population Survey. During the period from January 1996 to August 2011, the corrected monthly unemployment rates are between 1 and 4.4 percentage points (2.1 percentage points on average) higher than the official rates, and are more sensitive to changes in business cycles. The labor force participation rates, however, are not affected by this correction.

Abstract: The Bagwell and Staiger (1990) theory of cooperative trade agreements predicts new tariffs (i) increase with imports, (ii) increase with the inverse of the sum of the import demand and export supply elasticities, and (iii) decrease with the variance of imports. We find US import policy during 1997-2006 to be consistent with this theory. A one standard deviation increase in import growth, the inverse of the sum of the import demand and export supply elasticity, and the standard deviation of import growth changes the probability that the US imposes an antidumping tariff by 35 percent, by 88 percent, and by -76 percent, respectively.

Title: A Theory of Charitable Fund-Raising with Costly Solicitations
Abstract: We present a theory of charitable fund-raising in which it is costly to solicit donors. We fully characterize the solicitation strategy that maximizes donations net of fund-raising costs. It is optimal for the fund-raiser to target only the "net contributors" -- donors who would give more than their solicitation costs. We show that as the income inequality increases, so does the level of the public good, despite a (potentially) non-monotonic fund-raising strategy. This implies that costly fund-raising can provide a novel explanation for the non-neutrality of income redistributions and government grants often found in empirical studies.
