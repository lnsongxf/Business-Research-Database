Title: Intergenerational Occupational Mobility in Great Britain and the United States since 1850
Abstract: The US tolerates more inequality than Europe and believes its economic
mobility is greater than Europe?s, though they had roughly
equal rates of intergenerational occupational mobility in the late
twentieth century. We extend this comparison into the nineteenth century using 10,000 nationally-representative British and US fathers
and sons. The US was more mobile than Britain through 1900, so
in the experience of those who created the US welfare state in the
1930s, the US had indeed been ?exceptional.? The US mobility lead
over Britain was erased by the 1950s, as US mobility fell from its
nineteenth century levels.

Title: Why Don't the Poor Save More? Evidence from Health Savings Experiments
Abstract: Using data from a field experiment in Kenya, we document that providing individuals with simple informal savings technologies can
substantially increase investment in preventative health and reduce
vulnerability to health shocks. Simply providing a safe place to
keep money was sufficient to increase health savings by 66 percent.
Adding an earmarking feature was only helpful when funds were put
toward emergencies, or for individuals that are frequently taxed by
friends and relatives. Group-based savings and credit schemes had
very large effects.

Title: Unconventional Fiscal Policy at the Zero Bound
Abstract: When the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates binds, monetary
policy cannot provide appropriate stimulus. We show that, in the
standard New Keynesian model, tax policy can deliver such stimulus
at no cost and in a time-consistent manner. There is no need to use
inefficient policies such as wasteful public spending or future commitments to low interest rates.

Title: The Dynamic Effects of Personal and Corporate Income Tax Changes in the United States
Abstract: This paper estimates the dynamic effects of changes in taxes in the
United States. We distinguish between changes in personal and corporate income taxes and develop a new narrative account of federal
tax liability changes in these two tax components. We develop an
estimator which uses narratively identified tax changes as proxies
for structural tax shocks and apply it to quarterly post-WWII data.
We find that short run output effects of tax shocks are large and that
it is important to distinguish between different types of taxes when
considering their impact on the labor market and on expenditure
components.

Title: A Theory of Strategic Voting in Runoff Elections
Abstract: This paper analyzes the properties of runoff electoral systems when
voters are strategic. A model of three-candidate runoff elections is
presented, and two new features are included: the risk of upset victory
in the second round is endogenous, and many types of runoff systems
are considered. Three main results emerge. First, runoff elections produce equilibria in which only two candidates receive a positive fraction of the votes. Second, a sincere voting equilibrium does not always exist. Finally, runoff systems with a threshold below 50 percent produce an Ortega effect that may lead to the systematic victory of the
Condorcet loser.

Title: Going to a Better School: Effects and Behavioral Responses
Abstract: This paper applies a regression discontinuity design to the Romanian
secondary school system, generating two findings. First, students
who have access to higher achievement schools perform better in
a (high stakes) graduation test. Second, the stratification of schools
by quality in general, and the opportunity to attend a better school
in particular, result in significant behavioral responses: (i) teachers
sort in a manner consistent with a preference for higher achieving
students; (ii) children who make it into more selective schools realize
they are relatively weaker and feel marginalized; (iii) parents reduce
effort when their children attend a better school.

Title: The Lure of Authority: Motivation and Incentive Effects of Power
Abstract: Authority and power permeate political, social, and economic
life, but empirical knowledge about the motivational origins and
consequences of authority is limited. We study the motivation
and incentive effects of authority experimentally in an authority-delegation game. Individuals often retain authority even when its
delegation is in their material interest?suggesting that authority has
nonpecuniary consequences for utility. Authority also leads to overprovision of effort by the controlling parties, while a large percentage of subordinates underprovide effort despite pecuniary incentives to the contrary. Authority thus has important motivational consequences that exacerbate the inefficiencies arising from suboptimal delegation choices.

Title: Preferences and Incentives of Appointed and Elected Public Officials: Evidence from State Trial Court Judges
Abstract: We study how two selection systems for public officials, appointment
and election, affect policy outcomes, focusing on state court judges
and their criminal sentencing decisions. First, under appointment,
policy congruence with voter preferences is attained through
selecting judges with homogeneous preferences. In contrast, under
election, judges face strong reelection incentives, while selection on
preferences is weak. Second, the effectiveness of election in attaining
policy congruence critically depends on payoffs from the job, which
implies that the effectiveness of election may vary substantially across
public offices. Third, reelection incentives may discourage judges
with significant human capital from holding office.

Title: Just Luck: An Experimental Study of Risk-Taking and Fairness
Abstract: Choices involving risk significantly affect the distribution of income
and wealth in society. This paper reports the results of the first
experiment, to our knowledge, to study fairness views about risktaking,
specifically whether such views are based chiefly on ex ante
opportunities or on ex post outcomes. We find that, even though
many participants focus exclusively on ex ante opportunities, most
favor some redistribution ex post. Many participants also make
a distinction between ex post inequalities that reflect differences
in luck and ex post inequalities that reflect differences in choices.
These findings apply to both stakeholders and impartial spectators.

Title: The Gravity of Knowledge
Abstract: We analyze the international operations of multinational firms to
measure the spatial barriers to transferring knowledge. We model
firms that can transfer bits of knowledge to their foreign affiliates in
either embodied (traded intermediates) or disembodied form (direct
communication). The model shows how knowledge transfer costs can
be inferred from multinationals? operations. We use firm-level data
on the trade and sales of US multinationals to confirm the model?s
predictions. Disembodied knowledge transfer costs not only make
the standard multinational firm model consistent with the fact that
affiliate sales fall in distance but quantitatively accounts for much of
the gravity in multinational activity.

Title: Nonconvexities, Retirement, and the Elasticity of Labor Supply
Abstract: We consider two life cycle models of labor supply that use nonconvexities to generate retirement. In each case we derive a link between hours worked prior to retirement, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution for labor (IES), and the size of the nonconvexities. This link is robust to allowing for credit constraints and human capital accumulation by younger workers and suggests values for the IES that are .75 or higher.

Title: Lemons Markets and the Transmission of Aggregate Shocks
Abstract: I study a dynamic economy featuring adverse selection in asset markets. Borrowing-constrained entrepreneurs sell past projects to finance new investment, but asymmetric information creates a lemons problem. I show that this friction is equivalent to a tax on financial transactions. The implicit tax rate responds to aggregate shocks, generating amplification in the response of investment and cyclical variation in liquidity.

Title: Placebo Reforms
Abstract: I study a dynamic model of strategic reform decisions that potentially affect the stochastic evolution of a publicly observed economic variable. Policy makers maximize their evaluation by a boundedly rational public. Specifically, the public follows a rule that attributes recent changes to the most recent intervention. I analyze subgame perfect equilibrium in this model when the economic variable follows a linear growth trend with noise. Equilibrium is essentially unique and stationary, bearing a subtle formal relation to optimal search models. Policy makers tend to act during crises, display risk aversion conditional on acting, and prefer interventions that induce permanent noise.

Title: Discretionary Tax Changes and the Macroeconomy: New Narrative Evidence from the United Kingdom
Abstract: This paper provides new estimates of the macroeconomic effects of tax changes using a new narrative dataset for the United Kingdom. Identification is achieved by isolating ?exogenous? tax policy changes using the Romer and Romer narrative strategy. I find that a 1 percent cut in taxes increases GDP by 0.6 percent on impact and 2.5 percent over three years. The findings are remarkably similar to Romer and Romer narrative estimates for the United States, reinforcing the view that tax changes have powerful and persistent effects. ?Exogenous? tax changes are also shown to have contributed to important episodes in the UK business cycle.
