Title: The Growth of Low-Skill Service Jobs and the Polarization of the US Labor Market
Abstract: We offer a unified analysis of the growth of low-skill service
occupations between 1980 and 2005 and the concurrent polarization
of US employment and wages. We hypothesize that polarization
stems from the interaction between consumer preferences, which
favor variety over specialization, and the falling cost of automating
routine, codifiable job tasks. Applying a spatial equilibrium model, we
corroborate four implications of this hypothesis. Local labor markets
that specialized in routine tasks differentially adopted information
technology, reallocated low-skill labor into service occupations
(employment polarization), experienced earnings growth at the tails
of the distribution (wage polarization), and received inflows of skilled
labor.

Title: Ownership Consolidation and Product Characteristics: A Study of the US Daily Newspaper Market
Abstract: This paper develops a structural model of newspaper markets
to analyze the effects of ownership consolidation, taking into
account not only firms' price adjustments but also the adjustments
in newspaper characteristics. A new dataset on newspaper prices
and characteristics is used to estimate the model. The paper then
simulates the effect of a merger in the Minneapolis newspaper
market and studies how welfare effects of mergers vary with market
characteristics. It finds that ignoring adjustments of product
characteristics causes substantial differences in estimated effects of
mergers.

Title: Trade, Tastes, and Nutrition in India
Abstract: This paper explores the causes and consequences of regional taste
differences. I introduce habit formation into a standard general equilibrium
model. Household tastes evolve over time to favor foods consumed
as a child. Thus, locally abundant foods are preferred in every
region, as they were relatively inexpensive in prior generations. These
patterns alter the correspondence between price changes and nutrition.
For example, neglecting this relationship between tastes and agro-climatic
endowments overstates the short-run nutritional gains from agricultural
trade liberalization, since preferred foods rise in price in every
region. I examine the model's predictions using household survey data
from many regions of India.

Title: Time Use during the Great Recession
Abstract: Using data from the American Time Use Survey between 2003
and 2010, we document that home production absorbs roughly
30 percent
of foregone market work hours at business cycle frequencies.
Leisure absorbs roughly 50 percent of foregone market work
hours, with sleeping and television watching accounting for most
of this increase. We document significant increases in time spent
on shopping, child care, education, and health. Job search absorbs
between 2 and 6 percent of foregone market work hours. We discuss
the implications of our results for business cycle models with home
production and non-separable preferences.

Title: The Great Diversification and Its Undoing
Abstract: We investigate the hypothesis that macroeconomic fluctuations are primitively the results of many microeconomic shocks. We define fundamental volatility as the volatility that would arise from an economy made entirely of idiosyncratic sectoral or firm-level shocks. Fundamental volatility accounts for the swings in macroeconomic volatility in the major world economies in the past half-century. It accounts for the "great moderation" and its undoing. The initial great moderation is due to a decreasing share of manufacturing between 1975 and 1985. The recent rise of macroeconomic volatility
is chiefly due to the growth of the financial sector.

Title: Asset Prices and Institutional Investors
Abstract: We consider an economy populated by institutional investors alongside
standard retail investors. Institutions care about their performance
relative to a certain index. Our framework is tractable, admitting
exact closed-form expressions, and produces the following analytical
results. We find that institutions tilt their portfolios towards stocks that
compose their benchmark index. The resulting price pressure boosts
index stocks. By demanding more risky stocks than retail investors,
institutions amplify the index stock volatilities and aggregate stock
market volatility and give rise to countercyclical Sharpe ratios. Trades
by institutions induce excess correlations among stocks that belong to
their benchmark, generating an asset-class effect.

Title: The Political Resource Curse
Abstract: This paper studies the effect of additional government revenues
on political corruption and on the quality of politicians, both with
theory and data. The theory is based on a political agency model
with career concerns and endogenous entry of candidates. The data
refer to Brazil, where federal transfers to municipal governments
change exogenously at given population thresholds, allowing us to
implement a regression discontinuity design. The empirical evidence
shows that larger transfers increase observed corruption and reduce
the average education of candidates for mayor. These and other
more specific empirical results are in line with the predictions of the
theory.

Title: Does Disability Insurance Receipt Discourage Work? Using Examiner Assignment to Estimate Causal Effects of SSDI Receipt
Abstract: We present the first causal estimates of the effect of Social Security
Disability Insurance benefit receipt on labor supply using all program
applicants. We use administrative data to match applications to
disability examiners and exploit variation in examiners' allowance
rates as an instrument for benefit receipt. We find that among the
estimated 23 percent of applicants on the margin of program entry,
employment would have been 28 percentage points higher had they
not received benefits. The effect is heterogeneous, ranging from
no effect for those with more severe impairments to 50 percentage
points for entrants with relatively less severe impairments.

Title: When Should Sellers Use Auctions?
Abstract: A bidding process can be organized so that offers are submitted
simultaneously or sequentially. In the latter case, potential buyers
can condition their behavior on previous entrants' decisions. The
relative performance of these mechanisms is investigated when entry
is costly and selective, meaning that potential buyers with higher
values are more likely to participate. A simple sequential mechanism
can give both buyers and sellers significantly higher payoffs than the
commonly used simultaneous bid auction. The findings are illustrated
with parameters estimated from simultaneous entry USFS timber
auctions where our estimates predict that the sequential mechanism
would increase revenue and efficiency.

Title: Early Life Health Interventions and Academic Achievement
Abstract: This paper studies the effect of improved early life health care on
mortality and long-run academic achievement in school. We use the
idea that medical treatments often follow rules of thumb for assigning
care to patients, such as the classification of Very Low Birth
Weight (VLBW), which assigns infants special care at a specific birth
weight cutoff. Using detailed administrative data on schooling and
birth records from Chile and Norway, we establish that children who
receive extra medical care at birth have lower mortality rates and
higher test scores and grades in school. These gains are in the order
of 0.15-0.22 standard deviations.

Title: Taxation and International Migration of Superstars: Evidence from the European Football Market
Abstract: We analyze the effects of top tax rates on international migration of
football players in 14 European countries since 1985. Both country
case studies and multinomial regressions show evidence of strong
mobility responses to tax rates, with an elasticity of the number of
foreign (domestic) players to the net-of-tax rate around one (around
0.15). We also find evidence of sorting effects (low taxes attract highability
players who displace low-ability players) and displacement
effects (low taxes on foreigners displace domestic players). Those
results can be rationalized in a simple model of migration and taxation
with rigid labor demand.

Title: Immigration, Offshoring, and American Jobs
Abstract: Following Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) we present a model in which tasks of varying complexity are matched to workers of varying skill in order to develop and test predictions regarding the effects of immigration and offshoring on US native-born workers. We find that immigrant and native-born workers do not compete much due to the fact that they tend to perform tasks at opposite ends of the task complexity spectrum, with offshore workers performing the tasks in the middle. An effect of offshoring and a positive effect of immigration on native-born employment suggest that immigration and offshoring improve industry efficiency.

Title: Regional Effects of Trade Reform: What Is the Correct Measure of Liberalization?
Abstract: A growing body of research examines the regional effects of trade liberalization using a weighted average of trade policy changes across industries. This paper develops a specific-factors model of regional economies that provides a theoretical foundation for this intuitively appealing empirical approach and also provides guidance on treatment of the nontraded sector. In the context of Brazil's early 1990s trade liberalization, I find that regions facing a 10 percentage point larger liberalization-induced price decline experienced a 4 percentage point larger wage decline. The results also confirm the empirical relevance of appropriately dealing with the nontraded sector.

Title: Limited Life Expectancy, Human Capital and Health Investments
Abstract: Human capital theory predicts that life expectancy will impact human capital attainment. We estimate this relationship using variation in life expectancy driven by Huntington disease, an inherited neurological disorder. We compare investments for individuals who have ex-ante identical risks of HD but differ in disease realization. Individuals with the HD mutation complete less education and job training. The elasticity of demand for college attendance with respect to life expectancy is around 1.0. We relate this to cross-country and over-time differences in education. We use smoking and cancer screening data to test the corollary that health capital responds to life expectancy.

Title: Intergenerational Occupational Mobility in Great Britain and the United States since 1850: Comment
Abstract: Using historical census and survey data, Long and Ferrie (2013) found a significant decline in social mobility in the United States from 1880 to 1973. We present two critiques of the Long-Ferrie study. First, the data quality of the Long-Ferrie study is more limiting than the authors acknowledge. Second, and more critically, they applied a method ill-suited for measuring social mobility of farmers in a comparative study between 1880 and 1973, a period in which the proportion of farmers dramatically declined in the United States. We show that Long and Ferrie's main conclusion is all driven by this misleading result for farmers.

Title: Intergenerational Occupational Mobility in Great Britain and the United States since 1850: Comment
Abstract: We reanalyze Long and Ferrie's data. We find that the association of occupational status across generations was quite similar over time and place. Two significant differences were: (i) American farms in 1880 were far more open to men who had nonfarm backgrounds than were American farms in 1973 or British farms in either century; (ii) of the four cases, the intergenerational correlation was strongest in Britain in 1881. Structural mobility related to, among other things, economic growth and occupational differentiation, affected mobility most in 1970s America.

Title: Intergenerational Occupational Mobility in Great Britain and the United States since 1850: Reply
Abstract: We respond to several criticisms by Avery Guest and Michael Hout (2013) and Yu Xie and Alexandra Killewald (2013) to Jason Long and Joseph Ferrie (2013). We do not dispute Guest and Hout's characterization of the importance of total mobility in addition to relative mobility. We find much in their additional analyses that supports our original findings. In response to Xie and Killewald, we discuss the limitations of our data and the conceptualization of mobility.

Title: Matching with Contracts: Comment
Abstract: The matching with contracts model (Hatfield and Milgrom 2005) is widely considered to be one of the most important advances of the last two decades in matching theory. One of their main messages is that the set of stable allocations is non-empty under a substitutes condition. We show that an additional irrelevance of rejected contracts (IRC) condition is implicitly assumed throughout their analysis, and in the absence of IRC several of their results, including the guaranteed existence of a stable allocation, fail to hold.
