Title: Understanding the Mechanisms through Which an Influential Early Childhood Program Boosted Adult Outcomes
Abstract: A growing literature establishes that high quality early childhood
interventions targeted toward disadvantaged children have
substantial impacts on later life outcomes. Little is known about the
mechanisms producing these impacts. This paper uses longitudinal
data on cognitive and personality skills from an experimental
evaluation of the influential Perry Preschool program to analyze
the channels through which the program boosted both male and
female participant outcomes. Experimentally induced changes in
personality skills explain a sizable portion of adult treatment effects.

Title: The Effect of Education on Adult Mortality and Health: Evidence from Britain
Abstract: There is a strong, positive, and well-documented correlation
between education and health outcomes. In this paper, we attempt to
understand to what extent this relationship is causal. Our approach
exploits two changes to British compulsory schooling laws that
generated sharp across-cohort differences in educational attainment.
Using regression discontinuity methods, we find the reforms did not
affect health although the reforms impacted educational attainment
and wages. Our results suggest caution as to the likely health returns
to educational interventions focused on increasing educational
attainment among those at risk of dropping out of high school, a
target of recent health policy efforts.

Title: The China Syndrome: Local Labor Market Effects of Import Competition in the United States
Abstract: We analyze the effect of rising Chinese import competition between
1990 and 2007 on US local labor markets, exploiting cross-
market
variation in import exposure stemming from initial differences in
industry specialization and instrumenting for US imports using
changes in Chinese imports by other high-income countries. Rising
imports cause higher unemployment, lower labor force participation,
and reduced wages in local labor markets that house import-competing
manufacturing industries. In our main specification,
import competition explains one-quarter of the contemporaneous
aggregate decline in US manufacturing employment. Transfer
benefits payments for unemployment, disability, retirement, and
healthcare also rise sharply in more trade-exposed labor markets.

Title: Trade Liberalization and Embedded Institutional Reform: Evidence from Chinese Exporters
Abstract: If trade barriers are managed by inefficient institutions, trade
liberalization can lead to greater-than-expected gains. We examine
Chinese textile and clothing exports before and after the elimination
of externally imposed export quotas. Both the surge in export
volume and the decline in export prices following quota removal
are driven by net entry. This outcome is inconsistent with a model
in which quotas are allocated based on firm productivity, implying
misallocation of resources. Removing this misallocation accounts
for a substantial share of the overall gain in productivity associated
with quota removal.

Title: Does the Classic Microfinance Model Discourage Entrepreneurship among the Poor? Experimental Evidence from India
Abstract: Do the repayment requirements of the classic microfinance contract
inhibit investment in high-return but illiquid business opportunities
among the poor? Using a field experiment, we compare the classic
contract which requires that repayment begin immediately after
loan disbursement to a contract that includes a two-month grace
period. The provision of a grace period increased short-run business
investment and long-run profits but also default rates. The results,
thus, indicate that debt contracts that require early repayment
discourage illiquid risky investment and thereby limit the potential
impact of microfinance on microenterprise growth and household
poverty.

Title: How the West "Invented" Fertility Restriction
Abstract: We analyze the emergence of the first socioeconomic institution
in history limiting fertility: west of a line from St. Petersburg to
Trieste, the European Marriage Pattern (EMP) reduced childbirths
by approximately one-third between the fourteenth and eighteenth
century. To explain the rise of EMP we build a two-sector model
of agricultural production?grain and livestock. Women have a
comparative advantage in animal husbandry. After the Black Death
in 1348?1350, land abundance triggered a shift toward the pastoral
sector. This improved female employment prospects, leading to later
marriages. Using detailed data from England, we provide strong
evidence for our mechanism.

Title: Identifying Supply and Demand Elasticities of Agricultural Commodities: Implications for the US Ethanol Mandate
Abstract: We present a new framework to identify supply elasticities of storable
commodities where past shocks are used as exogenous price shifters.
In the agricultural context, past yield shocks change inventory
levels and futures prices of agricultural commodities. We use our
estimated elasticities to evaluate the impact of the 2009 Renewable
Fuel Standard on commodity prices, quantities, and food consumers'
surplus for the four basic staples: corn, rice, soybeans, and wheat.
Prices increase 20 percent if one-third of commodities used to
produce ethanol are recycled as feedstock, with a positively skewed
95 percent confidence interval that ranges from 14 to 35 percent.

Title: Urban Accounting and Welfare
Abstract: We use a simple theory of a system of cities to decompose
the determinants of the city size distribution into three main
 components: efficiency, amenities, and frictions. Higher efficiency
and better amenities lead to larger cities but also to greater frictions
through congestion and other negative effects of agglomeration.
Using data on MSAs in the United States, we estimate these city
characteristics. Eliminating variation in any of them leads to large
population reallocations, but modest welfare effects. We apply the
same methodology to Chinese cities and find welfare effects that are
many times larger than those in the US.

Title: Managing Conflicts in Relational Contracts
Abstract: A manager and a worker are in an infinitely repeated relationship
in which the manager privately observes her opportunity costs of
paying the worker. We show that the optimal relational contract generates
periodic conflicts during which effort and expected profits
decline gradually but recover instantaneously. To manage a conflict,
the manager uses a combination of informal promises and formal
commitments that evolves with the duration of the conflict. Finally,
we show that liquidity constraints limit the manager's ability to manage
conflicts but may also induce the worker to respond to a conflict
by providing more effort rather than less.

Title: The Cost of Contract Renegotiation: Evidence from the Local Public Sector
Abstract: Contract theory claims that renegotiation prevents attainment of
the efficient solution that could be obtained under full commitment.
Assessing the cost of renegotiation remains an open issue from an
empirical viewpoint. We fit a structural principal-agent model with
renegotiation on a set of contracts for urban transport services. The
model captures two important features of the industry as only two
types of contracts are used (fixed price and cost-plus) and subsidies
are greater following a cost-plus contract than following a fixed price
one. We conclude that the welfare gains from improving commitment
would be significant but would accrue mostly to operators.

Title: Competition with Exclusive Contracts and Market-Share Discounts
Abstract: We analyze firms that compete by means of exclusive contracts and
market-share discounts (conditional on the seller's share of customers'
total purchases). With incomplete information about demand,
firms have a unilateral incentive to use these contractual arrangements
to better extract buyers' informational rents. However,
exclusive contracts intensify competition, thus reducing prices and
profits and (in all Pareto undominated equilibria) increasing welfare.
Market-share discounts, by contrast, produce a double marginalization
effect that leads to higher prices and harms buyers. We
discuss the implications of these results for competition policy

Title: Spontaneous Discrimination
Abstract: We consider a dynamic economy in which agents are repeatedly
matched and decide whether or not to form profitable partnerships.
Each agent has a physical color and a social color. An agent's social
color acts as a signal, conveying information about the physical
color of agents in his partnership history. Before an agent makes a
decision, he observes his match's physical and social colors. Neither
the physical color nor the social color is payoff relevant. We identify
environments where equilibria arise in which agents condition their
decisions on the physical and social colors of their potential partners.
That is, they discriminate.

Title: Incarceration and Incapacitation: Evidence from the 2006 Italian Collective Pardon
Abstract: In August 2006, the Italian government released one-third of the
nation's prison inmates via a national collective pardon. We test for
a discontinuous break in national crime rates corresponding to the
mass release. We also test for the effect of the return of the incarceration
rate to its predicted steady state level on national crime rates.
Finally, we exploit regional variation in prison releases based on
the province of residence of pardoned inmates. All three sources of
variation yield substantial incapacitation effect estimates and suggest
that the crime-preventing effects of incarceration diminish with
increases in the incarceration rate.

Title: Word-of-Mouth Communication and Percolation in Social Networks
Abstract: This paper develops a model of demand, pricing and advertising in
the presence of social learning via word-of-mouth communication
between friends. In the model consumers must receive information
about a monopolist's product in order to consider purchasing it.
The presence of word-of-mouth is not sufficient for demand to be
more elastic and prices to be lower compared to an informed
population. I derive the comparative static results of connectivity,
mean-preserving spread of friendships, and clustering of friends on
prices. The optimal targets for advertising are not, generically, the
individuals with the most friends.

Title: The Nature of Risk Preferences: Evidence from Insurance Choices
Abstract: We use data on insurance deductible choices to estimate a structural
model of risky choice that incorporates "standard" risk aversion
(diminishing marginal utility for wealth) and probability distortions.
We find that probability distortions?characterized by substantial
overweighting of small probabilities and only mild insensitivity to
probability changes?play an important role in explaining the aversion
to risk manifested in deductible choices. This finding is robust to
allowing for observed and unobserved heterogeneity in preferences.
We demonstrate that neither K?szegi-Rabin loss aversion alone nor
Gul disappointment aversion alone can explain our estimated probability
distortions, signifying a key role for probability weighting.

Title: Consumer Spending and the Economic Stimulus Payments of 2008
Abstract: We measure the change in household spending caused by receipt of the economic stimulus payments of 2008, using questions added to the Consumer Expenditure Survey and variation from the randomized timing of disbursement. Households spent 12-30 percent (depending on specification) of their payments on nondurable goods during the three-month period of payment receipt, and a significant amount more on durable goods, primarily vehicles, bringing the total response to 50-90 percent of the payments. The responses are substantial and significant for older, lower-income, and home-owning households. Spending does not vary significantly with the method of disbursement (check versus electronic transfer).

Title: Trading Away Wide Brands for Cheap Brands
Abstract: Firms face competing needs to expand product variety and reduce production costs. Access to larger markets enables innovation to reduce costs. Although firm scale increases, foreign competition reduces markups. Firms' ability to recapture lost markups depends on the interplay between within-firm competition and across-firm competition. Narrowing product variety eases within-firm competition but lowers market share. I provide a theory detailing the impact of trade policy on product and process innovation. Unbundling innovation provides new insights into welfare gains and innovation policy. Product innovation increases welfare beyond standard gains from trade. The relative returns to innovation policy change with trade liberalization.

Title: Surplus Maximization and Optimality
Abstract: Expected consumer's surplus rarely represents preferences over price lotteries. Still, I give sufficient conditions for policies which maximize aggregate expected surplus to be interim Pareto Optimal. Besides two standard partial equilibrium conditions, I assume that feasible prices satisfy a single-crossing property; and each consumer's indirect utility satisfies increasing differences in the price and income. I use the result to extend well-known welfare conclusions beyond the knife-edge quasilinear utility case. Since increasing differences puts no upper bound on risk aversion, the result is useful for applications in which risk aversion is important.

Title: News Shocks and the Slope of the Term Structure of Interest Rates
Abstract: We adopt a statistical approach to identify the shocks that explain most of the fluctuations of the slope of the term structure of interest rates. We find that one shock can explain the majority of unpredictable movements in the slope. Impulse response functions lead us to interpret this shock as news about future total factor productivity (TFP). By showing that "slope shocks" are essentially "TFP news shocks" we provide a new explanation for the relationship between the slope and macroeconomic fundamentals. Our results also provide a new empirical benchmark for structural models at the intersection of macroeconomics and finance.

Title: Do We Follow Others When We Should? A Simple Test of Rational Expectations: Comment
Abstract: The payoff of actions is estimated and the resulting empirical payoff is controlled for in regression analyses to formulate a test of rational expectations in information cascade experiments. We show that the empirical payoff of actions is a function of estimates of choice probabilities and estimates of the information parameters of the game. We introduce an alternative empirical payoff of actions with true values of the information parameters. Our improved measure of the success of social learning confirms that rational expectations are violated, but deviations from rational expectations are statistically significantly smaller than in Weizsacher (2010).
