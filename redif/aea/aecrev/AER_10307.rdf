Title: Adverse Selection and Inertia in Health Insurance Markets: When Nudging Hurts
Abstract: This paper investigates consumer inertia in health insurance markets,
where adverse selection is a potential concern. We leverage a major
change to insurance provision that occurred at a large firm to
identify substantial inertia, and develop and estimate a choice model
that also quantifies risk preferences and ex ante health risk. We use
these estimates to study the impact of policies that nudge consumers
toward better decisions by reducing inertia. When aggregated,
these improved individual-level choices substantially exacerbate
adverse selection in our setting, leading to an overall reduction in
welfare that doubles the existing welfare loss from adverse selection.

Title: Using Differences in Knowledge across Neighborhoods to Uncover the Impacts of the EITC on Earnings
Abstract: We estimate the impacts of the Earned Income Tax Credit on labor
supply using local variation in knowledge about the EITC schedule.
We proxy for EITC knowledge in a Zip code with the fraction
of individuals who manipulate reported self-employment income to
maximize their EITC refund. This measure varies significantly across
areas. We exploit changes in EITC eligibility at the birth of a child
to estimate labor supply effects. Individuals in high-knowledge areas
change wage earnings sharply to obtain larger EITC refunds relative
to those in low-knowledge areas. These responses come primarily
from intensive-margin earnings increases in the phase-in region.

Title: Intertemporal Price Discrimination in Storable Goods Markets
Abstract: We study intertemporal price discrimination when consumers can
store for future consumption needs. We offer a simple model of demand
dynamics, which we estimate using market-level data. Optimal
pricing involves temporary price reductions that enable sellers to
discriminate between price sensitive consumers, who stockpile for
future consumption, and less price-sensitive consumers, who do not
stockpile. We empirically quantify the impact of intertemporal price
discrimination on profits and welfare. We find that sales (i ) capture
25-30 percent of the gap between non-discriminatory profits and
(unattainable) third-degree price discrimination profits, (ii ) increase
total welfare, and (iii) have a modest impact on consumer welfare.

Title: Two Perspectives on Preferences and Structural Transformation
Abstract: We assess the empirical importance of changes in income and
relative prices for structural transformation in the postwar United
States. We explain two natural approaches to the data: sectors may
be categories of final expenditure or value added; e.g., the service
sector may be the final expenditure on services or the value added
from service industries. We estimate preferences for each approach
and find that with final expenditure income effects are the dominant
force behind structural transformation, whereas with value-added
categories price effects are more important. We show how the inputoutput
structure of the United States can reconcile these findings.

Title: "Reverse Bayesianism": A Choice-Based Theory of Growing Awareness
Abstract: This article introduces a new approach to modeling the expanding
universe of decision makers in the wake of growing awareness, and
invokes the axiomatic approach to model the evolution of decision
makers' beliefs as awareness grows. The expanding universe is
accompanied by extension of the set of acts, the preference relations
over which are linked by a new axiom, invariant risk preferences,
asserting that the ranking of lotteries is independent of the set of acts
under consideration. The main results are representation theorems
and rules for updating beliefs over expanding state spaces and events
that have the flavor of "reverse Bayesianism."

Title: Dynamic Deception
Abstract: We characterize the unique equilibrium of a competitive continuous
time game between a resource-constrained informed player and a
sequence of rivals who partially observe his action intensity. Our
game adds noisy monitoring and impatient players to Aumann
and Maschler (1966), and also subsumes insider trading models.
The intensity bound induces a novel strategic bias and serial mean
reversion by uninformed players. We compute the duration of the
informed player's informational edge. The uninformed player's
value of information is concave if the intensity bound is large
enough. Costly obfuscation by the informed player optimally rises in
the public deception.

Title: Debt Contracts with Partial Commitment
Abstract: This paper analyzes a dynamic lending relationship where the borrower
cannot be forced to make repayments, and the lender offers
long-term contracts that are imperfectly enforced and repeatedly
renegotiated. No commitment and full commitment by the lender
are special cases of this model where the probability of enforcement
equals zero and one, respectively. I show that an increase in
the degree of enforcement can lower social welfare. Furthermore,
properties of equilibrium investment dynamics with partial commitment
drastically differ from those with full and no commitment. In
particular, investment is positively related to cash flow, consistent
with empirical findings.

Title: Information and Quality When Motivation Is Intrinsic: Evidence from Surgeon Report Cards
Abstract: If profit maximization is the objective of a firm, new information
about quality should affect firm behavior only through its effects
on market demand. I consider an alternate model in which suppliers
are motivated by a desire to perform well in addition to profit.
The introduction of quality "report cards" for cardiac surgery in
Pennsylvania provides an empirical setting to isolate the relative role
of extrinsic and intrinsic incentives in determining surgeon response.
Information on performance that was new to surgeons and unrelated
to patient demand led to an intrinsic response four times larger than
surgeon response to profit incentives.

Title: When Do Secondary Markets Harm Firms?
Abstract: To investigate whether secondary markets aid or harm durable goods
manufacturers, we build a dynamic model of durable goods oligopoly
with transaction costs in the secondary market. Calibrating model
parameters using data from the US automobile industry, we find the
net effect of opening the secondary market is to decrease new car
manufacturers' profits by 35 percent. Counterfactual scenarios in
which the size of the used good stock decreases, such as when products
become less durable, when the number of firms decreases, or when
firms can commit to future production levels, increase the profitability
of opening the secondary market.

Title: Time as a Trade Barrier
Abstract: A large and growing share of world trade travels by air. We model
exporters' choice between fast, expensive air cargo and slow, cheap
ocean cargo, which depends on the price elasticity of demand and
the value that consumers attach to fast delivery. We use US imports
data that provide rich variation in the premium paid for air shipping
and in time lags for ocean transit to extract consumers' valuation
of time. We estimate that each day in transit is equivalent to an advalorem
tariff of 0.6 to 2.1 percent. The most time-sensitive trade
flows involve parts and components trade.

Title: Vertical Integration and Exclusivity in Platform and Two-Sided Markets
Abstract: This paper measures the impact of vertically integrated and exclusive
software on industry structure and welfare in the sixth-generation of
the US video game industry (2000-2005). I specify and estimate a
dynamic model of both consumer demand for hardware and software
products, and software demand for hardware platforms. I use estimates
to simulate market outcomes had platforms been unable to own
or contract exclusively with software. Driven by increased software
compatibility, hardware and software sales would have increased
by 7 percent and 58 percent and consumer welfare by $1.5 billion.
Gains would be realized only by the incumbent, suggesting exclusivity
favored the entrant platforms.

Title: Conclusions Regarding Cross-Group Differences in Happiness Depend on Difficulty of Reaching Respondents
Abstract: A growing literature explores differences in subjective well-being
across demographic groups, often relying on surveys with high nonresponse
rates. By using the reported number of call attempts made
to participants in the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers,
we show that comparisons among easy-to-reach respondents differ
from comparisons among hard-to-reach ones. Notably, easy-to-reach
women are happier than easy-to-reach men, but hard-to-reach men
are happier than hard-to-reach women, and conclusions of a survey
could reverse with more attempted calls. Better alternatives to
comparing group sample averages might include putting greater
weight on hard-to-reach respondents or even extrapolating trends in
responses.

Title: The Demand for Youth: Explaining Age Differences in the Volatility of Hours
Abstract: Over the business cycle young workers experience much greater volatility of hours
worked than prime-aged workers. This can arise from age differences in labor supply or
labor demand characteristics. To distinguish between these, we document that, for young
workers, both the cyclical volatilities of hours and wages are greater than those of the
prime-aged. We argue that a general class of models featuring only age-specific labor
supply differences cannot reconcile these facts. We then show that a simple model
featuring labor demand differences can.

Title: News, Noise, and Fluctuations: An Empirical Exploration
Abstract: We explore empirically models of aggregate fluctuations in which consumers form
anticipations about the future based on noisy sources of information and these
anticipations affect output in the short run. Our objective is to separate fluctuations due to
changes in fundamentals (news) from those due to temporary errors in agents' estimates
(noise). We show that structural VARs cannot be used to identify news and noise shocks,
but identification is possible via a method of moments or maximum likelihood. Next, we
estimate our model on US data. Our results suggest that noise shocks explain a sizable
fraction of short-run consumption fluctuations.

Title: Polarization and Ambiguity
Abstract: We offer a theory of polarization as an optimal response to ambiguity. Suppose
individual A's beliefs first-order stochastically dominate individual B's. They observe a
common signal. They exhibit polarization if A's posterior dominates her prior and B's
prior dominates her posterior. Given agreement on conditional signal likelihoods, we
show that polarization is impossible under Bayesian updating or after observing extreme
signals. However, we also show that polarization can arise after intermediate signals as
ambiguity averse individuals implement their optimal prediction strategies. We explore
when this polarization will occur and the logic underlying it.

Title: Social Preferences under Risk: Equality of Opportunity versus Equality of Outcome
Abstract: This paper axiomatizes a utility function for social preferences under risk. In the model, a
single parameter captures a preference for equality of opportunity (i.e., equality of exante
expected payoffs) relative to equality of outcome (i.e., equality of ex-post payoffs).
In a deterministic environment, the model reduces to the model of Fehr and Schmidt
(1999). The model is consistent with recent experiments on probabilistic dictator games.

Title: Taxes, Cigarette Consumption, and Smoking Intensity: Reply
Abstract: This paper shows that smoking intensity, i.e. the amount of nicotine extracted per
cigarette smoked, responds to changes in excise taxes and tobacco prices. We exploit
NHANES data covering the period 1988 to 2006 across many US states. Moreover, using
panel data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA)
study, we provide new evidence on the importance of cotinine measures in explaining

cessation to changes in excise taxes and their interaction with smoking intensity.
