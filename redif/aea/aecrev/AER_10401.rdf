Title: Sales Taxes and Internet Commerce
Abstract: We estimate the sensitivity of Internet retail purchasing to sales taxes
using eBay data. Our first approach exploits the fact that a seller's
location?and therefore the applicable tax rate?is revealed only
after a buyer has expressed interest in an item. We document how
adverse tax "surprises" reduce the likelihood of purchase and shift
subsequent purchases toward out-of-state sellers. We then use more
aggregated data to estimate that every one percentage point increase
in a state's sales tax increases online purchases by state residents by
almost 2 percent, while decreasing their online purchases from state
retailers by 3?4 percent.

Title: Risk Shocks
Abstract: We augment a standard monetary dynamic general equilibrium
model to include a Bernanke-Gertler-Gilchrist financial accelerator
mechanism. We fit the model to US data, allowing the volatility of
cross-sectional idiosyncratic uncertainty to fluctuate over time. We
refer to this measure of volatility as risk. We find that fluctuations in
risk are the most important shock driving the business cycle.

Title: Aligned Delegation
Abstract: A principal delegates multiple decisions to an agent, who has private
information relevant to each decision. The principal is uncertain
about the agent's preferences. I solve for max-min optimal mechanisms?
those which maximize the principal's payoff against the
worst case agent preference types. These mechanisms are characterized
by a property I call "aligned delegation": all agent types play
identically, as if they shared the principal's preferences. Max-min
optimal mechanisms may take the simple forms of ranking mechanisms,
budgets, or sequential quotas.

Title: Immigration and the Diffusion of Technology: The Huguenot Diaspora in Prussia
Abstract: This paper analyzes long-term effects of skilled-worker immigration
on productivity for the Huguenot migration to Prussia. In 1685,
religiously persecuted French Huguenots settled in Brandenburg-
Prussia and compensated for population losses due to plagues during
the Thirty Years' War. We combine Huguenot immigration lists from
1700 with Prussian firm-level data on the value of inputs and outputs
in 1802 in a unique database to analyze the effects of skilled immigration
to places with underused economic potential. Exploiting this
settlement pattern in an instrumental-variable approach, we find substantial
long-term effects of Huguenot settlement on the productivity
of textile manufactories.

Title: Violence and Risk Preference: Experimental Evidence from Afghanistan
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between violence and economic risk
preferences in Afghanistan combining: (i) a two-part experimental
procedure identifying risk preferences, violations of Expected Utility,
and specific preferences for certainty; (ii) controlled recollection of
fear based on established methods from psychology; and (iii) administrative
violence data from precisely geocoded military records. We
document a specific preference for certainty in violation of Expected
Utility. The preference for certainty, which we term a Certainty
Premium, is exacerbated by the combination of violent exposure
and controlled fearful recollections. The results have implications
for risk taking and are potentially actionable for policymakers and
marketers.

Title: Consumption Risk-Sharing in Social Networks
Abstract: We develop a model in which connections between individuals serve
as social collateral to enforce informal insurance payments. We show
 that: (i) The degree of insurance is governed by the expansiveness of
the network, measured with the per capita number of connections
that groups have with the rest of the community. "Two-dimensional"
networks?like real-world networks in Peruvian villages?are sufficiently
expansive to allow very good risk-sharing. (ii) In second-
best
arrangements, insurance is local: agents fully share shocks within,
but imperfectly between endogenously emerging risk-sharing groups.
We also discuss how endogenous social collateral affects our results.

Title: Risk Sharing and Transactions Costs: Evidence from Kenya's Mobile Money Revolution
Abstract: We explore the impact of reduced transaction costs on risk sharing by
estimating the effects of a mobile money innovation on consumption.
In our panel sample, adoption of the innovation increased from 43 to
70 percent. We find that, while shocks reduce consumption by 7 percent
for nonusers, the consumption of user households is unaffected. The
mechanisms underlying these consumption effects are increases in
remittances received and the diversity of senders. We report robustness
checks supporting these results and use the four-fold expansion of the
mobile money agent network as a source of exogenous variation in
access to the innovation.

Title: Estimating a Structural Model of Herd Behavior in Financial Markets
Abstract: We develop a new methodology to estimate herd behavior in financial
markets. We build a model of informational herding that can
be estimated with financial transaction data. In the model, rational
herding arises because of information-event uncertainty. We estimate
the model using data on a NYSE stock (Ashland Inc.) during 1995.
Herding occurs often and is particularly pervasive on some days. On
average, the proportion of herd buyers is 2 percent; that of herd sellers
is 4 percent. Herding also causes important informational inefficiencies
in the market, amounting, on average, to 4 percent of the
asset's expected value.

Title: Worktime Regulations and Spousal Labor Supply
Abstract: We study interdependencies in spousal labor supply by exploiting the
design of the French workweek reduction, which introduced exogenous
variation in one's spouse's labor supply, at constant earnings.
Treated employees work on average two hours less per week.
Husbands of treated women respond by reducing their labor supply
by about half an hour, consistent with substantial leisure complementarity,
and specifically cut the nonusual component of their
workweek, leaving usual hours unchanged. Women's response to
their husband's treatment is instead weak and rarely statistically
significant, possibly due to heavier constraints in the organization of
their workweek.

Title: One Swallow Doesn't Make a Summer: New Evidence on Anchoring Effects
Abstract: Some researchers have argued that anchoring in economic valuations
casts doubt on the assumption of consistent and stable preferences. We
present new evidence that explores the strength of certain anchoring
results. We then present a theoretical framework that provides insights
into why we should be cautious of initial empirical findings in general.
The model importantly highlights that the rate of false positives
depends not only on the observed significance level, but also on statistical
power, research priors, and the number of scholars exploring
the question. Importantly, a few independent replications dramatically
increase the chances that the original finding is true.

Title: Partnerships versus Corporations: Moral Hazard, Sorting, and Ownership Structure
Abstract: Team production takes advantage of technological complementarities
but comes with the cost of free-ridership. When workers differ in
skills, the choice of sorting pattern may be associated with a nontrivial
trade-off between exploiting the technological complementarities
and minimizing the cost of free-ridership. This paper demonstrates
that whether such a trade-off arises depends (i) on how the power
of incentives required for effort provision varies with workers' types,
and (ii) on whether the workers are organized for production in partnerships
or in corporations. These results have implications for how
production is organized in different industries?in partnerships or in
corporations.

Title: Social Ideology and Taxes in a Differentiated Candidates Framework
Abstract: Many observers argue that political polarization, particularly on
social and cultural issues, has increased in the United States. How
does this influence the political competition on economic issues?
We analyze this question using a framework in which two officemotivated
candidates differ in their fixed ideological position and
choose a level of government spending to maximize their vote share.
In equilibrium, candidates cater to a set of swing voters who contain
socially conservative and economically-liberal voters, as well as
socially-liberal and economically-conservative voters. We analyze
how voters' cultural preferences and candidates' cultural positions
influence equilibrium economic positions.

Title: Term Premia and Inflation Uncertainty: Empirical Evidence from an International Panel Dataset: Comment
Abstract: Term premia implied by maximum likelihood estimates of affine
term structure models are misleading because of small-sample
bias. We show that accounting for this bias alters the conclusions
about the trend, cycle, and macroeconomic determinants of the term
premia estimated in Wright (2011). His term premium estimates are
essentially acyclical, and often just parallel the secular trend in longterm
interest rates. In contrast, bias-corrected term premia show
pronounced countercyclical behavior, consistent with theoretical
and empirical arguments about movements in risk premia.

Title: Term Premia and Inflation Uncertainty: Empirical Evidence from an International Panel Dataset: Reply
Abstract: Bauer, Rudebusch, and Wu (2014) advocate the use of bias-corrected
estimates in their comment on Wright (2011). Econometric estimation
of a macro-finance VAR provides quite imprecise estimates of future
short-term interest rates. Nonetheless, comparison with survey
responses indicates that the proposed bias-corrected point estimates
are less plausible than their maximum-likelihood counterparts.
