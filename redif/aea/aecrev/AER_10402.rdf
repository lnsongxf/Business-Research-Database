Title: Collateral Crises
Abstract: Short-term collateralized debt, private money, is efficient if agents
are willing to lend without producing costly information about the
collateral backing the debt. When the economy relies on such informationally insensitive debt, firms with low quality collateral can borrow, generating a credit boom and an increase in output. Financial
fragility is endogenous; it builds up over time as information about
counterparties decays. A crisis occurs when a (possibly small) shock
causes agents to suddenly have incentives to produce information,
leading to a decline in output. A social planner would produce more
information than private agents but would not always want to eliminate
fragility.

Title: A Macroeconomic Model with a Financial Sector
Abstract: This article studies the full equilibrium dynamics of an economy with
financial frictions. Due to highly nonlinear amplification effects, the
economy is prone to instability and occasionally enters volatile crisis
episodes. Endogenous risk, driven by asset illiquidity, persists
in crisis even for very low levels of exogenous risk. This phenomenon,
which we call the volatility paradox, resolves the Kocherlakota
(2000) critique. Endogenous leverage determines the distance to crisis.
Securitization and derivatives contracts that improve risk sharing
may lead to higher leverage and more frequent crises.

Title: Finance and Misallocation: Evidence from Plant-Level Data
Abstract: We use producer-level data to evaluate the role of financial frictions
in determining total factor productivity (TFP). We study a model
of establishment dynamics in which financial frictions reduce TFP
through two channels. First, finance frictions distort entry and
technology adoption decisions. Second, finance frictions generate
dispersion in the returns to capital across existing producers and thus
productivity losses from misallocation. Parameterizations of our model
consistent with the data imply fairly small losses from misallocation,
but potentially sizable losses from inefficiently low levels of entry and
technology adoption.

Title: Tracing Value-Added and Double Counting in Gross Exports
Abstract: This paper proposes an accounting framework that breaks up a country's gross exports into various value-added components by source
and additional double-counted terms. Our parsimonious framework
bridges a gap between official trade statistics (in gross value terms)
and national accounts (in value-added terms), and integrates all previous measures of vertical specialization and value-added trade in the literature into a unified framework. To illustrate the potential of such
a method, we present a number of applications including re-computing
revealed comparative advantages and the magnifying impact of
multi-stage production on trade costs.

Title: Market Size, Competition, and the Product Mix of Exporters
Abstract: We build a theoretical model of multi-product firms that highlights
how competition across market destinations affects both a firm's
exported product range and product mix. We show how tougher
competition in an export market induces a firm to skew its export sales
toward its best performing products. We find very strong confirmation
of this competitive effect for French exporters across export market
destinations. Theoretically, this within-firm change in product mix
driven by the trading environment has important repercussions on
firm productivity. A calibrated fit to our theoretical model reveals
that these productivity effects are potentially quite large.

Title: Do Consumers Respond to Marginal or Average Price? Evidence from Nonlinear Electricity Pricing
Abstract: Nonlinear pricing and taxation complicate economic decisions by
creating multiple marginal prices for the same good. This paper
provides a framework to uncover consumers' perceived price of
nonlinear price schedules. I exploit price variation at spatial
discontinuities in electricity service areas, where households in
the same city experience substantially different nonlinear pricing.
Using household-level panel data from administrative records, I find
strong evidence that consumers respond to average price rather than
marginal or expected marginal price. This suboptimizing behavior
makes nonlinear pricing unsuccessful in achieving its policy goal of
energy conservation and critically changes the welfare implications
of nonlinear pricing.

Title: Time to Build and Fluctuations in Bulk Shipping
Abstract: This paper explores the nature of fluctuations in world bulk shipping
by quantifying the impact of time to build and demand uncertainty on
investment and prices. We examine the impact of both construction
lags and their lengthening in periods of high investment activity, by
constructing a dynamic model of ship entry and exit. A rich dataset
of secondhand ship sales allows for a new estimation strategy: resale
prices provide direct information on value functions and allow their
nonparametric estimation. We find that moving from time-varying
to constant to no time to build reduces prices, while significantly
increasing both the level and volatility of investment.

Title: Time Allocation and Task Juggling
Abstract: A single worker allocates her time among different projects which are
progressively assigned. When the worker works on too many projects at the same time, the output rate decreases and completion time increases according to a law which we derive. We call this phenomenon "task juggling" and argue that it is pervasive in the workplace. We show that task juggling is a strategic substitute of worker effort. We then present a model where task juggling is the result of lobbying by clients, or coworkers, each seeking to get the worker to apply effort to his project ahead of the others'.

Title: How Financial Incentives Induce Disability Insurance Recipients to Return to Work
Abstract: Using a local randomized experiment that arises from a sharp discontinuity in Disability Insurance (DI) policy in Norway, we provide
transparent and credible identification of how financial incentives
induce DI recipients to return to work. We find that many DI recipients
have considerable capacity to work that can be effectively
induced by providing financial work incentives. We further show that
providing work incentives to DI recipients may both increase their
disposable income and reduce program costs. Our findings also suggest
that targeted policies may be the most effective in encouraging
DI recipients to return to work.

Title: Outside Options and the Failure of the Coase Conjecture
Abstract: A buyer wishes to purchase a good from a seller who chooses a
sequence of prices over time. Each period the buyer can also exercise
an outside option, abandoning their search or moving on to
another seller. We show there is a unique equilibrium in which the
seller charges a constant price in every period equal to the monopoly
price, contravening the Coase conjecture. We then embed the singleseller model into a search framework and show the result provides a foundation for the usual "no haggling" assumption.

Title: Raising Retailers' Profits: On Vertical Practices and the Exclusion of Rivals
Abstract: Resale price maintenance (RPM), slotting fees, loyalty rebates, and
other related vertical practices can allow an incumbent manufacturer
to transfer profits to retailers. If these retailers were to accommodate
entry, upstream competition could lead to lower industry
profits and the breakdown of these profit transfers. Thus, in equilibrium,
retailers can internalize the effect of accommodating entry on
the incumbent's profits. Consequently, if entry requires downstream
accommodation, entry can be deterred. We discuss policy implications
of this aspect of vertical contracting practices.

Title: Are Private Markets and Filtering a Viable Source of Low-Income Housing? Estimates from a "Repeat Income" Model
Abstract: While filtering has long been considered the primary mechanism by
which markets supply low-income housing, direct estimates of that
process have been absent. This has contributed to doubts about the
viability of markets and to misplaced policy. I fill this gap by estimating
a "repeat income" model using 1985-2011 panel data. Real annual filtering rates are faster for rental housing (2.5 percent) than
owner-occupied (0.5 percent), vary inversely with the income elasticity
of demand and house price inflation, and are sensitive to tenure
transitions as homes age. For most locations, filtering is robust which
lends support for housing voucher programs.

Title: Income and Democracy: Comment
Abstract: Acemoglu et al. (2008) document that the correlation between
income per capita and democracy disappears when including time
and country fixed effects. While their results are robust for the full
sample, we find evidence for significant but heterogeneous effects of
income on democracy: negative for former colonies, but positive for
non-colonies. Within the sample of colonies we detect heterogeneous
effects related to colonial history and early institutions. The zero
mean effect estimated by Acemoglu et al. (2008) is consistent with
effects of opposite signs in the different subsamples. Our findings are
robust to the use of alternative data and estimation techniques.
