Title: Monetary Policy and Rational Asset Price Bubbles
Abstract: I examine the impact of alternative monetary policy rules on a rational asset price bubble, through the lens of an overlapping generations model with nominal rigidities. A systematic increase in interest rates in response to a growing bubble is shown to enhance the fluctuations in the latter, through its positive effect on bubble growth. The optimal monetary policy seeks to strike a balance between stabilization of the bubble and stabilization of aggregate demand. The paper's main findings call into question the theoretical foundations of the case for "leaning against the wind" monetary policies.

Title: Fiscal Stimulus in a Monetary Union: Evidence from US Regions
Abstract: We use rich historical data on military procurement to estimate the effects of government spending. We exploit regional variation in military build-ups to estimate an "open economy relative multiplier" of approximately 1.5. We develop a framework for interpreting this estimate and relating it to estimates of the standard closed economy aggregate multiplier. The latter is highly sensitive to how strongly aggregate monetary and tax policy "leans against the wind." Our open economy relative multiplier "differences out" these effects because monetary and tax policies are uniform across the nation. Our evidence indicates that demand shocks can have large effects on output.

Title: Trade Adjustment and Productivity in Large Crises
Abstract: We empirically characterize the mechanics of trade adjustment during the Argentine crisis. Though imports collapsed by 70 percent from 2000-2002, the entry and exit of firms or products at the country level played a small role. The within-firm churning
of imported inputs, however, played a sizeable role. We build a model of trade in intermediate inputs with heterogeneous firms, fixed import costs, and roundabout production. Import demand is non-homothetic and the implications of an import price shock
depend on the full distribution of firm-level adjustments. An import price shock generates a significant decline in productivity.

Title: Do Prices and Attributes Explain International Differences in Food Purchases?
Abstract: Food purchases differ substantially across countries. We use detailed household level data from the US, France and the UK to (i) document these differences; (ii) estimate a demand system for food and nutrients, 
and (iii) simulate counterfactual choices if households faced prices and nutritional characteristics from other countries. We find that differences in prices and characteristics are important and can explain some difference 
(e.g., US-France difference in caloric intake), but generally cannot explain many of the compositional patterns by themselves. Instead, it seems an interaction between the economic environment and differences in 
preferences is needed to explain cross country differences.

Title: The Economics of Predation: What Drives Pricing When There Is Learning-by-Doing?
Abstract: We formally characterize predatory pricing in a modern industry-dynamics framework that endogenizes competitive advantage and industry structure. As an illustrative example we focus on learning-by-doing. 
To disentangle predatory pricing from mere competition for efficiency on a learning curve we decompose the equilibrium pricing condition.  We show that forcing firms to ignore the predatory incentives in setting 
their prices can have a large impact and that this impact stems from eliminating equilibria with predation-like behavior. Along with the predation-like behavior, however, a fair amount of competition for the market is eliminated.

Title: Strategic Interaction and Networks
Abstract: Geography and social links shape economic interactions. In industries, schools, and markets, the entire network determines outcomes. This paper analyzes a large class of games and obtains a striking result. 
Equilibria depend on a single network measure: the lowest eigenvalue. This paper is the first to uncover the importance of the lowest eigenvalue to economic and social outcomes. It captures how much the network 
amplifies agents' actions. The paper combines new tools?potential games, optimization, and spectral graph theory?to solve for all Nash and stable equilibria and applies the results to R&D, crime, and the econometrics of peer effects.

Title: How University Endowments Respond to Financial Market Shocks: Evidence and Implications
Abstract: Endowment payouts have become an increasingly important component of universities' revenues in recent decades. We study how universities respond to financial shocks to endowments and thus shed light on a number of existing models 
of endowment behavior. Endowments actively reduce payouts relative to their stated payout policies following negative, but not positive, shocks. This asymmetric behavior is consistent with "endowment hoarding," especially among endowments 
whose current value is close to the benchmark value at the start of the university president's tenure. We also document the effect of negative endowment shocks on university operations, such as personnel cuts.

Title: When the Levee Breaks: Black Migration and Economic Development in the American South
Abstract: In the American South, post-bellum economic development may have been restricted in part by white landowners' access to low-wage black labor. This paper examines the impact of the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 on black out-migration and subsequent 
agricultural development. Flooded counties experienced an immediate and persistent out-migration of black population. Over time, landowners in flooded counties modernized agricultural production and increased its capital intensity relative to landowners in 
nearby similar non-flooded counties. Landowners resisted black out-migration, however, benefiting from the status quo system of labor-intensive agricultural production.

Title: School Choice, School Quality, and Postsecondary Attainment
Abstract: We study the impact of a public school choice lottery in Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools on college enrollment and degree completion. We find a significant overall increase in college attainment among lottery winners who attend their first choice school. 
Using rich administrative data on peers, teachers, course offerings and other inputs, we show that the impacts of choice are strongly predicted by gains on several measures of school quality. Gains in attainment are concentrated among girls. Girls respond 
to attending a better school with higher grades and increases in college-preparatory course-taking, while boys do not.

Title: Do Employers Use Unemployment as a Sorting Criterion When Hiring? Evidence from a Field Experiment
Abstract: The stigma associated with long-term unemployment spells could create large inefficiencies in labor markets. While the existing literature points toward large stigma effects, it has proven difficult to estimate causal relationships. Using data from a field experiment,
we find that long-term unemployment spells in the past do not matter for employers' hiring decisions, suggesting that subsequent work experience eliminate this negative signal. Nor do employers treat contemporary short-term unemployment spells differently,
suggesting that they understand that worker/firm matching takes time. However, employers attach a negative value to contemporary unemployment spells lasting at least nine months, providing evidence of stigma effects.

Title: Risk and Precautionary Saving in Two-Person Households
Abstract: The existing literature on precautionary saving is based almost entirely on the assumption that the household acts as if it consisted of a single individual decision-taker. In reality saving decisions are typically taken by two-person households. 
This paper examines the implications of this observation for the existence of precautionary saving, and shows that the assumption that the individual utility functions satisfy the conditions for precautionary saving to exist can imply that the household exhibits
precautionary saving, but only under strong assumptions on the type of risk change being considered.

Title: Does Money Illusion Matter? Comment
Abstract: This paper experimentally investigates whether money illusion generates substantial nominal inertia. Building on the design of Fehr and Tyran (2001), we find no evidence that agents choose high nominal payoffs over high real payoffs. However, participants
do select prices associated with high nominal payoffs within a set of maximum real payoffs as a heuristic to simplify their decision task. The cognitive challenge of this task explains the majority of the magnitude of nominal inertia; money illusion exerts only a
second-order effect. The duration of nominal inertia depends primarily on participants' best response functions, not the prevalence of money illusion.

Title: Does Money Illusion Matter? Reply
Abstract: The data in Fehr and Tyran (FT, 2001) and Luba Petersen and Abel Winn (PW,2013) show that money illusion plays an important role in nominal price adjustment after a fully anticipated negative monetary shock. Money Illusion affects subjects'
expectations, and causes pronounced nominal inertia after a negative shock but much less inertia after a positive shock. Thus PW provide a misleading interpretation both of our and their own data.

Title: The Dynamic Behavior of the Real Exchange Rate in Sticky Price Models: Comment
Abstract: In an article published in the American Economic Review, J?n Steinsson (2008) argues that two sticky price models driven by real shocks can explain the observed persistence, volatility and hump-shaped impulse response function of the
real exchange rate. This comment shows, first, that correcting an error in one of Steinsson's models leads to substantially lower persistence and volatility of the real exchange rate; second, that Steinsson's models cannot match real exchange rate
volatility relative to output; and, third, that reasonable variations of the model calibration or specification all lead to lower real exchange rate persistence and volatility (or both).
