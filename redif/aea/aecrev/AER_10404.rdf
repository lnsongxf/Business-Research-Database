Title: A Grand Gender Convergence: Its Last Chapter
Abstract: The converging roles of men and women are among the grandest
advances in society and the economy in the last century. These
aspects of the grand gender convergence are figurative chapters in
a history of gender roles. But what must the "last" chapter contain
for there to be equality in the labor market? The answer may come
as a surprise. The solution does not (necessarily) have to involve
government intervention and it need not make men more responsible
in the home (although that wouldn't hurt). But it must involve
changes in the labor market, especially how jobs are structured and
remunerated to enhance temporal flexibility. The gender gap in pay
would be considerably reduced and might vanish altogether if firms
did not have an incentive to disproportionately reward individuals
who labored long hours and worked particular hours. Such change
has taken off in various sectors, such as technology, science, and
health, but is less apparent in the corporate, financial, and legal
worlds.

Title: Vertical Integration and Input Flows
Abstract: We use broad-based yet detailed data from the economy's goods-producing sectors to investigate firms' ownership of production
chains. It does not appear that vertical ownership is primarily used
to facilitate transfers of goods along the production chain, as is often
 presumed: roughly one-half of upstream establishments report no
shipments to downstream establishments within the same firm. We
propose an alternative explanation for vertical ownership, namely
that it promotes efficient intrafirm transfers of intangible inputs. We
show evidence consistent with this hypothesis, including the fact
that, after a change of ownership, an acquired establishment begins
to resemble the acquiring firm along multiple dimensions.

Title: Misallocation and Growth
Abstract: This paper models growth via on-the-job learning when firms and
workers are heterogeneous. It is an overlapping generations model
in which young agents match with the old. More efficient assignments
lead to faster long-run growth, more inequality, and less turnover
in the distribution of human capital. Constant-growth paths are
characterized for general functional forms and then, for the Cobb-Douglas case, the transition dynamics are solved analytically when the skill of the young is log-normally distributed and the initial
human capital of the old generation is also log-normal. Growth and
inequality move together on the transition to the balanced growth path.

Title: Search, Liquidity, and the Dynamics of House Prices and Construction
Abstract: The dynamics of house prices, sales, construction, and population
growth in response to city-specific income shocks are characterized
for 106 US cities. A dynamic model of search in the housing market
in which construction, the entry of buyers, house prices, and sales
are determined in equilibrium is then developed. The theory generates
dynamics qualitatively consistent with the observations and a
version calibrated to match key features of the US housing market
offers a substantial quantitative improvement over models without
search. In particular, variation in the time it takes to sell induces
transaction prices to exhibit serially correlated growth.

Title: Spatial Development
Abstract: We present a theory of spatial development. Manufacturing and
services firms located in a continuous geographic area choose each
period how much to innovate. Firms trade subject to transport costs
and technology diffuses spatially. We apply the model to study the
evolution of the US economy in the last half-century and find that it
can generate the reduction in the manufacturing employment share,
the increased spatial concentration of services, the growth in service
productivity starting in the mid-1990s, the rise in the dispersion of
land rents in the same period, as well as several other spatial and
temporal patterns.

Title: The Role of Local Officials in New Democracies: Evidence from Indonesia
Abstract: This paper shows that the body of appointed officials that a new
democracy inherits from the previous regime is a key determinant
of the extent of electoral fraud and clientelistic spending in new
democracies. I develop a model that predicts that appointed officials
have stronger incentives to influence voters during national level
elections because of their career concerns. I test the implications
of the model using data from Indonesia's transition to democracy.
Both the pattern of alignment of electoral results between village
and district levels and the pattern of subsequent turnover of
appointed village heads corroborate the predictions of the model.

Title: Bidding for Incomplete Contracts: An Empirical Analysis of Adaptation Costs
Abstract: Procurement contracts are often renegotiated because of changes
that are required after their execution. Using highway paving contracts
we show that renegotiation imposes significant adaptation
costs. Reduced form regressions suggest that bidders respond strategically to contractual incompleteness and that adaptation costs are an important determinant of their bids. A structural empirical model
compares adaptation costs to bidder markups and shows that adaptation costs account for 7.5-14 percent of the winning bid. Markups
from private information and market power, the focus of much of the
auctions literature, are much smaller by comparison. Implications
for government procurement are discussed.

Title: Do Physicians' Financial Incentives Affect Medical Treatment and Patient Health?
Abstract: We investigate whether physicians' financial incentives influence
health care supply, technology diffusion, and resulting patient outcomes.  In 1997, Medicare consolidated the geographic regions
across which it adjusts physician payments, generating area-specific
price shocks. Areas with higher payment shocks experience significant
increases in health care supply. On average, a 2 percent increase
in payment rates leads to a 3 percent increase in care provision.
Elective procedures such as cataract surgery respond much more
strongly than less discretionary services. Non-radiologists expand
their provision of MRIs, suggesting effects on technology adoption.
We estimate economically small health impacts, albeit with limited
precision.

Title: Cycles of Conflict: An Economic Model
Abstract: We propose a model of cycles of conflict and distrust. Overlapping
generations of agents from two groups sequentially play coordination
games under incomplete information about whether the other side
consists of bad types who always take bad actions. Good actions may
be misperceived as bad and information about past actions is limited.
Conflict spirals start as a result of misperceptions but also contain the
seeds of their own dissolution: Bayesian agents eventually conclude
that the spiral likely started by mistake, and is thus uninformative of
the opposing group's type. The agents then experiment with a good
action, restarting the cycle.

Title: Frictionless Technology Diffusion: The Case of Tractors
Abstract: Many new technologies display long adoption lags, and this is often
interpreted as evidence of frictions inconsistent with the standard
neoclassical model. We study the diffusion of the tractor in American
agriculture between 1910 and 1960-a well-known case of slow
diffusion-and show that the speed of adoption was consistent with
the predictions of a simple neoclassical growth model. The reason for
the slow rate of diffusion was that tractor quality kept improving over
this period and, more importantly, that only when wages increased
did it become relatively unprofitable to operate the alternative, labor-intensive, horse technology.

Title: Investment Dispersion and the Business Cycle
Abstract: The cross-sectional dispersion of firm-level investment rates is
procyclical. This makes investment rates different from productivity,
output, and employment growth, which have countercyclical
dispersions. A calibrated heterogeneous-firm business cycle model
with nonconvex capital adjustment costs and countercyclical
dispersion of firm-level productivity shocks replicates these facts and
produces a correlation between investment dispersion and aggregate
output of 0.53, close to 0.45 in the data. We find that small shocks to
the dispersion of productivity, which in the model constitutes firm
risk, suffice to generate the mildly procyclical investment dispersion
in the data but do not produce serious business cycles.

Title: Knowledge Is (Less) Power: Experimental Evidence from Residential Energy Use
Abstract: Imperfect information about product attributes inhibits efficiency in
many choice settings, but can be overcome by providing simple, lowcost information. We use a randomized control trial to test the effect
of high-frequency information about residential electricity usage on
the price elasticity of demand. Informed households are three standard
deviations more responsive to temporary price increases, an
effect that is not attributable to price salience. Conservation extends
beyond pricing events in the short and medium run, providing evidence
of habit formation and implying that the intervention leads to
greenhouse gas abatement. Survey evidence suggests that information
facilitates learning.

Abstract: Beaudry and Portier (2006) propose an identification scheme to
study the effects of news shocks about future productivity in vector
error correction models (VECMs). This comment shows that, when
applied to their VECMs with more than two variables, the identification
scheme does not have a unique solution. The problem arises
from a particular interplay of cointegration assumptions and longrun
restrictions.

Title: Heterogeneity and Aggregation: Implications for Labor-Market Fluctuations: Comment
Abstract: Chang and Kim (2007) develop an incomplete asset markets
model incorporating discrete labor supply and idiosyncratic labor
productivity. Their results resolve long-standing puzzles for business
cycle models. Specifically, they produce a low correlation between
aggregate hours worked and labor productivity (0.23) and a labor
wedge with 76 percent the volatility of output. I show that these
results arise from errors in their computational method. I resolve
their model using a corrected method and find a strong, positive
correlation between hours and productivity (0.80). Fluctuations in
the labor wedge decrease to 24 percent of those in output.

Title: Heterogeneity and Aggregation: Implications for Labor-Market Fluctuations: Reply
Abstract: Takahashi (2014) has uncovered coding errors in our paper,
Chang and Kim (2007)-henceforth, CK. We acknowledge and are
embarrassed by these mistakes. We are grateful to Takahashi for
uncovering them. While the correction decreases the volatility of the
labor market wedge, we find that the main message of CK remains
 valid: the measured labor market wedge arises endogenously in
an economy with incomplete capital markets and indivisible labor
supply. For example, our model accounts for 18 percent of the
volatility in the labor market wedge in the data; it was 43 percent in
CK.
