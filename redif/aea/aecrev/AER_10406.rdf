Title: Who Is (More) Rational?
Abstract: Revealed preference theory offers a criterion for decision-making quality: if decisions are high quality then there exists a utility function the choices maximize. We conduct a large-scale experiment to test for consistency with utility maximization. Consistency scores vary markedly within and across socioeconomic groups. In particular, consistency is strongly related to wealth: a standard deviation increase in consistency is associated with 15-19 percent more household wealth. This association is quantitatively robust to conditioning on correlates of unobserved constraints, preferences, and beliefs. Consistency with utility maximization
under laboratory conditions thus captures decision-making ability
that applies across domains and influences important real-world outcomes.

Title: Tenure, Experience, Human Capital, and Wages: A Tractable Equilibrium Search Model of Wage Dynamics
Abstract: We develop and estimate an equilibrium job search model of worker careers, allowing for human capital accumulation, employer heterogeneity and individual-level shocks. Wage growth is decomposed into contributions of human capital and job search,
within and between jobs. Human capital accumulation is largest
for highly educated workers. The contribution from job search to
wage growth, both within- and between-job, declines over the first
ten years of a career &ndash; the &lsquo;job-shopping&rsquo; phase of a working life &ndash; after which workers settle into high-quality jobs using outside offers to generate gradual wage increases, thus reaping the benefits from competition between employers.

Title: The Wage Effects of Offshoring: Evidence from Danish Matched Worker-Firm Data
Abstract: We employ data that match the population of Danish workers to the universe of
private-sector Danish firms, with product-level trade flows by origin- and destination-countries.
We document new stylized facts about offshoring and instrument for offshoring and exporting.
Within job spells, offshoring increases (decreases) the high-skilled (low-skilled) wage; exporting
increases the wages of all skill-types; the net wage-effect of trade varies substantially within the
same skill-type; conditional on skill, the wage-effect of offshoring varies across task
characteristics. We estimate the overall effects of offshoring on workers' present and future
income streams by constructing pre-offshoring-shock worker-cohorts and tracking them over
time.

Title: US Food Aid and Civil Conflict
Abstract: We study the effect of U.S. food aid on conflict in recipient countries. Our analysis exploits
time variation in food aid shipments due to changes in U.S. wheat production and cross-sectional
variation in a country's tendency to receive any U.S. food aid. According to our estimates, an
increase in U.S. food aid increases the incidence and duration of civil conflicts, but has no robust
effect on inter-state conflicts or the onset of civil conflicts. We also provide suggestive evidence
that the effects are most pronounced in countries with a recent history of civil conflict.

Title: The Size Distribution of Farms and International Productivity Differences
Abstract: We study the determinants of differences in farm-size across countries and their impact on agricultural and aggregate productivity using a quantitative sectoral model featuring a distribution of farms. Measured aggregate factors (capital, land, economy-wide productivity) account for ? of the observed differences in farm size and productivity. Policies and institutions that misallocate resources across farms have the potential to account for the remaining differences. Exploiting within-country variation in crop-specific price distortions and their correlation with farm size, we construct a cross-country measure of farm-size distortions which together with aggregate factors accounts for ? of the cross-country differences in size and productivity.

Title: The Effect of Uncertainty on Investment: Evidence from Texas Oil Drilling
Abstract: This paper estimates the response of investment to changes in uncertainty using data on oil drilling in Texas and the expected volatility of the future price of oil. Using a dynamic model of firms' investment problem, I find that: (1) the response of drilling activity to changes in price volatility has a magnitude consistent with the optimal response prescribed by theory, (2) the cost of failing to respond to volatility shocks is economically significant, and (3) implied volatility data derived from futures options prices yields a better fit to firms' investment behavior than backward-looking volatility measures such as GARCH.

Title: Gift Exchange versus Monetary Exchange: Theory and Evidence
Abstract: We study the Lagos and Wright (2005) model of monetary exchange in the laboratory.
With a finite population of sufficiently patient agents, this model has a unique
monetary equilibrium and a continuum of non-monetary gift exchange equilibria, some
of which Pareto dominate the monetary equilibrium. We find that subjects avoid the
gift-exchange equilibria in favor of the monetary equilibrium. We also study versions of
the model without money where all equilibria involve non-monetary gift-exchange. We
find that welfare is higher in the model with money than without money, suggesting
that money plays a role as an efficiency enhancing coordination device.

Title: Compulsory Education and the Benefits of Schooling
Abstract: Causal estimates of the benefits of increased schooling using U.S.
state schooling laws as instruments typically rely on specifications
which assume common trends across states in the factors affecting
different birth cohorts. Differential changes across states during
this period, such as relative school quality improvements, suggest
that this assumption may fail to hold. Across a number of outcomes including wages, unemployment, and divorce, we find that
statistically significant causal estimates become insignificant and,
in many instances, wrong-signed when allowing year of birth effects
to vary across regions.

Title: Evolutionary Origins of the Endowment Effect: Evidence from Hunter-Gatherers
Abstract: The endowment effect, the tendency to value possessions more
than non-possessions, is a well known departure from rational
choice and has been replicated in numerous settings. We investigate the universality of the endowment effect, its evolutionary significance, and its dependence on environmental factors. We experimentally test for the endowment effect in an isolated and evolutionarily relevant population of hunter-gatherers, the Hadza Bushmen of Northern Tanzania. We find that Hadza living in isolated regions do not display the endowment effect, while Hadza living in a geographic region with increased exposure to modern society and markets do display the endowment effect.

Title: Does Growing Up in a High Crime Neighborhood Affect Youth Criminal Behavior?
Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of early exposure to neighborhood crime on
subsequent criminal behavior of youth exploiting a unique natural experiment between 1986 and
1998 when refugee immigrants to Denmark were assigned to neighborhoods quasi-randomly. We
find strong evidence that the share of young people convicted for crimes, in particular violent
crimes, in the neighborhood increases convictions of male assignees later in life. No such effects
are found for other measures of neighborhood crime including the rate of committed crimes. Our
findings suggest social interaction as a key channel through which neighborhood crime is linked
to individual criminal behavior.

Title: Aid under Fire: Development Projects and Civil Conflict
Abstract: We estimate the causal effect of a large development program on conflict in the
Philippines through a regression discontinuity design that exploits an arbitrary poverty
threshold used to assign eligibility for the program. We find that barely eligible municipalities experienced a large increase in conflict casualties compared to barely ineligible
ones. This increase is mostly due to insurgent-initiated incidents in the early stages of
program preparation. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that insurgents
try to sabotage the program because its success would weaken their support in the
population.

Title: Language, Meaning, and Games: A Model of Communication, Coordination, and Evolution: Comment
Abstract: Demichelis & Weibull (AER 2008) show that adding lexicographic lying costs to
coordination games with cheap talk yields a sharp prediction: only the efficient
outcome is evolutionarily stable. I show that this result is caused by the discontinuity
of preferences rather than by small lying costs per se. Finally, I discuss
why discontinuity may not be an appealing assumption in evolutionary models.
