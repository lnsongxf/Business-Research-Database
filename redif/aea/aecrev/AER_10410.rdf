Title: Mandatory versus Discretionary Spending: The Status Quo Effect
Abstract: Do mandatory spending programs such as Medicare improve efficiency? We analyze a model with two parties allocating a fixed budget to a public good and private transfers each period over an infinite horizon. We compare two institutions that differ in whether public good spending is discretionary or mandatory. We model mandatory spending as an endogenous status quo since it is enacted by law and remains in effect until changed. Mandatory programs result in higher public good spending; furthermore, they ex ante Pareto dominate discretionary programs when parties are patient, persistence of power is low, and polarization is low.

Title: Behavioral Implementation
Abstract: Implementation theory assumes that participants' choices are rational,
in the sense of being consistent with the maximization of a context-
independent preference. The paper investigates implementation
under complete information when individuals'  choices need not be
rational.

Title: The Short-Run and Long-Run Effects of Behavioral Interventions: Experimental Evidence from Energy Conservation
Abstract: We document three remarkable features of the Opower program, in
which social comparison-based home energy reports are repeatedly
mailed to more than six million households nationwide. First, initial
reports cause high-frequency "action and backsliding,"  but these
cycles attenuate over time. Second, if reports are discontinued after
two years, effects are relatively persistent, decaying at 10-20 percent
per year. Third, consumers are slow to habituate: they continue to
respond to repeated treatment even after two years. We show that the
previous conservative assumptions about post-intervention persistence had dramatically understated cost effectiveness and illustrate how empirical estimates can optimize program design.

Title: Environmental Regulations, Air and Water Pollution, and Infant Mortality in India
Abstract: Using the most comprehensive developing country dataset ever
compiled on air and water pollution and environmental regulations,
the paper assesses India's environmental regulations with a
difference-in-differences design. The air pollution regulations are
associated with substantial improvements in air quality. The most
successful air regulation resulted in a modest but statistically
insignificant decline in infant mortality. In contrast, the water
regulations had no measurable benefits. The available evidence leads
us to cautiously conclude that higher demand for air quality prompted
the effective enforcement of air pollution regulations, indicating that
strong public support allows environmental regulations to succeed in
weak institutional settings.

Title: Competition and Ideological Diversity: Historical Evidence from US Newspapers
Abstract: We study the competitive forces which shaped ideological diversity in
the US press in the early twentieth century. We find that households
preferred like-minded news and that newspapers used their political
orientation to differentiate from competitors. We formulate a model
of newspaper demand, entry,  and political affiliation choice in which
newspapers compete for both readers and advertisers. We use a combination of estimation and calibration to identify the model's parameters from novel data on newspaper circulation, costs, and revenues. The estimated model implies that competition enhances ideological diversity, that the market undersupplies diversity, and that optimal competition policy requires accounting for the two-sidedness of the news market.

Title: Financial Networks and Contagion
Abstract: We study cascades of failures in a network of interdependent financial
 organizations: how discontinuous changes in asset values
(e.g., defaults and shutdowns) trigger further failures, and how this
depends on network structure. Integration (greater dependence on
counterparties) and diversification (more counterparties per organization) have different, nonmonotonic effects on the extent of cascades. Diversification connects the network initially, permitting
cascades to travel; but as it increases further, organizations are
better insured against one another's failures. Integration also faces
 trade-offs: increased dependence on other organizations versus less
sensitivity to own investments. Finally, we illustrate the model with
data on European debt cross-holdings.

Title: Measuring the Effect of the Zero Lower Bound on Medium- and Longer-Term Interest Rates
Abstract: According to standard macroeconomic models, the zero lower bound
greatly reduces the effectiveness of monetary policy and increases the
efficacy of fiscal policy. However, private-sector decisions depend
on the entire path of expected future short-term interest rates, not
just the current short-term rate. Put differently, longer-term yields
matter. We show how to measure the zero bound's effects on yields
of any maturity. Indeed, 1- and 2-year Treasury yields were surprisingly unconstrained throughout 2008 to 2010, suggesting that monetary and fiscal policy were about as effective as usual during this
period. Only beginning in late 2011 did these yields become more
constrained.

Title: Productivity Losses from Financial Frictions: Can Self-Financing Undo Capital Misallocation?
Abstract: I develop a highly tractable general equilibrium model in which
heterogeneous producers face collateral constraints, and study the
effect of financial frictions on capital misallocation and aggregate
productivity. My economy is isomorphic to a Solow model but with
time-varying TFP. I argue that the persistence of idiosyncratic productivity shocks determines both the size of steady-state productivity losses and the speed of transitions: if shocks are persistent, steady-state losses are small but transitions are slow. Even if financial frictions are unimportant in the long run, they tend to matter in the short run and analyzing steady states only can be misleading.

Title: German Jewish ?migr?s and US Invention
Abstract: Historical accounts suggest that Jewish ?migr?s from Nazi Germany
revolutionized US science. To analyze the ?migr?s' effects on chemical
innovation in the United States, we compare changes in patenting
by US inventors in research fields of ?migr?s with fields of other
German chemists. Patenting by US inventors increased by 31 percent
in ?migr? fields. Regressions which instrument for ?migr? fields with
pre-1933 fields of dismissed German chemists confirm a substantial
increase in US invention. Inventor-level data indicate that ?migr?s
encouraged innovation by attracting new researchers to their fields,
rather than by increasing the productivity of incumbent inventors.

Title: Efficiency, Equality, and Labeling: An Experimental Investigation of Focal Points in Explicit Bargaining
Abstract: We investigate Schelling's hypothesis that payoff-irrelevant labels
("cues") can influence the outcomes of bargaining games with
communication. In our experimental games, players negotiate over
the division of a surplus by claiming valuable objects that have
payoff-irrelevant spatial locations. Negotiation occurs in continuous
time, constrained by a deadline. In some games, spatial cues are
opposed to principles of equality or efficiency. We find a strong tendency for players to agree on efficient and minimally unequal payoff divisions, even if spatial cues suggest otherwise. But if there are two such divisions, cues are often used to select between them, inducing distributional effects.

Title: Private Equity Premium Puzzle Revisited
Abstract: This paper revisits the results of Moskowitz and Vissing-J?gensen
(2002) on returns to entrepreneurial investments in the United States.
Following the authors' methodology and new data from the Survey of
Consumer Finances, I find that the "private equity premium puzzle"
does not survive the period of high public equity returns in the 1990s.
The difference between private and public equity returns is positive
and large period-by-period between 1999 and 2007. Whereas in
the 2008-2010 period, overlapping with the Great Recession,
public and private equities performances are substantially closer.
I validate these results in the aggregate data going back to the 1960s.

Title: How Does Risk Selection Respond to Risk Adjustment? New Evidence from the Medicare Advantage Program
Abstract: To combat adverse selection, governments increasingly base payments to health plans and providers on enrollees' scores from
risk-adjustment formulae. In 2004, Medicare began to risk-adjust
capitation payments to private Medicare Advantage (MA) plans to
reduce selection-driven overpayments. But because the variance
of medical costs increases with the predicted mean, incentivizing
enrollment of individuals with higher scores can increase the scope
for enrolling "overpriced" individuals with costs significantly below
the formula's prediction. Indeed, after risk adjustment, MA plans
enrolled individuals with higher scores but lower costs conditional
on their score. We find no evidence that overpayments were on net
reduced.

Title: The Effect of Mergers in Search Markets: Evidence from the Canadian Mortgage Industry
Abstract: We examine the relationship between concentration and price dispersion using variation induced by a merger in the Canadian mortgage market. Since interest rates are determined through a search and negotiation process, consolidation weakens consumers' bargaining positions. We use reduced-form techniques to estimate the mergers' distributional impact, and show that competition benefits only consumers at the bottom and middle of the transaction price distribution, and that mergers reduce the dispersion of prices. We illustrate that these effects can be explained by the presence of search frictions, and that the average effect of mergers on rates underestimates the increase in market power.
