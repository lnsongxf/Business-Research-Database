Title: A Test of Racial Bias in Capital Sentencing
Abstract: We collect a new dataset on capital punishment in the US and we propose a test of racial bias based upon patterns of sentence reversals. We model the courts as minimizing type I and II errors.
If trial courts were unbiased, conditional on defendants race the error rate should be independent of the victims race. Instead we uncover 3 and 9 percentage points higher reversal rates in Direct Appeal and Habeas Corpus cases, respectively, against minority defendants who killed whites. The pattern for white defendants is opposite but not statistically significant. This bias is confined to Southern States.

Title: On the Selection of Arbitrators
Abstract: A key feature of arbitration is the possibility for con
icting parties to participate in the selection of the arbitrator, the individual who will rule the case. We analyze this problem of the selection of arbitrators from the perspective of implementation theory. In particular, theoretical analyses document problems with veto-rank,
a simultaneous procedure that is commonly used in practice, and
develop a new sequential procedure, shortlisting, with better properties. Experimental results are consistent with the theoretical predictions, highlighting both the disadvantages associated with the
veto-rank procedure and the advantages associated with the short-lising procedure.

Title: Asset Demand Based Tests of Expected Utility Maximization
Abstract: We provide conditions under which contingent claim and asset demands are consistent with state independent Expected Utility maximization. The paper focuses on the case of a single commodity and demands are allowed to be functions of probabilities and not just prices and income. We extend prior analyses by deriving three distinct tests for demands to be rationalized by Expected Utility: (i) a contingent claim analogue to the certainty strong axiom of revealed preference, (ii) a characterization of the functional form for demand and (iii) necessary and sufficient conditions based on the Slutsky matrix.

Title: A Biological Theory of Social Discounting
Abstract: We consider a growth model in which intergenerational transfers
are made via stocks of private and public capital. Private capital is
the outcome of individuals' private savings while decisions regarding public capital are made collectively. We hypothesize that private saving choices evolve through individual selection while public
saving decisions are the result of group selection. The main result
of the paper is that the equilibrium rate of return to private capital is at least 2-3% more than the rate of return to public capital.
In other words, social choices involving intertemporal trade-offs
exhibit much more patience than individual choices do.

Title: Can Marginal Rates of Substitution Be Inferred from Happiness Data? Evidence from Residency Choices
Abstract: We survey 561 students from U.S. medical schools shortly after they submit choice rankings over residencies to the National Resident Matching Program. We elicit (a) these choice rankings, (b) anticipated subjective well-being (SWB) rankings, and (c) expected features of the residencies (such as prestige). We find substantial differences between choice and anticipated-SWB rankings in the implied tradeoffs between residency features. In our data, evaluative SWB measures (life satisfaction and Cantril's ladder) imply tradeoffs closer to choice than does affective happiness (even time-integrated), and as close as do multi-measure SWB indices. We discuss implications for using SWB data in applied work.

Title: Mismatch Unemployment
Abstract: We develop a framework where mismatch between vacancies and job seekers across sectors translates into higher unemployment by lowering the aggregate job-finding rate. We use this framework to measure the contribution of mismatch to the recent rise in U.S. unemployment by exploiting two sources of cross-sectional data on vacancies, JOLTS and HWOL. Our calculations indicate that mismatch, across industries and 3-digit occupations, explains at most 1/3 of the total observed increase in the unemployment rate. Occupational mismatch has become especially more severe for college graduates, and in the West of the United States. Geographical mismatch unemployment plays no apparent role.

Title: Inefficient Hiring in Entry-Level Labor Markets
Abstract: Hiring inexperienced workers generates information about their abilities. If this information is public, workers obtain its benefits. If workers cannot compensate firms for hiring them, firms will hire too few inexperienced workers. I determine the effects of hiring workers and revealing more information about their abilities through a field experiment in an online marketplace. I hired 952 randomly-selected workers, giving them either detailed or coarse public evaluations. Both hiring workers and providing more detailed evaluations substantially improved workers' subsequent employment outcomes. Under plausible assumptions, the experiment's market-level benefits exceeded its cost, suggesting that some experimental workers had been inefficiently unemployed.

Title: The Network Structure of International Trade
Abstract: Motivated by empirical evidence I uncover on the dynamics of
French firms exports, I offer a novel theory of trade frictions.
Firms only export into markets where they have a contact. They
directly search for new trading partners, but also use their existing network of contacts to remotely search for new partners. I
characterize the dynamic formation of an international network
of exporters in this model. I structurally estimate this model on
French data and confirm its predictions regarding the distribution
of the number of foreign markets accessed by exporters and the
geographic distribution of exports.

Title: Structural Transformation, the Mismeasurement of Productivity Growth, and the Cost Disease of Services
Abstract: If workers self-select into industries based upon their relative
productivity in different tasks, and comparative advantage is aligned
with absolute advantage, then the average efficacy of a sector's
workforce will be negatively correlated with its employment share.
This might explain the difference in the reported productivity growth
of contracting goods and expanding services. Instrumenting with
defense expenditures, I find the elasticity of worker efficacy with
respect to employment shares is substantially negative, albeit
imprecisely estimated. The estimates suggest that the view that
goods and services have similar productivity growth rates is a
plausible alternative characterization of growth in developed
economies.

Title: A Quantitative Analysis of the Used-Car Market
Abstract: We quantitatively investigate the allocative and welfare effects of
secondary markets for cars. An important source of gains from
trade in these markets is the heterogeneity in the willingness to
pay for higher-quality (newer) goods, but transaction costs are an
impediment to instantaneous trade. Calibration of the model successfully matches several aggregate features of the U.S. and French used-car markets. Counterfactual analyses show that transaction costs have a large effect on volume of trade, allocations, and the primary market. Aggregate effects on consumer surplus and welfare are relatively small, but the effect on lower-valuation households can be large.

Title: Fertility Transitions along the Extensive and Intensive Margins
Abstract: By allowing for an extensive margin in the standard quantity-quality model, we generate new insights into fertility transitions. We test the model on Southern black women aected by a large-scale school construction program. Consistent with our model, women facing improved schooling opportunities for their children were more likely to have at least one child but chose to have smaller families overall. By contrast, women who themselves obtained more schooling due to the program delayed childbearing along both the extensive and intensive margins and entered higher quality occupations, consistent with education raising opportunity costs of child rearing.

Title: Claim Validation
Abstract: Hume (1748) challenged the idea that a general claim (e.g. "all
swans are white") can be validated by empirical evidence, no matter how compelling. We examine this issue from the perspective of a tester who must accept or reject the forecasts of a potential expert. If experts can be skeptical about the validity of claims then they can strategically evade rejection. In contrast, if experts are required to conclude that claims backed by sucient evidence are likely to be true, then they can be tested and rejected. These results provide an economic rationale for claim validation based on incentive problems.

Title: The Power of Communication
Abstract: In this paper, I offer two ways in which firms can collude: secret monitoring and infrequent coordination. Such collusion is enforceable with intuitive communication protocols. I make my case in the context of a repeated Cournotoligopoly with flexible production, prices that follow a Brownian motion and no monetary side payments, an environment where it has previously been argued that any collusion is impossible. Trade associations can easily facilitate collusion by mediating communication amongst firms.

Title: The Human Capital Stock: A Generalized Approach
Abstract: This paper reconsiders the traditional approach to human capital measurement in the study of cross-country income differences. Within a broader class of neoclassical human capital aggregators, traditional accounting is found to be a theoretical lower bound on human capital difference across economies. Implementing a generalized accounting empirically illustrates the possibility that capital variation may now account (even fully) for the large income variation between rich and poor countries. These findings reject the constraints on human capital variation that traditional accounting has imposed.
