Title: Optimal Allocation with Costly Verification
Abstract: A principal allocates an object to one of I agents. Each agent values
receiving the object and has private information regarding the value
to the principal of giving it to him. There are no monetary transfers,
but the principal can check an agent's information at a cost.
A favored-agent mechanism specifies a value v* and an agent i*. If
all agents other than i* report values below v*, then i* receives the
good and no one is checked. Otherwise, whoever reports the highest
value is checked and receives the good if and only if her report is
confirmed. All optimal mechanisms are essentially randomizations
over optimal favored-agent mechanisms. (JEL D82)

Title: Ambiguity Aversion with Three or More Outcomes
Abstract: Ambiguous choice problems which involve three or more outcome
values can reveal aspects of ambiguity and ambiguity aversion
which cannot be displayed in the classic two-outcome Ellsberg urn
problems, and hence are not always captured by models designed
to accommodate them. These aspects include Allais-type preferences
over purely subjective acts, attitudes toward different sources involving different amounts of ambiguity, and attitudes toward ambiguity at different outcome levels. This paper presents a few such examples, and examines the standard models' predictions and performance in such cases. (JEL D81)

Title: Hospital Choices, Hospital Prices, and Financial Incentives to Physicians
Abstract: We estimate an insurer-specific preference function which rationalizes
hospital referrals for privately insured births in California. The function
is additively separable in: a hospital price paid by the insurer,
the distance traveled, and plan- and severity-specific hospital fixed
effects (capturing hospital quality). We use an inequality estimator
that allows for errors in price and detailed hospital-severity interactions and obtain markedly different results than those from a logit. The estimates indicate that insurers with more capitated physicians are more responsive to price. Capitated plans send patients further to utilize similar quality, lower-priced hospitals; but the cost-quality trade-off does not vary with capitation rates. (JEL G22, H51, I11, I13, I18, J44)

Title: Is It Whom You Know or What You Know? An Empirical Assessment of the Lobbying Process
Abstract: Do lobbyists provide issue-specific information to members of
Congress? Or do they provide special interests access to politicians?
We present evidence to assess the role of issue expertise versus connections in the US Federal lobbying process and illustrate how both
are at work. In support of the connections view, we show that lobbyists
follow politicians they were initially connected to when those
politicians switch to new committee assignments. In support of the
expertise view, we show that there is a group of experts that even
politicians of opposite political affiliation listen to. However, we find
a more consistent monetary premium for connections than expertise.

Title: The Effects of Poor Neonatal Health on Children's Cognitive Development
Abstract: We make use of a new data resource -- merged birth and school
records for all children born in Florida from 1992 to 2002 -- to study
the relationship between birth weight and cognitive development.
Using singletons as well as twin and sibling fixed effects models,
we find that the effects of early health on cognitive development are
essentially constant through the school career; that these effects are
similar across a wide range of family backgrounds; and that they
are invariant to measures of school quality. We conclude that the
effects of early health on adult outcomes are therefore set very early.

Title: Private Equity, Jobs, and Productivity
Abstract: Private equity critics claim that leveraged buyouts bring huge job
losses and few gains in operating performance. To evaluate these
claims, we construct and analyze a new dataset that covers US
buyouts from 1980 to 2005. We track 3,200 target firms and their
150,000 establishments before and after acquisition, comparing to
controls defined by industry, size, age, and prior growth. Buyouts
lead to modest net job losses but large increases in gross job creation
and destruction. Buyouts also bring TFP gains at target firms,
mainly through accelerated exit of less productive establishments
and greater entry of highly productive ones. (JEL D24, G24, G32,

Title: Hot and Cold Seasons in the Housing Market
Abstract: Every year housing markets in the United Kingdom and the United
States experience systematic above-trend increases in prices and
transactions during the spring and summer ("hot season") and
below-trend falls during the autumn and winter ("cold season").
House price seasonality poses a challenge to existing housing models.
We propose a search-and-matching model with thick-market effects.
In thick markets, the quality of matches increases, rising buyers' willingness to pay and sellers' desire to transact. A small, deterministic
driver of seasonality can be amplified and revealed as deterministic
seasonality in transactions and prices, quantitatively mimicking seasonal fluctuations in UK and US markets. (JEL C78, R21, R31)

Title: Reputation and Persistence of Adverse Selection in Secondary Loan Markets
Abstract: The volume of new issuances in secondary loan markets fluctuates
over time and falls when collateral values fall. We develop a model
with adverse selection and reputation that is consistent with such
fluctuations. Adverse selection ensures that the volume of trade falls
when collateral values fall. Without reputation, the equilibrium has
separation, adverse selection is quickly resolved, and trade volume is
independent of collateral value. With reputation, the equilibrium has
pooling and adverse selection persists over time. The equilibrium
is efficient unless collateral values are low and originators' reputational
levels are low. We describe policies that can implement efficient
outcomes. (JEL D82, G11, G21, G28)

Title: The Dynamic Efficiency Costs of Common-Pool Resource Exploitation
Abstract: We conduct the first empirical investigation of common-pool
resource users' dynamic and strategic behavior at the micro level
using real-world data. Fishermen's strategies in a fully dynamic
game account for latent resource dynamics and other players'
actions, revealing the profit structure of the fishery. We compare the
fishermen's actual and socially optimal exploitation paths under
a time-specific vessel allocation policy and find a sizable dynamic
externality. Individual fishermen respond to other users by exerting
effort above the optimal level early in the season. Congestion
is costly instantaneously but is beneficial in the long run because it
partially offsets dynamic inefficiencies. (JEL D24, Q21, Q22)

Title: Trade Wars and Trade Talks with Data
Abstract: How large are optimal tariffs? What tariffs would prevail in a worldwide
trade war? How costly would a breakdown of international
trade policy cooperation be? And what is the scope for future multilateral trade negotiations? I address these and other questions
using a unified framework which nests traditional, new trade, and
political economy motives for protection. I find that optimal tariffs
average 62 percent, world trade war tariffs average 63 percent, the
government welfare losses from a breakdown of international trade
policy cooperation average 2.9 percent, and the possible government
welfare gains from future multilateral trade negotiations average
0.5 percent. (JEL F12, F13, O19)

Title: Consume Now or Later? Time Inconsistency, Collective Choice, and Revealed Preference
Abstract: We develop a revealed preference methodology that allows us to
explore whether time inconsistencies in household choice are the
product of individual preference nonstationarities or the result of
individual heterogeneity and renegotiation within the household.
An empirical application to household-level microdata highlights
that an explicit recognition of the collective nature of household
choice enables the observed behavior to be rationalized by a theory
that assumes preference stationarity at the individual level. The
methodology created in this paper also facilitates the recovery of
theory-consistent discount rates for each individual within particular
household under study. (JEL E24, F13, F16)

Title: Present Bias and Collective Dynamic Choice in the Lab
Abstract: We study collective decisions by time-discounting individuals choosing
a common consumption stream. We show that with any heterogeneity
in time preferences, utilitarian aggregation necessitates a
present bias. In lab experiments three quarters of "social planners"
exhibited present biases, and less than two percent were time consistent. Roughly a third of subjects acted as if they were pure utilitarians, and the rest chose as if they also had varying degrees of
distributional concerns. (JEL C91, D12, D71, D72)

Title: Consumption and Debt Response to Unanticipated Income Shocks: Evidence from a Natural Experiment in Singapore
Abstract: This paper uses a unique panel dataset of consumer financial transactions to study how consumers respond to an exogenous unanticipated income shock. Consumption rose significantly after the fiscal policy announcement: during the ten subsequent months, for each $1 received, consumers on average spent $0.80. We find a strong
announcement effect -- 19 percent of the response occurs during the
first two-month announcement period via credit cards. Subsequently,
consumers switched to debit cards after disbursement before finally
increasing spending on credit cards in the later months. Consumers
with low liquid assets or with low credit card limit experienced stronger
consumption responses. (JEL D12, D14, E21)

Title: Risk Matters: The Real Effects of Volatility Shocks: Comment
Abstract: We show that the risk-shock business cycle model of
Fernández-Villaverde et al. (2011) must be recalibrated because
it underpredicts the targeted business cycle moments by a factor
of three once a time aggregation error is corrected. Recalibrating
the corrected model for the benchmark case of Argentina, the peak
response and the contribution of interest rate risk shocks to business
cycle volatility increase. However, the recalibrated model does
worse in capturing the business cycle properties of net exports once
an additional error in the computation of net exports is corrected.
