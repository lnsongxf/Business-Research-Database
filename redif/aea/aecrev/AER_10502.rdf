Title: The Impact of the Great Migration on Mortality of African Americans: Evidence from the Deep South
Abstract: The Great Migration–the massive migration of African Americans
out of the rural South to largely urban locations in the North,
Midwest, and West–was a landmark event in US history. Our paper
shows that this migration increased mortality of African Americans
born in the early twentieth century South. This inference comes from
an analysis that uses proximity of birthplace to railroad lines as an
instrument for migration. (JEL I12, J15, N31, N32, N91, N92, R23)

Title: Overconfidence in Political Behavior
Abstract: This paper studies, theoretically and empirically, the role of overconfidence in political behavior. Our model of overconfidence in
beliefs predicts that overconfidence leads to ideological extremeness,
increased voter turnout, and stronger partisan identification.
The model also makes nuanced predictions about the patterns of ideology in society. These predictions are tested using unique data that
measure the overconfidence and standard political characteristics of
a nationwide sample of over 3,000 adults. Our numerous predictions
find strong support in these data. In particular, we document that
overconfidence is a substantively and statistically important predictor
of ideological extremeness, voter turnout, and partisan identification.

Title: Robustness and Linear Contracts
Abstract: We consider a moral hazard problem where the principal is uncertain
as to what the agent can and cannot do: she knows some actions
available to the agent, but other, unknown actions may also exist.
The principal demands robustness, evaluating possible contracts by
their worst-case performance, over unknown actions the agent might
potentially take. The model assumes risk-neutrality and limited liability, and no other functional form assumptions. Very generally, the
optimal contract is linear. The model thus offers a new explanation
for linear contracts in practice. It also introduces a flexible modeling
approach for moral hazard under nonquantifiable uncertainty.

Title: Systemic Risk and Stability in Financial Networks
Abstract: This paper argues that the extent of financial contagion exhibits a
form of phase transition: as long as the magnitude of negative shocks
affecting financial institutions are sufficiently small, a more densely
connected financial network (corresponding to a more diversified
pattern of interbank liabilities) enhances financial stability.
However, beyond a certain point, dense interconnections serve as a
mechanism for the propagation of shocks, leading to a more fragile
financial system. Our results thus highlight that the same factors
that contribute to resilience under certain conditions may function
as significant sources of systemic risk under others. (JEL D85, E44,

Title: Price Subsidies, Diagnostic Tests, and Targeting of Malaria Treatment: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial
Abstract: Both under- and over-treatment of communicable diseases are public
bads. But efforts to decrease one run the risk of increasing the
other. Using rich experimental data on household treatment-
seeking behavior in Kenya, we study the implications of this trade-off for subsidizing life-saving antimalarials sold over-the-counter at retail drug outlets. We show that a very high subsidy (such as the one under consideration by the international community) dramatically increases access, but nearly one-half of subsidized pills go to patients without malaria. We study two ways to better target subsidized drugs:
reducing the subsidy level, and introducing rapid malaria tests
over-the-counter. (JEL D12, D82, I12, O12, O15)

Title: Self-Confirming Equilibrium and Model Uncertainty
Abstract: We analyze a notion of self-confirming equilibrium with non-neutral
ambiguity attitudes that generalizes the traditional concept. We show
that the set of equilibria expands as ambiguity aversion increases. The
intuition is quite simple: by playing the same strategy in a stationary
environment, an agent learns the implied distribution of payoffs,
but alternative strategies yield payoffs with unknown distributions;
increased aversion to ambiguity makes such strategies less appealing.
In sum, a kind of "status quo bias" emerges; in the long run, the
uncertainty related to tested strategies disappears, but the uncertainty
implied by the untested ones does not. (JEL C72, C73, D81, D83)

Title: Environmental Health Risks and Housing Values: Evidence from 1,600 Toxic Plant Openings and Closings
Abstract: Regulatory oversight of toxic emissions from industrial plants and
understanding about these emissions' impacts are in their infancy.
Applying a research design based on the openings and closings of
1,600 industrial plants to rich data on housing markets and infant
health, we find that: toxic air emissions affect air quality only within
1 mile of the plant; plant openings lead to 11 percent declines in
housing values within 0.5 mile or a loss of about $4.25 million
for these households; and a plant's operation is associated with
a roughly 3 percent increase in the probability of low birthweight
within 1 mile. (JEL I12, L60, Q52, Q53, Q58, R23, R31)

Title: Bankruptcy as Implicit Health Insurance
Abstract: This paper examines the implicit health insurance that households
receive from the ability to declare bankruptcy. Exploiting multiple
sources of variation in asset exemption law, I show that uninsured
households with a greater financial cost of bankruptcy make higher
out-of-pocket medical payments, conditional on the amount of
care received. In turn, I find that households with greater wealth at
risk are more likely to hold health insurance. The implicit insurance
from bankruptcy distorts the insurance coverage decision. Using a
microsimulation model, I calculate that the optimal Pigovian penalties
are three-quarters as large as the average penalties under the Affordable Care Act. (JEL D14, H51, I13, K35)

Title: Leader Punishment and Cooperation in Groups: Experimental Field Evidence from Commons Management in Ethiopia
Abstract: We conduct a social dilemma experiment in which real-world leaders
can punish group members as a third party. Despite facing an
identical environment, leaders are found to take remarkably different
punishment approaches. The different leader types revealed experimentally explain the relative success of groups in managing their
forest commons. Leaders who emphasize equality and efficiency see
positive forest outcomes. Antisocial leaders, who punish indiscriminately, see relatively negative forest outcomes. Our results highlight the importance of leaders in collective action, and more generally the idiosyncratic but powerful roles that leaders may play, leading to substantial variation in group cooperation outcomes.

Title: The Price of Experience
Abstract: We identify a key role of factor supply, driven by demographic changes, in shaping several empirical regularities that are a focus of active research in macro and labor economics. In particular, demographic changes alone can account for the large movements of the return to experience over the last four decades, for the differential dynamics of the age premium across education groups emphasized by Katz and Murphy (1992), for the differential dynamics of the college premium across age groups emphasized by Card and Lemieux (2001), and for the changes in cross-sectional and cohort-based life-cycle profiles emphasized by Kambourov and Manovskii (2005).

Title: Optimal Life Cycle Unemployment Insurance
Abstract: We argue that US welfare would rise if unemployment insurance
were increased for younger and decreased for older workers. This
is because the young tend to lack the means to smooth consumption
during unemployment and want jobs to accumulate high-return human capital. So unemployment insurance is most valuable to
them, while moral hazard is mild. By calibrating a life cycle model
with unemployment risk and endogenous search effort, we find that
allowing unemployment replacement rates to decline with age yields
sizeable welfare gains to US workers. (JEL D91, E24, J13, J64, J65)

Title: Evidence for Countercyclical Risk Aversion: An Experiment with Financial Professionals
Abstract: Countercyclical risk aversion can explain major puzzles such as the
high volatility of asset prices. Evidence for its existence is, however,
scarce because of the host of factors that simultaneously change
during financial cycles. We circumvent these problems by priming
financial professionals with either a boom or a bust scenario.
Subjects primed with a financial bust were substantially more fearful
and risk averse than those primed with a boom, suggesting that fear
may play an important role in countercyclical risk aversion. The
mechanism described here is relevant for theory and may explain
self-reinforcing processes that amplify market dynamics. (JEL E32,

Title: Information Disclosure as a Matching Mechanism: Theory and Evidence from a Field Experiment
Abstract: Market outcomes depend on the quality of information available to
its participants. We measure the effect of information disclosure on
market outcomes using a large-scale field experiment that randomly
discloses quality information in wholesale automobile auctions. We
argue that buyers in this market are horizontally differentiated across
cars that are vertically ranked by quality. This implies that information
disclosure helps match heterogeneous buyers to cars of varying quality, causing both good and bad news to increase competition and revenues. The data confirm these hypotheses. These findings have implications for the design of other markets, including e-commerce, procurement auctions, and labor markets. (JEL C93, D44, D82, L15)

Title: Thar SHE Blows? Gender, Competition, and Bubbles in Experimental Asset Markets
Abstract: Do women and men behave differently in financial asset markets?
Our results from an asset market experiment show a marked gender
difference in producing speculative price bubbles. Mixed markets
show intermediate values, and a meta-analysis of 35 markets from
different studies confirms the inverse relationship between the magnitude of price bubbles and the frequency of female traders in the
market. Women's price forecasts also are significantly lower, even in
the first period. Implications for financial markets and experimental
methodology are discussed. (JEL D14, D81, G01, G11, J16)
