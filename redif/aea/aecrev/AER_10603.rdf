Title: The Determinants and Welfare Implications of US Workers' Diverging Location Choices by Skill: 1980-2000
Abstract: From 1980 to 2000, the rise in the US college/high school graduate
wage gap coincided with increased geographic sorting as college
graduates concentrated in high wage, high rent cities. This paper
estimates a structural spatial equilibrium model to determine causes
and welfare consequences of this increased skill sorting. While local
labor demand changes fundamentally caused the increased skill
sorting, it was further fueled by endogenous increases in amenities
within higher skill cities. Changes in cities' wages, rents, and
endogenous amenities increased inequality between high school
and college graduates by more than suggested by the increase in the
college wage gap alone. (JEL D31, I26, J24, J31, J61, R23)

Title: University Differences in the Graduation of Minorities in STEM Fields: Evidence from California
Abstract: We examine differences in minority science graduation rates among
University of California campuses when racial preferences were
in place. Less prepared minorities at higher ranked campuses had
lower persistence rates in science and took longer to graduate. We
estimate a model of students' college major choice where net returns
of a science major differ across campuses and student preparation.
We find less prepared minority students at top ranked campuses
would have higher science graduation rates had they attended lower
ranked campuses. Better matching of science students to universities
by preparation and providing information about students' prospects
in different major-university combinations could increase minority
science graduation. (JEL D14, E23, E32, E43, E52, E61, E62)

Title: Search Design and Broad Matching
Abstract: We study decentralized mechanisms for allocating firms into search
pools. The pools are created in response to noisy preference signals
provided by consumers, who then browse the pools via costly
random sequential search. Surplus-maximizing search pools are
implementable in symmetric Nash equilibrium. Full extraction of the
maximal surplus is implementable if and only if the distribution of
consumer types satisfies a set of simple inequalities, which involve
the relative fractions of consumers who like different products and
the Bhattacharyya coefficient of similarity between their conditional
signal distributions. The optimal mechanism can be simulated by a
keyword auction with broad matching. (JEL C78, D44, D82)

Title: How Do Electricity Shortages Affect Industry? Evidence from India
Abstract: We estimate the effects of electricity shortages on Indian
manufacturers, instrumenting with supply shifts from hydroelectric
power availability. We estimate that India's average reported level of
shortages reduces the average plant's revenues and producer surplus
by 5 to 10 percent, but average productivity losses are significantly
smaller because most inputs can be stored during outages. Shortages
distort the plant size distribution, as there are significant economies
of scale in generator costs and shortages more severely affect plants
without generators. Simulations show that offering interruptible
retail electricity contracts could substantially reduce the impacts of
shortages. (JEL D24, L60, L94, O13, O14, Q41)

Title: Firm Dynamics, Job Turnover, and Wage Distributions in an Open Economy
Abstract: This paper explores the combined effects of reductions in trade frictions, tariffs, and firing costs on firm dynamics, job turnover, and
wage distributions. It uses establishment-level data from Colombia
to estimate an open economy dynamic model that links trade to job
flows and wages. Counterfactual experiments imply that Colombia's
integration with global product markets increased its national income
at the expense of higher unemployment, greater wage inequality, and
increased firm-level volatility. In contrast, contemporaneous labor
market reforms dampened the increase in unemployment and aggregate job turnover. The results speak more generally to the effects of globalization on labor markets. (JEL F13, F16, F66, J31, J63, O15,

Title: Parameter Learning in General Equilibrium: The Asset Pricing Implications
Abstract: Parameter learning strongly amplifies the impact of macroeconomic
shocks on marginal utility when the representative agent has a preference for early resolution of uncertainty. This occurs as rational
belief updating generates subjective long-run consumption risks.
We consider general equilibrium models with unknown parameters
governing either long-run economic growth, rare events, or model
selection. Overall, parameter learning generates long-lasting,
quantitatively significant additional macroeconomic risks that help
explain standard asset pricing puzzles. (JEL C52, D83, E13, E32,

Title: Liquidity Trap and Excessive Leverage
Abstract: We investigate the role of macroprudential policies in mitigating
liquidity traps. When constrained households engage in deleveraging,
the interest rate needs to fall to induce unconstrained households to
pick up the decline in aggregate demand. If the fall in the interest rate
is limited by the zero lower bound, aggregate demand is insufficient
and the economy enters a liquidity trap. In this environment,
households' ex ante leverage and insurance decisions are associated
with aggregate demand externalities. Welfare can be improved with
macroprudential policies targeted toward reducing leverage. Interest
rate policy is inferior to macroprudential policies in dealing with
excessive leverage. (JEL D14, E23, E32, E43, E52, E61, E62)

Title: The Effect of Unemployment Benefits and Nonemployment Durations on Wages
Abstract: We estimate that unemployment insurance (UI ) extensions reduce
reemployment wages using sharp age discontinuities in UI eligibility
in Germany. We show this effect combines two key policy parameters:
the effect of UI on reservation wages and the effect of nonemployment
durations on wage offers. Our framework implies if UI extensions do
not affect wages conditional on duration, then reservation wages do
not bind. We derive resulting instrumental variable estimates for the
effect of nonemployment durations on wage offers and bounds for
reservation wage effects. The effect of UI on wages we find arises
mainly from substantial negative nonemployment duration effects.

Title: The Value of Postsecondary Credentials in the Labor Market: An Experimental Study
Abstract: We study employers' perceptions of the value of postsecondary
degrees using a field experiment. We randomly assign the sector
and selectivity of institutions to fictitious resumes and apply to real
vacancy postings for business and health jobs on a large online job
board. We find that a business bachelor's degree from a for-profit
online institution is 22 percent less likely to receive a callback than
one from a nonselective public institution. In applications to health
jobs, we find that for-profit credentials receive fewer callbacks unless
the job requires an external quality indicator such as an occupational
license. (JEL I23, I26, J24, J44, J63, M51)

Title: Taxpayer Confusion: Evidence from the Child Tax Credit
Abstract: We develop an empirical test for whether households understand
or misperceive their marginal tax rate. Our identifying variation
comes from the loss of the Child Tax Credit when a child turns 17.
Using this age discontinuity, we find that despite this tax liability
increase being lump-sum and predictable, households reduce their
reported wage income upon discovering they have lost the credit.
This finding suggests that households misinterpret at least part of
this tax liability change as an increase in their marginal tax rate.
This evidence supports the hypothesis that tax complexity can cause
confusion and leads to unintended behavioral responses. (JEL D12,

Title: Dictating the Risk: Experimental Evidence on Giving in Risky Environments: Comment
Abstract: Based on experimental dictator games with probabilistic prospects,
Brock, Lange, and Ozbay (2013) conclude that neither ex post nor ex
ante comparisons can fully account for observed behavior. We argue
that their conclusion that ex ante comparisons cannot explain the
data is at best weakly supported by their results, and do so on three grounds: 
(i ) the absence of significant differences between the most
relevant treatments, (ii ) the implicit assumption of subjects' risk neutrality, and (iii ) the asymmetry of treatments regarding the disclosure of dictators' choice. (JEL C72, D63, D64, D81)

Title: A Balls-and-Bins Model of Trade: Comment
Abstract: We show that the Armenter and Koren model's firm-product-country
results rely on the assumption that export shipment size is independent of firm size, and this assumption is contradicted by the data.
When actual shipment sizes are used in the balls-and-bins model, it
cannot reproduce the data on single product/single country exporters.
Beyond just showing that the shipment size assumption matters
to balls-and-bins outcomes, our results highlight the important fact
that shipment size is an economic decision, co-determined with other
export choices. For this reason, we argue that a balls-and-bins model
cannot be a purely statistical benchmark model. (JEL F11, F14, O13,

Title: A Balls-and-Bins Model of Trade: Reply
Abstract: Blum, Claro, and Horstmann (2016) make two statements about the
balls-and-bins model of Armenter and Koren (2014). First, that using
firm-level shipment data changes some of our results. Second, that
the balls-and-bins model is not an appropriate statistical method.
We respond to the first statement and argue that the second statement
is unfounded and unrelated to the first. Indeed, the work of
Blum, Claro, and Horstmann (2016) is a perfect example of how to
use balls-and-bins in a rich dataset to spot interesting data patterns.
