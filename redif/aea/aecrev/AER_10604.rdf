Title: The Effects of Exposure to Better Neighborhoods on Children: New Evidence from the Moving to Opportunity Experiment
Abstract: The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment offered randomly
selected families housing vouchers to move from high-poverty
housing projects to lower-poverty neighborhoods. We analyze MTO's
impacts on children's long-term outcomes using tax data. We find that
moving to a lower-poverty neighborhood when young (before age
13) increases college attendance and earnings and reduces single
parenthood rates. Moving as an adolescent has slightly negative
impacts, perhaps because of disruption effects. The decline in the
gains from moving with the age when children move suggests that the
duration of exposure to better environments during childhood is an
important determinant of childrenâ€™s long-term outcomes. (JEL I31,

Title: Long-Run Impacts of Childhood Access to the Safety Net
Abstract: We examine the impact of a positive and policy-driven change in
economic resources available in utero and during childhood. We
focus on the introduction of the Food Stamp Program, which was
rolled out across counties between 1961 and 1975. We use the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics to assemble unique data linking family
background and county of residence in early childhood to adult
health and economic outcomes. Our findings indicate access to food
stamps in childhood leads to a significant reduction in the incidence
of metabolic syndrome and, for women, an increase in economic self-sufficiency. (JEL I12, I38, J24)

Title: The Long-Run Impact of Cash Transfers to Poor Families
Abstract: We estimate the long-run impact of cash transfers to poor families
on children's longevity, educational attainment, nutritional status,
and income in adulthood. To do so, we collected individual-
level administrative records of applicants to the Mothers' Pension
program -- the first government-sponsored welfare program in the
United States (1911-1935) -- and matched them to census, WWII,
and death records. Male children of accepted applicants lived one
year longer than those of rejected mothers. They also obtained one-third more years of schooling, were less likely to be underweight, and had higher income in adulthood than children of rejected mothers.

Title: Bounding the Labor Supply Responses to a Randomized Welfare Experiment: A Revealed Preference Approach
Abstract: We study the short-term impact of Connecticut's Jobs First welfare
reform experiment on women's labor supply and welfare participation
decisions. A nonparametric optimizing model is shown to restrict
the set of counterfactual choices compatible with each woman's
actual choice. These revealed preference restrictions yield informative
bounds on the frequency of several intensive and extensive margin
responses to the experiment. We find that welfare reform induced
many women to work but led some others to reduce their earnings in
order to receive assistance. The bounds on this latter "opt-in" effect
imply that intensive margin labor supply responses are nontrivial.

Title: Presidents and the US Economy: An Econometric Exploration
Abstract: The US economy has performed better when the president of the
United States is a Democrat rather than a Republican, almost regardless of how one measures performance. For many measures, including real GDP growth (our focus), the performance gap is large and significant. This paper asks why. The answer is not found in technical time series matters nor in systematically more expansionary monetary or fiscal policy under Democrats. Rather, it appears that the
Democratic edge stems mainly from more benign oil shocks, superior
total factor productivity (TFP) performance, a more favorable
international environment, and perhaps more optimistic consumer
expectations about the near-term future. (JEL D72, E23, E32, E65,

Title: The Evolution of Strategic Sophistication
Abstract: This paper investigates the evolutionary foundation for our ability to
attribute preferences to others, an ability that is central to conventional game theory. We argue here that learning others' preferences allows individuals to efficiently modify their behavior in strategic environments with a persistent element of novelty. Agents with the ability to learn have a sharp, unambiguous advantage over those who are less sophisticated because the former agents extrapolate to novel circumstances information about opponents' preferences that was learned previously. This advantage holds even with a suitably small cost to reflect the additional cognitive complexity involved. (JEL C73, D11, D83)

Title: Group Strategy-Proofness in Private Good Economies
Abstract: Many salient rules to allocate private goods are not only strategy-proof, but also group strategy-proof, in appropriate domains of
definition, hence diminishing the traditional conflict between
incentives and efficiency. That is so for solutions to matching,
division, cost sharing, house allocation, and auctions, in spite of the
substantive disparity between these cases. In a general framework
encompassing all of them, we prove that the equivalence between
the two forms of strategy-proofness is due to an underlying common
structure that transcends the many differences between the contexts
and the mechanisms for which it holds. (JEL C78, D44, D63, D71,

Title: Fiscal Policy and Economic Recovery: The Case of the 1936 Veterans' Bonus
Abstract: Conventional wisdom has it that in the 1930s fiscal policy did not
work because it was not tried. This paper shows that fiscal policy
was tried in 1936. The veterans' bonus of 1936 paid 2 percent of
GDP to 3.2 million veterans; the typical veteran received a payment
equal to per capita income. Multiple sources, including a household
consumption survey, show that veterans spent the majority of
their bonus. Point estimates of the MPC are between 0.6 and 0.75.
Spending was concentrated on cars and housing in particular. (JEL

Title: The Caloric Costs of Culture: Evidence from Indian Migrants
Abstract: Anthropologists have documented substantial and persistent
differences in food preferences across social groups. My paper
asks whether such food cultures can constrain caloric intake?
I first document that interstate migrants within India consume
fewer calories per rupee of food expenditure compared to their
neighbors. Second, I show that migrants bring their origin-state food
preferences with them. Third, I link these findings by showing that the
gap in caloric intake between locals and migrants depends on the
suitability and intensity of the migrants' origin-state preferences. The
most affected migrants would consume seven percent more calories
if they possessed their neighbors' preferences. (JEL D12, I12, O15,

Title: The Bidder's Curse: Comment
Abstract: The prices of auctions on eBay often exceed eBay's fixed-price "Buy-
It-Now" prices. I investigate the causes of this overbidding, focusing
on the interpretation in Malmendier and Lee (2011) that the observed
overbidding cannot be explained "without allowing for nonstandard
preferences or beliefs" and that the "strongest direct evidence points
to limited attention." Using data from their study and new data from
eBay, I provide evidence that a key condition for identifying nonstandard behavior may not have been met, and that the observed overbidding is not inconsistent with standard behavior once we allow for the likely presence of search costs. (JEL D12, D44, D83)

Title: The Bidder's Curse: Reply
Abstract: An important unresolved issue in the search literature is the
question to what extent suboptimal search reflects "traditional
search frictions," and to what extent it reflects behavioral biases.
The distinction is important for assessing welfare, predicting firm
behavior, and making policy choices. In order to make progress on
this question, we need a precise theoretical distinction and micro
data. I argue that Schneider's (2016) analysis and data confirm
and complement the main findings in Malmendier and Lee (2011),
but neither his nor our data permit us to quantitatively assess the
relative importance of these determinants. I propose several feasible
identification strategies. (JEL D12, D44)
