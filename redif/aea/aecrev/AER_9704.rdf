Title: Reference-Dependent Risk Attitudes
Abstract: We use Koszegi and Rabin's (2006) model of reference-dependent utility, and an
extension of it that applies to decisions with delayed consequences, to study preferences
over monetary risk. Because our theory equates the reference point with
recent probabilistic beliefs about outcomes, it predicts specific ways in which the
environment influences attitudes toward modest-scale risk. It replicates "classical"
prospect theory—including the prediction of distaste for insuring losses—when
exposure to risk is a surprise, but implies first-order risk aversion when a risk,
and the possibility of insuring it, are anticipated. A prior expectation to take on
risk decreases aversion to both the anticipated and additional risk. For large-scale
risk, the model allows for standard "consumption utility" to dominate reference-dependent
"gain-loss utility," generating nearly identical risk aversion across situations.

Title: Mismatch
Abstract: This paper develops a dynamic model of mismatch. Workers and jobs are randomly
allocated to labor markets. Each market clears, but some have excess (unemployed)
workers and some have excess (vacant) jobs. As workers and jobs switch markets,
unemployed workers find vacancies and employed workers become unemployed.
The model is quantitatively consistent with the business cycle frequency comovement
of unemployment, vacancies, and the job finding rate and explains much of
these variables' volatility. It can also address cyclicality in the separation rate into
unemployment and duration dependence in the job finding rate. The results are
robust to some nonrandom mobility. (JEL E24, J41, J63, J64)

Title: Subjective Expectations and Asset-Return Puzzles
Abstract: In textbook expositions of the equity-premium, riskfree-rate and equity-volatility
puzzles, agents are sure of the economy's structure while growth rates are normally
distributed. But because of parameter uncertainty the thin-tailed normal
distribution conditioned on realized data becomes a thick-tailed Student-t distribution,
which changes the entire nature of what is considered "puzzling" by reversing
every inequality discrepancy needing to be explained. This paper shows that
Bayesian updating of unknown structural parameters inevitably adds a permanent
tail-thickening
effect to posterior expectations. The expected-utility ramifications of
this for asset pricing are strong, work against the puzzles, and are very sensitive to
subjective prior beliefs—even with asymptotically infinite data. (JEL D84, G12)

Title: On the Cyclicality of Research and Development
Abstract: Economists have recently argued recessions play a useful role in fostering growth.
Yet a major source of growth, R&D, is procyclical. This paper argues one reason
for procyclical R&D is a dynamic externality inherent in R&D that makes entrepreneurs
short-sighted and concentrate their innovation in booms, even when it is
optimal to concentrate it in recessions. Additional forces may imply that procyclical
R&D is desirable, but equilibrium R&D is likely to be too procyclical, and macroeconomic
shocks are likely to have overly persistent effects on output and make
growth more costly than in the absence of such shocks.

Title: Inventories and the Business Cycle: An Equilibrium Analysis of (<i>S</i>, <i>s</i>) Policies
Abstract: We develop an equilibrium business cycle model where nonconvex delivery costs lead
firms to follow (S, s) inventory policies. Calibrated to postwar US data, the model
reproduces two-thirds of the cyclical variability of inventory investment. Moreover,
it delivers strongly procyclical inventory investment, greater volatility in production
than sales, and a countercyclical inventory-to-sales ratio. Our model challenges
several prominent claims involving inventories, including the widely held belief
that they amplify aggregate fluctuations. Despite the comovement between inventory
investment and final sales, GDP volatility is essentially unaltered by inventory
accumulation, because procyclical inventory investment diverts resources from
final production, thereby dampening fluctuations in sales. (JEL E22, E32).

Title: Markets in China and Europe on the Eve of the Industrial Revolution
Abstract: Why did Western Europe industrialize first? An influential view holds that its exceptionally
well-functioning markets supported with a certain set of institutions provided
the incentives to make investments needed to industrialize. This paper examines this
hypothesis by comparing the actual performance of markets in terms of market integration
in Western Europe and China, two regions that were relatively advanced
in the preindustrial period, but would start to industrialize about 150 years apart.
We find that the performance of markets in China and Western Europe overall was
comparable in the late eighteenth century. Market performance in England was
higher than in the Yangzi Delta, and markets in England also performed better than
those in continental Western Europe. This suggests strong market performance may
be necessary, but it is not sufficient for industrialization. Rather than being a key
condition for subsequent growth, improvements in market performance and growth
occurred simultaneously. (JEL N13, N15, O47)

Title: Projection Bias in Catalog Orders
Abstract: Evidence suggests that people understand qualitatively how tastes change over time,
but underestimate the magnitudes. This evidence is limited, however, to laboratory
evidence or surveys of reported happiness. We test for such projection bias in field
data. Using data on catalog orders of cold-weather items, we find evidence of projection
bias over the weather—specifically, people's decisions are overinfluenced
by the current weather. Our estimates suggest that if the order-date temperature
declines by 30°F, the return probability increases by 3.95 percent. We also estimate
a structural model to measure the magnitude of the bias. (JEL D12, L81)

Title: Do Markets Reduce Costs? Assessing the Impact of Regulatory Restructuring on US Electric Generation Efficiency
Abstract: While neoclassical models assume static cost-minimization by firms, agency models
suggest that firms may not minimize costs in less-competitive or regulated environments.
We test this using a transition from cost-of-service regulation to marketoriented
environments for many US electric generating plants. Our estimates of input
demand suggest that publicly owned plants, whose owners were largely insulated
from these reforms, experienced the smallest efficiency gains, while investor-owned
plants in states that restructured their wholesale electricity markets improved the
most. The results suggest modest medium-term efficiency benefits from replacing
regulated monopoly with a market-based industry structure. (JEL D24, L11 , L51,

Title: Selection Bias, Demographic Effects, and Ability Effects in Common Value Auction Experiments
Abstract: Inexperienced women, along with economics and business majors, are much
more susceptible to the winner's curse, as are subjects with lower SAT/ACT
scores. There are strong selection effects in bid function estimates for inexperienced
and experienced subjects due to bankruptcies and bidders who
have lower earnings returning less frequently as experienced subjects. These
selection effects are not identified using standard econometric techniques but
are identified through experimental treatment effects. Ignoring these selection
effects leads to misleading estimates of learning. (JEL D44, D83, J16)

Title: Naked Exclusion, Efficient Breach, and Downstream Competition
Abstract: Previous papers by Eric B. Rasmusen, J. Mark Ramseyer, and John S. Wiley, Jr.
(1991) and Ilya R. Segal and Michael D. Whinston (2000) argue that exclusive contracts
can inefficiently deter entry in the presence of scale economies and multiple
buyers. We first show that these results no longer hold when buyers are final
consumers who can breach these contracts and pay expectation damages. We then
show, however, that exclusive contracts can inefficiently deter entry if buyers are
downstream competitors, even in the absence of scale economies and even if breach
is possible. (JEL D86, K21, L11 , L13, L14, L40)

Title: Do Vertical Mergers Facilitate Upstream Collusion?
Abstract: We investigate the impact of vertical mergers on upstream firms' ability to collude
when selling to downstream firms in a repeated game. We show that vertical mergers
give rise to an outlets effect: the deviation profits of cheating unintegrated firms
are reduced as these firms can no longer profitably sell to the downstream affiliates
of their integrated rivals. Vertical mergers also result in an opposing punishment effect:
 integrated firms typically make more profit in the punishment phase
than unintegrated upstream firms. The net result of these effects in an unintegrated
industry is to facilitate upstream collusion. We provide conditions under which further
vertical integration also facilitates collusion. (JEL D43, G34, L12, L13)

Title: Individual Behavior and Group Membership
Abstract: People who are members of a group and identify with it behave differently from people
who perceive themselves as isolated individuals. This paper shows that group
membership affects preferences over outcomes, and saliency of the group affects the
perception of the environment. We manipulate the saliency of group membership
by letting a player's own group watch as a passive audience as decisions are made,
and/or by making part of the payoff common for members of the group. In contrast
to the minimal-group paradigm, minimal groups alone do not affect behavior in our
strategic environments. However, salient group membership significantly increases
the aggressive stance of the hosts (people who have their group members in the
audience), and tends to reduce that of the guests. (JEL D71, Z13)

Title: Political Bias and War
Abstract: We examine how countries' incentives to go to war depend on the "political bias"
of their pivotal decision makers. This bias is measured by a decision maker’s risk/
reward ratio from a war compared to that of the country at large. If there is no
political bias, then there are mutually acceptable transfers from one country to
the other that will avoid a war in the presence of commitment or enforceability of
peace treaties. There are cases with a strong enough bias on the part of one or both
countries where war cannot be prevented by any transfer payments. Our results
shed some new light on the uneven contender paradox and the interpretation of the
"democratic peace." We examine countries' choices of the bias of their leaders and
show that when transfers are possible, at least one country will choose a biased
leader, as that leads to a strong bargaining position and extraction of transfers.

Title: A Political-Economy Theory of Trade Agreements
Abstract: We present a model where trade agreements are motivated by the desire of governments to commit vis-&agrave;-vis domestic lobbies, in addition to standard terms-of-trade
externalities. The model predicts that trade liberalization is deeper when capital is more mobile across sectors, and when governments are more politically motivated (provided domestic-commitment motives are strong enough). The model also provides a new rationale for the use of tariff ceilings. In a fully dynamic specification of the model, tariffs are reduced in two stages: an immediate cut and a subsequent gradual reduction, with the speed of liberalization increasing in the degree of capital
mobility. (JEL D72, F13)

Title: Auctions with Anticipated Regret: Theory and Experiment
Abstract: This paper demonstrates theoretically and experimentally that in first-price auctions overbidding with respect to the risk neutral Nash equilibrium might be driven from anticipated loser regret (felt when bidders lose at an affordable price). Different information structures are created to elicit regret: bidders know they will learn the winning bid if they lose (loser regret condition); or the second-highest bid if they win (winner regret condition); or they will receive no feedback regarding the other bids. Bidders in loser regret condition anticipated regret and significantly overbid. However, bidders in the winner regret condition did not anticipate regret. (JEL D44)

Title: Labor and the Market Value of the Firm
Abstract: What role does labor play in firms' market value? We use a production-based asset pricing model with factor adjustment costs and forward-looking agents to explore this question. We posit that the hiring of labor is akin to investment in capital and that the two interact, with the interaction being a crucial determinant of the dynamic behavior of market value. Using aggregate US corporate sector data, we estimate firms' optimal hiring and investment decisions and the consequences for firms' value. (JEL E22, E24, G31, G32, M51)

Title: Contracting with Repeated Moral Hazard and Private Evaluations
Abstract: A repeated moral hazard setting in which the Principal privately observes the Agent's output is studied. The optimal contract for a finite horizon is characterized, and shown to require burning of resources. These are only burnt after the worst possible realization sequence and the amount is independent of both the length of the horizon and the discount factor. For the infinite horizon. it is shown that there is no loss from restricting
the analysis to contracts in which the Agent receives a constant efficiency wage and no feedback until he is fired. Furthermore, optimal contracts cannot be replicated by short-term contracts. A family of fixed interval review contracts is characterized. Longer review intervals are preferable but harder to implement. Comparative statics on the review length are carried out. Finally, these contracts are shown approximate first best if players are very patient. (JEL D82, D86)

Title: Exchange Asymmetries Incorrectly Interpreted as Evidence of Endowment Effect Theory and Prospect Theory?
Abstract: Systematic asymmetries in exchange behavior have been widely interpreted as support for "endowment effect theory," an application of prospect theory positing that loss aversion and utility function kinks set by entitlements explain observed asymmetries. We experimentally test an alternative explanation, namely, that asymmetries are explained by classical preference theories finding influence through the experimental procedures typically used. Contrary to the predictions of endowment effect theory, we observe no asymmetries when we modify procedures to remove the influence of classical preference theories. When we return to traditional-type procedures, however, the asymmetries reappear. The results support explanations based in classical preference theories and reject endowment effect theory. (JEL D01)

Title: Surviving Andersonville: The Benefits of Social Networks in POW Camps
Abstract: Twenty-seven percent of the Union Army prisoners captured July 1863 or later died in captivity. At Andersonville, the death rate may have been as high as 40 percent. How did men survive such horrific conditions? Using two independent datasets, we find that friends had a statistically significant positive effect on survival probabilities and that the closer the ties between friends as measured by such identifiers as ethnicity, kinship, and
the same hometown, the bigger was the impact of friends on survival probabilities. (JEL N41, Z13)

Title: Individual Consumption Risk and the Welfare Cost of Business Cycles
Abstract: We measure the welfare gain from removing aggregate consumption fluctuations in a model where each individual faces incomplete consumption insurance. We show that, because this welfare gain is a convex function of the overall consumption risk—aggregate plus idiosyncratic—each individual faces, to gauge the magnitude of the gain, it is important to match individuals' overall risk prior to any policy. In an economy calibrated to match individuals' overall risk, even removing 10 percent of aggregate fluctuations can result in a large welfare gain. Further, large gains do not necessarily depend on the countercyclical nature of idiosyncratic risk. (JEL E21, E32)

Title: Goodbye Lenin (or Not?): The Effect of Communism on People
Abstract: Preferences for redistribution, as well as the generosity of welfare states, differ significantly across countries. This paper tests whether there exists a feedback process of the economic regime on individual preferences. We exploit the experiment of German separation and reunification to establish exogeneity of the economic system. We find that, after German reunification, East Germans are more in favor of state intervention than West Germans. This effect is especially strong for older cohorts. We further find that East Germans' preferences converge toward those of West Germans. It will take one to two generations for preferences to converge completely. (JEL D12, D72, H11, H23, P26)
