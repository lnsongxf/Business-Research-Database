Title: The Increasing Returns Revolution in Trade and Geography
Abstract: Thirty years have passed since a small group of theorists began applying concepts and tools
from industrial organization to the analysis of international trade. The new models of trade that
emerged from that work didn't supplant traditional trade theory so much as supplement it, creating
an integrated view that made sense of aspects of world trade that had previously posed major
puzzles. The "new trade theory"&#8212;an unfortunate phrase, now quite often referred to as "the old
new trade theory"&#8212;also helped build a bridge between the analysis of trade between countries
and the location of production within countries.
In this paper I will try to retrace the steps and, perhaps even more important, the state of mind
that made this intellectual transformation possible. At the end I'll also ask about the relevance
of those once-revolutionary insights in a world economy that, as I'll explain, is arguably more
classical now than it was when the revolution in trade theory began.

Title: Bureaucratic Minimal Squawk Behavior: Theory and Evidence from Regulatory Agencies
Abstract: This paper develops a model in which a desire to avoid criticism prompts
otherwise public-spirited bureaucrats to behave inefficiently. Decisions
are taken to keep interest groups quiet and to keep mistakes out of the public
eye. The policy implications of this "minimal squawk" behavior are
at odds with the view that agencies should be structured to minimize the
threat of "capture." An empirical test using data from US State Public
Utility Commissions rejects the capture hypothesis and is consistent with
the squawk hypothesis: longer PUC terms of office are associated with
a higher incidence of rate reviews and lower household electricity bills.

Title: Incentives and Stability in Large Two-Sided Matching Markets
Abstract: A number of labor markets and student placement systems can be modeled
as many-to-one matching markets. We analyze the scope for manipulation in
many-to-one matching markets under the student-optimal stable mechanism
when the number of participants is large. Under some regularity conditions,
we show that the fraction of participants with incentives to misrepresent their
preferences when others are truthful approaches zero as the market becomes
large. With an additional condition, truthful reporting by every participant is
an approximate equilibrium under the student-optimal stable mechanism in
large markets. (JEL C78)

Title: Economic Catastrophe Bonds
Abstract: The central insight of asset pricing is that a security's value depends both on
its distribution of payoffs across economic states and on state prices. In fixed
income markets, many investors focus exclusively on estimates of expected
payoffs, such as credit ratings, without considering the state of the economy
in which default occurs. Such investors are likely to be attracted to securities
whose payoffs resemble economic catastrophe bonds&#8212;bonds that default
only under severe economic conditions. We show that many structured finance
instruments can be characterized as economic catastrophe bonds, but offer far
less compensation than alternatives with comparable payoff profiles. (JEL G11,

Title: Distributional and Efficiency Impacts of Increased US Gasoline Taxes
Abstract: We examine the impacts of increased US gasoline taxes in a model that links
the markets for new, used, and scrapped vehicles and recognizes the considerable
heterogeneity among households and cars. Household choice parameters
derive from an estimation procedure that integrates individual choices for car
ownership and miles traveled. We find that each cent-per-gallon increase in the
price of gasoline reduces the equilibrium gasoline consumption by about 0.2
percent. Taking account of revenue recycling, the impact of a 25-cent gasoline
tax increase on the average household is about $30 per year (2001 dollars).
Distributional impacts depend importantly on how additional revenues from
the tax increase are recycled. (JEL D12, H22, H25, L62, L71)

Title: Should Urban Transit Subsidies Be Reduced?
Abstract: This paper derives empirically tractable formulas for the welfare effects of
fare adjustments in passenger peak and off-peak rail and bus transit, and for
optimal pricing of those services. The formulas account for congestion, pollution,
accident externalities, scale economies, and agency adjustment of transit
service offerings. We apply them using parameter values for Washington (DC),
Los Angeles, and London. The results support the efficiency of the large current
fare subsidies; even starting with fares at 50 percent of operating costs,
incremental fare reductions are welfare improving in almost all cases. These
findings are robust to alternative assumptions and parameters. (JEL L92, R41,

Title: Trade, Tragedy, and the Commons
Abstract: We develop a theory of resource management where the degree to which countries
escape the tragedy of the commons, and hence the de facto property rights
regime, is endogenously determined. Three forces determine success or failure
in resource management: the regulator's enforcement power, the extent of harvesting
capacity, and the ability of the resource to generate competitive returns
without being extinguished. The model can explain heterogeneity across countries
and resources in the effectiveness of resource management, and it predicts
that changes in prices, population, and technology can cause transitions to
better or worse management regimes. (JEL P14, Q21, Q22, Q23, Q32)

Title: Strategic Leniency and Cartel Enforcement
Abstract: The cornerstone of cartel enforcement in the United States and elsewhere is a
commitment to the lenient prosecution of early confessors. A burgeoning gametheoretical
literature is ambiguous regarding the impacts of leniency. I develop
a theoretical model of cartel behavior that provides empirical predictions and
moment conditions, and apply the model to the complete set of indictments and
information reports issued over a 20-year span. Statistical tests are consistent
with the notion that leniency enhances deterrence and detection capabilities.
The results have implications for market efficiency and enforcement efforts
against cartels and other forms of organized crime. (JEL D43, L12, L13, K21)

Title: Optimal Sticky Prices under Rational Inattention
Abstract: This paper presents a model in which price setting firms decide what to pay
attention to, subject to a constraint on information flow. When idiosyncratic
conditions are more variable or more important than aggregate conditions,
firms pay more attention to idiosyncratic conditions than to aggregate conditions.
When we calibrate the model to match the large average absolute size of
price changes observed in micro data, prices react fast and by large amounts to
idiosyncratic shocks, but only slowly and by small amounts to nominal shocks.
Nominal shocks have strong and persistent real effects. (JEL D21, D83, E31,

Title: The Young, the Old, and the Restless: Demographics and Business Cycle Volatility
Abstract: We investigate the consequences of demographic change for business cycle
analysis. We find that changes in the age composition of the labor force account
for a significant fraction of the variation in cyclical volatility observed in the
G7. Since World War II, these countries have experienced dramatic demographic
changes, although details regarding timing and nature differ across
countries. We exploit this variation to show that the workforce age composition
has a large and significant effect on cyclical volatility. We relate our results to
the recent decline in US macroeconomic volatility, finding that demographic
change accounts for approximately one-fifth to one-third of this moderation.

Title: Tricks with Hicks: The EASI Demand System
Abstract: We invent Implicit Marshallian demands, which combine desirable features of
Hicksian and Marshallian demands. We propose and estimate the Exact Affine
Stone Index (EASI) implicit Marshallian demand system. Like the Almost Ideal
Demand (AID) system, EASI budget shares are linear in parameters given real
expenditures. However, unlike the AID, EASI demands can have any rank and
its Engel curves can have any shape over real expenditures. EASI error terms
equal random utility parameters to account for unobserved preference heterogeneity.
EASI demand functions can be estimated using GMM or three stage
least squares, and, like AID, an approximate EASI model can be estimated by
linear regression. (JEL D11, D12)

Title: Observational Learning: Evidence from a Randomized Natural Field Experiment
Abstract: We report results from a randomized natural field experiment conducted in a
restaurant dining setting to distinguish the observational learning effect from
the saliency effect. We find that, when customers are given ranking information
of the five most popular dishes, the demand for those dishes increases by 13 to
20 percent. We do not find a significant saliency effect. We also find modest
evidence that the observational learning effects are stronger among infrequent
customers, and that dining satisfaction is increased when customers are presented
with the information of the top five dishes, but not when presented with
only names of some sample dishes. (JEL C93, D83)

Title: Misselling through Agents
Abstract: This paper analyzes the implications of the inherent conflict between two tasks
performed by direct marketing agents: prospecting for customers and advising
on the product's "suitability" for the specific needs of customers. When
structuring salesforce compensation, firms trade off the expected losses from
"misselling" unsuitable products with the agency costs of providing marketing
incentives. We characterize how the equilibrium amount of misselling
(and thus the scope of policy intervention) depends on features of the agency
problem including: the internal organization of a firm's sales process, the
transparency of its commission structure, and the steepness of its agents'
sales incentives. (JEL M31, M37, M52)

Title: Reference-Dependent Consumption Plans
Abstract: We develop a rational dynamic model in which people are loss averse over
changes in beliefs about present and future consumption. Because changes
in wealth are news about future consumption, preferences over money are
reference-dependent. If news resonates more when about imminent consumption
than when about future consumption, a decision maker might (to generate
pleasant surprises) overconsume early relative to the optimal committed plan,
increase immediate consumption following surprise wealth increases, and
delay decreasing consumption following surprise losses. Since higher wealth
mitigates the effect of bad news, people exhibit an unambiguous first-order
precautionary-savings motive. (JEL D14, D81, D83, D91)

Title: Evolution of Time Preferences and Attitudes toward Risk
Abstract: This paper explores a general model of the evolution and adaption of hedonic
utility. It is shown that optimal utility will be increasing strongly in regions
where choices have to be made often and decision mistakes have a severe impact
on fitness. Several applications are suggested. In the context of intertemporal
preferences, the model offers an evolutionary explanation for the existence of
conflicting short- and long-run interests that lead to dynamic inconsistency.
Concerning attitudes toward risk, an evolutionary explanation is given for
S-shaped value functions that adjust to the decision maker's environment. (JEL

Title: Cooperation and Competition in Intergenerational Experiments in the Field and the Laboratory
Abstract: There is economic pressure to postpone the retirement age, but employers are
still reluctant to employ older workers. We investigate the comparative behavior
of juniors and seniors in experiments conducted both onsite with the employees
of two large firms and in a conventional laboratory environment with students
and retirees. We show that seniors are no more risk averse than juniors and are
typically more cooperative; both juniors and working seniors respond strongly
to competition. The implication is that it may be beneficial to define additional
incentives near the end of the career to motivate and retain older workers. (JEL

for monitoring and enforcement facilitate cooperation? Finally, what classes of

even in anonymous settings; second, some type of monitoring and punishment
institutions significantly promote cooperation; and, third, subjects mostly
employ strategies that are selective in punishment. (JEL C71, C73, D12, Z13)

Title: Under the Weather: Health, Schooling, and Economic Consequences of Early-Life Rainfall
Abstract: We examine the effect of early-life rainfall on the health, education, and socioeconomic outcomes of Indonesian adults. We link historical rainfall for each individual's birth year and birth location with adult outcomes from the 2000 Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS). Higher early-life rainfall has large positive effects on the adult outcomes of women, but not of men. Women with 20 percent higher rainfall (relative to the local norm) are 0.57 centimeters taller, complete 0.22 more schooling grades, and live in households scoring 0.12 standard deviations higher on an asset index. Schooling attainment appears to mediate the impact on adult women's socioeconomic status. (JEL I12, I21, J16, O15)

Title: Anchoring Effects: Evidence from Art Auctions
Abstract: This paper shows that the price of a painting sold at an art auction and the experts' pre-sale valuations are anchored on the price at which the painting previously sold at auction.  We are able to separate anchoring from rational learning by using the identifying strategy that the unobservable component of quality for a particular painting remains constant between the last auction sale and the current auction sale.  We interpret these results as anchoring on the part of the buyers, with the sellers and auctioneers either anticipating anchoring on the part of the buyers or exhibiting anchoring effects themselves.

Title: On the Welfare Cost of Inflation and the Recent Behavior of Money Demand
Abstract: Post-1980 US data trace out a stable long-run money demand relationship of Cagan's semi-log form between the M1-income ratio and the nominal interest rate, with an interest semielasticity below 2. Integrating under this money demand curve yields estimates of the welfare costs of modest departures from Friedman's zero nominal interest rate rule for the optimum quantity of money that are quite small. The results suggest that the Federal Reserve's current policy, which generates low but still positive rates of inflation, provides an adequate approximation in welfare terms to the alternative of moving all the way to the Friedman rule.

Title: Not All Oil Price Shocks Are Alike: Disentangling Demand and Supply Shocks in the Crude Oil Market
Abstract: Shocks to the real price of oil may reflect oil supply shocks, shocks to the global demand for all industrial commodities, or demand shocks that are specific to the crude oil market. Each shock has different effects on the real price of oil and on US macroeconomic aggregates. Changes in the composition of shocks help explain why regressions of macroeconomic aggregates on oil prices tend to be unstable. Evidence that the recent surge in oil prices was driven primarily by global demand shocks helps explain why this shock so far has failed to cause a major recession in the United States.

Title: Exclusive Dealing and Entry, When Buyers Compete: Comment
Abstract: In a recent paper, Chiara Fumagalli and Massimo Motta (2006) challenge the idea that an incumbent can foreclose efficient entry in the face of scale economies by using exclusive contracts. They claim that inefficient exclusion does not arise when buyers are homogenous firms that compete downstream. However, when upstream firms can compete in two-part tariffs, their equilibrium analysis contains some errors. Fixing these errors, inefficient exclusion arises when scale economies are sufficiently large or the entrant's cost advantage is not too big. Inefficient exclusion arises to protect industry profits from competition. (JEL L11, L13, L14)
