Title:   The Market for Sulfur Dioxide Emissions. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 669-85
Issue: 4
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments initiated the first large-scale use of
 the tradable permit approach to pollution control. The theoretical case
 for this approach rests on the assumption of an efficient market for
 emission rights. The authors' empirical analysis shows that the emission
 rights market created by the 1990 Amendments had become reasonably
 efficient by mid-1994. They also show that the auctions specified in the
 Amendments to jump-start trading had become a small part of the overall
 market. Finally, the authors demonstrate that the strategic bidding
 behavior discussed in the literature has had no effect on market prices.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Valuing the Impact of Large-Scale Ecological Change in a Market: The Effect of Climate Change on U.S. Timber. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 686-710
Issue: 4
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper establishes a methodology for valuing the impact of
 large-scale ecological changes in a market. Given the large capital stocks
 inherent in most ecological systems, the dynamic nature of most ecological
 change, and the dynamic response of markets, it is critical to build
 dynamic models to capture the resulting effects. This paper demonstrates
 how to construct such a model using the impacts of climate change on U.S.
 timber markets as an example. Across a wide range of scenarios and models,
 warming is predicted to expand timber supplies and thus benefit U.S.
 timber markets.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Layoffs, Top Executive Pay, and Firm Performance. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 711-23
Issue: 4
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the connection between layoffs, executive pay, and
 stock prices. Firms that announce layoffs in the previous year pay their
 CEOs more, and give their CEOs larger percentage raises than firms which
 do not have at least one layoff announcement in the previous year.
 However, the likelihood of announcing a layoff varies dramatically along
 other dimensions, for example firm size, which are also correlated with
 CEO pay. Once firm-specific fixed effects are controlled for, the CEO pay
 premium for laying off workers disappears. In addition, there is a small
 negative share price reaction to layoff announcements.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Multidimensional Uncertainty and Herd Behavior in Financial Markets. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 724-48
Issue: 4
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors study the relationship between asset prices and herd
 behavior, which occurs when traders follow the trend in past trades. When
 traders have private information on only a single dimension of uncertainty
 (the effect of a shock to the asset value), price adjustments prevent herd
 behavior. Herding arises when there are two dimensions of uncertainty (the
 existence and effect of a shock), but it need not distort prices because
 the market discounts the informativeness of trades during herding. With a
 third dimension of uncertainty (the quality of traders' information), herd
 behavior can lead to a significant, short-run mispricing.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Effect of Tax-Favored Retirement Accounts on Capital Accumulation. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 749-68
Issue: 4
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors develop an applied general equilibrium model
 to examine the effects of tax-favored retirement accounts on the capital
 stock. The results from their benchmark model indicate that a modest
 individual retirement account (IRA) contribution limit similar to that in
 effect during the early 1980s raises the steady-state capital stock by
 6.18 percent; approximately 9 percent of IRA contributions constitutes
 incremental saving. The authors' results lend support to recent
 suggestions that retirement accounts with favorable tax treatment only for
 contributions above some base amount might provide more stimulus to saving
 than conventional IRAs.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Is There a Retirement-Savings Puzzle? 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 769-88
Issue: 4
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper addresses whether households save enough for their retirement.
 For successive date-of-birth cohorts the authors analyze income and
 expenditure patterns around the time of retirement. They find a fall in
 consumption as household heads retire which cannot be fully explained by a
 forward-looking consumption-smoothing model that accounts for expected
 demographic changes and mortality risk. Controlling for labor-market
 participation explains part, but not all, of this dip. The authors argue
 that the only way to reconcile fully the fall in consumption with the
 life-cycle hypothesis is with the systematic arrival of unexpected adverse
 information.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Education-Finance Reform and the Distribution of Education Resources. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 789-812
Issue: 4
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Between 1971 and 1996 opponents of local funding for public schools
 successfully challenged the constitutionality of school-finance systems in
 sixteen states. Using the variation across states in the timing of these
 cases the authors investigate the impact of reform on the distribution of
 school resources. Their results suggest that court-ordered finance reform
 reduced within-state inequality in spending by 19 to 34 percent.
 Successful litigation reduced inequality by raising spending in the
 poorest districts while leaving spending in the richest districts
 unchanged, thereby increasing aggregate spending on education. Reform led
 states to fund additional spending through higher state taxes.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Public Education and Income Distribution: A Dynamic Quantitative Evaluation of Education-Finance Reform. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 813-33
Issue: 4
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Many states are implementing school-finance reforms which will have
 complex effects on income distribution, intergenerational income mobility,
 and welfare. This paper analyzes the static and dynamic effects of such
 reforms by constructing a dynamic general equilibrium model of
 public-education provision and calibrating it using U.S. data. The authors
 examine the consequences of a reform of a locally financed system to a
 state-financed system which equalizes expenditures per student across
 districts. They find that this policy increases both average income and
 the share of income spent on education. Steady-state welfare increases by
 3.2 percent of steady-state income.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Games with Procedurally Rational Players. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 834-47
Issue: 4
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors study interactive situations in which players are boundedly
 rational. Each player, rather than optimizing given a belief about the
 other players' behavior, as in the theory of Nash equilibrium, uses the
 following choice procedure. She first associates one consequence with each
 of her actions by sampling (literally or virtually) each of her actions
 once. Then she chooses the action that has the best consequence. The
 authors define a notion of equilibrium for such situations and study its
 properties.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Predicting How People Play Games: Reinforcement Learning in Experimental Games with Unique, Mixed Strategy Equilibria. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 848-81
Issue: 4
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors examine learning in all experiments they could locate
 involving one hundred periods or more of games with a unique equilibrium
 in mixed strategies, and in a new experiment. They study both the ex post
 ('best fit') descriptive power of learning models, and their ex ante
 predictive power, by simulating each experiment using parameters estimated
 from the other experiments. Even a one-parameter reinforcement learning
 model robustly outperforms the equilibrium predictions. Predictive power
 is improved by adding 'forgetting' and 'experimentation,' or by allowing
 greater rationality as in probabilistic fictitious play. Implications for
 developing a low-rationality, cognitive game theory are discussed.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Noncooperative Bargaining, Hostages, and Optimal Asset Ownership. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 882-901
Issue: 4
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper re-examines the effect of asset ownership on investment
 decisions for a joint relationship in the absence of contracts on
 investment levels. It obtains some results which contradict findings by
 Sanford J. Grossman, Oliver D. Hart, and John Moore. In particular, it
 finds that the loss of ownership of an asset may increase the asset
 loser's investment incentive. The difference between this paper and those
 authors' papers stems from the different interpretations of the roles of
 the threat point and outside options in bargaining. This paper also
 clarifies the role of relationship-specific investments as a cause of
 integration.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Incomplete Contracts and Strategic Ambiguity. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 902-32
Issue: 4
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Why are observed contracts so often incomplete in the sense that they
 leave contracting parties' obligations vague or unspecified? Traditional
 answers to this question invoke transaction costs or bounded rationality.
 In contrast, the authors argue that such incompleteness is often an
 essential feature of a well-designed contract. Specifically, once some
 aspects of performance are unverifiable, it is often optimal to leave
 other verifiable aspects of performance unspecified. The authors explore
 the conditions under which this occurs, and investigate the structure of
 optimal contracts when these conditions are satisfied.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review

Issue: 1
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  In a general equilibrium model with incomplete asset markets, nominal
 securities, and mean-variance preferences, a monetary union is desirable
 when the gain from eliminating excess volatility of nominal variables
 exceeds the cost of reducing the number of currencies with which to hedge
 risks.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The International Ramifications of Tax Reforms: Supply-Side Economics in a Global Economy. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 226-45
Issue: 1
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper studies tax reforms in a dynamic model of a global economy
 calibrated to current U.S. and European tax policies. World capital
 markets add consumption-smoothing and income-redistribution effects that
 alter closed-economy predictions. In the absence of taxes on foreign
 interest, welfare gains of eliminating U.S. income taxes are enlarged by
 up to 34 percent at the expense of European losses caused by transitional
 declines in consumption and leisure and a permanent capital outflow. In
 contrast, if foreign interest is taxed, the same tax reform reduces U.S.
 welfare 0.7 percent and increases European welfare 1.8 percent.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   What Price Coordination? The Efficiency-Enhancing Effect of Auctioning the Right to Play. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 198-225
Issue: 1
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  A model is proposed to explain the results of recent experiments in which
 subjects repeatedly played a coordination game, with the right to play
 auctioned each period in a larger group. Subjects bid the market-clearing
 price to a level recoverable only in the efficient equilibrium and then
 converged to that equilibrium, although subjects playing the game without
 auctions converged to inefficient equilibria. The efficiency-enhancing
 effect of auctions is reminiscent of forward induction but is not
 explained by equilibrium refinements. The model explains it by showing how
 strategic uncertainty interacts with history-dependent learning dynamics
 to determine equilibrium selection.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   When Does It Take a Nixon to Go to China? 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 180-97
Issue: 1
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Substantial policy changes, like market-oriented reforms by populist
 parties and steps towards peace by 'hawks,' are sometimes implemented by
 'unlikely' parties. To account for such episodes, this paper develops a
 framework in which incumbent politicians have better information about the
 state of the world than voters. The incumbent is unable to credibly
 transmit all this information since voters are also imperfectly informed
 about his ideology. The paper identifies conditions under which an
 incumbent party's electoral prospects increase the more atypical the
 policy it proposes. Popular support for a policy, or its 'credibility,'
 depends on the policymaker-policy pair.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Altruists, Egoists, and Hooligans in a Local Interaction Model. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 157-79
Issue: 1
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The authors study a population of agents, each of whom can be an altruist
 or an egoist. Altruism is a strictly dominated strategy. Agents choose
 their actions by imitating others who earn high payoffs. Interactions
 between agents are local, so that each agent affects, and is affected by,
 only his neighbors. Altruists can survive in such a world if they are
 grouped together, so that the benefits of altruism are enjoyed primarily
 by other altruists, who then earn relatively high payoffs and are
 imitated. Altruists continue to survive in the presence of mutations that
 continually introduce egoists into the population.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:    Sources of Inefficiency in a Representative Democracy: A Dynamic Analysis.
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 139-56
Issue: 1
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper studies the efficiency of policy choice in representative
 democracies. It extends the citizen-candidate model of democratic
 policy-making to a dynamic environment. Equilibrium policy choices are
 shown to be efficient in the sense that, in each period, conditional on
 future policies being selected through the democratic process, there
 exists no alternative current policy choices which can raise the expected
 utilities of all citizens. However, policies that would be declared
 efficient by standard economic criteria are not necessarily adopted in
 political equilibrium. The paper argues that these divergencies are
 legitimately viewed as 'political failures.'   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Simple Economics of Easter Island: A Ricardo-Malthus Model of Renewable Resource Use. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 119-38
Issue: 1
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a general equilibrium model of renewable resource and
 population dynamics related to the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model,
 with man as the predator and the resource base as the prey. The authors
 apply the model to the rise and fall of Easter Island, showing that
 plausible parameter values generate a 'feast and famine' pattern of
 cyclical adjustment in population and resource stocks. Near-monotonic
 adjustment arises for higher values of a resource regeneration parameter,
 as might apply elsewhere in Polynesia. The authors also describe other
 civilizations that might have declined because of population overshooting
 and endogenous resource degradation.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Endogenously Chosen Boards of Directors and Their Monitoring of the CEO. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 96-118
Issue: 1
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  How can boards be chosen through a process partially controlled by the
 CEO, yet, in many instances, still be effective monitors of him? The
 authors offer an answer based on a model in which board effectiveness is a
 function of its independence. This, in turn, is a function of negotiations
 (implicit or explicit) between existing directors and the CEO over who
 will fill vacancies on the board. The CEO'S bargaining power over the
 board-selection process comes from his perceived ability relative to
 potential successors. Many empirical findings about board structure and
 performance arise as equilibrium phenomena of this model.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 83-95
Issue: 1
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Using the Mirrlees optimal income tax model with quasi-linear
 preferences, the paper examines conditions for marginal tax rates to be
 rising at high income levels and declining in an interval containing the
 modal skill. It examines conditions for the marginal tax rate to be higher
 at a low skill level than at the high skill level with the same
 density--an argument only holding for skill levels above a cutoff where
 resources of a worker are marginally of the same value as resources of the
 government. Data on earnings rates are presented.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Issue: 1
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  People differ in how they respond to their environment. Some individuals
 treat each situation as unique and tailor their behavior accordingly while
 others respond in the same manner regardless of the situation. The
 authors' objective is to explore how social systems select from such a
 heterogeneous population. A class of simple hierarchical systems is
 considered which encompasses some features of corporations and electoral
 systems. A selection process operates on this population which results in
 successful agents going on to compete against equally successful agents
 for further advancement. The author characterizes the population dynamics
 and the type of agent that ultimately dominates.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 33-62
Issue: 1
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  A theoretical and computational model with tax-financed, tuition-free
 public schools and competitive, tuition-financed private schools is
 developed. Students differ by ability and income. Achievement depends on
 own ability and on peers' abilities. Equilibrium has a strict hierarchy of
 school qualities and two-dimensional student sorting with stratification
 by ability and income. In private schools, high-ability, low-income
 students receive tuition discounts, while low-ability, high-income
 students pay tuition premia. Tuition vouchers increase the relative size
 of the private sector and the extent of student sorting and benefit
 high-ability students relative to low-ability students.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Unique Equilibrium in a Model of Self-Fulfilling Currency Attacks. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 587-97
Issue: 3
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Even though self-fulfilling currency attacks lead to multiple equilibria
 when fundamentals are common knowledge, the authors demonstrate the
 uniqueness of equilibrium when speculators face a small amount of noise in
 their signals about the fundamentals. This unique equilibrium depends not
 only on the fundamentals but also on financial variables, such as the
 quantity of hot money in circulation and the costs of speculative trading.
 In contrast to multiple equilibrium models, the authors' model allows
 analysis of policy proposals directed at curtailing currency attacks.	 Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 559-86
Issue: 3
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper examines whether financial development facilitates economic
 growth by scrutinizing one rationale for such a relationship: that
 financial development reduces the costs of external finance to firms.
 Specifically, the authors ask whether industrial sectors that are
 relatively more in need of external finance develop disproportionately
 faster in countries with more-developed financial markets. They find this
 to be true in a large sample of countries over the 1980s. The authors show
 this result is unlikely to be driven by omitted variables, outliers, or
 reverse causality.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Issue: 3
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Do well-functioning stock markets and banks promote long-run economic
 growth? This paper shows that stock market liquidity and banking
 development both positively predict growth, capital accumulation, and
 productivity improvements when entered together in regressions, even after
 controlling for economic and political factors. The results are consistent
 with the views that financial markets provide important services for
 growth and that stock markets provide different services from banks. The
 paper also finds that stock market size, volatility, and international
 integration are not robustly linked with growth and that none of the
 financial indicators is closely associated with private saving rates.	 Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 516-36
Issue: 3
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors study a one-sector growth model where capital investment is
 credit financed and there is an adverse selection problem in credit
 markets. The presence of adverse selection creates an indeterminacy of
 equilibrium. Many equilibria display permanent fluctuations characterized
 by transitions between Walrasian regimes and regimes of credit rationing.
 Cyclical contractions involve declines in real interest rates, increases
 in credit rationing, and withdrawals of savings from banks. For some
 configurations of parameters, all equilibria display cyclical
 fluctuations. The authors provide sufficient conditions for deterministic
 cycles consisting of m periods of expansion followed by n periods of
 contraction to exist.	 Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 495-515
Issue: 3
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors construct a rational expectations model in which the economy
 switches stochastically between periods of low and high growth. When
 agents expect growth to be slow, the returns on investment are low and
 little investment takes place. But if agents expect fast growth,
 investment is high, returns are high, and growth is rapid. This
 expectational indeterminacy is induced by monopolistic competition and
 complementarity between different types of capital goods. Neither
 externalities nor increasing returns to scale are required. The
 equilibrium with growth cycles is stable under the dynamics implied by a
 simple learning rule.	 Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Issue: 3
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The author considers trade between a flexible-wage America and a
 rigid-wage Europe. In a benchmark case, a move from autarky to free trade
 doubles European unemployment. American wages rise to the European level.
 Entry of the unskilled 'South' to world markets raises European
 unemployment. Europe's commitment to the high wage wholly insulates
 America from the shock. Immigration to America raises American income, but
 lowers European income dollar for dollar, while European unemployment
 rises. Absent South-North migration of the unskilled from 1970-90, Europe
 could have maintained the same wage with from one-eighth to one-fourth
 less unemployment.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 450-77
Issue: 3
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Research on the labor-supply consequences of childbearing is complicated
 by the endogeneity of fertility. This study uses parental preferences for
 a mixed sibling-sex composition to construct instrumental variables (IV)
 estimates of the effect of childbearing on labor supply. IV estimates for
 women are significant but smaller than ordinary least-squares estimates.
 The IV are also smaller for more educated women and show no impact of
 family size on husbands' labor supply. A comparison of estimates using
 sibling-sex composition and twins instruments implies that the impact of a
 third child disappears when the child reaches age thirteen.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   A Theory of Holdouts in Wage Bargaining. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 428-49
Issue: 3
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Holdouts (the continuation of negotiations beyond the contract expiry
 date) are the most common form of disputes in labor contract negotiations.
 The authors model holdouts as a delaying tactic employed by unions to
 obtain information about other bargaining outcomes in their industry.
 Novel implications of their model include a positive association between
 holdout duration and the number of bargaining pairs negotiating contracts
 simultaneously; bunching of holdout durations within these 'negotiating
 groups'; and fewer strikes among holdouts which end later in groups. Using
 a large panel of contract negotiations in Canadian manufacturing, the
 authors find considerable support for these predictions.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Economics of Child Labor. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 412-27
Issue: 3
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  If child labor as a mass phenomenon occurs not because of parental
 selfishness but because of the parents' concern for the household's
 survival, the popular argument for banning child labor loses much of its
 force. However, this assumption about parental decision making, coupled
 with the assumption of substitutability in production between child and
 adult labor, could result in multiple equilibria in the labor market, with
 one equilibrium where children work and another where adult wage is high
 and children do not work. The paper establishes this result and discusses
 its policy implications.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 388-411
Issue: 3
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Many workers receive pay based on subjectively assessed performance, yet
 the shirking model of efficiency wages excludes it. This paper
 incorporates such pay, with the following results. Performance pay is more
 efficient than efficiency wages when the costs of having a job vacant are
 low and qualified workers in short supply. More capital-intensive
 industries pay more than less capital-intensive industries, as observed in
 studies of interindustry wages differentials. Sustaining an efficient
 outcome requires a social convention similar to the notion of a fair wage.
 The model also makes predictions about the relationship between turnover,
 wages, growth, and unemployment.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Unraveling in Matching Markets. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 371-87
Issue: 3
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors use a two-period matching model with initial uncertainty
 about productivities of participants to analyze incentives for early
 contracting or unraveling. Unraveling provides insurance in the absence of
 complete markets but causes inefficient assignments. Unraveling is more
 likely the smaller the applicant pool, the smaller the proportion of
 more-promising applicants, and the greater the heterogeneity in the pool.
 Banning early contracts hurts firms and benefits less-promising
 applicants; the effects on more-promising applicants depend on how the
 gains from early contracts are shared. Ex post buyouts eliminate
 inefficient assignments and more-promising applicants always unravel.	 Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Value of Weather Information Services for Nineteenth-Century Great Lakes Shipping. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1059-76
Issue: 5
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The U.S. government established a national weather organization in 1870.
 Changes in Great Lakes cargo and hull losses, and shipping rates from
 Chicago to Buffalo, provide evidence of the value of storm warnings on the
 Great Lakes. Nearly half of the Great Lakes storm-warning stations were
 closed during the fall of 1883 because of appropriations reductions. This
 exogenous shock permits the econometric estimation of the value of
 storm-warning locations on the Great Lakes. The results indicate that the
 social rate of return for weather expenditures during the Weather Bureau's
 founding period was at least 60 percent.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Rise and Fall of Bank Control in the United States: 1890-1939. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1077-93
Issue: 5
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This article studies how equity ownership and corporate control were
 separated in the United States. Initially, railroads and industrial firms
 were tightly controlled by a few shareholders; this situation was altered
 in the 1890s by massive mergers and reorganizations, which allowed private
 banks to control railroads and industrial firms. Between 1912 and 1939,
 bank control faded away as a result of a political reaction against
 financial institutions. Using stock-market data from 1914, the author
 shows that the eviction of banks from corporate boards depressed firm
 values by about 7 percent and that part of this value came from
 cartelization.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Winners and Losers in Russia's Economic Transition. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1094-1116
Issue: 5
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The transition to a market economy has produced a substantial and rapid
 change in the wage structure in Russia. Household surveys taken before and
 after the transition indicate that overall wage inequality nearly doubled
 from 1991 to 1994 and has reached a level higher than that in the United
 States. Returns to both measured skills (education, occupation) and
 unmeasured skills within groups have increased considerably. Skill
 premiums across experience groups, however, have become more compressed
 and relative wages of older workers have declined. In addition, female
 wages have declined relative to male wages across all percentiles of the
 wage distribution.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Unemployment and the Social Safety Net during Transitions to a Market Economy: Evidence from the Czech and Slovak Republics. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1117-42
Issue: 5
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors investigate the remarkably short unemployment spells in the
 Czech Republic compared to Slovakia and other Central and East European
 economies. They estimate hazard functions and find that 40 to 5O percent
 of the difference in unemployment durations between the two republics is
 accounted for by differences in demographics and demand conditions. The
 remainder is explained by differences in coefficients, proxying the
 behavior of firms, individuals, and institutions. In both republics, the
 unemployment compensation system has a moderately negative effect on the
 exit rate from unemployment. Policymakers, hence, have latitude in
 providing adequate social safety nets without jeopardizing efficiency.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Federalism and the Soft Budget Constraint. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1143-62
Issue: 5
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The government's incentives to bail out inefficient projects are
 determined by the trade-off between political benefits and economic costs,
 the latter depending on the decentralization of government. Two effects of
 federalism are derived: first, fiscal competition among local governments
 under factor mobility increases the opportunity costs of bailout and,
 thus, serves as a commitment device (the 'competition effect'); second,
 monetary centralization, together with fiscal decentralization, induces a
 conflict of interests and, thus, may harden budget constraints and reduce
 inflation (the 'checks and balance effect'). The authors' analysis is used
 to interpret China's recent experience of transition to a market economy.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Interest-Group Competition and the Organization of Congress: Theory and Evidence from Financial Services' Political Action Committees. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1163-87
Issue: 5
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors develop a positive theory of how interest-group competition
 shapes the organization of Congress and use it to explain campaign
 contribution patterns in financial services. Since interest groups cannot
 enforce fee-for-service contracts with legislators, legislators have an
 incentive to create specialized, standing committees which foster repeated
 dealing between interests and committee members. The resulting
 reputational equilibrium supports high contributions and high legislative
 effort for the interests. Contribution patterns by competing interests in
 the congressional battle over whether banks can enter new businesses
 support the theory, which also has implications for term limits and
 campaign reform.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Ambiguity Aversion and Incompleteness of Contractual Form. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1207-31
Issue: 5
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Subjective uncertainty is characterized by ambiguity if the decisionmaker
 has an imprecise knowledge of the probabilities of payoff-relevant events.
 In such an instance, subjective beliefs are better represented by a set of
 probability functions than by a unique probability function. An
 ambiguity-averse decisionmaker adjusts his choice on the side of caution
 in response to his imprecise knowledge of the odds. This paper shows that
 ambiguity aversion can explain the existence of incomplete contracts. The
 contextual setting is the investment hold-up model which has been the
 focus of much of the research on incomplete contracts.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Anticompetitive Vertical Integration by a Dominant Firm. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1232-48
Issue: 5
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Backward vertical integration by a dominant firm into an upstream
 competitive industry causes both input and output prices to rise. The
 dominant firm's advantage may or may not offset the negative effect of
 higher prices on social welfare. Whether it does depends on a simple
 indicator derived from input and output market shares and the degree of
 prior vertical integration. A vertical merger is similar to a hypothetical
 horizontal merger, suggesting that vertical merger policy for this
 industry should be similar to horizontal merger policy. The dominant firm
 model yields an observable sufficient indicator of welfare-improving
 vertical mergers.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Patent Litigation as an Information-Transmission Mechanism. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1249-63
Issue: 5
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Patent litigation reveals important information about the validity of the
 contested patent to other potential entrants. This paper explores the
 implications of such informational externalities for entry dynamics in the
 presence of multiple potential entrants. The nature of the entry game can
 be one of either waiting or preemption depending on the degree of patent
 protection. Therefore, the payoffs for the patentee and the initial
 imitator are discontinuous in the degree of patent protection.
 Furthermore, strengthening intellectual property rights is not necessarily
 desirable for the patentee. The analysis may also help explain the
 apparently puzzling practice of delaying patent suits.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Volume: 88

Abstract:
  Does national market size matter for industrial structure? This has been
 suggested by theoretical work on 'home market' effects. In the present
 paper, the author shows that what previously was regarded as an assumption
 of convenience--transport costs only for the differentiated goods--matters
 a great deal. In a focal case in which differentiated and homogeneous
 goods have identical transport costs, the home market effect disappears.
 This paper discusses available evidence on the relative trade costs for
 differentiated and homogeneous goods. No compelling argument is found that
 market size will matter for industrial structure.   Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.

Issue: 5
Volume: 88
Year: 1998
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper studies endogenous world balanced-growth equilibria in which
 national learning productivity differentials govern relative per capita
 products. Learning productivities depend on the national share of world
 specialized-goods production, national and world scale, and familiarity
 with the foreign economy. Familiarity indexes the extent to which imported
 specialized goods enhance learning productivity. The authors find that
 mutual familiarization causes per capita products to converge. Unfamiliar
 economies diverge substantially and persistently. Unilateral
 familiarization of a less-developed country (LDC) with the leading economy
 causes the LDC to catch up to, and even overtake, the leader.	 Copyright 1998 by American Economic Association.
