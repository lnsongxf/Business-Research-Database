Title:   Technology, Factor Supplies, and International Specialization: Estimating the Neoclassical Model. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 475-94
Issue: 4
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The neoclassical model of trade predicts that international
 specialization will be jointly determined by cross-country differences in
 relative factor endowments and technology levels. This paper specifies an
 empirical model of specialization consistent with the neoclassical
 explanation. In the model, a sector's share of GDP depends on relative
 factor supplies and relative technology differences, and the estimated
 parameters of the model have a clear connection to theoretical parameters.
 The model is estimated with panel data on manufacturing sectors in
 industrialized countries. Relative technology levels and factor supplies
 are both found to be important determinants of specialization.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The International Transmission of Financial Shocks: The Case of Japan. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 495-505
Issue: 4
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The size of Japanese bank lending operations in the United States enables
 the authors to use U.S. banking data to investigate the extent to which
 the sharp decline in Japanese stock prices was transmitted to the United
 States via U.S. branches of Japanese parent banks, as well as to identify
 a supply shock to U.S. bank lending that is independent of U.S. loan
 demand. They find that binding risk-based capital requirements associated
 with the Japanese stock market decline resulted in a decrease in lending
 by Japanese banks in the United States that was both economically and
 statistically significant.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   A Political-Economic Analysis of Free-Trade Agreements. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 506-19
Issue: 4
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper demonstrates that bilateral free-trade agreements can
 undermine political support for further multilateral trade liberalization.
 If a bilateral trade agreement offers disproportionately large gains to
 key agents in a country, then their reservation utility is raised above
 the multilateral free-trade level, and a multilateral agreement would be
 blocked. Bilateral agreements between countries with similar factor
 endowments are most likely to have this effect. It also follows that
 bilateral free-trade agreements can never increase political support for
 multilateral free trade.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   An Empirical Assessment of the Proximity-Concentration Trade-off between Multinational Sales and Trade. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 520-44
Issue: 4
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the extent to which multinational location decisions
 reflect a trade-off between achieving proximity to customers and
 concentrating production to achieve scale economies. It finds that
 overseas production by multinationals increases relative to exports the
 higher are transport costs and trade barriers and the lower are investment
 barriers and scale economies at the plant level relative to the corporate
 level. However, it is not possible to reject a model with only country and
 industry effects. The evidence also suggests that multinational activity
 is more likely the more similar are the home and foreign markets--contrary
 to conventional wisdom.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Decision to Export in Colombia: An Empirical Model of Entry with Sunk Costs. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 545-64
Issue: 4
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Recent theoretical models of entry predict that, in the presence of sunk
 costs, current market participation is affected by prior experience. This
 paper quantifies the effect of prior exporting experience on the decisions
 of Colombian manufacturing plants to participate in foreign markets. It
 develops a dynamic discrete-choice model of exporting behavior that
 separates the roles of profit heterogeneity and sunk entry costs in
 explaining plants' exporting status. Sunk costs are found to be
 significant and prior export experience is shown to increase the
 probability of exporting by as much as sixty percentage points.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Privatization in Eastern Germany: Management Selection and Economic Transition. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 565-97
Issue: 4
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper suggests that management's role in enterprise restructuring
 and market failures in the managerial labor market help explain important
 features of the German privatization program. A model of adverse selection
 based on information advantages for private owners demonstrates how
 privatization can improve the quality and number of western managers in
 eastern enterprises. These benefits can increase with the size of the
 transition. Evidence of management replacement and significant differences
 between state-owned and privatized firms from a survey of eastern German
 firms supports model assumptions and predictions. These results suggest
 the importance of management replacement to successful privatization.	 Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Competition or Compensation: Supplier Incentives under the American and Japanese Subcontracting Systems. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 598-618
Issue: 4
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Two fundamentally different subcontracting systems arise as distinct
 solutions to the quality control problem facing an input buyer. The
 'American' system involves competitive bidding on each contract, large
 orders, and inspections. The 'Japanese' system involves repeat purchases
 from a supplier who earns a premium, small orders, and no inspections.
 Both systems may coexist as local solutions, but the global optimum is
 determined by the ratio of set-up to inspection costs. This suggests that
 the adoption of flexible manufacturing equipment and rising product
 complexity may be responsible for the shift from the American to the
 Japanese system observed in many industries.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Demand Uncertainty and Price Maintenance: Markdowns as Destructive Competition. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 619-41
Issue: 4
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper offers a new theory of destructive competition. The authors
 compare minimum resale price maintenance to retail market-clearing in a
 model with a monopolistic manufacturer selling to competitive retailers.
 In both the resale price maintenance and flexible-price games, retailers
 must order inventories before the realization of demand uncertainty. The
 authors find that manufacturer profits and equilibrium inventories are
 higher under resale price maintenance than under market-clearing.
 Surprisingly, consumer surplus can also be higher, in which case
 unfettered retail competition can legitimately be called 'destructive.'   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Public Policy towards R&D in Oligopolistic Industries. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 642-62
Issue: 4
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors consider the free-market and socially optimal outcomes in a
 general oligopoly model with many firms which first engage in R&D and then
 compete in either output or price. Strategic behavior by firms tends to
 reduce output, R&D, and welfare and so justifies higher subsidies except
 when R&D spillovers are low and firms' actions are strategic substitutes.
 It also reduces the benefits of R&D cooperation. Moreover, policies to
 encourage cooperation are likely to be redundant (since it is always
 privately profitable) and simulations suggest that the welfare cost of lax
 competition policy is high.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Secret Reserve Prices in a Bidding Model with a Resale Option. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 663-84
Issue: 4
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper presents an auction model in which the seller may choose not
 to sell in spite of receiving a bid above the announced reserve price.
 Such behavior is seen frequently in auctions, yet would be suboptimal
 within most existing models. Here, the seller uses resale to signal
 information about the object's value that could not be easily communicated
 via a reserve price announcement. The model predicts that bids for
 reauctioned objects increase relative to initial bids and that, on
 average, prices of both reauctioned items and those sold at initial
 auction rise as delay in reauctioning increases.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Optimal Health Insurance and Provider Payment. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 685-704
Issue: 4
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors derive optimal insurance for patients and payment method for
 physicians when neither the input decided by the patient (quantity of
 treatment) nor the input decided by the physician (effort) are
 contractible. The equilibrium in this third-best regime may sometimes be
 second best, in which both the physician input and the report of treatment
 are verifiable. Otherwise, truthful reporting forces a third best,
 characterized by provider 'prospective payment' and suboptimal effort,
 while consumers' demand becomes excessive. The authors also analyze how
 'professional ethics' alters the equilibrium. Finally, collusive reporting
 mechanisms imply more stringent constraints, while competition among
 physicians relaxes them.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Role of the Family in Immigrants' Labor-Market Activity: An Evaluation of Alternative Explanations. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 705-27
Issue: 4
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors evaluate some explanations of immigrants' family labor-supply
 behavior. Upon arrival, immigrant husbands work less than natives but
 immigrant wives work more. A conventional labor-supply model uses wage
 assimilation to explain these differences but is not supported by the
 data. More favorable results are obtained for the 'family investment
 model,' in which wives in immigrant families take on 'dead-end' jobs to
 finance their husbands' investments in human capital. The authors conclude
 that family composition is an important correlate of immigrants'
 assimilation and the family investment model can account for many of the
 patterns in the data.	 Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   An Asset Allocation Puzzle. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 181-91
Issue: 1
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper examines popular advice on portfolio allocation among cash,
 bonds, and stocks. It documents that this advice is inconsistent with the
 mutual-fund separation theorem, which states that all investors should
 hold the same composition of risky assets. In contrast to the theorem,
 popular advisors recommend that aggressive investors hold a lower ratio of
 bonds to stocks than conservative investors. The paper explores various
 possible explanations of this puzzle and finds them unsatisfactory.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The International Diversification Puzzle Is Worse Than You Think. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 170-80
Issue: 1
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Despite the growing integration of international financial markets,
 investors do not diversify internationally to any significant extent. The
 authors show that this 'international diversification puzzle' is deepened
 once they consider the implications of nontraded human capital for
 portfolio composition. While growth rates of labor and capital income are
 not highly correlated within countries, the authors find that the returns
 to human capital and physical capital are very highly correlated within
 four OECD countries. Hedging human capital risk therefore involves a
 substantial short position in domestic marketable assets. A diversified
 world portfolio will involve a negative position in domestic marketable
 assets.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Excess Volatility and Closed-End Funds. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 155-69
Issue: 1
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  If investors are rational, the variance of closed-end mutual fund returns
 should equal the variance of the underlying securities in their
 portfolios. In fact, this paper shows that the average closed-end fund's
 monthly return is 64 percent more volatile than its assets. Unlike
 variance-bounds tests, this facilitates an excess volatility test that
 does not rely on strong assumptions about discount rates or dividend
 streams. Although largely idiosyncratic, 15 percent of the average fund's
 excess risk is explained by market risk, small-firm risk, and risk that
 affects other closed-end funds.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Capital-Account Liberalization as a Signal. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 138-54
Issue: 1
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The authors present a model in which a government's current
 capital-control policy signals future policies. Controls on capital
 outflows evolve in response to news on technology, conditional on
 government attitudes toward taxation of capital. When there is uncertainty
 over governmental types, a policy of liberal capital outflows sends a
 favorable signal that may trigger a capital inflow. This prediction is
 consistent with the experience of several countries that have liberalized
 their capital accounts.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Aggregate Employment Dynamics: Building from Microeconomic Evidence. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 115-37
Issue: 1
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper studies quarterly employment flows of approximately 10,000
 U.S. manufacturing establishments. The authors use establishments'
 hours-week to construct measures of the deviation between desired and
 actual employment and use these as the establishments' main state
 variables. The main findings are: (1) microeconomic adjustment functions
 are nonlinear, with plants adjusting disproportionately to large
 shortages; (2) adjustments are often either large or nil, suggesting the
 presence of nonconvexities in the adjustment cost technologies; (3) the
 bulk of average employment fluctuations is accounted for by aggregate,
 rather than reallocation, shocks; and (4) microeconomic nonlinearities
 amplify the impact of large aggregate shocks.	 Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Optimal Inflation Targets, "Conservative" Central Banks, and Linear Inflation Contracts. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 98-114
Issue: 1
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Inflation-targeting regimes (like those of New Zealand, Canada, the
 United Kingdom, and Sweden) are interpreted as having explicit inflation
 targets and implicit employment targets. Without employment persistence,
 an 'inflation-target-conservative' central bank eliminates the inflation
 bias, mimics an optimal inflation contract, and dominates a Rogoff
 'weight-conservative' central bank. With employment persistence, a
 state-contingent inflation bias and a stabilization bias also arise. A
 constant inflation target and a constant inflation contract are still
 equivalent. A state-contingent inflation target combined with a
 weight-conservative central bank can achieve the equilibrium corresponding
 to an optimal rule under commitment.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Measuring the Liquidity Effect. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 80-97
Issue: 1
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper measures the effect on the federal funds rate of an
 open-market operation. The paper deals with simultaneous-equations bias by
 developing a proxy for the errors the Federal Reserve makes in forecasting
 the extent to which Treasury operations will add or drain reserves
 available to private banks. These errors induce fluctuations in bank
 reserves which have measurable consequences for the federal funds rate.
 The paper estimates that a reduction in nonborrowed reserves of $30
 million, if sustained for an entire fourteen-day reserve maintenance
 period, will cause the federal funds rate to rise by ten basis points.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Replicating Ricardian Equivalence Tests with Simulated Series. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 65-79
Issue: 1
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper replicates standard consumption function tests of Ricardian
 equivalence using series generated from a model which nests Ricardian
 equivalence within a non-Ricardian alternative (due to finite horizons
 and/or distortionary taxation). The author shows that the estimates of the
 effects of taxation on consumption are not robust and that standard tests
 may have weaknesses which can lead to conflicting results, whether
 Ricardian equivalence holds or not. The simulations also show that no
 clear conclusions about Ricardian equivalence can be drawn from observing
 a low correlation between the current account and government budget
 deficits.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   True Measures of GDP and Convergence. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 41-64
Issue: 1
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Widely used 'purchasing power parity' comparisons of per capital GDP are
 not true quantity indexes and are subject to systematic substitution bias.
 This bias may distort measurement of convergence and divergence. Extending
 Hal R. Varian's nonparametric construction of a true index gives the set
 of true indexes, including the new Ideal Afriat Index. These indexes are
 utility-consistent and independent of arbitrary reference price vectors.
 The authors establish bounds on the dispersion of true multilateral
 indexes, hence bounds on convergence. International price indexes
 understate both true GDP dispersion and, where prices are converging over
 time, the rate of time quantity convergence.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Macroeconomic Effects of War Finance in the United States: World War II and the Korean War. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 23-40
Issue: 1
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  During World War II, government expenditures were financed primarily by
 issuing debt. During the Korean War, expenditures were financed almost
 exclusively by higher taxes, reflecting President Truman's preference for
 balanced budgets. This paper evaluates quantitatively the economic effects
 of the different policies used to finance these two wars. Counterfactual
 experiments are used to explore the implications of financing World War II
 like the Korean War, and financing the Korean War like World War II. The
 author finds that using a Korean War policy during World War II would have
 resulted in much lower output and welfare relative to the actual policy.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Firm-Specific Assets and the Link between Exchange Rates and Foreign Direct Investment. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 447-65
Issue: 3
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Foreign direct investment (FDI) theory and empirical studies have
 generated mixed support for a link between exchange rates and FDI. This
 paper argues that exchange rate movements may affect acquisition FDI
 because acquisitions involve firm-specific assets which can generate
 returns in currencies other than that used for purchase. Using data on
 Japanese acquisitions in the United States across three-digit SIC
 industries from 1975 to 1992, maximum-likelihood estimates from discrete
 dependent variable models support the hypothesis that real dollar
 depreciations make Japanese acquisitions more likely in U.S. industries,
 particularly those which more likely have firm-specific assets.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Using International and Japanese Regional Data to Determine When the Factor Abundance Theory of Trade Works. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 421-46
Issue: 3
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) model of factor service trade is a
 mainstay of international economics. Empirically, though, it is a flop.
 This warrants a new approach. The authors test the HOV model with
 international and Japanese regional data. The strict HOV model performs
 poorly because it cannot explain the international location of production.
 Restricting the sample to Japanese regions provides no help, inter alia
 giving rise to what Daniel Trefler calls the 'mystery of the missing
 trade.' However, when the authors relax the assumption of universal factor
 price equalization, results improve dramatically. In sum, the HOV model
 performs remarkably well.  Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Issue: 3
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  In trade liberalization between a large country and a small one, if
 production requires irreversible investments, anticipated negotiations may
 make the small country strictly worse off than a fully anticipated trade
 war, and indeed worse off than autarchy. The reason is that investors,
 anticipating liberal trade, will invest in the export sector, making the
 small country dependent on trade with the large one and thus ruining its
 bargaining power. This effect is dominated by conventional effects, so
 that anticipated bargaining benefits the small country on balance, if
 there is sufficient: dissimilarity between the economies and between
 goods.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Month:  June 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors analyze the speed of convergence to a balanced

 capital. They show that such rate depends locally on the technological
 parameters of the model but does not depend on preferences parameters.
 This result stands in sharp contrast with that of the one-sector
 neoclassical growth model, where both preferences and technologies
 determine the speed of convergence to a steady-state growth path.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Technological Progress, Mobility, and Economic Growth. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 363-82
Issue: 3
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes the relationship between technological progress, wage
 inequality, intergenerational earnings mobility, and economic growth. In
 periods of major technological inventions, a decline in the relative
 importance of initial conditions raises inequality, enhances mobility, and
 generates a larger concentration of high-ability individuals in
 technologically advanced sectors, stimulating future technological
 progress and growth. However, once technologies become more accessible,
 mobility is diminished and inequality decreases but becomes more
 persistent. The reduction in the concentration of ability in
 technologically advanced sectors diminishes the likelihood of
 technological breakthroughs and slows future growth. User friendliness,
 therefore, becomes unfriendly to future economic growth.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Long-Run Implications of Investment-Specific Technological Change. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 342-62
Issue: 3
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The role that investment-specific technological change played in
 generating postwar U.S. growth is investigated here. The premise is that
 the introduction of new, more efficient capital goods is an important
 source of productivity change and an attempt is made to disentangle its
 effects from the more traditional Hicks-neutral form of technological
 progress. The balanced growth path for the model is characterized and
 calibrated to U.S. National Income and Product Account data. The
 quantitative analysis suggests that investment-specific technological
 change accounts for the major part of growth.	 Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  This paper presents an experimental examination of a variety of group
 incentive programs. The authors investigate simple revenue sharing and
 more sophisticated, target-based systems such as profit sharing or
 productivity gainsharing, as well as tournament-based and monitoring
 schemes. Their results can be characterized by three facts: (1) history
 matters-how a group performs in one incentive scheme depends on its
 history together under the scheme that preceded it; (2) relative
 performance schemes outperform target-based schemes; and (3) monitoring
 can elicit high effort from workers, but the probability of monitoring
 must be high and, therefore, costly.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Effects of Human Resource Management Practices on Productivity: A Study of Steel Finishing Lines. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 291-313
Issue: 3
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors investigate the productivity effects of innovative employment
 practices using data from a sample of thirty-six homogeneous steel
 production lines owned by seventeen companies. The productivity
 regressions demonstrate that lines using a set of innovative work
 practices, which include incentive pay, teams, flexible job assignments,
 employment security, and training, achieve substantially higher levels of
 productivity than do lines with the more traditional approach, which
 includes narrow job definitions, strict work rules, and hourly pay with
 close supervision. Their results are consistent with recent theoretical
 models which stress the importance of complementarities among work
 practices.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Using Electoral Cycles in Police Hiring to Estimate the Effect of Police on Crime. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 270-90
Issue: 3
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Previous empirical studies have uncovered little evidence that police
 reduce crime, possibly due to simultaneity problems. This paper uses the
 timing of mayoral and gubernatorial elections as an instrument variable to
 identify a causal effect of police on crime. Increases in the size of
 police forces are shown to be disproportionately concentrated in mayoral
 and gubernatorial election years. Increases in police are shown to
 substantially reduce violent crime but have a smaller impact on property
 crime. The null hypothesis that the marginal social benefit of reduced
 crime equals the costs of hiring additional police cannot be rejected.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Equity and Time to Sale in the Real Estate Market. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 255-69
Issue: 3
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Evidence from the Boston condominium market of the early 1990s reveals
 that an owner's equity position determines his experience as a seller. An
 owner of a property with a high loan-to-value ratio sets a higher asking
 price, has a higher expected time on the market and, if he sells, receives
 a higher price than an owner with proportionately less debt. The down
 payment requirement for purchasers, but not incumbent owners, provides a
 simple explanation for this phenomenon among owner-occupants. The results
 provide supporting evidence for equity-based aggregate theories of price-
 volume movements in the housing market.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Political Institutions and Sorting in a Tiebout Model. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 977-92
Issue: 5
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors construct a computational model of Tiebout competition and
 show that political institutions differ in their ability to sort citizens
 effectively. In particular, they find that certain types of
 institutions--those that become more 'politically unstable' as citizen
 heterogeneity increases--perform relatively poorly given a single
 jurisdiction, yet these same institutions perform relatively well when
 there are multiple jurisdictions. The authors provide an explanation for
 this phenomenon which draws upon simulated annealing, a discrete nonlinear
 search algorithm.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Economics of Split-Ticket Voting in Representative Democracies. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 957-76
Issue: 5
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  In U.S. elections, voters often vote for candidates from different
 parties for president and Congress. Voters also express dissatisfaction
 with the performance of Congress as a whole and satisfaction with their
 own representative. The authors develop a model of split-ticket voting in
 which government spending is financed by uniform taxes. The benefits from
 this spending are concentrated. While the model generates split-ticket
 voting, overall spending is too high only if the president's powers are
 limited. Overall spending is too high in a parliamentary system. The
 authors' model can be used as the basis of an argument for term limits.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   A Coalition-Formation Approach to Equilibrium Federations and Trading Blocs. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 940-56
Issue: 5
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors develop a model in which states may choose to form coalitions
 to capture efficiency gains from policy coordination. Joining a coalition
 entails setting the policy variable to maximize the coalition's aggregate
 payoff at a Nash equilibrium against nonmembers and to commit to a
 transfer scheme to share the gains. With two states, the unique
 equilibrium structure is complete federation; with more than two states,
 incomplete federation can be the unique equilibrium. Interpreting this
 result in terms of custom unions, the trend to trading-bloc formation may
 be equilibrium behavior even with cooperation and transfers within customs
 unions.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  In all industrial countries, fiscal policy is increasingly about
 redistribution. In this paper, the authors study redistribution across
 different types of agents in a world characterized by the presence of
 labor unions and distortionary taxation. They show that an increase in
 transfers financed by distortionary taxation has nonlinear effects on unit
 labor costs relative to the other countries, depending on the degree of
 centralization of the wage-setting process in the labor market. The
 authors find considerable empirical support for the model in a sample of
 fourteen OECD countries.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Credibility of Optimal Monetary Delegation. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 911-20
Issue: 5
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  While optimal monetary policy is subject to a credibility problem, it is
 often argued that the government should appoint a central banker whose
 incentives differ from the government's. The author argues, however, that
 such delegation does not overcome credibility problems given that
 delegation is discretionary and without costs. 'Reappointment costs' of
 delegation are shown to improve suboptimal outcomes but credibility of
 optimal monetary policy turns out be worsened. At best, delegation
 therefore has no effects on credibility, but only if reappointment has no
 costs.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Agency Costs, Net Worth, and Business Fluctuations: A Computable General Equilibrium Analysis. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 893-910
Issue: 5
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a computable general equilibrium model in which
 endogenous agency costs can potentially alter business-cycle dynamics. A
 principal conclusion is that the agency-cost model replicates the
 empirical fact that output growth displays positive autocorrelation at
 short horizons. This hump-shaped output behavior arises because households
 delay their investment decisions until agency costs are at their lowest--a
 point in time several periods after the initial shock.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Interactions between the Seasonal and Business Cycles in Production and Inventories. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 884-92
Issue: 5
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper shows that, in several U.S. manufacturing industries, the
 seasonal variability of production and inventories varied with the state
 of the business cycle. The authors present a simple model which implies
 that, if firms reduce the seasonal variability of their production as the
 economy strengthens and they either hold constant or increase the stock of
 inventories they bring into the high-production seasons of the year, then
 they must be facing upward-sloping and convex marginal cost curves. The
 authors conclude that firms in a number of industries face upward-sloping
 and convex marginal-production-cost curves.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  The authors examine the social costs of asymmetric-information-induced

 case study is the Chicago bank panic of June 1932. The authors compare the
 ex ante characteristics of panic failures and panic survivors. Despite
 temporary confusion about bank asset quality on the part of depositors
 during the panic, which was associated with widespread depositor runs and
 bank stock price declines, the panic did not produce significant social
 costs in terms of failures among solvent banks.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Issue: 5
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  When a series of individuals with private information announce public
 predictions, initial conformity can create an 'information cascade' in
 which later predictions match the early announcements. This paper reports
 an experiment in which private signals are draws from an unobserved urn.
 Subjects make predictions in sequence and are paid if they correctly guess
 which of two urns was used for the draws. If initial decisions coincide,
 then it is rational for subsequent decisionmakers to follow the
 established pattern, regardless of their private information. Rational
 cascades formed in most periods in which such an imbalance occurred.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  The authors report the results of voluntary contributions experiments
 where subjects are randomly assigned different rates of return from their
 private consumption. These random assignments are changed round to round,
 enabling the measurement of individual player contribution rates as a
 function of that player's investment cost. The authors directly test these
 response functions for the presence of warm-glow and/or altruism effects.
 They find significant evidence for heterogeneous warm-glow effects that
 are, on average, low in magnitude. The authors statistically reject the
 presence of an altruism effect.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Exchange Economies and Loss Exposure: Experiments Exploring Prospect Theory and Competitive Equilibria in Market Environments. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 801-28
Issue: 5
Volume: 87
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Exchange economies were created in which individuals faced losses. If
 people are risk seeking in the losses, as predicted by prospect theory,
 then due to the nonconvexity, the competitive equilibria are all on the
 boundaries of the Edgeworth box. The experimental results are that
 risk-seeking behavior is observed in many people and appears in markets as
 predicted. In addition, market behavior is consistent with answers to
 hypothetical questionnaires. Contrary to prospect theory, risk seeking
 seems to diminish with experience: preferences in the market setting are
 not labile; and risk-seeking preferences are not simply a result of
 framing effects.   Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association.
