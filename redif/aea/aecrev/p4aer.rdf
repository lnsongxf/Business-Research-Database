Title:   The Politics of Free-Trade Agreements. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 667-90
Issue: 4
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Suppose that an opportunity arises for two countries to negotiate a
 free-trade agreement. Will a free-trade agreement between these countries
 be politically viable and, if so, what form will it take? The authors
 address these questions using a political-economy framework that
 emphasizes the interaction between industry special-interest groups and an
 incumbent government. They describe the economic conditions necessary for
 a free-trade agreement to be an equilibrium outcome, both for the case
 when the agreement must cover all bilateral trade and for the case when a
 few politically sensitive sectors can be excluded from the agreements.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Occasional Interventions to Target Rates. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 691-715
Issue: 4
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a model of central-bank intervention based upon a
 policy characteristic of foreign-exchange interventions by the United
 States, Germany, and Japan in the late 1980s and evaluates it empirically.
 Central bankers intervene with greater intensity as rates deviate from
 target levels but they also try to stabilize rates around current levels.
 The model is estimated using exchange rates and data based upon observed
 central-bank interventions. Interestingly, the estimates of the model are
 consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model for both the
 deutsche-mark/dollar rate and, less strongly, for the yen/dollar rate.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Trade and Transboundary Pollution. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 716-37
Issue: 4
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper examines how national income and trading opportunities
 interact to determine the level and incidence of world pollution. The
 authors find that free trade raises world pollution if incomes differ
 substantially across countries; if trade equalizes factor prices,
 human-capital-abundant countries lose from trade, while
 human-capital-scarce countries gain; international trade in pollution
 permits can lower world pollution even when governments' supply of permits
 is unrestricted; international income transfers may not affect world
 pollution or welfare; and attempts to manipulate the terms of trade with
 pollution policy leave world pollution unaffected.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Transition Problems in Economic Reform: Agriculture in the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 738-54
Issue: 4
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  How fast should Mexican agriculture be incorporated into the North
 American Free Trade Agreement? The authors focus on the implications for
 policy design of the absence of efficient capital markets on the welfare
 costs of reforming gradually, on incentive problems created by trade
 adjustment policies, and on the redistributive aspects of policy
 reform--all transitional problems that arise in most economic reforms. A
 key consideration is that adjustment should focus on increasing the value
 of the assets owned by the groups affected and not on direct income
 transfers or programs targeted on characteristics controlled by the
 beneficiaries.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Closing the Technology Gap under Protection. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 755-70
Issue: 4
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper explores the linkage between protection and the speed with
 which a protected firm adopts new technology. Of primary importance here
 is the distinction between permanent and temporary protection on the one
 hand, and between tariffs and quotas on the other. The authors find that a
 permanent tariff speeds up adoption but a permanent quota delays adoption
 unless the quota is highly restrictive. However, temporary protection
 (i.e., protection that remains effective until the firm adopts new
 technology) always delays the timing of technology adoption.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Design Innovation and Fashion Cycles. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 771-92
Issue: 4
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A model of fashion cycles is developed in which designs are used as a
 signaling device in a 'dating game.' A monopolist periodically creates a
 new design. Over time the price of the design falls as it spreads across
 the population. Once sufficiently many consumers own the design it is
 profitable to create a new design and thereby render the old design
 obsolete. This paper gives conditions under which all consumers would be
 better-off by banning the use of fashion. Competition among designers may
 lead to less frequent changes in fashion and to higher prices than
 monopoly.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Dalton-Improving Indirect Tax Reform. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 793-807
Issue: 4
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A tax reform is 'Dalton-improving' if it improves social welfare for all
 possible social-welfare functions that conform to Hugh Dalton's principle
 of transfers. According to this principle, there exists a prior social
 ranking of households and a transfer is approved if it it distributes from
 high-ranking ('rich') to low-ranking ('poor') households, without altering
 the ranking itself. In this paper, the authors develop a procedure for
 identifying marginal Dalton-improving reforms in the context of indirect
 taxation. The methodology is illustrated using data on excise taxes in the
 United Kingdom.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Appropriation and Efficiency: A Revision of the First Theorem of Welfare Economics. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 808-27
Issue: 4
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The first theorem of welfare economics rests on the assumption that
 individuals have neither price-making nor market-making capacities. The
 authors offer a revision in which individuals have such capacities. The
 revision emphasizes two keys for market efficiency: the need to align
 private rewards with social contributions--called full appropriation--and
 the need for an assumption to counter the possibility of coordination
 failures in the choice of produced commodities--called noncomplementarity.
 The authors also emphasize that information about prices of unmarketed
 commodities involves decentralized knowledge available only to product
 innovators and that pecuniary externalities are important potential
 sources of market failure.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   War Politics: An Economic, Rational-Voter Framework. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 828-46
Issue: 4
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The frequency of foreign conflict initiations in the United States is
 found to be significantly greater following the onset of recessions during
 a president's first term than in other periods. The authors develop an
 economic theory of the political use of wars which links the election
 cycle, war decisions, and economic performance consistent with the
 observed relationships among these events. An incumbent leader with an
 unfavorable economic performance record may initiate a war to force the
 learning of his war leadership abilities and thus salvage, with some
 probability, his reelection. This obtains despite voter rationality and
 informational symmetry.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Credible Privatization. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 847-59
Issue: 4
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Privatization shifts residual income and control to private investors,
 restricting redistribution and improving incentives; thus rapid
 privatization should be desirable. Empirically, however, the transfer of
 ownership, as opposed to control, is very gradual. The author offers an
 explanation based on investors' concerns about future interference. A
 government averse to redistribution retains a passive stake in the firm;
 the willingness to bear residual risk signals commitment. When a large
 government stake conflicts with the transfer of control, underpricing may
 be necessary for separation. Finally, when the required discount is large,
 a committed government may prefer not to signal, gaining credibility over
 time.	 Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors review and provide motivation for a one-sector model of
 economic growth in which decisions about capital accumulation are made by
 a political process. If it is possible to commit for at least three
 periods into the future, then, for any feasible consumption plan, there is
 a perturbation that is majority-preferred to it. Furthermore, plans that
 minimize the maximum vote that can be obtained against them yield a
 political business cycle. If it is impossible to commit, voters select the
 optimal consumption plan for the median voter.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Digging for Golden Carrots: An Analysis of Research Tournaments. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 872-90
Issue: 4
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Contracting for research is often infeasible because research inputs are
 unobservable and research outcomes cannot be verified by a court.
 Sponsoring a research tournament can resolve these problems. A model is
 presented in which contestants compete to find the innovation of highest
 value to the tournament sponsor. The winner receives a prespecified prize.
 The tournament game has a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium. Free entry
 is not optimal because equilibrium effort by each researcher decreases in
 the number of contestants. An optimally designed research tournament
 balances the probability of overshooting the first-best quality level
 against the probability of falling short.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Cooperation in Public-Goods Experiments: Kindness or Confusion? 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 891-904
Issue: 4
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The persistence of cooperation in public-goods experiments has become an
 important puzzle for economists. This paper presents the first systematic
 attempt to separate the hypothesis that cooperation is due to kindness,
 altruism, or warm-glow from the hypothesis that cooperation is simply the
 result of errors or confusion. The experiment reveals that, on average,
 about half of all cooperation comes from subjects who understand
 free-riding but choose to cooperate out of some form of kindness. This
 suggests that the focus on errors and 'learning' in experimental research
 should shift to include studies of preferences for cooperation as well.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   An Experimental Investigation of the Seller Incentives in the EPA's Emission Trading Auction. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 905-22
Issue: 4
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to conduct annual auctions of emission
 allowances. Under the discriminative auction rules, sellers with the
 lowest asking prices receive the highest bids. This paper studies an
 inverted version of this auction in which buyers face the same incentives
 as sellers in the EPA auction. Consistent with theoretical predictions,
 buyers bid above their valuation, auction outcomes are inefficient, and
 increasing the number of buyers increases bids. Buyers facing human
 opponents compete more aggressively than the risk-neutral prediction but
 bids do not differ systematically from this prediction when buyers face
 computerized Nash 'robots.'   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   A Natural Experiment in "Jeopardy!". 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 240-53
Issue: 1
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper uses the television game show 'Jeopardy!' as a natural
 experiment to analyze behavior under uncertainty and the ability of
 players to choose strategic best-responses. The results suggest that,
 while most players bet in a rational manner, the failure rate for choosing
 best-responses increases as the betting problem grows more complex and
 that players' choices are affected by the 'frame' of the problem. However,
 suboptimal betting tends to decrease as inferior players are driven from
 the game. The data also allow for estimation of the extent of risk
 aversion; the results imply near risk-neutrality.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Monetary Policy Trade-offs and the Correlation between Nominal Interest Rates and Real Output. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 219-39
Issue: 1
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The authors present a structural model of the U.S. economy that combines
 their price-contracting specification with a term-structure relationship,
 an aggregate demand curve, and a monetary-policy reaction function. The
 model matches important features of postwar data well and provides a
 structural explanation of the correlation between real output and the
 short-term nominal rate of interest. The authors perform a battery of
 monetary-policy experiments that show that, as viewed through the lens of
 this model, monetary policy has struck a good balance recently among
 competing monetary-policy objectives.	 Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Exchange Rates and Fundamentals: Evidence on Long-Horizon Predictability. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 201-18
Issue: 1
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Regressions of multiple-period changes in the log exchange rate on the
 deviation of the log exchange rate from its 'fundamental value' display
 evidence that long-horizon changes in log nominal exchange rates contain
 an economically significant predictable component. To account for
 small-sample bias and size distortion in asymptotic tests, inference is
 drawn from bootstrap distributions generated under the null hypothesis
 that the log exchange rate is unpredictable. The bias-adjusted slope
 coefficients and R[superscript]2's increase with the forecast horizon, and
 the out-of-sample point predictions generally outperform the driftless
 random walk at the longer horizons.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Union Contracts and the Life-Cycle/Permanent-Income Hypothesis. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 186-200
Issue: 1
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper isolates households in the PSID whose heads can be matched to
 particular long-term union contracts with high confidence. The author uses
 use published information on these contracts to construct a
 household-specific measure of expected wage growth. He finds that
 predictable wage movements are significantly correlated with consumption
 changes, contrary to neoclassical consumption theory. The author finds
 that consumption responds more strongly to predictable income declines
 than to predictable income increases. This asymmetry is inconsistent with
 liquidity constraints and myopia but is qualitatively consistent with
 models in which preferences exhibit loss aversion.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Tastes and Technology in a Two-Country Model of the Business Cycle: Explaining International Comovements. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 168-85
Issue: 1
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Trade on international financial markets allows people to insure
 country-specific risk and smooth consumption intertemporally. Equilibrium
 models of business cycles with trade on global financial markets typically
 yield international consumption correlations near one and excessive
 volatility of investment. The authors incorporate nontraded goods in the
 model and find that the implications for aggregate consumption,
 investment, and the trade balance are consistent with business-cycle
 properties of industrialized countries. However, the model driven by
 technology shocks alone yields counterfactual implications for comovements

Title:   Optimal Contracts for Central Bankers. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 150-67
Issue: 1
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper adopts a principal-agent framework to determine how a central
 banker's incentives should be structured to induce the socially optimal
 policy. In contrast to previous findings using ad hoc targeting rules, the
 inflation bias of discretionary policy is eliminated and an optimal
 response to shocks is achieved by the optimal incentive contract, even in
 the presence of private central-bank information. In the one-period model
 that has formed the basis for much of the literature on discretionary
 monetary policy, it is shown that the optimal contract ties the rewards of
 the central banker to realized inflation.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Transition from Barter to Fiat Money. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 134-49
Issue: 1
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  How did it become possible to exchange apparently valueless pieces of
 paper for goods? This paper provides an equilibrium account of the
 transition between barter and fiat-money regimes. The explanation relies
 on the intervention of a self-interested government that must be able to
 promise credibly to limit the issue of money. To achieve credibility, the
 government must offset the benefits of seigniorage by internalizing some
 of the macroeconomic externalities generated by the issue of fiat money.
 The government's patience and the extent of its involvement in the economy
 are key determinants of whether the transition can be accomplished.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Early Development. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 116-33
Issue: 1
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Long-term economic development involves four fundamental processes: the
 exploitation of increasing returns to specialization, the transition from
 household to market production, knowledge and human-capital accumulation,
 and industrialization. This paper integrates these processes into a
 coherent framework for thinking about economic history. Preindustrial
 development is driven by increasing returns to specialization made
 possible by a growing population. Increasing specialization eventually
 activates a learning technology and initiates industrial growth, which
 carries the economy to a fully market-based balanced-growth path. Among
 other things, the authors attribute a role to population and market size
 that is consistent with the evidence.	 Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Capital Mobility in Neoclassical Models of Growth. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 103-15
Issue: 1
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The neoclassical growth model accords with empirical evidence on
 convergence if capital is viewed broadly to include human investments, so
 that diminishing returns to capital set in slowly, and if differences in
 government policies or other variables create substantial differences in
 steady-state positions. However, open-economy versions of the theory
 predict higher rates of convergence than those observed empirically. The
 authors show that the open-economy model conforms with the evidence if an
 economy can borrow to finance only a portion of its capital, for example,
 if human capital must be financed by domestic savings.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Cartel Quotas under Majority Rule. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 82-102
Issue: 1
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The authors examine the choice of quotas by legal volume-restricting
 organizations: cartels, commodity agreements, agricultural marketing
 boards, and prorationing boards. Unlike their illegal counterparts, legal
 cartels have published regulations and broader enforcement capabilities.
 However, differences in costs and size among cartel members still make
 quota selection contentious. Conflicts over quotas are typically resolved
 by voting. Side-payments to influence votes are prohibited. The authors
 examine the predicted effects of this real-world voting institution on
 prices and welfare. They also deduce the economic consequences of
 exogenous political changes, such as alterations in the voting weights or
 in the identity of the voters.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   On the Evolution of Altruistic Ethical Rules for Siblings. 
Journal: American Economic Review

Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper explores the evolutionary foundations of altruism among
 siblings and extends the biologists' kin-selection theory to a richer
 class of games between relatives. It shows that a population will resist
 invasion by dominant mutant genes if individuals maximize a 'semi-Kantian'
 utility function in games with their siblings. It is shown that a
 population that resists invasion by dominant mutants may be invaded by
 recessive mutants. Conditions are found under which a population resists
 invasion by dominant and also by recessive mutants.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 46-57
Issue: 1
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper shows that altruism provides an efficiency rationale for
 public provision of insurance to the poor. The framework is one in which
 there are rich altruists and risk-averse poor who face some possibility of
 loss. The government represents the rich and makes transfers on their
 behalf. With unconditional transfers, the poor may forgo insurance and
 rely on private charity to bail them out in the event of loss. This
 reliance on private charity has adverse efficiency effects. These may be
 avoided if the government makes in-kind transfers of insurance.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Incumbent Behavior: Vote-Seeking, Tax-Setting, and Yardstick Competition. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 25-45
Issue: 1
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a model of the political economy of tax-setting in a
 multijurisdictional world where voters' choices and incumbent behavior are
 determined simultaneously. Voters are assumed to make comparisons between
 jurisdictions to overcome political agency problems. This forces
 incumbents into a (yardstick) competition in which they care about what
 other incumbents are doing. The authors provide a theoretical framework
 and empirical evidence using U.S. state data from 1960 to 1988. The
 results are encouraging to the view that vote-seeking and tax-setting are
 tied together through the nexus of yardstick competition.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 567-85
Issue: 3
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors argue that long-term debt has a role in controlling
 management's ability to finance future investments. Companies with high
 (widely held) debt will find it hard to raise capital, since new
 security-holders will have low priority relative to existing creditors;
 conversely for companies with low debt. The authors show that there is an
 optimal debt-equity ratio and mix of senior and junior debt if management
 undertakes unprofitable as well as profitable investments. They derive
 conditions under which equity and a single class of senior long-term debt
 work as well as more complex contracts for controlling investment
 behavior.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  This paper examines the effect of existing college scholarship rules on

 for college scholarships face 'education tax rates' on capital income of
 between 22 percent and 47 percent in addition to regular federal and state
 income taxes. The empirical analysis developed here, based on the 1986
 Survey of Consumer Finances, implies that these high tax rates have a
 powerful adverse effect on the accumulation of financial assets.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   A Tax-Based Test of the Dividend Signaling Hypothesis. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 532-51
Issue: 3
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors propose and implement a new test of the dividend signaling
 hypothesis. Dividend signaling models generally imply that an increase in
 dividend taxation should increase the share price response per dollar of
 dividends (or 'bang-for-the-buck'). Many other dividend-preference
 theories have the opposite implication. An analysis of recent variations
 in tax policy reveals a strong positive relation between dividend tax
 rates and the bang-for-the-buck. Additional evidence on the relation
 between the bang-for-the-buck and other variables that are related to the
 marginal cost of paying dividends provides further support for dividend
 signaling.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 512-31
Issue: 3
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper presents an aggregate demand-driven model of business cycles
 that provides a new explanation for the procyclicality of productivity and
 simultaneously predicts large welfare losses from monetary nonneutrality.
 The key features of the model are an input-output production structure;
 imperfect competition; countercyclical markups; and, for some results,
 state-dependent price rigidity. True technical efficiency is procyclical
 even though production takes place with constant returns, without
 technology shocks or technological externalities. The paper has observable
 implications that distinguish it empirically from related work. These
 implications are generally supported by data from U.S. manufacturing
 industries.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Output Dynamics in Real-Business-Cycle Models. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 492-511
Issue: 3
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The time-series literature reports two stylized facts about output
 dynamics in the United States: GNP growth is positively autocorrelated and
 GNP appears to have an important trend-reverting component. This paper
 investigates whether current real-business-cycle models are consistent
 with these stylized facts. Many real-business-cycle models have weak
 internal propagation mechanisms and must rely on external sources of
 dynamics to replicate both facts. Models that incorporate labor adjustment
 costs are partially successful. They endogenously generate positive
 autocorrelation in output growth but they need implausibly large
 transitory shocks to match the trend-reverting component in output.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  This paper studies a laboratory economy with some of the prominent
 features of an international economic system. The patterns of trade and
 output predicted by the law of comparative advantage are observed evolving
 within the experimental markets. Market prices and quantities move in the
 direction of the competitive equilibrium but the quantitative predictions
 of the (risk-neutral) competitive equilibrium are rejected. Considerable
 amounts of economic activity occur as disequilibria. Factor-price
 equalization is observed but there is a universal tendency for factors of
 production to trade at prices below their marginal products.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

 wealth losses that are ten million dollars larger than the wealth gains of
 plaintiffs. Financial distress, behavioral constraints, and follow-on
 suits are sources of wealth leakage and influence settlement behavior.
 Since the threat of a monetary transfer has little power to explain either
 wealth effects or the likelihood of settlement, the central concern of
 defendants may be the potential prohibition of profitable business
 practices.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Capital Structure and Product-Market Competition: Empirical Evidence from the Supermarket Industry. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 415-35
Issue: 3
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper establishes an empirical link between firm capital structure
 and product-market competition using data from local supermarket
 competition. First, an event-study analysis of supermarket leveraged
 buyouts (LBOs) suggests that a LBO announcement increases the market value
 of the LBO chain's local rivals. Second, the author shows that supermarket
 chains were more likely to enter and expand in a local market if a large
 share of the incumbent firms in the local market undertook LBOs. The study
 suggests that leverage increases in the late 1980s led to softer
 product-market competition in this industry.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Productivity Effects of Employee Stock-Ownership Plans and Bonuses: Evidence from Japanese Panel Data. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 391-414
Issue: 3
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors report the first results for Japanese firms on the effects of
 employee stock-ownership plans (ESOPs) and bonuses by estimating
 production functions using new panel data. They find that the introduction
 of an ESOP will lead to a 4-5 percent increase in productivity; this
 productivity payoff takes three to four years. There is a modest
 productivity gain from the bonus system. The authors also find evidence
 that the productivity effect of bonuses is enhanced by the existence of
 ESOPs, suggesting that ESOPs may create a climate conducive to
 profit-sharing by enhancing long-term commitment and peer monitoring.	 Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Ethnicity, Neighborhoods, and Human-Capital Externalities. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 365-90
Issue: 3
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The socioeconomic performance of today's workers depends not only on
 parental skills but also on the average skills of the ethnic group in the
 parents' generation (or ethnic capital). This paper investigates the link
 between the ethnic externality and ethnic neighborhoods. The evidence
 indicates that residential segregation and the external effect of
 ethnicity are linked, partly because ethnic capital summarizes the
 socioeconomic background of the neighborhood where the children were
 raised. Ethnicity has an external effect, even among persons who grow up
 in the same neighborhood, when children are exposed frequently to persons
 who share the same ethnic background.	 Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Does Head Start Make a Difference? 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 341-64
Issue: 3
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The impact of participation in Head Start is investigated using a
 national sample of children. Comparisons are drawn between siblings to
 control for selection. Head Start is associated with large and significant
 gains in test scores among both whites and African-Americans. However,
 among African-Americans, these gains are quickly lost. Head Start
 significantly reduces the probability that a white child will repeat a
 grade but it has no effect on grade repetition among African-American
 children. Both whites and African-Americans who attend Head Start, or
 other preschools, gain greater access to preventive health services.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Workers' Compensation and Injury Duration: Evidence from a Natural Experiment. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 322-40
Issue: 3
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the effect of workers' compensation on time out of
 work. It introduces a 'natural experiment' approach of comparing
 individuals injured before and after increases in the maximum weekly
 benefit amount. The increases examined in Kentucky and Michigan raised the
 benefit amount for high-earnings individuals by approximately 50 percent,
 while low-earnings individuals, who were unaffected by the benefit
 maximum, did not experience a change in their incentives. Time out of work
 increased for those eligible for the higher benefits and remained
 unchanged for those whose benefits were constant. The estimated duration
 elasticities are clustered around 0.3-0.4.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  More than three hundred paired audits at new-car dealerships reveal that
 dealers quoted significantly lower prices to white males than to black or
 female test buyers using identical, scripted bargaining strategies.
 Ancillary evidence suggests that the dealerships' disparate treatment of
 women and blacks may be caused by dealers' statistical inferences about
 consumers' reservation prices, but the data do not strongly support any
 single theory of discrimination.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Rationalizing Child-Support Decisions. 
Journal: American Economic Review

Issue: 5
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors provide a framework within which the child-support compliance
 decisions of noncustodial fathers and the child-support awards set by
 institutional agents can be coherently interpreted. The model of
 child-support transfers is able to capture qualitatively the features of
 the monthly payment distribution. Estimated parental-decision rules are
 used to infer the implicit weights given by institutional agents to the
 postdivorce welfare of parents and children. The authors find that the
 weight attached to the combined welfare of the custodial mother and child
 is significantly less than the weight given to the father's welfare in
 most sample cases.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   On the Optimal Structure of Local Governments. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1224-40
Issue: 5
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors show that space matters in designing the optimal provision of
 local public goods. Geography imposes a particular institutional structure
 of local governments due to the overlapping of market areas associated
 with different local public goods. The optimum can be decentralized
 through local governments that have jurisdiction over market areas of all
 local public good types. This implies that the appropriate suppliers of
 local public goods are metropolitan governments which finance them through
 user charges and land rent. In addition, the authors' approach invalidates
 the prevailing theory of fiscal federalism, according to which a layer of
 government should be established for each type of local public good.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Product Safety: Liability, R&D, and Signaling. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1187-1206
Issue: 5
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors develop a monopoly model of product design and safety
 signaling incorporating a parametric liability specification. The firm
 first engages in R&D to affect the safety of its product. Since the
 outcome of R&D trials is unobservable to consumers, the firm then chooses
 its price, understanding that consumers may draw inferences from the price
 about the product's safety. Consumers acquire and use the product;
 injuries lead to losses which are allocated by the liability system. The
 authors vary the liability system's allocation of losses and trace out the
 implications for R&D investment and the price-safety relationship.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   How Liable Should a Lender Be? The Case of Judgment-Proof Firms and Environmental Risk. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1171-86
Issue: 5
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Recently, U.S. environmental law has shown a tendency toward increased
 lender liability. A model of a potentially judgment-proof owner of a firm,
 a lender, and a potential victim is developed in which this policy can
 increase accident frequency and reduce efficiency. Full, partial, and zero
 lender-liability rules and a minimum equity requirement are analyzed.
 Partial lender liability and an equivalent minimum equity requirement
 deliver the highest level of efficiency, although the former can deliver a
 higher contribution by the lender to the victim than the latter. Policy
 and empirical implications are also discussed.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   When Are Agents Negligible? 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1160-70
Issue: 5
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors examine the following paradox: in a dynamic setting,
 equilibria can be radically different in a model with a finite number of
 agents than in a model with a continuum of agents. They present a simple
 strategic setting in which this paradox is a general phenomenon. However,
 the paradox disappears when there is noisy observation of the players'
 actions and the aggregate level of noise does not disappear too rapidly as
 the number of players increases. The authors give several economic
 examples in which this paradox has recently received attention:
 durable-goods monopoly, corporate takeovers, and time consistency of
 optimal government policy.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   On Fully Revealing Prices When Markets Are Incomplete. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1152-59
Issue: 5
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors investigate the structure of preferences and uncertainty that
 guarantees that prices are fully revealing even though asset markets are
 incomplete and there are more sources of uncertainty than assets in the
 economy. A sufficient condition for fully revealing prices is that
 investors have preferences of the (possibly state-dependent)
 linear-risk-tolerance class. Finally, the authors discuss how their result
 allows one to extend certain existing literature on demand aggregation,
 welfare analysis, and the pricing of contingent claims to the case in
 which markets are incomplete and investors have asymmetric private
 information.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Cross-Country Evidence on the Link between Volatility and Growth. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1138-51
Issue: 5
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper presents empirical evidence against the standard dichotomy in
 macroeconomics that separates growth from the volatility of economic
 fluctuations. In a sample of ninety-two countries as well as a sample of
 OECD countries, the authors find that countries with higher volatility
 have lower growth. The addition of standard control variables strengthens
 the negative relationship. The authors also find that government
 spending-induced volatility is negatively associated with growth even
 after controlling for both time- and country-fixed effects.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Consumption over the Life Cycle and over the Business Cycle. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1118-37
Issue: 5
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors assess the empirical validity of the life-cycle model using a
 time series of cross sections and a novel parametrization of preferences.
 The main findings are as follows: the excess sensitivity of consumption
 growth to labor income disappears when the authors control for demographic
 variables; the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) is a
 function of several variables, including the level of consumption, and the
 EIS increases with the level of consumption; and the variables that change
 the EIS are also important in explaining excess sensitivity over the
 business cycle. The authors are able to reconcile their results with those
 in the macro and micro literature.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Corporate-Debt Overhang and Macroeconomic Expectations. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1106-17
Issue: 5
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  One way in which corporate financial structure affects macroeconomic
 performance is by creating debt overhang. Debt overhang occurs when
 existing debt deters new investment because the benefits from new
 investment will go to the existing creditors, not to the new investors. If
 the economy is booming, debt overhang will not bind because the returns to
 investing are high. If the economy is stagnant, debt overhang will bind
 because the returns to investing are low. As a result, high levels of debt
 can create multiple expectational equilibria in which 'animal spirits'
 determine economy activity.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Momentum Investment Strategies, Portfolio Performance, and Herding: A Study of Mutual Fund Behavior. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1088-1105
Issue: 5
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This study analyzes the extent to which mutual funds purchase stocks
 based on their past returns as well as their tendency to exhibit 'herding'
 behavior (i.e., buying and selling the same stocks at the same time). The
 authors find that 77 percent of the mutual funds were 'momentum
 investors,' buying stocks that were past winners; however, most did not
 systematically sell past losers. On average, funds that invested on
 momentum realized significantly better performance than other funds. The
 authors also find relatively weak evidence that funds tended to buy and
 sell the same stocks at the same time.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Economic Returns to Schooling in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1065-87
Issue: 5
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The author uses micro data from the Labor Force Surveys conducted in the
 West Bank and the Gaza Strip during 1981-91 to show that during 1981-87
 wage differences between schooling groups fell by well over one-half. This
 sharp reduction is associated with large increases in the size of the
 educated Palestinian labor force. Since the returns to schooling for
 Israeli Jews were stable, the decline in returns to schooling for
 Palestinians is consistent with the notion that the returns to schooling
 in the territories were determined largely by the forces of supply and
 demand in a segmented market for skilled labor.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Tying Trade Flows: A Theory of Countertrade with Evidence. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1047-64
Issue: 5
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  A countertrade contract ties an export to an import. Usually,
 countertrade is criticized as a form of bilateralism and reciprocity and,
 thus, as an inefficient form of international exchange. In this paper, the
 authors argue that there are circumstances in which the tying of two
 technologically unrelated trade flows may be efficiency-enhancing. They
 show that countertrade can be an efficient institution in international
 trade that solves moral-hazard problems and restores creditworthiness of
 highly indebted countries. The authors test the implications of their
 model using a sample of 230 countertrade contracts.   Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Case of the Missing Trade and Other Mysteries. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1029-46
Issue: 5
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) theorem, which predicts that countries
 will export products that are made from factors in great supply, performs
 poorly. However, deviations from HOV follow pronounced patterns. Trade is
 missing relative to its HOV prediction. Also, rich countries appear scarce
 in most factors and poor countries appear abundant in all factors, a fact
 that squares poorly with the HOV prediction that abundant factors are
 exported. As suggested by the patterns, HOV is rejected empirically in
 favor of a modification that allows for home bias in consumption and
 international technology differences.	 Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Design of Reform Packages under Uncertainty. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1207-23
Issue: 5
Volume: 85
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors present a model of large-scale economic reforms, modeled on
 the transition process in Eastern Europe, with aggregate and individual
 uncertainty concerning the outcome of reforms. The government is assumed
 to choose the speed and sequencing of reforms. The authors compare
 big-bang strategies with gradualist reform packages. They show that
 gradualist reform packages may be easier to get started, optimal
 sequencing of reforms should aim at creating constituencies for further
 reforms, and gradualism may generate a higher investment response because
 of a lower option value of waiting than would a big-bang approach.  Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.
