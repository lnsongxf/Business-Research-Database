Using cross-sectional data on climate, farmland prices, and other economic and geophysical data for almost 3,000 counties in the United States, they find that higher temperatures in all seasons except autumn reduce average farm values, while more precipitation outside of autumn increases farm values. Applying the model to a global-warming scenario shows a significantly lower estimated impact of global warming on U.S. agriculture than the traditional production-function approach and, in one case, suggests that, even without carbon dioxide fertilization, global warming may have economic benefits for agriculture.

To evaluate the impact of the law, the authors surveyed 410 fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania before and after the rise. Comparisons of employment growth at stores in New Jersey and Pennsylvania (where the minimum wage was constant) provide simple estimates of the effect of the higher minimum wage. The authors also compare employment changes at stores in New Jersey that were initially paying high wages (above $5.00) to the changes at lower-wage stores. They find no indication that the rise in the minimum wage reduced employment.

The estimated effect of permanent change is substantially smaller than the effect of transitory change. The difference is even larger than differences between estimates from past micro data studies, which have primarily measured the transitory effect, and time-series studies, which have primarily measured the permanent effect. The authors' results resolve a long-standing conflict between micro data and time-series studies of how marginal tax rates affect capital-gains realizations behavior.

A Study of the U.S. Experience with Universal Banking before 1933. Journal: American Economic ReviewPages: 810-32Issue: 4Volume: 84Year: 1994Month:  September Abstract:  The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 removed commercial banks from the securities underwriting business. The authors evaluate the argument for the separation of commercial and investment banking that conflicts of interest induce commercial banks to fool the public into investing in securities which turn out to be of low quality. A comparison of the performance of securities underwritten by commercial and investment banks prior to the act shows no evidence of this. Instead, the public appears to have rationally accounted for the possibility of conflicts of interest and this appears to have constrained the banks to underwrite high-quality securities.

The interest groups bid for protection with their campaign support. Politicians maximize their own welfare, which depends on total contributions collected and on the welfare of voters. The authors study the structure of protection that emerges in the political equilibrium and the contributions by different lobbies that support the policy outcome. They also discuss why the lobbies may in some cases prefer to have the government use trade policy to transfer income, rather than more efficient means.

Two regions with identical technologies, endowments, and preferences will trade if one, the South, has ill-defined property rights on environmental resources. Trade with a region with well-defined property rights transmits and enlarges the problem of the commons: the North overconsumes underpriced resource-intensive products imported from the South. This occurs even though trade equalizes all prices, of goods and factors, worldwide. Taxing the use of resources in the South is unreliable as it can lead to more overextraction. Property-rights policies may be more effective.

In the received theory of market structure, based largely on inflexible techniques of production, a number of well-known forces work to limit concentration. In the authors' model, none of these forces exists. Hence, they conclude that flexible manufacturing promotes concentration through preemption and mergers, or equivalently through cartels. Interestingly, the concentrated market structures associated with flexibility may or may not be welfare-dominated by a regime in which monopolization is not allowed.

Decisions of this type include land-redevelopment decisions where the density of residential or commercial development is a choice variable as well as capital-replacement decisions where capacity is variable. The authors provide a general yet simple formation of the problem using an optimal-stopping framework. They characterize the value of the project, the timing of investment, and the intensity of development. The authors show that intensity interacts in important ways with timing, taxes, and project values. The ability to vary intensity raises hurdle rents and delays development decisions.

The distribution of koyck lag or AR(1) coefficients across agents in an economy is shown to be completely identified just from the dynamic behavior of aggregate (macroeconomic) data. Aggregate testable implications of an economy composed of agents having koyck lags or AR(1) models are provided. Extensions to higher-order and time-varying lags are discussed. Aggregate U.S. consumption data are shown to support the hypothesis that some consumers have random-walk consumption, while the rest have ARIMA (1, 1, 0) consumption with widely varying AR coefficients.

When prices become volatile, shocks to liquidity and fundamentals may occur between the time investors decide to trade and the time their orders are executed. This gives rise to implementation risk that cannot be transferred with contingent claims. The authors show that price limits partially insure implementation risk. When price fluctuations are driven by news about fundamentals, judiciously chosen price limits can be (ex ante) Pareto superior to unconstrained trade. When liquidity shocks are large, price limits benefit hedgers but harm some speculators.

The authors show that once the participation decision is endogenized, market properties change dramatically. First, limited market participation can amplify the effect of liquidity trading relative to full participation; under certain circumstances, an arbitrarily small aggregate liquidity shock can cause significant price volatility. Second, there exist multiple equilibria with very different participation regimes and levels of asset-price volatility. Third, under plausible conditions the equilibria can be Pareto-ranked; the Pareto-preferred equilibrium is characterized by greater participation and lower volatility.

Standard-setters maximize their conception of social welfare, knowing that utility-maximizing students choose whether to meet the standard. The author shows that more egalitarian policymakers set lower standards, the median voter would prefer higher standards (under symmetric distributions), and decentralization lowers standards (among identical communities). Optimal standards do not necessarily fall with increased student preference for leisure, deterioration of nonstudent inputs to education, or increased student heterogeneity. Superseding binary credentials by perfect information increases average achievement and social welfare for plausible degrees of heterogeneity, egalitarianism, and pooling under decentralization.

The difficulties these markets have experienced in coordinating the timing of transactions have been decisive in determining how they are organized today. The paper develops a framework in which to address the timing of transactions and the tendency observed in many of these markets for transactions to become earlier and earlier.

In contrast to well-known results for market goods with close substitutes (i.e., candy bars and coffee mugs), the authors' results indicate a convergence of willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-accept measures of value. However, for a nonmarket good with imperfect substitutes (i.e., reduced health risk), the divergence of willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-accept value measures is persistent, even with repeated market participation and full information on the nature of the good.

The results indicate that taxes distort labor-market activities away from the regular sector to the underground sector but the distortion is small for the average worker. The distortion is large, however, for particular groups of the population such as welfare claimants.

Efficient commitment, however, would require complete contracts. The authors study instead bilateral contracting, without commitment regarding others' terms. Each firm then fears that the supplier might opportunistically renegotiate another's contract to increase bilateral profit at the firm's expense. The authors show that nondiscrimination clauses generally cannot curb such third-party opportunism, even with symmetric firms. To reassure firms, crude forms of commitment may be adopted. This could explain the pervasiveness of exclusivity arrangements and the striking uniformity and intertemporal rigidity of franchise contracts.

The inventor can protect his or her intellectual property by negotiating a contingent contract (with a buyer) prior to revealing the invention or, alternatively, the inventor can reveal the invention and then negotiate with the newly informed buyer. Despite the risk of expropriation, the authors find that, in equilibrium, an inventor with little wealth can expect to appropriate a sizable share of the market value of the invention by adopting the latter approach.

As a criterion for distributive justice, the author requires that if both agents work equal numbers of hours, they should divide the output equally. He also requires that the labor-supply decision should remain sovereign. Sufficient conditions are established for achieving an efficient allocation using a division procedure that is consistent with the equal-division-for-equal-work principle and it is shown that the conditions are satisfied in many standard economies.

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how to incorporate new product varieties into a constant-elasticity-of-substitution aggregate of import prices. This method is applied to U.S. imports of six disaggregate manufactured goods. It is shown that the corrected indexes are able to account for part--but not all--of the high income elasticities.

A 'soft budget constraint' problem arises when the state bank is unable to make a credible commitment not to refinance bad projects once some investment costs are sunk. In such a situation, if a consumer good is also demanded by firms as an input and the seller cannot separate firms from households, the high market-clearing price would lead to welfare losses because too many bad projects would start and crowd out household consumption.

This inference follows from two widely held beliefs: sectoral shocks induce only positive unemployment-vacancy comovements, while negative comovements are necessarily the result of aggregate demand shocks. This paper describes an equilibrium matching model that identifies plausible circumstances in which neither assumption is correct, thus suggesting that unemployment-vacancy data are inconclusive. Interestingly, this model's novel results are due to standard features in the contracting literature: firms experience relative price shocks and negotiate contracts that prescribe temporary layoffs.

The model is specified so that, without private information, only high-quality commodities are produced and there is no welfare gain from using money. With private information, there can be equilibria (and sometimes multiple equilibria) where low-quality commodities are produced and money can increase welfare. Money works by promoting useful production and exchange. In efficient monetary equilibria, agents adopt strategies that increase the probability of acquiring high-quality output.

They document the same properties in a two-country stochastic growth model in which trade fluctuations reflect, in large part, the dynamics of capital formation. The authors find that their general-equilibrium perspective is essential: the relation between the trade balance and the terms of trade depends critically on the source of fluctuations.

A nonparametric programming method (activity analysis) is used to compute Malmquist productivity indexes. These are decomposed into two component measures, namely, technical change and efficiency change. The authors find that U.S. productivity growth is slightly higher than average, all of which is due to technical change. Japan's productivity growth is the highest in the sample with almost half due to efficiency change.

While the effects of inflation on growth are small, the effects of growth on the monetary system are substantial. The results are consistent with ideas about money and growth contained in work that predates that of James Tobin and Miguel Sidrauski, as well as with evidence that money and asset demands vary systematically within economies as they develop.

This paper investigates three possible explanations. The first explanation is that shocks to the economy have been smaller in the postwar period. The second explanation is that the composition of output has shifted from very cyclical sectors to less cyclical sectors. The third explanation is that the apparent stabilization is largely spurious and is caused by differences in the way that prewar and postwar business-cycle reference dates were chosen by the National Bureau of Economic Research The evidence presented in this paper favors this third explanation.

The efficiency of these policies will be largely dependent on the extent to which their costs are shifted to group-specific wages. The author studies several state and federal mandates that stipulated that childbirth be covered comprehensively in health insurance plans, raising the relative cost of insuring women of childbearing age. He finds substantial shifting of the costs of these mandates to the wages of the targeted group. Correspondingly, he finds little effect on total labor input for that group.

The authors suggest that it is. In a society where distributional conflict is important, political decisions produce economic policies that tax investment and growth-promoting activities in order to redistribute income. The paper formulates a theoretical model that captures this idea. The model's implications are supported by the evidence.

In this setting, exclusionary contracts are generally shown to be efficient and to deter inefficient entry that would otherwise occur. With multiple unorganized buyers, equilibrium contracts are shown to take a 'divide-and-conquer' form and, in some cases, to deter some efficient entry. In such cases, efficient contracting can be restored by a policy that prohibits price discrimination and gives agents free reign to sign exclusionary agreements.

In the first stage, routine behavior tends to keep information of common interest trapped in private hands. In the second stage, private information reaches a threshold that triggers some agents to alter their behavior; these actions release information to the market. The final stage involves the market's response to this news as other participants react to the initial departure from routine behavior. The authors present an application to industry investment. They also outline applications to the international debt crisis, to bank runs, and to political upheavals.

Unethical managers lack these norms. Higher ethical standards on the part of managers increase economic activity in the short run. However, increased economic activity increases opportunities to profit from unethical behavior, eroding ethical standards over the long run. When this rate of erosion is high, cycling of ethics and economic activity emerges. Otherwise, ethics and economic activity converge to a stable long-run limiting value.

Prior to a vote over the alternatives, some people take costly political action to signal their private information to voters. By informing voting decisions, political action has potential to decrease the likelihood that voters cast 'mistaken' votes. Perhaps surprisingly, preelection communication may be counterproductive. The dispersed information is partially aggregated by the vote and political action may contribute 'noise' to the voting process. In some cases, the voting mechanism is more likely to implement the full-information voting outcome in the absence of preelection political action.

Using this model, the authors show that ostensibly uninformative advertising plays a key role in bringing about coordination economies by directing consumer search toward firms that offer the best deals. Optimal consumer search takes the form of a simple rule of thumb that uses observed advertising information to guide search. Both industry concentration and social surplus are higher in the presence of advertising, relative to a no-advertising benchmark.

First, in a world where inheritance is sexual as opposed to asexual, second-best adaptations can be evolutionarily stable. That is, the adaptation selected need not be the optimal solution to the evolutionary problem at hand. Second, the author applies this result to show that natural selection provides a potential explanation for why, in many settings, humans commit errors that are systematic in nature.

This hypothesis implies that the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) holding Darwinian fitness constant must equal the MRS holding utility constant. Furthermore, in a market economy, the latter must equal the MRS in exchange. Exploiting these principles, the author finds that the long-term real interest rate should equal ln(2) per generation (about 2 percent per year) and that young adults should discount the future more rapidly than their elders.

Its main advantages over the traditional approach based on signing derivatives are that it utilizes only a subset of the assumptions, resulting in a simpler theory that facilitates focusing attention on the economics rather than the mathematics; it applies to discrete changes, even when there are multiple equilibria and when some equilibria do not vary smoothly with the parameters; and it incorporates a formal theory of the robustness of conclusions to assumptions, which helps modelers distinguish which assumptions are 'critical' to their comparative-statics conclusions.

The individual makes adjustment errors inversely proportional to his ability to choose. The authors compare the stationary state of this process with the standard model. They see how an imperfect ability to choose modifies both positive and normative predictions of the standard model and how the standard model can be obtained from the authors' more general one as the special case corresponding to perfect ability.

Repeat-purchase customers have, then, less incentive to acquire price information. The fact that consumers are less well informed allows firms to increase their markups and permits inefficient producers to increase their sales. Production gets reallocated toward higher-cost firms. Given the well-documented correlation between inflation and relative price variability, these results help explain some of the costs of inflation.

In this extended framework, investment is a nondecreasing function of q, the shadow price of installed capital. The optimal rate of investment is in one of three regimes (positive, zero, or negative gross investment), depending on the value of q relative to two critical values. In general, however, the shadow price q is not directly observable, so the authors present two examples relating q to observable variables.

Production units that embody the newest process and product innovations are continuously being created and outdated units are being destroyed. Although outdated units are the most likely to turn unprofitable and be scrapped in a recession, they can be 'insulated' from the fall in demand by a reduction in creation. The structure of adjustment costs plays a determinant role in the responsiveness of those two margins. The calibrated model matches the relative volatilities of the observed manufacturing job creation and destruction series, and their asymmetries over the cycle.

This pursuit of narrow strategies is applauded by some academics who study strategic management. The authors present two related theoretical models in which firms do indeed benefit from pursuing such narrow strategies. In these models, a narrow strategy is beneficial because it enables the firm to motivate its employees to search for ways of increasing the profitability of its core activities. These benefits arise in the authors' model because an incompleteness of contracts precludes offering similar incentives when the firm is involved in many activities.

The mechanism linking global diversification to growth is an attendant world portfolio shift from safe low-yield capital to riskier high-yield capital. The presence of these two types of capital captures the idea that growth depends on the availability of an ever-increasing array of specialized, hence inherently risky, production inputs.

The analysis shows that electoral uncertainty associated with competition between political parties, each representing a specific group of the electorate, imparts a negative 'bias' on the nation's military spending, given military spending by other nations. In turn, electoral uncertainty lowers other nations' incentive to arm as well. In this context, democratic institutions can be thought of as a possible 'precommitment' mechanism that reduces the severity of conflict between nations and, thereby, increases the amount of resources available globally for consumption.

Their empirical estimates indicate that raising the annual IRA contribution limit between 1983 and 1986 would have resulted in little, if any, increase in national saving. Results from sensitivity analysis imply substantially smaller effects on national saving than most previous researchers have estimated. The authors' results are consistent with new evidence they present indicating considerable potential among IRA holders to shift taxable forms of saving into IRAs.

The empirical results, obtained from two longitudinal data sets, indicate that the parents view a dollar of income earned by their daughters as equivalent to a dollar increase in welfare benefits. However, there exists only a small trade-off between the generosity of government aid and the incidence of parental aid.

Plain people earn less than average-looking people, who earn less than the good-looking. The plainness penalty is 5 to 10 percent, slightly larger than the beauty premium. Effects for men are at least as great as for women. Unattractive women have lower labor-force participation rates and marry men with less human capital. Better-looking people sort into occupations where beauty may be more productive but the impact of individuals' looks is mostly independent of occupation, suggesting the existence of pure employer discrimination.

Multiple measurements of schooling levels were also collected to assess the effect of reporting error on the estimated economic returns to schooling. The data indicate that omitted ability variables do not bias the estimated return to schooling upward but that measurement error does bias it downward. Adjustment for measurement error indicates that an additional year of schooling increases wages by 12 to 16 percent, a higher estimate of the economic returns to schooling than has been previously found.

They find large short-term effects of unplanned births on labor-force participation, poverty, and welfare recipiency among unwed mothers but not among married mothers. Although most of the adverse economic effects of unplanned motherhood dissipate over time for whites, there are larger and more persistent negative effects on black unwed mothers.
