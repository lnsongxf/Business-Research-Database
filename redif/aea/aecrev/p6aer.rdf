They find that high-tenure workers separating from distressed firms suffer long-term losses averaging 25 percent per year. In addition, the authors find that displaced workers' losses (1) begin mounting before their separations; (2) depend only slightly on their age and sex; (3) depend more on local labor-market conditions and their former industries; (4) are not, however, limited to those in a few sectors; and (5) are large even for those who find new jobs in similar firms.

This paper uses a structural vector autoregression estimated on ante- and postbellum data to distinguish the influences of changes in the nature or magnitude of the disturbances from those of changes in the response of the system to shocks (i.e., changes in structure) in contributing to this increased economic instability. The increased cyclical severity in the postbellum period is found to have been the result of greater sensitivity to monetary disturbances, rather than of larger or more volatile shocks.

Cross-sectional data show that firms in industries experiencing more strikes in the 1880s were less likely to cut nominal wages in the depression of 1893. This and other evidence suggests that the nineteenth-century decrease in wage flexibility was caused by an increase in workers' bargaining power in the absence of binding wage contracts.

The author shows that firms may optimally eschew the use of incentive contracts to retain workers' incentives for honesty. The author illustrates that the incentive to conform implies inefficiencies, even when workers are risk-neutral, and is likely to lead to more centralized decision-making than in the absence of the desire to conform.

Promotion signals that workers are potentially valuable managers in other firms and so can lead to turnover. To preempt competition for a manager, an employer may offer a wage high enough to discourage competitors from acquiring information and bidding up the wage further or hiring the worker away. This transfers wages from good workers to bad. More costly information acquisition yields greater expected lifetime wages.

Using a model in which individuals save for an indivisible durable consumption good, the authors study rotating savings and credit associations that distribute funds using random allocation and bidding. Each type of rotating savings and credit association allows individuals without access to credit markets to improve their welfare but, under a reasonable assumption on preferences, random allocation is preferred when individuals have identical tastes. This conclusion need not hold when individuals are heterogeneous. The authors also discuss the sustainability of rotating savings and credit associations given the possibility of default.

With two-sided specific investments, efficiency requires prices to have sufficient escalator clauses to avoid renegotiation, as observed in many long-term contracts. A third case, with one-sided specific investments, can generate 'take or pay' contracts and explain why firms sometimes pay for specific investments that appear to benefit employees directly.

Without auctioning costs, auctioning is always optimal. When auctioning is costly, auctions are still preferable if the marginal-revenue curve is sufficiently steep. The global steepness of the marginal-revenue curve is found to coincide with the dispersion around the mean for a number of standard distributions. Finally, the prices of the monopoly seller and of the social optimum are compared.

Paternalism reduced monitoring and turnover costs in cotton cultivation in the U.S. South until the mechanization of the cotton harvest in the 1950s. Until then, the effectiveness of paternalism was threatened by government programs that could have substituted for paternalism; but large Southern landowners had the political power to prevent the appearance of such programs in the South. With mechanization, the economic incentive to provide paternalism disappeared and Southern congressmen allowed welfare programs to expand in ways consistent with their interests.

This paper uses a simple two-country model to address a range of consequent policy concerns, focusing particularly on the role of country size. Differences in size exacerbate the inefficiency from noncooperative behavior, harming both countries. The smaller country loses from harmonization to any tax rate between those set in the noncooperative equilibrium, but both countries gain from the imposition of a minimum tax anywhere in that range. The fully optimal response to freer cross-border trade, however, may be to do nothing.

Cross-sectionally, higher-wage individuals have more schooling, more hours worked in the market, fewer hours worked at home, and a lower variance of market hours. Over the life cycle, older individuals have higher wages, more hours worked both in the market and at home, a lower variance of market hours, and almost the same amount of education as younger agents. These and other facts are documented, and a simple overlapping-generations model with skill acquisition and home production that delivers most of these properties is constructed.

Quantitative experiments with the fixed-savings-rate models of the 1960s showed lengthy transitions, thus potentially rationalizing sustained differences in growth rates across countries. The authors investigate quantitative transitional dynamics in various neoclassical models with intertemporally optimizing households. Lengthy transitions occur only with very low intertemporal substitution. Generally, when one tries to explain sustained economic growth with transitional dynamics, there are extremely counterfactual implications. These result from the fact that implied marginal products are extraordinarily high in the early stages of development.

The observed response patterns provide no support for nominal-contracting theories of unemployment, which predict that nominal surprises should be negatively correlated with real wages. In fact, both inflation and money-growth surprises are found to be essentially uncorrelated with real wages. Either a real-business-cycle model or a model with rigidities in commodity prices could be consistent with these results.

Financial repression is a combination of controls on international capital flows with restrictions on domestic interest rates. The result is an artificially low cost of domestic funding to governments. The authors estimate the government revenue from financial repression as the difference between the foreign and the domestic cost of funds, times the domestic stock of government debt. The evidence indicates that the revenue from financial repression can be quite substantial and, for several countries, it is of the same order of magnitude as seigniorage.

solve an optimizing model that explains counterintuitive effects of fiscal policy in terms of expectations. If government spending follows an upward-trending stochastic process that the public believes may fall sharply when it reaches specific "trigger" points, then optimizing consumption behavior and simple budget-constraint arithmetic imply a nonlinear relationship between private consumption and government spending. Th is theoretical relation is consistent with the experience of several countries.

By assuming that voters are uncertai n as to the efficacy of different policies, a reelection process is derived that depends on both a politician's past policies and the level of economic activity during his time in office. It is shown th at the less uncertain are voters as to which policy is best, the more likely is a politician to manipulate policy for reelection purposes. Manipulation entails implementing the policy that is more likely to be well received rather than the one that maximizes income.

The demographic structure permits analysis of both within- and between-country intergenerational externalities caused by past weapons-accumulation decisions, as well as of intragenerational externalities from the adversary's current weap ons accumulation. Zero accumulation is a possible equilibrium with both noncooperative and cooperative behavior.

The authors formalize this idea using a search-theoretic equilibrium model of the exchange process that captures the "double coincidence of wants problem" with pure barter. One advantage of the framework described here is that it is very tractable.

The author s find that tighter monetary policy leads to a shift in firms' mix of external financing: commercial paper issuance rises while bank loans fall. This suggests that contractionary policy can indeed reduce lo an supply. Furthermore, such shifts in loan supply seem to affect investment, even controlling for interest rates and output.

By limitin g the degree of flexibility permitted in policy, this procedure mitiga tes the credibility problem. As the length of the targeting horizon decreases, the severity of the credibility problem falls but at the expense of weakening the monetary authority's ability to pursue its stabilization goals. Based on model simulations, the analysis studi es the determinants of the optimal targeting horizon that balances the benefits of flexibility and discipline in policy.

The reason is that deterring entry at one st age affects the cost of doing so in later stages. This force can be so powerful that entry is deterred only at the final stage. The persistence of monopoly or its erosion over time depends on the timi ng of arrival of capacity, the size of early versus subsequent capacity availability, the length of the capacity-acquisition stage relative to the life of the industry, and the discount factor.

The paper provides a detailed analysis of a particular structural model--William Vickrey' s model of bottleneck congestion in the morning rush-hour auto commute extended to treat elastic (i.e., price-sensitive) demand--and examin es some economic implications of the structural approach.

Average growth is significantly low er in manufacturing firms that experience successful union elections bu t these strong "effects" are largely illusory. The authors find no evidence of a significant relationship between unionization and firm growth, despite a strong cyclical pattern in election activity. Thei r results suggest that the significant negative effect of organizing activity on a firm's market value is not accompanied by any growth changes. The authors, therefore, cannot reject the hypothesis that t he equity losses from union election activity represent a simple transf er of wealth from shareholders to workers.

3Volume: 83Year: 1993Month:  June Abstract:  The aim of this paper is to assess the importance of using micro-level data in the econometric analysis of consumer demand. To do this, the authors utilize a time series of repeated cross sections covering some 4,000 households in each of fifteen years. Employing a number of different aggregation procedures, they conclude that aggregate data alone are unlikely to produce reliable estimates of structural price and income coefficients. However, once certain aggregation factors as well as trend and seasonal components are included, an aggregate model is not necessarily outperformed across all demand equations in terms of forecasting ability.

The results show that prices increased on routes served by the merging firms relative to a control group of routes unaffected by the merger. Mergers may lead to more efficient operations but, on the whole, the impact of efficiency gains on airfares is more than offset by exercise of increased market power.

Agency relations were governed by a coalition--an economic institution in which expectations, implicit contractual relations, and a specific information-transmission mechanism supported the operation of a reputation mechanism. Historical records and a simple game-theoretical model are used to examine this institution. The study highlights the interaction between social and economic institutions, the determinants of business practices, the nature of the merchants' law, and the interrelations between market and nonmarket institutions.

Compensating managers in proportion to a combination of profits and sales provides one mechanism through which aggressive behavior emerges. However, when the profit component of managerial compensation comes in the form of stock options, the aggressive behavior is restrained or even eliminated in equilibrium. This result relies only on the nonlinearity of the stock option; generalizations to other forms of compensation are discussed.

The paper uses a loglinear approximation to the budget constraint to substitute out consumption from a standard intertemporal asset pricing model. In a homoskedastic lognormal setting, the consumption-wealth ratio is shown to depend on the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption, while asset risk premia are determined by the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Risk premia are related to the covariances of asset returns with the market return and with news about the discounted value of all future market returns.

Given the industries sampled, more price discrimination across destinations is observed in the U.K, German, and Japanese data. For industries that match across source countries, however, behavior is very similar across source countries. Furthermore, destination-specific price adjustment on exports to the United States from Germany and Japan is similar to price adjustment observed on shipments to other destinations. Most variation in the data appears to be related to industry.

Evidence from the Dollar/Pound Exchange Rate, 1976-1987. Journal: American Economic ReviewPages: 450-72Issue: 3Volume: 83Year: 1993Month:  June Abstract:  One of the most puzzling aspects of the floating-exchange-rate regime since 1973 has been the apparent irrationality embedded in investors' exchange-rate expectations. This paper investigates whether exchange-rate forecasts, although biased, are still rational. The idea is that investors can be rational and yet make repeated mistakes if the true model of the exchange rate is evolving over time. The author's results support the hypothesis that the exchange rate has followed a switching-regime process. Moreover, the switching-regime model estimated can explain about 75 percent of the bias implied by the forward market and the survey data.

The author shows that a large debt was not an unconditional predictor of low investment in the 1980s, nor was investment abnormally low when compared to a 'financial-autarky' rate calculated in the text. He does find, however, that the actual service of the debt crowded out investment. For the rescheduling countries, he shows that 1 percent of GDP paid abroad reduced domestic investment by 0.3 percent of GDP. This is identical to the correlation between investment and foreign finance observed in the 1960s.

This is puzzling, as it apparently implies a low degree of international capital mobility. This paper shows that the observed positive correlation between national saving and investment rates arises naturally within a quantitatively restricted equilibrium model with perfect mobility of financial and physical capital. The model is consistent with the fact that saving-investment correlations are larger for larger countries but are still substantial for small countries. Further, the model is consistent with the finding that current-account deficits tend to be associated with investment booms.

The authors begin by examining anecdotal evidence on the nature of the production control system in force during that period. Motivated by that evidence, they then extend the conventional linear-quadratic model of production behavior to take account of annual shutdown. Finally, the authors apply the modified model to newly available data on monthly unit production, sales, and inventories during 1924-40. General Motors appears to have been aiming to maintain a targeted level of inventory relative to expected sales and, secondarily, to smooth production.

The process of costly replacement and depreciation creates endogenous fluctuations in productivity, employment, and output of a single producer. The authors explore the spillover effects of machine replacement on other sectors of the economy and provide conditions for synchronized machine replacement by multiple independent producers. The implications of their model are generally consistent with observed monthly output, employment, and productivity fluctuations in automobile plants. Synchronization of retooling across plants within the auto industry is widespread, so that the fluctuations observed at the plant level have aggregate implications.

The main results are: (1) supply shocks, particularly country-specific ones, are very important in generating international business cycles and (2) although the post-1973 flexible-exchange-rate period has been inherently more volatile, there are no differences in transmission properties of economic disturbances across exchange-rate regimes for the endogenous variables they focus on.

The authors' main findings are as follows: (1) permanent changes in government purchases can lead to short-run and long-run output multipliers that exceed one; (2) permanent changes in government purchases induce larger effects than temporary changes; (3) the financing decision is quantitatively more important than the resource cost of changes in government purchases; and (4) public investment has dramatic effects on private output and investment. These findings stem from important dynamic interactions of capital and labor absent in earlier equilibrium analyses of fiscal policy.

In the basic extensive form, one of the two players chooses to play a battle-of-the-sexes game or to receive a certain payoff. According to forward induction, choosing to play the game is a signal about intended action. Though the presence of the outside option changes play, the authors find only limited support for the forward-induction hypothesis. The effects of the outside option also reflect the creation of a focal point through the asymmetry created by offering the outside option to one of the two players.

Outcomes rejecting such motivations are called fairness equilibria. Outcomes are mutual-max when each person maximizes the other's material payoffs, and mutual-min when each person minimizes the other's payoffs. It is shown that every mutual-max or mutual-min Nash equilibrium is a fairness equilibrium. If payoffs are small, fairness equilibria are roughly the set of mutual-max and mutual-min outcomes; if payoffs are large, fairness equilibria are roughly the set of Nash equilibria. Several economic examples are considered and possible welfare implications of fairness are explored.

Nonetheless, there was a positive relationship between differences in equilibrium predictions and differences in behavior.

Respondents read scenarios describing a hypothetical company and its labor market, and recommended wage changes for several positions. Contrary to some popular theories, differences in unemployment, quit rates, and a company's return on assets led to almost no change in respondents' recommended wage increases. When market wages for closely related occupations diverged, most respondents did not recommend adjusting relative wages within the company; but when the occupations were not closely related (blue versus white collar), most respondents recommended adjusting relative wages to reflect market forces.

The authors argue that this depends on how the policy affects employers' beliefs about the productivity of minority workers. They study the joint determination of employer beliefs and worker productivity in a model of statistical discrimination in job assignments. The authors prove that, even when identifiable groups are equally endowed ex ante, affirmative action can bring about a situation in which employers (correctly) perceive the groups to be unequally productive, ex post.

Yet sometimes this leadership role shifts. The authors suggest a mechanism that explains this pattern of 'leapfrogging' as a response to occasional major changes in technology. When such a change occurs, the new technology does not initially seem to be an improvement for leading nations, given their extensive experience with older technologies. Lagging nations have less experience; the new technique allows them to use their lower wages to enter the market. If the new technique proves more productive than the old, leapfrogging of leadership occurs.

The model allows for the simultaneous existence of a pessimistic zero-privatization trap and an optimistic full-privatization equilibrium defined by a critical mass of expected privatization. While both privatization subsidies and minimum-income guarantees can by themselves secure coordination on the optimistic equilibrium, the financing constraint may offset the direct effect.

If the median voter is capital-poor relative to the economy's representative agent, political interactions tend to slow down growth when policy acts on capital's income share and tend to accelerate it when investment subsidies are the policy instrument of choice.

A discretionary contract allows a contracting party to choose whether or not to honor the contract. It is shown that such a contract liquefies reputational capital by permitting it to be depreciated in exchange for the preservation of financial capital and information reusability in financially impaired states. In addition, discretionary contracts foster the development of reputation. This explains discretion among highly confident letters, holding-company relationships, mutual-fund contracts, bank loan commitments, and other financial and nonfinancial contracts.

If markets are incomplete and traders are only able to enter into contracts that they will be able to execute regardless of future events, contingent contracting may be severely restricted. Moreover, opening new markets may not relieve these restrictions. Default promotes efficiency in a way that opening new markets does not by making it possible for traders to enter into contracts that they will be able to execute with high probability but not with certainty.

When the repayment of senior claims depends in part upon further investment, shareholders may be able to alter credibly their incentives to invest through an exchange of junior debt for equity and thereby force concessions from senior creditors. The authors focus on the conflict between shareholders and risk-averse workers and show that this strategic use of debt leads to an inefficient allocation of risk. They characterize conditions under which firms will undergo leveraged recapitalizations, their choice of debt instruments, and the dynamics of their capital structure.

Two models are developed that illustrate this general idea. One model is based on investor uncertainty about the quality of other investors' information; the other is based on dispersion of information and small costs to trading. The analysis is used to suggest a possible rational explanation of the October 1987 crash.

The three RJR bonds are virtually identical in all respects except for the form in which interest is paid. The authors document large and persistent errors in the market pricing of the three bonds over a two-year period. The cash-paying bond was consistently more expensive than either the pay-in-kind or deferred-coupon bonds. The magnitude of the pricing errors is too large to be explained by market imperfections.

As in other studies of art as an investment, prints do not compare favorably to traditional financial assets. There is substantial noise in auction prices but little or no support for the proposition that some artists command higher prices in certain countries or that masterpieces outperform the market. One puzzle is the continuing tendency for prices realized at certain auction houses to exceed those realized at others: notably, at Sotheby's relative to Christie's in New York.
