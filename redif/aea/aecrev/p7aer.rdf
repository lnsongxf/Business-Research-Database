In this setting, conflict is not the necessary outcome of one-time interaction and cooperation is consistent with domination of one agent over another. Other things being equal, an agent's power, a well-defined concept in this paper, is inversely related to an agent's resources when resources are valued according to marginal-productivity theory. Some implications for the evolution of property rights are drawn. The model is applicable to a variety of situations in which directly unproductive activities are prevalent.

This contrasts with the standard intuition that firms minimize competition by differentiating their products.

The authors argue that high premiums can be attributed, at least in part, to large numbers of uninsured motorists in some markets, while uninsured motorists can be attributed to high premiums. The authors construct a simple noncooperative equilibrium model that can generate inefficient equilibria with uninsured drivers and high, yet actuarially fair, premiums. For certain parameterizations, an efficient full-insurance equilibrium and inefficient high-price equilibria with uninsured drivers exist simultaneously, helping to explain price variability across otherwise similar cities. Policy implications are discussed.

The authors show how a simple probabilistic process, in which change influences a key unobserved determinant of R&D and firm size conditions the returns to R&D, can account for these regularities and other features of the distributions. The model provides a unified, noncausal explanation of a series of long-observed relationships across mean R&D intensity, market concentration, and the coefficient of variation. It also offers a novel explanation for the inverse relationship between R&D productivity and firm size.

Analysis of balance-sheet data indicates that while newly insured thrifts undertook less risk than their uninsured counterparts, possibly because of screening by deposit-insurance authorities, moral hazard emerged gradually. Insured institutions operating under relatively permissive regulatory regimes were more prone to undertake risky lending activities than their more tightly regulated counterparts, possibly because of screening by deposit-insurance authorities, moral hazard emerged gradually. Insured institutions operating under relatively premissive regulatory regimes were more prone to undertake risky lending activities than their more tightly regulated counterparts. Given the current system of deposit insurance, the results suggest that effective regulation and supervision will play a key role in maintaining thrift stability in the 1990s.

This paper begins by observing that a highly asymmetric distribution of power between two partners is not sustainable if the choice variables are strategic substitutes. It then studies a simple general-equilibrium model of a monetary union and shows that a small economy will not take part in the agreement unless it can secure influence that is more than proportional to its size and a transfer of seigniorage revenues in its favor.

Inflation rates are more persistent after World War II than before, and price-level fluctuations are typically procyclical before World War II and countercyclical afterward. Fluctuations in money are less highly correlated with output in the postwar period but are no more persistent than in earlier periods.

The authors begin by recreating Steven Salop's turnover model of the natural rate in its naturally intertemporal version. Useful findings on impact effects and the adjustment process at the individual firm, necessarily excluded by the static version, are shown to derive from the dynamized model. At the macroeconomic level, the authors then provide a general-equilibrium analysis of some shocks showing how they drive the equilibrium unemployment rate and in varying ways also disturb the real rate of interest.

Then they argue that the reason for this forecasting success is that the funds rate sensitively records shocks to the supply of bank reserves; that is, the funds rate is a good indicator of monetary policy actions. Finally, using innovations to the funds rate as a measure of changes in policy, the authors present evidence consistent with the view that monetary policy works at least in part through "credit" (i.e., bank loans) as well as through "money" (i.e., bank deposits).

It extends old results to make them more relevant to the contemporary debates about the adjustment of investment goods for quality change and about the role of embodied technical change as a source of economic growth. It is shown that the failure to adjust capital for quality change has the effect of suppressing the quality effects into the conventional total-factor-productivity residual and it is found that approximately 20 percent of the residual growth of quality-adjusted.output could be attributed to embodied technical change.

This paper examines whether the conclusions from existing studies are robust or fragile to small changes in the conditioning information set. The authors find that almost all results are fragile. They do, however, identify a positive, robust correlation between growth and the share of investment in GDP and between the investment share and the ratio of international trade to GDP. The authors clarify the conditions under which there is evidence of per capita output convergence.

Time-series information on regional rainfall is used to construct estimates of transitory income due to rainfall shocks. The relationship between these measures of transitory income and savings indicates that farm households save a significantly higher fraction of transitory income than nontransitory income.

Decollectivization is found to improve total factor productivity and to account for about half of the output growth during 1978-84. The adjustment in state procurement prices also contributed positively to output growth. Its impact came mainly from the responses in input use. The effect of other market-related reforms on productivity and output growth was very small. Reasons for slowdown in agricultural growth after 1984 are also analyzed.

He focuses on three prototypes of ownership classes: landlords, smallholders, and landless people. Agents are identical except for their ownership of assets. On the basis of optimizing behavior, they divide into urban workers in the modern sector, urban workers in the informal sector, agricultural laborers, subsistence farmers, and landlords. The impact of land reform on production and poverty depends on the amount of fertile land per capita. A more egalitarian distribution of landownership reduces poverty where land is scarce but not where land is abundant.

Export-country governments' incentives differ, leading either to export tax or subsidy, depending on the circumstances. The prospect of one departure from free trade, thus, leads to another, a domino effect. Antidumping enforcement will ordinarily not eliminate and ironically may increase dumping.

The model assumes that the home government can precommit to a subsidy function. The optimal marginal subsidy rate is shown to decrease with domestic exports. This induces the firms to select steeper supply functions, thereby softening competition. The strategic complementarity between supply functions' slopes is the key to these results.

Yet a prominent feature of U.S. collective bargaining is the holdout: negotiations often continue without a strike after the contract has expired. Production continues with workers paid accordingly to the expired contract. The authors analyze the union's decision to strike or hold out and highlight its importance to strike activity. Strikes are more likely to occur after a drop in the real wage or a decline in unemployment.

A replication based on these methods is more cyclically sensitive and exhibits less autocorrelation than the postwar data. Aggregation using variable instead of fixed employment weights also greatly exaggerates the cyclicality of prewar wages. These biases imply that wages are just as sensitive to the cycle today as one hundred years ago, perhaps even more so.

The major conclusion is that beginning in late 1930, and possibly as early as late 1929, deflation could have been anticipated at horizons of three-six months. This implies, in turn, that short-run ex ante real interest rates were very high during the initial phases of the Great Depression. These results provide further support for the proposition that monetary contraction was the driving force behind the economic decline.

Evidence from the Commodity Futures Market. Journal: American Economic ReviewPages: 157-78Issue: 1Volume: 82Year: 1992Month:  March Abstract:  Futures prices were well above spot prices for most commodities during most of the Great Depression; evidently the spectacular declines in agricultural prices caught many people by surprise. Based on the historical correlations between commodity prices and consumer prices, commodity markets anticipated stable consumer prices during the first year of the Great Depression. The dramatic drop in nominal Treasury bill yields, thus, should be read as a drop in ex ante real rates. Later in the Great Depression, markets anticipated deflation, but not as severe as actually occurred.

A distinguishing feature of the analysis is that the welfare loss from inflation, the money-demand function, and the time path of inflation are jointly derived from first principles of government and private-sector intertemporal optimization. Quarterly data for Argentina, Brazil, and Israel are used in implementing the model. Although the overidentifying restrictions of the model are not rejected in most cases, there are several data points characterized by higher rates of inflation than the optimal rates under precommitment.

In this paper, the specification of the contract duration is determined endogenously. The wage rate can be indexed to the consumer price index, but there is a loss since the indexation must be the same for different types of shocks. This loss increases with the variability of the contract duration. Since the loss due to the contracting cost depends on the expected discounted duration only, a fixed duration is chosen.

The technology endows agents with correctly specified economic models, but the cost of expectation calculation using these models leads to gradual and incomplete adjustment to long-run rational-expectation equilibrium. The rational-expectations hypothesis emerges as a special case of the equilibrium paths obtained in the authors' framework. In a natural-rate model of monetary policy, calculation technology gives rise to long-run nonneutrality and hysteresis effects, and incomplete adjustment of forecast rules causes output fluctuations to be amplified.

Institutional evidence for interventions or changes of regime combined with econometric tests for structural breaks are used to investigate the relative stability of conditional and marginal probability distributions for each variable. The patterns of stability are the products of underlying causal order. The authors find two distinct causal structures operating in the postwar era. Before the mid-1960s, taxes appear to cause spending. After the late 1960s, taxes and spending are causally independent.

renegotiation-proof affects the set of contracts that can be implemented in a seller-buyer scenario in which the information regarding the agents' valuations is nonverifiable. This paper explicitly adds a time dimension to an implementation problem and introduces a natural criterion of renegotiation-proofness for the case of time-consuming renegotiation. The main insight gained is that the addition of the time dimension enlarges significantly the set of contracts that can be implemented in a renegotiation-proof manner.

This enables him to refuse the contract in unfavorable states but burdens him with an observation cost. The authors show that the principal offers a contract in which the agent has no incentive to observe the state of nature and they explore its terms. Later, they show that the principal finds it profitable to organize competition between several agents, even though he has monopoly power and can push a single agent down to his reservation utility.

If some degrees of the offenses are not adequately reported or if investigation is too costly, the regulator must monitor and treat offenses of different severity quite differently. Smaller offenses should not be investigated; they should be deterred by monitoring alone, coupled with graduated fines. To deter larger offenses, the regulator should vary the investigation rate while setting maximal fines.

This paper tries to explain this regularity by studying a political model of tax reform. The model implies that countries with a more unstable and polarized political system will have more inefficient tax structures and, thus, will rely more heavily on seigniorage. This prediction of the model is tested on cross-sectional data for seventy countries. The authors find that, after controlling for other variables, political instability is positively associated with seigniorage.

The authors find that the implications of available models are inconsistent with European exchange-rate data, and they suggest that the frequent realignments occurring in the period they consider may be responsible for this. They construct a model in which the likelihood of a realignment in the near future increases as the exchange rate approaches the limits of its fluctuation band and show that its implications are broadly consistent with the evidence.

Though the phenomenon is general, it is illustrated here for the life-cycle-permanent-income model. Cross-section and pooled-panel data induce information-aggregation bias akin to that in aggregate time series.

The model assumes costly matching in the labor market and a thin-market externality in the output market that makes the profitability of hiring depend positively on the number of firms hiring. The equilibrium does not rely on any effect of expected inflation on labor supply. It is also stable under learning; Bayesian updating induces convergence to the equilibrium with positive probability even if people start with no definite belief that animal spirits affect the profitability of hiring.

Focusing on data from 1970 onward destroys this evidence altogether. Evidence indicating cointegration of real income and real money balances, with due allowance for the effect of interest rates, also deteriorates when the sample extends through the 1980s. A positive finding is that the spread between the commercial paper rate and the Treasury bill rate consistently contains highly significant information about future movements in real income.

The authors show that the conditions that guarantee interior Walrasian equilibria, in conjunction with a continuity restriction on strategies, rule out equilibria with extremely low levels of activity (zero activity), which is a distinguishing feature of many existing models. They study the case of separability and show that there is no rationing and, hence, no equilibrium unemployment. In addition, in a numerical example, the authors find that there is a unique symmetric equilibrium.

Existing real-business-cycle models fail this test dramatically. The authors modify prototypical real-business-cycle models by allowing government consumption shocks to influence labor-market dynamics. This modification can, in principle, bring the models into closer conformity with the data. Their empirical results indicate that it does.

Intergenerational data from the National Longitudinal Survey are used. Earlier studies, conducted for the United States, report elasticities of children's earnings with respect to parent's earnings of 0.2 or less, suggesting extensive intergenerational mobility. These estimates, however, are biased.downward by error-contaminated measures of lifetime economic status. Estimates presented in this paper correct for the problem of measurement error and find the intergenerational correlation in income to be on the order of 0.4. This suggests considerably less intergenerational mobility than previously believed.

The few existing estimates of the intergenerational correlation in income have been biased downward by measurement error, unrepresentative samples, or both. New estimates based on intergenerational data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics imply that the intergenerational correlation in long-run income is at least 0.4, indicating dramatically less mobility than suggested by earlier research.

This paper attempts to assess the power of several alternative explanations of the observed relative wage changes in the context of a theoretical framework that nests all of these explanations. The authors' conclusion is that their major cause was a shift in the skill structure of labor demand brought about by biased technological change.

Quality-Improvement by Public Utilities. Journal: American Economic ReviewPages: 1321-40Issue: 5Volume: 82Year: 1992Month:  December Abstract:  The authors examine the design of incentive programs to motivate regulated utilities to supply both basic service (e.g., electricity supply, local telephone service) and service enhancements (e.g., energy-conservation services, improved clarity and speed of voice communication). The optimal regulatory programs are shown to vary greatly, depending upon the information available to the regulator. The price of the basic service may optimally be distorted above or below marginal cost to better motivate the supply of the service enhancement. The authors' policy prescriptions are compared with current programs and proposals to promote energy conservation.

In the presence of sufficiently large R&D spillovers, neither noncooperative nor cooperative equilibria achieve even second-best R&D levels. In the absence of spillover effects, however, while the cooperative R&D level remains socially insufficient, the noncooperative level may overshoot first- and second-best levels of R&D.

Research efforts, which precede production, are directed to reducing unit cost and are subject to various degrees of spillovers. It is shown that creating a competitive research joint venture reduces the equilibrium level of technological improvement and increases equilibrium prices compared to when firms conduct R&D independently. A research joint venture that cooperates in its R&D decisions yields the highest consumer plus producer surplus under Cournot competition and, in most cases, under Bertrand competition.

Unfortunately, it has also blurred the distinction between statements that are valid at the individual level and those that apply to the aggregate. In this paper, the author argues that probability theory puts strong restrictions on the joint behavior of a large number of units that are less than fully synchronized. Many fallacies arise from disregarding these restrictions. For example, asymmetric factor adjustment costs at the firm level need not imply asymmetric responses of aggregate employment flows to positive and negative shocks.

The corresponding concept of eductive learning stability, based on the game-theoretical concept of rationalizability, is primarily used within the classical Muth model. Conditions for coordination of beliefs are interpreted and discussed; they are robust to the introduction of noise. More generally, eductive stability fits economic intuition on coordination: stability increases when the industry product differentiation increases and when decisions are sequential and observable.

Using a representative-agent model, the authors show that the key distinction between the trade balance in nondurables and durables is the role of intertemporal prices in the latter. A decrease in intertemporal prices associated, for example, with an exchange-rate overvaluation should, therefore, be expected to worsen the trade balance in durables more than in nondurables. This interpretation of the compositional changes of the U.S. trade balance is supported by their econometric findings.

This paper presents an explicitly dynamic search model that is able to account for cyclical patterns of prices and demand over time. These cyclical features of the model are the consequence of the dynamic strategic interaction between buyers and firms and do not require the presence of extraneous factors such as shocks or heterogeneity of agents in order to obtain. The model builds on earlier work by Kenneth Burdett and Kenneth L. Judd and may be interpreted as a dynamic extension of their model.

Assuming altruistically motivated transfers in at least some family lines and other plausible conditions, the authors prove the invariance of capital's steady-state marginal product to government debt, government expenditures, and the tax rates on labor and capital income. The authors show that the tax treatment of household interest payments has powerful effects on capital intensity and aggregate savings in life-cycle and, especially, altruistic linkage models.

Yet empirical voting models do not allow for vote trading. These models recognize that observed ideology may influence legislative behavior but do not correct for unobserved ideology. This study devises new tests for logrolling and ideology. The empirical model controls for logroll agreements and unobserved ideological interest via the correlation of unobserved variables. The results reflect the presence of vote-trading coalitions on some votes but not on others. The results cast doubt on the importance of personal ideological interests of legislators.

The authors find that the market worked extremely well, dominating opinion polls in forecasting the outcome of the 1988 presidential election, even though traders in the market exhibited substantial amounts of judgment biases. Their explanation is that judgment bias refers to average behavior, while in markets it is marginal traders who influence price. They present evidence that in this market a sufficient number of traders were free of judgment bias so that the market was able to work well.

Results indicate a statistically significant impact of the level of monetary incentives on revealed risk preferences. However, even under extreme monetary incentives, subjects demanded amounts well in excess of expected value for low-probability gain prospects.

First, are the responses of cooperatives to changes in their economic environment different from those of conventional firms? It appears that cooperatives are more inclined to adjust pay than employment. Second, how profitable has membership in the cooperatives been? Using information on share prices, the authors find membership to have been extremely profitable and, in this sense, the prices of co-ops' shares have been underpriced. The riskiness of cooperative memberships is discussed.
