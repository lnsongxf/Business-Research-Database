Dispute costs are lower under compulsory arbitration than under the right to strike or when no collective-bargaining legislation exists. Hence, a switch to compulsory arbitration could potentially make both the union and the employer better off by reducing dispute costs. However, the authors find that wages are higher under compulsory arbitration than under other legal structures.

The author argues that there will be no real effects if firms reduce straight-time wages so as to offer the same package of weekly compensation and hours of work that was acceptable initially. Empirical analysis suggests that wage differentials do arise to mitigate the purely demand-driven effects predicted by previous models, but these differentials are not large enough to neutralize overtime pay regulation completely.

This paper uses two retrospective surveys from 1944 and 1951 to show that half of all married women employed in 1950 were working in 1940, and more than half of the decade's new entrants joined after the war. Of all wartime entrants, the majority exited after 1944 but before 1950. The war had several significant indirect impacts on women's employment, but its direct influence appears to have been more modest.

A model of interjurisdictional migration is used to study the nature of this redistributive externality. Analysis of optimal redistribution and optimal corrective subsidies from higher-level governments shows that benefit levels for the recipients of income transfers and tax rates on mobile taxpayers should be equalized across jurisdictions. A system of jurisdictions with a common labor market can achieve welfare improvements through coordination of "domestic" redistributive policy or through the intervention of a higher-level government.

Wages for unskilled workers and skilled individuals who choose to become employees are then lower in the former country, while incomes of skilled individuals talented enough to become managers are lower (for a given talent level) in the latter. Countries with abundant skilled labor therefore export managers (e.g., through multinational subsidiaries) and skilled-labor-intensive goods yet import skilled employees (the "brain drain").

The results show that the model mimics many of the stylized facts using moderate adjustment costs and minimal variability and persistence in the technological disturbances. In particular, the model is consistent with the observed positive correlation between savings and investment, even though financial capital is perfectly mobile, and with countercyclical fluctuations in external trade.

This paper uses a long-run restriction implied by a large class of real-business-cycle models--identifying permanent productivity shocks as shocks to the common stochastic trend in output, consumption, and investment--to provide new evidence on this question. Econometric tests indicate that this common-stochastic-trend/cointegration implication is consistent with postwar U.S. data. However, in systems with nominal variables, the estimates of this common stochastic trend indicate that permanent productivity shocks typically explain less than half of the business-cycle variability in output, consumption, and investment.

This link between M2 and prices is the basis for a dynamic model of inflation that compares favorably in forecasting exercises with Phillips-curve and more typical monetarist approaches. The behavior of V2 is examined from 1870 to the present, providing a basis for reconsidering previous findings that V2 follows a random walk.

The trade-offs between these price promotions are analyzed, providing insights about their roles, profitability, and welfare properties. Retailers' rebates are also studied. While price discrimination is a common explanation for rebates to consumers, when a product is sold through a distribution channel, the manufacturer may also use rebates to motivate retail participation in the promotion. This explains why rebates may be offered even when all consumers use them and price discrimination does not occur.

The authors focus on how this decision is affected by technological change in the industry. In general, cost-reducing technological change leads the firm to produce the input itself more often. The firm's calculus is shown to depend on whether the subcontractor's skills are idiosyncratic or transferable. In the latter case, technological progress can even be detrimental to the firm and to society as a whole.

There are three types of firms: diversified firms that produce both goods and two types of specialized firms. Thus, there are five possible industry market structures: one involving all three types of firms, three involving two types of firms, and one involving only diversified firms. The authors show that the equilibrium market structure is jointly determined by supply (cost) and demand conditions and that any market structure involving more types of firms than goods is an unlikely occurrence.

The general equilibrium analytical framework reveals how the allocation of labor time among insurrection, soldiering, and production and the probabilistic distribution of income between the peasant families and the ruler's clientele both depend on the technology of insurrection. A central result is that equilibria with more time allocated to insurrection and a higher probability of a successful insurrection have lower production and total income, but nevertheless can have higher expected income for the peasants.

The authors compare treatments in which incentive-efficient strikes (disagreements) are possible with alternatives in which efficiency forbids strikes. They find that incentive-efficiency is very helpful in explaining when strikes occur. There is also evidence of substantial heterogeneity in the subjects' altruism and in their risk preferences. This means that the common-knowledge assumptions of game theory cannot be controlled in experiments; but in the authors' experiments the main theoretical conclusions seem robust to violations of these assumptions.

We show that there exist subgame-perfect equilibria in which the union engages in several periods of strikes prior to reaching a final agreement, although both parties are completely rational and fully informed. This has implications for other inefficient phenomena, such as tariff wars, debt negotiations, and wars in general. We characterize the set of equilibria, show that strikes can occur in real time, and discuss extensions of the model, such as lockouts and the possibility of multiple recontracting opportunities.

High prices are the efficient means of signaling, because the consequent loss of sales volume is most damaging for lower-cost, lower-quality products. As time passes and the number of informed consumers increases, the signaling distortion lessens, resulting in a declining price profile. The prediction of high and declining prices is robust across a variety of dynamic models and is consistent with recent empirical findings.

In equilibrium, every firm on the continuous price distribution buys less advertising than is socially optimal. The result is robust if firms advertise in just one medium. If readers of different advertising media are positively correlated, excess advertising can occur in media used exclusively to advertise discount prices.

Permanent attachment of buyer and seller such that transactions take place inside a firm raises the social cost of delivering high quality. Yet, such costly integration is often profitable, because prices exceed marginal cost at equilibria where market transactions provide high quality. This theory can rationalize the empirical finding that middle managers are averse to transactions between profit centers.

When market insurance is provided, supplementary mutual assistance between family and friends (unobservable to market insurers) will occur. When nonmarket insurers have no better information than market insurers, the mutual assistance not only crowds out market insurance, but is also harmful and, therefore, dysfunctional. Alternatively, when nonmarket insurers can observe each other's effort perfectly, mutual assistance is beneficial. These results point to the potential importance of peer-monitoring mechanisms in mitigating moral hazard.

The new method still taxes capital gains only upon realization, but effectively by charging interest on past gains when realization finally occurs, eliminates the incentive to defer such realization. Unlike a similar scheme suggested previously by William Vickrey, the present method does not require knowledge of the potentially unobservable pattern of gains over time. It, thus, is applicable to a very broad range of capital assets.

However, this issue is usually investigated using commodity-tax models that contain no lump-sum taxes. This paper examines a many-consumer economy in which the only tax instruments are commodity taxes and a poll tax (subsidies are negative taxes). The optimal level of public good provision in this economy typically exceeds the first-best level, at least for distributionally neutral public goods.

This paper presents numerical estimates of the effects of federal lending. Existing credit subsidies appear to have important effects on the allocation of credit, but little effect on aggregate investment. Efficiency costs are shown to be large (approximately 1/3 percent of GNP). Government costs exceed fifty cents per dollar of incremental targeted lending. Interactions among programs can eliminate much or all of the original gain provided by a subsidy, especially if borrowers are rationed. The paper also examines the effects of several policy reforms.

The longitudinal nature of the data allows for the identification of pure aging effects. In five of the six areas studied, life-cycle aging effects are present. Only in particle physics, where scientists often speak of being on a "religious quest," is the indication that scientific productivity is not investment-motivated. Vintage effects are also considered. The expectation that the latest educated are the most productive is not generally supported by the data.

We find that one need not invoke increasing returns or externalities to capital to explain these two puzzles. Rather, they are consistent with a constant-returns-to-scale aggregate production function, so long as the exogenous Solow residual process has enough persistence in it. In our model, causality runs exclusively from knowledge to capital, and therefore the apparent absence of an external effect to the capital input says nothing about the importance of spillovers in the creation of knowledge.

Nevertheless, this article reports that credit card interest rates have been exceptionally sticky relative to the cost of funds. Moreover, major credit card issuers have persistently earned from three to five times the ordinary rate of return in banking during the periods 1983-88. The failure of the competitive model appears to be partly attributable to consumers making credit card choices without taking account of the very high probability that they will pay interest on their outstanding balances.

Using recursive procedures on their annual data, the authors obtain a better-fitting, constant, dynamic error-correction (cointegration) model. Results on exogeneity and encompassing imply that the authors' money-demand model is interpretable as a model of money, but not of prices, since its constancy holds only conditionally on contemporaneous prices.

This paper argues that classical statistical tests only indicate that there is not sufficient evidence to reject either specification and provides Bayesian analyses designed to reveal the relative support the data give to the two specifications. The analysis suggests that dividends and prices are more likely to be trend-stationary than integrated, leaving the determination of prices a puzzle.

This paper argues that the reason is that these traditional summary statistics may not be closely related to a forecast's profits. Using profit measures, the authors find only very weak relationships between such summary error statistics and forecast value.

Capital:labor ratios also converged over the long period, though the process was much stronger after 1960. TFP catch-up is found to be positively associated with capital:labor growth and strongest when capital intensity is growing most rapidly. The United States overtook the United Kingdom in technological leadership in 1900 when its capital:labor growth was more than three times higher. The steady deterioration in the United Kingdom's relative TFP since 1900 and the United States' since 1950 are both associated with low rates of capital formation.

In this setting, it is shown that there is often a Nash equilibrium in consumption that will keep the firm producing. Selfish consumers engage in excessive (beyond demand) consumption to keep the firm in business and to protect their surpluses. This is shown to be true in a simple model with perfect information and also in a more realistic model in which consumers are uncertain about the firm's costs.

If a firm's desired price is increasing in others' prices, then the gain from price adjustment after a nominal shock is greater if others adjust. This "strategic complementarity" leads to multiple equilibria in the degree of rigidity. Welfare may be much higher in the equilibria with less rigidity. Thus, nominal rigidity arises from a failure to coordinate price changes.

An explanation is developed in which demandable debt provides incentive-compatible intermediation where the banker has comparative advantage in allocating investment funds but may act against the interests of uninformed depositors. Demandable debt attracts funds by giving depositors an option to force liquidation. Its usefulness in transacting follows from information-sharing between monitors and nonmonitors.

The paper reports estimates of plausible alternative versions of a standard two-country model. Activist policy (either coordinated or uncoordinated) may produce large welfare losses in the absence of learning, if policymakers behave in the wrong model; hence, exogenous money targets and freely flexible exchange rates may be best. However, model learning (from observations on macroeconomic variables) causes coordinated policies to dominate activist uncoordinated policies or exogenous money targets.

Analysis of the rules of the match and of preference lists from twenty-one matches reveals an unstable matching procedure that gives agents incentives to behave strategically. The analysis also shows how the agents act on these incentives and how the resulting strategic behavior has contributed to the longevity of the matching system and to the stability of the resulting matches.

Like the American market, these markets have experienced failures that led to the adoption of centralized market mechanisms. Because different regions employ different centralized mechanisms, these markets provide a test of the hypothesis that the success of the American markets is related to the fact that it produces matches which are stable in the sense that no two agents mutually prefer to be matched to one another than to their assigned partners. Even in the more complex U.K. markets, this kind of stability plays an important role. Centralized markets that produced unstable matches in environments in which agents could act upon instabilities fared no better than the decentralized markets they replaced.

Suppose that, in addition to the money cost, some sort of search, waiting, or other quasi-fixed "effort cost" is needed to obtain goods. The presence of this quasi-fixed cost element will trigger an inventory policy. A shortage equilibrium occurs when effort costs are such that, in the corresponding inventory policy, the flow of desired consumption does not exceed the available supply flow. Stock hoarding, a critical phenomenon in the economics of shortage, emerges as a natural component of this model. A complete characterization of a stationary shortage equilibrium is given. Comparative statics and welfare analysis are performed. The dynamic transition between steady states is analyzed to give insight into the mechanics of how shortages develop.

Although the Soviet respondents were somewhat less likely to accept exchange of money as a solution to personal problems and although their attitudes toward business were less warm, the authors found that the Soviet and American respondents were basically similar in some very important dimensions: in their attitudes toward fairness, income inequality, and incentives and in their understanding of the working of markets.

1991Month:  December Abstract:  This paper reexamines observed international differences in the price of services and the positive correlation of these with per capita GDP differences. Using a general trade model with a nontraced sector, the authors find that differences in countries' factor endowments, populations, trade policies, and trade balances will have ambiguous and sometimes opposite effects on their service prices and real incomes. Estimating the service-price equation using recent data suggests that larger endowments of agricultural land, minerals, and capital, larger trade deficits, and higher prices for tradables increase service prices. Conversely, larger populations and labor forces reduce service prices.

These differences are also reflected in expectations-augmented Phillips curves. The authors use a two-country macro model, with forward-looking price setters, to demonstrate that higher monetary accommodation of inflation and exchange-rate accommodation of inflation differentials increase inflation persistence. The evidence does not contradict this hypothesis. It supports the hypothesis of forward-looking price setters and highlights the empirical significance of the Lucas critique.

To answer that question, the author develops a procedure based on a long-run restriction implied by the consumer's intertemporal budget constraints. In contrast to previous work, the approach here (1) does not require any assumptions on the stochastic properties of labor income, (2) does not impose restrictions on the consumer's information set, and (3) is robust to departures from the permanent-income-hypothesis model. The application of the procedure to postwar U.S. data suggests that consumption is smoother than the permanent-income-hypothesis model predicts.

A real-business-cycle model with endogenous growth is developed and estimated with U.S. data. In the present framework, wage movements do not have to be transitory to generate fluctuations in labor effort. The reduced form is a constrained bivariate output/hours (or real-wage/hours) vector autoregressive process. The bivariate setup provides a useful framework for analyzing the persistence of output fluctuations, given that the theory implies that hours of work contain information about future output movement.

The authors call bubbles of this type "intrinsic" bubbles because they derive all of their variability from exogenous economic fundamentals and none from extraneous factors. Intrinsic bubbles provide a more plausible empirical account of deviations from present-value pricing than do the traditional examples of rational bubbles. Their explanatory potential comes partly from their ability to generate persistent deviations that appear to be relatively stable over long periods.

The process leading to stabilization becomes a "war of attrition," each group attempting to wait the others out and stabilization occurring only when one group concedes and bears a disproportionate share of the burden. The authors solve for the expected time of stabilization in a model of "rational" delay and relate it to several political and economic variables. They motivate this approach and its results by comparison to historical and current episodes.

An export-subsidy policy promotes the (rational) perception that a high-quality export can be provided at a relatively low price. Thus, an export subsidy generates a first-order benefit to welfare by enabling a high-quality export to be sold at a less-distorted high price. The subsidy will also introduce distortions into the price of a low-quality export and the quality-selection process. Since these choices are initially undistorted, however, the export-country welfare loss arising from new distortions is of second-order importance.

The authors answer to this question relies on uncertainty regarding the distribution of gains and losses from reform. They show that there is a bias toward the status quo (and, hence, against efficiency-enhancing reforms) whenever some of the individual gainers and losers from reform cannot be identified beforehand. There are reforms which, once adopted, will receive adequate political support but would have failed to carry the day ex ante. The argument does not rely on risk aversion, irrationality, or hysteresis due to sunk costs.

If, however, there are one hundred customers and the minimum efficient scale requires serving fifteen, the monopoly need only lock up eighty-six customers to forestall entry. If each customer believes that the others will sign, each also believes that no rival seller will enter. Hence, an individual customer loses nothing by signaling the exclusionary agreement and will indeed sign. Thus, naked exclusion can be profitable.

In this paper, the author postulates that bargainers  behave as if they are negotiating over both "absolute" and "relative" money. Absolute money is measured by cash, relative money by the disparity between absolute measures. The resulting model is consistent with previously observed regularities. New experiments provide further support as well as evidence against several alternative explanations. Also finding some support is an extension that predicts that the equilibrium of the standard theory will be observed when bargaining is done in a "tournament" setting.

Bargaining outcomes were everywhere different from equilibrium predictions (both in agreements and in the substantial frequency of disagreements) and differences were observed between countries. Because of the experimental design, the fact that the market behavior is the same in all countries supports the hypothesis that the observed differences are not due to differences in languages, currencies, or experimenters, but may tentatively be attributed to cultural differences.

These patterns are not significantly different between female and male authors. Authors at top-ranked universities and at colleges and low-ranked universities are largely unaffected by the different reviewing practices, but the authors at near-top-ranked universities and at nonacademic institutions have lower acceptance rates under double-blind reviewing.
