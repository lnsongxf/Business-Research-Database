Title:   The Origins of American Industrial Success, 1879-1940. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 651-68
Issue: 4
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The United States became the world's preeminent manufacturing nation at
 the turn of the twentieth century. This study considers the bases for this
 success by examining the factor content of trade in manufactured goods.
 Surprisingly, the most distinctive characteristic of U.S. manufacturing
 exports was intensity in nonreproducible natural resources; furthermore,
 this relative intensity was increasing between 1880 and 1920. The study
 then asks whether resource abundance reflected geological endowment or
 greater exploitation of geological potential. It was mainly the latter.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Unexpected Inflation, Real Wages, and Employment Determination in Union Contracts. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 669-88
Issue: 4
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the effect of nominal contracting provisions on
 employment determination in union contracts. In most contracts, the
 nominal wage rate is wholly or partially predetermined. Real wage rates
 therefore contain unanticipated components that reflect unexpected price
 changes and the degree of indexation. The empirical analysis, based on a
 large sample of indexed and nonindexed contracts, suggests that unexpected
 real wage changes are associated with systematic employment responses in
 the opposite direction. The author concludes that nominal contracting
 provisions play a potentially important role in the cyclical properties
 and persistence of employment movements in the union sector.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Long Swings in the Dollar: Are They in the Data and Do Markets Know It? 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 689-713
Issue: 4
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The value of the dollar appears to move in one direction for long periods
 of time. The authors develop a new statistical model of exchange rate
 dynamics as a sequence of stochastic, segmented time trends. They reject
 the null hypothesis that exchange rates follow a random walk in favor of
 their model of long swings. The authors' model also generates better
 forecasts than a random walk. The specification is a natural framework for
 assessing the importance of the "peso problem" for the dollar. The authors
 nonetheless reject uncovered interest parity.	 Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Testing the Rationality of Price Forecasts: New Evidence from Panel Data. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 714-35
Issue: 4
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper tests the rationality of individual price forecasts in a panel
 of professional forecasters. Here, unlike in most previous studies,
 rationality is not rejected. The results here differ because (1) using
 individual forecasts avoids aggregation bias, (2) comparison of forecasts
 to initial data avoids bias due to data revision, (3) the professional
 forecasters have economic incentives to state their expectations
 accurately, and (4) a new covariance matrix estimator consistent when
 forecast errors are correlated across individuals is used.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Margin Requirements, Volatility, and the Transitory Components of Stock Prices. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 736-62
Issue: 4
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Official margin requirements in the U.S. stock market were established in
 October 1934 to limit the amount of credit available for the purpose of
 buying stocks. Since then, higher or rising margin requirements are
 associated with lower stock price volatility, lower excess volatility, and
 smaller deviations of stock prices from their fundamental values. The
 results hold throughout the post-1934 period and are not very sensitive to
 the exclusion of the turbulent depression years from the sample. Thus,
 margin requirements seem to be an effective policy tool in curbing
 destabilizing speculation.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Business Cycle Models with Endogenous Technology. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 763-78
Issue: 4
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper compares real and monetary business cycle models with and
 without endogenous technical change. If technology is endogenous, the
 properties of these models change significantly. In particular, both real
 and monetary models yield very similar output processes if growth is
 endogenous, and changes in aggregate demand can result in permanent
 changes in productivity, employment, and output. The effect of
 depreciation of technology is examined, and the pattern of real wage
 movements over the cycle when money wages are fixed, but technology is
 changing, is briefly considered.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   A Theory of Managed Trade. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 779-95
Issue: 4
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper proposes a theory that predicts low levels of protection
 during periods of "normal" trade volume coupled with episodes of "special"
 protection when trade volumes surge. This dynamic pattern of protection
 emerges from a model in which countries choose levels of protection in a
 repeated game facing volatile trade swings. High trade volume leads to a
 greater incentive to defect unilaterally from cooperative tariff levels.
 Therefore, as the volume of trade expands, the level of protection must
 rise in a cooperative equilibrium to mitigate the rising trade volume and
 hold the incentive to defect in check.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review

Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors construct a dynamic, two country model of trade and growth in
 which endogenous technological progress results from the profit-maximizing
 behavior of entrepreneurs. They study the role that the external trading
 environment and that trade and industrial policies play in the
 determination of long-run growth rates. Cross-country differences in
 efficiency at R&D versus manufacturing (i.e., comparative advantage) bear
 importantly on the growth effects of economic structure and commercial
 policies.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Fundamental Determinants of the Terms of Trade Reconsidered: Long-run and Long-period Equilibrium. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 816-27
Issue: 4
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Ronald Findlay's analysis of the long-run equilibrium (uniform
 international growth rates) determinants of the terms of trade, in the
 context of North-South models of trade and growth, is reconsidered when
 the North is a Keynesian and a Kaleckian economy. Also examined are the
 determinants of the terms of trade in long-period equilibrium (uniform
 profit rates), so that the consequences of capital mobility are accounted
 for. Two surprising results are noted: first, the long-run terms of trade
 when the North is a Kaleckian economy will be independent of the North's
 markup and, second, in the long-period it is theoretically possible for
 the North to raise its markup, but experience a deterioration in its own
 terms of trade.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Case of the Vanishing Revenues: Auction Quotas with Monopoly. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 828-36
Issue: 4
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the effects of auctioning quota licenses when
 monopoly power exists. Here the sales of licenses will never raise any
 revenue if domestic and foreign markets are segmented. More surprisingly,
 the inability to raise revenue is shown to persist even when arbitrage
 across markets is possible as long as the quota is not too far from the
 free trade import level. This suggests that existing revenue estimates
 from auctioning quota licenses, which are based on the assumption of
 competition, are upwardly biased. It also makes it likely that quotas
 implemented by auctioning licenses, even when set optimally, have adverse
 welfare effects.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  In recent years, the "leverage theory" of tied good sales has faced heavy
 and influential criticism. In an important sense, though, the models used
 by its critics are actually incapable of addressing the leverage theory's
 central concerns. Here the author reconsiders the leverage hypothesis and
 argues that tying can indeed serve as a mechanism for leveraging market
 power. The mechanism through which this leverage occurs, its
 profitability, and its welfare implications are discussed in detail.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Economics of Product Patents. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 860-69
Issue: 4
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a model of product patents in which the patent
 changes the nature of market entry behavior rather than preventing entry
 entirely. The model incorporates three levels of action, namely, the
 innovator's patenting decision, the potential entrant's location decision,
 and possible court action. The analysis demonstrates how the
 characteristics of the patents system and the enforcement framework can
 influence rivals' variety choices and, thus, the market equilibrium. It
 also considers how the system can, in principle, be adjusted to improve
 social welfare.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Are Treble Damages Neutral? Sequential Equilibrium and Private Antitrust Enforcement. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 870-87
Issue: 4
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A sequential equilibrium model of private antitrust enforcement is
 presented. Consumers have incomplete information about cartel costs and
 cannot accurately estimate a priori the damage recovery from an antitrust
 action. Consumers are able to infer cartel costs from the equilibrium
 pricing strategy of firms. The universal divinity criterion is used to
 characterize the sequential equilibrium. It is shown that, for a
 sufficiently large damage multiple, antitrust enforcement effectively
 increases social welfare.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Ex Post Liability for Harm vs. Ex Ante Safety Regulation: Substitutes or Complements? 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 888-901
Issue: 4
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper concerns the regulation of hazardous economic activities.
 Economists have generally viewed ex ante regulations (safety standards,
 Pigouvian fees) that regulate an activity before an accident occurs as
 substitutes for ex post policies (exposure to tort liability) for
 correcting externalities. This paper shows that where there is
 uncertainty, there are inefficiencies associated with the exclusive use of
 negligence liability and that ex ante regulation can correct the
 inefficiencies. In such a case, it is efficient to set the safety standard
 below the level of precaution that would be called for if the standard
 were used alone.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Equilibrium Political Budget Cycles. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 21-36
Issue: 1
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Political business cycle theories generally rely on nominal rigidities
 and voter myopia. This paper offers an equilibrium theory that preserves
 some basic insights from earlier models, though with significant
 refinements. The "political budget cycle" emphasized here is in fiscal
 policy rather than output and inflation; it arises via a multidimensional
 signal process. One can consider the welfare implications of proposals to
 mitigate the cycle and the effects of altering the electoral structure.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Voting on the Budget Deficit. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 37-49
Issue: 1
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes a model in which a group of rational individuals
 votes over the composition and time profile of public spending. All voters
 agree that a balanced budget is ex ante optimal. However, if there is
 disagreement between current and future majorities, a balanced budget is
 not a political equilibrium under majority rule. Under certain conditions,
 a majority of the voters favors a budget deficit, and the equilibrium
 deficit is larger the greater is the polarization among voters.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Arming as a Strategic Investment in a Cooperative Equilibrium. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 50-68
Issue: 1
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  To develop a positive, economic theory of military spending, this
 analysis focuses on a game-theoretic, general equilibrium model of
 international conflict, in which consumption, peaceful investment, and
 military spending are endogenously determined. The analysis illustrates
 that when there is repeated interaction between nations, a game of threats
 and punishments generally will not support a disarmament outcome and that
 fluctuations in military spending can be an endogenous result of
 fluctuations in aggregate economic activity. Furthermore, the analysis
 shows how the relation between aggregate economic activity and military
 spending qualitatively depends on whether governments are acting
 opportunistically or cooperatively.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper advocates a generalized N-firm Stackelberg model as a
 plausible testable alternative description of oligopoly. A pure-strategy
 equilibrium must exist for this model. The main result is that efficiency
 obtains in the limit as the scale of each firm is shrunk relative to
 demand. This is demonstrated for the case of U-shaped average cost and
 also for that of natural monopoly.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Quality vs. Quantity in Military Procurement. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 83-92
Issue: 1
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  It is often argued that the same expenditures on military procurement
 would produce a more effective defense if larger numbers of less
 sophisticated (and thus cheaper) weapons were purchased. This paper shows
 that such a result can occur even if the military derives no private
 consumption value from technically sophisticated weapons. Rather, the
 organization of the decision-making process itself can produce this
 result. This suggests some possible solutions through organizing
 decision-making in a different fashion.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   A Theory of Predation Based on Agency Problems in Financial Contracting. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 93-106
Issue: 1
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  By committing to terminate funding if a firm's performance is poor,
 investors can mitigate managerial incentive problems. These optimal
 financial constraints, however, encourage rivals to ensure that a firm's
 performance is poor; this raises the chance that the financial constraints
 become binding and induce exit. The authors analyze the optimal financial
 contract in light of this predatory threat. The optimal contract balances
 the benefits of deterring predation by relaxing financial constraints
 against the cost of exacerbating incentive problems.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Horizontal Mergers: An Equilibrium Analysis. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 107-26
Issue: 1
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The authors analyze horizontal mergers in Cournot oligopoly. They find
 general conditions under which such mergers raise price, and show that any
 merger not creating synergies raises price. The authors develop a
 procedure for analyzing the effect of a merger on rivals and consumers
 and, thus, provide sufficient conditions for profitable mergers to raise
 welfare. They show that traditional merger analysis can be misleading in
 its use of the Herfindahl Index. Their analysis stresses the output
 responses of large firms not participating in the merger.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  The authors formulate a complete, but analytically simple, equilibrium
 model of vertical mergers to evaluate the logic of standard vertical
 foreclosure claims and the criticisms made of those claims. The model
 includes incentives of the integrated firm and unintegrated input
 suppliers to exclude rivals, and the potential holdout problem. In this
 fully specified model, vertical foreclosure can emerge in equilibrium.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Disadvantageous Oil Tariffs and Dynamic Consistency. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 143-56
Issue: 1
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  A large importer who places relatively greater weight on future than
 current oil consumption will import less oil in the future than if it were
 able to commit itself in advance to future tariffs, and may find itself
 worse off than if it were unable to impose tariffs at all. Futures markets
 and storage modify these adverse effects and may avoid the problem of
 dynamic inconsistency.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   On the Treatment of Anticipated Shocks in Models of Optimal Control with Rational Expectations: An Economic Interpretation. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 157-69
Issue: 1
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The authors suggest a general, heuristic method, based on elementary
 notions of price theory, for dealing with the question of anticipated
 changes in models of perfect foresight. The method is illustrated for the
 case of anticipated shocks to the state variable; in this context the
 standard "shadow price continuity condition" fails, while the method
 presented here applies. After presenting the general solution, it is used
 to analyze various examples of preannounced changes.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Inventories and the Propagation of Sectoral Shocks. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 170-90
Issue: 1
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper contrasts the dynamic properties of an imperfectly competitive
 economy with a representative agent, real business cycle model. For both
 economies, inventories are the important dynamic linkage. The predictions
 of these models with regards to the comovement of employment across
 sectors may differ. Empirical evidence on the comovement of employment
 over the business cycle is consistent with the model of imperfect
 competition with inventory holdings.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Did the Federal Trade Commission's Advertising Substantiation Program Promote More Credible Advertising? 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 191-203
Issue: 1
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the effects of the Federal Trade Commission's
 Advertising Substantiation Program, developed in the early 1970s. This
 program coupled changes in the legal definition of deception with more
 vigorous FTC enforcement. The authors analyze changes in advertising
 intensity, media choice, media wealth, and the progress of new entrants.
 The evidence suggests that adoption of substantiation requirements
 increased the credibility of advertising.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Causes of Preference Reversal. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 204-17
Issue: 1
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Observed preference reversal cannot be adequately explained by violations
 of independence, the reduction axiom, or transitivity. The primary cause
 of preference reversal is the failure of procedure invariance, especially
 the overpricing of low-probability, high-payoff bets. This result violates
 regret theory and generalized (nonindependent) utility models. Preference
 reversal and a new reversal involving time preferences are explained by
 scale compatibility, which implies that payoffs are weighted more heavily
 in pricing than in choice.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Malthusian Selection of Preferences. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 529-44
Issue: 3
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors study natural selection of preferences using a golden-age
 model with endogenous population. In equilibrium, all agents have
 preferences with maximum biological fitness, given resource constraints,
 and total population is the maximum the environment can sustain. Naturally
 selected agents follow the golden rule, acting as if they maximize the
 undiscounted sum of per-capita felicities of current and future
 generations. Selected preferences and, hence, work, saving, consumption,
 and population density vary predictably with environmental differences.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Economics of Modern Manufacturing: Technology, Strategy, and Organization. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 511-28
Issue: 3
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Manufacturing is undergoing a revolution. The mass production model is
 being replaced by a vision of a flexible multiproduct firm that emphasizes
 quality and speedy response to market conditions while utilizing
 technologically advanced equipment and new forms of organization. The
 authors' optimizing model of the firm generates many of the observed
 patterns that mark modern manufacturing. Central to the authors' results
 is a method of handling optimization and comparative statics problems that
 requires neither differentiability nor convexity.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Differential Payments within a Bidder Coalition and the Shapley Value. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 493-510
Issue: 3
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Bidder coalitions at English auctions frequently distribute collusive
 gains among members via a secondary auction of "knockout." When coalition
 members are sufficiently heterogeneous, nested coalition structures are
 observed in which a knockout is conducted at each level of nesting. The
 nested knockout's characteristics are investigated. Within many settings,
 the authors find that the expected payments to coalition members via the
 nested knockout equal the Shapley value. Incentive compatibility problems
 of the nested knockout are also analyzed.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Perfect Equilibria in a Trade Liberalization Game. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 480-92
Issue: 3
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The credibility of temporary protection is examined in a simple infinite
 horizon, perfect information game of timing in which the domestic
 government uses the threat of future liberalization to induce the domestic
 firm to invest. All pure strategy subgame-perfect equilibria are cyclical
 and, surprisingly, one of them implements optimal temporary protection.
 However, this equilibrium fails to pass another credibility criterion
 called "renegotiation-proof." The game has a unique stationary
 subgame-perfect equilibrium in mixed strategies.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Herd Behavior and Investment. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 465-79
Issue: 3
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper examines some of the forces that can lead to herd behavior in
 investment. Under certain circumstances, managers simply mimic the
 investment decisions of other managers, ignoring substantive private
 information. Although this behavior is inefficient from a social
 standpoint, it can be rational from the perspective of managers who are
 concerned about their reputations in the labor market. The authors discuss
 applications of the model to corporate investment, the stock markets, and
 decision-making within firms.	 Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Foreign Exchange Rate Expectations: Micro Survey Data. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 434-49
Issue: 3
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes the panel data of biweekly surveys on the yen/dollar
 exchange rate expectations of forty-four institutions for two years and
 contains four major findings. First, market participants are
 heterogeneous; that is, significant "individual effects" exist in their
 expectation formation. Second, the individual effects have a
 characteristic of "wishful expectations": exporters expect yen
 depreciation and importers expect yen appreciation (relative to others).
 Third, many violate the rational expectations hypothesis. Fourth,
 forecasts with long horizons show less yen appreciation than those with
 short horizons. Cross-equation constraints implied by the consistency of
 the forecast term structure are strongly rejected in the data.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Is the European Community an Optimal Currency Area? Optimal Taxation versus the Cost of Multiple Currencies. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 419-33
Issue: 3
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors propose a view of optimal currency areas that is based on the
 principles of public finance. Inflation taxes are distortionary, and an
 optimal spreading of tax distortions may require high inflation in one
 region and low inflation in another. Each region would need its own
 currency to do this. On the other hand, multiple currencies imply
 valuation and currency conversion costs, which impede trade between
 regions. This tradeoff is explored in the context of the European
 Community's debate over a common currency, using a two-country variant of
 Robert Lucas and Nancy Stokey's cash-in-advance model.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Mean Reversion in Equilibrium Asset Prices. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 398-418
Issue: 3
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper demonstrates that negative serial correlation in long-horizon
 stock returns is consistent with an equilibrium model of asset pricing.
 When investors display only a moderate desire to smooth their consumption,
 commonly used measures of mean reversion in stock prices calculated from
 historical returns data nearly always lie within a 60 percent confidence
 interval of the median of the Monte Carlo distributions implied by the
 authors equilibrium model. From this evidence, the authors conclude that
 the degree of serial correlation in the data could plausibly have been
 generated by their model.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Money, Output, and the Nominal National Debt. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 390-97
Issue: 3
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a model of finitely lived rational agents in which
 unanticipated innovations in the stock of fiat money affect real
 variables. An unanticipated inflation reduces the real value of the
 nominally denominated national debt, thereby reducing the crowding-out of
 capital and/or the tax burden. Both effects stimulate increased investment
 in capital, which leads to an increase in real output and wages in the
 following periods. In contrast with price-surprise models, these real
 effects occur even if the monetary innovation is instantly and perfectly
 observed by agents.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Comparing Information in Forecasts from Econometric Models. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 375-89
Issue: 3
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The information contained in one model's forecast compared to that in
 another can be assessed from a regression of actual values on predicted
 values from the two models. The authors do this for forecasts of real GNP
 growth rates for different pairs of models. The models include a
 structural model (the Fair model), various versions of the vector
 autoregressive model, and various versions of a model the authors call the
 "autoregressive components" model. The authors' procedure requires that
 forecasts make no use of future information and they have been careful to
 try to insure this, including using the version of the Fair model that
 existed in 1976, the beginning of their test period.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

  Taylor's series and logarithmic estimates of health state-dependent

 valuation of nonincremental risk changes and effects of base risks follow
 economic predictions.	 Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Unintended Impacts of Public Investments on Private Decisions: The Depletion of Forested Wetlands. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 337-52
Issue: 3
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  By affecting relative economic returns, infrastructure investments can
 induce major changes in private land use. The authors find that 30 percent
 of forested wetland depletion in the Mississippi Valley has resulted from
 private decisions induced by federal flood-control projects, despite
 explicit federal policy to preserve wetlands. The model aggregates
 individual land-use decisions using a parametric distribution of
 unobserved land quality; dynamic simulations are used to quantify the
 impacts on wetlands of federal projects and other factors.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  The randomly assigned risk of induction generated by the draft lottery is
 used to construct estimates of the effect of veteran status on civilian
 earnings. These estimates are not biased by the fact that certain types of
 men are more likely than others to service in the military. Social
 Security administrative records indicate that, in the early 1980s, long
 after their service in Vietnam had ended, the earnings of white veterans
 were approximately 15 percent less than the earnings of comparable
 nonveterans.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

 stochastic environment. In a model with distortionary taxes, the
 government should smooth tax rates over states of nature as well as over
 time. Government liabilities should be structured to hedge against
 macroeconomic shocks that affect the government budget. The optimal
 structure of government liabilities generally includes some "risky"
 securities that are state-contingent in real terms. The empirical part of
 the paper tests for tax smoothing and then studies state contingencies
 implemented by some specific securities, including nominal debt, long-term
 bonds, equity, and foreign-currency debt.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Overdrafts and the Demand for Money. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1201-16
Issue: 5
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a stochastic analysis of the demand for
 interest-bearing money, such as NOW accounts, when overdrafting is allowed
 at some penalty rate. It is shown that the short-run interest elasticity
 of money demand is probably large (in absolute value) and negative, but in
 the long run this elasticity is much smaller or even positive. It is also
 argued that current definitions of the monetary aggregates, which exclude
 unused credit, may spuriously generate instability of money demand. An
 alternative definition of money stock is suggested and seems to be
 conceptually more satisfying.	 Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Deposit Insurance, Risk, and Market Power in Banking. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1183-1200
Issue: 5
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  A fixed-rate deposit insurance system provides a moral hazard for
 excessive risk taking and is not viable absent regulation. Although the
 deposit insurance system appears to have worked remarkably well over most
 of its fifty-year history, major problems began to appear in the early
 1980s. This paper tests the hypothesis that increases in competition
 caused bank charter values to decline, which in turn caused banks to
 increase default risk through increases in asset risk and reductions in
 capital.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Economic Effects of Production Taxes in a Stochastic Growth Model. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1168-82
Issue: 5
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes the effects of stochastic taxes on production in
 simple stochastic growth model. In so doing, the paper explicitly examines
 the importance of uncertainty on the decisions of individual agents. This
 importance is emphasized by comparing economic outcome to various
 realizations of tax rates under uncertainty and perfect foresight.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   A Social Exchange Approach to Voluntary Cooperation. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1157-67
Issue: 5
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  A social exchange approach to voluntary cooperation is developed on the
 assumption that voluntary cooperative behavior is motivated by social
 approval, which is conceptualized as an emotional activity. The associated
 unique Nash equilibrium may have attractive welfare properties and
 provides an understanding of spontaneous norm emergence. Furthermore, the
 opening of a market or government intervention for the collective good is
 shown to affect voluntary cooperation negatively.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Productivity, Health, and Inequality in the Intrahousehold Distribution of Food in Low-Income Countries. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1139-56
Issue: 5
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  A model is formulated incorporating linkages among nutrition,
 labor-market productivity, health heterogeneity, and the intrahousehold
 distribution of food and work activities in a subsistence economy.
 Empirical results, based on a sample of households from Bangladesh,
 indicate that, despite considerable intrahousehold disparities in calorie
 consumption, households are averse to inequality. Furthermore, consistent
 with the model, the results also indicate that both the higher level and
 greater variance in the calories consumed by men relative to women reflect
 in part the greater participation by men in activities in which
 productivity is sensitive to health status.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Intergenerational Income-Group Mobility and Differential Fertility. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1125-38
Issue: 5
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  One question development economists are especially interested in, but so
 far left unanswered, is how the societal income distribution would be
 affected by introducing a family-planning program to reduce the
 reproduction rate of the poor, which is usually high in developing
 countries. The purpose of this paper is to search for analytical answers
 to this question. The authors are able to make definite comparisons about
 some class of inequality measures of the steady-state societal income
 distributions, and these comparisons provide strong theoretical support in
 favor for the above-mentioned family-planning program.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   To Innovate or Not to Innovate: Incentives and Innovation in Hierarchies. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1105-24
Issue: 5
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Hierarchical organizations often perform poorly in inducing the adoption
 of innovations.  The authors examine a principal offering contracts to
 agents who make unobservable effort and adoption-of-innovation choices
 (yielding moral hazard); who occupy jobs of differing, unobserved
 productivities (yielding adverse selection); and who engage in a repeated
 relationship with the principal (causing a ratchet effect to arise).
 Increasing the rate of adoption of an innovation in such an organization
 causes the incentive costs of adoption to increase at an increasing rate.
 Relatively low rates of adoption may then be a response to the prohibitive
 incentive costs of higher adoption rates.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Year: 1990

Abstract:
  This paper relates firm location choice and consumer search. Firms that
 cluster together attract consumers by facilitating price comparison, but
 clustering increases the intensity of local competition. The author
 constructs a simple model which shows that firms may choose head-on
 competition by locating together. Under reasonable conditions, this is the
 only equilibrium outcome.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  This paper presents a dynamic general equilibrium model of North-South
 trade in which research and development races between firms determine the
 rate of product innovation in the North. Tariffs designed to protect dying
 industries in the North from Southern competition reduce the steady-state
 number of dominant firms in the North, reduce the rate of product
 innovation, and increase the relative wage of Northern workers.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Durable-Good Monopoly and Best-Price Provisions. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1062-76
Issue: 5
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Best-price provisions guarantee buyers that the prices they pay are the
 lowest available. If the seller subsequently cuts price, then each
 previous buyer is entitled to a refund. A durable-good monopolist who
 offers certain forms of these provisions can construct a consistent plan
 yielding the same profits as rental agreements and contracts with explicit
 quantity commitments. The provisions require special circumstances to be
 practical, but they are simple and effective and appear in a variety of
 economic settings. Three applications are discussed: international
 commodity agreements, markets for electric turbogenerators, and markets
 for financial claims.	 Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Optimal Bypass and Cream Skimming. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1042-61
Issue: 5
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a normative model of regulatory policy toward bypass
 and cream skimming. It analyzes the effects of bypass on second-degree
 price discrimination, on the rent of the regulated firm, and on the
 welfare of low-demand customers. It shows that pricing under marginal cost
 may be optimal for the regulated firm, excessive cream skimming occurs if
 access to the bypass technology is not regulated, and the prohibition of
 bypass may increase or decrease the regulated firm's rent.   Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Insider Trading in a Rational Expectations Economy. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1022-41
Issue: 5
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  It is often argued that efficiency considerations require society to
 freely permit insider trading. In this article, an opposing efficiency
 argument is formalized. The model incorporates an investment stage
 followed by a trading stage. If "outsiders" expect "insiders" to take
 advantage of them in trading, outsiders will reduce their investment. The
 insiders' loss from this diminished investor confidence may more than
 offset their trading gains. Consequently, a prohibition on insider trading
 may effect a Pareto improvement. Insiders are made better off if they can
 precommit not to trade on their privileged information; government
 regulation accomplished exactly this.	 Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Market Liquidity, Hedging, and Crashes. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 999-1021
Issue: 5
Volume: 80
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  In the absence of significant news, hedging strategies were blamed for
 the stock market crash of October 1987; but traditional models cannot
 explain how a relatively small amount of selling could cause so large a
 price drop. The authors develop a rational expectations model in which
 prices play an important role in shaping expectations; markets are much
 less liquid in their model than in traditional models. Discontinuities (or
 "crashes") can occur even with relatively little hedging. The model is
 consistent with theories as disparate as Keynes' "beauty contest" insights
 and Thom's "catastrophe" analysis and suggests means to reduce volatility.  Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.
