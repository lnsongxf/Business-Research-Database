Title:   Changing Beliefs and Systematic Rational Forecast Errors with Evidence from Foreign Exchange. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 621-36
Issue: 4
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper addresses a new interpretation to the appearance, in the early
 1980s, of systematic errors in forecasting the dollar exchange rate.
 Following a change in the process of a fundamental variable, market
 participants revise their beliefs about the process using Bayes' Rule.
 Since the market does not immediately recognize the change, forecast
 errors are, on average, wrong during a period when the market is
 rationally learning. For conservative parameter values, the learning
 behavior of the dollar exchange rate in the early 1980s appears consistent
 with about half of the dollar's underprediction implied by the forward
 market.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Exchange Rate Pass-Through When Market Share Matters. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 637-54
Issue: 4
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors investigate the pass-through from exchange rates to import
 prices when firms' future demands depend on their current market shares.
 They show that profit-maximizing foreign firms may either raise or lower
 their dollar export prices when the dollar appreciates temporarily (i.e.,
 the pass-through may be perverse) and that current import prices may be
 more sensitive to expected future exchange rates than to current exchange
 rates. They present evidence that suggests the behavior of expected future
 exchange rates may provide a clue to the puzzling recent behavior of U.S.
 import prices.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Dynamic Effects of Aggregate Demand and Supply Disturbances. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 655-73
Issue: 4
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors interpret fluctuations in GNP and unemployment as due to two
 types of disturbances: disturbances that have a permanent effect on output
 and disturbances that do not. They interpret the first as supply
 disturbances, the second as demand disturbances. Demand disturbances have
 a hump-shaped, mirror-image effect on output and unemployment. The effect
 of supply disturbances on output increases steadily over time, peaking
 after two years and reaching a plateau after five years.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Labor Demand and the Structure of Adjustment Costs. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 674-89
Issue: 4
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This study examines the costs firms face in adjusting labor demand to
 exogenous shocks. Evidence on monthly plant-level data shows that
 adjustment proceeds in jumps: employment is unchanged in response to small
 shocks, but moves instantaneously to a new equilibrium if the shocks are
 large. Results in the large literature that assumes smooth adjustment are
 due to aggregation of this nonlinear relation. The finding has
 implications for cyclical changes in productivity; for severance pay,
 layoff, and plant-closing restrictions; and for all other policies that
 affect the cost of adjusting employment.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Entry, Exit, and Diffusion with Learning by Doing. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 690-99
Issue: 4
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Early entry has the advantage of higher revenues per unit of output early
 on. Late entry has the benefit of learning from the experience of earlier
 entrants, and hence lower production costs. The advantages are balanced
 off in a continuous-time, perfect-foresight equilibrium. Competition
 generates S-shaped diffusion, and staggered entry and exit. A monopolist
 will innovate less than a competitive industry, but the innovation that he
 does do, he will do sooner.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Oligopolistic Pricing with Sequential Consumer Search. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 700-712
Issue: 4
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  N identical stores compete by choosing prices for a homogeneous good with
 constant marginal costs. Consumers search sequentially with perfect recall
 for the lowest price. One class of consumers, called shoppers, have zero
 search costs, while all other consumers have a positive search cost, c.
 There is a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium price distribution with the
 property that it changes smoothly from "marginal cost pricing" when all
 consumers are shoppers and/or c = 0 and "monopoly pricing" when no
 consumers are shoppers. Remarkably, as the number of stores increases, the
 Nash equilibrium becomes more monopolistic.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   A Political Theory of Government Debt and Deficits in a Neo-Ricardian Framework. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 713-32
Issue: 4
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  In the presence of different abilities, and therefore different bequests,
 some individuals are bequest constrained even in a neo-Ricardian world.
 Such individuals vote for taxes on future generations, through the
 issuance of bonds, thereby increasing their current consumption. This
 produces some crowding out of capital, reduces wage rates, and increases
 the interest rate. As a consequence, even unconstrained individuals are no
 longer indifferent to the size of government debt. The paper derives
 conditions that are conducive to larger debt and deficits when each of the
 living generations determines current taxes, social security benefits, and
 the national debt by majority rule.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Inflation Tax in a Real Business Cycle Model. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 733-48
Issue: 4
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Money is incorporated into a real business cycle model using a
 cash-in-advance constraint. The model is used to analyze whether the
 business cycle is different in high-inflation and low-inflation economies
 and to analyze the impact of variability in the growth rate of money. The
 welfare cost of the inflation tax is measured and the steady-state
 properties of high and low inflation economies are compared. The welfare
 cost of a sustained (10 percent) inflation is estimated to be between 0.11
 percent and 0.4 percent of GNP. The features of the business cycle are the
 same in high and low inflation economies, but the steady-state paths may
 be quite different.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Theory and Misbehavior of First-Price Auctions. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 749-62
Issue: 4
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Recent experimental evidence appears to reject simple Nash equilibrium
 models of bidding behavior in first-price auctions. The author presents a
 methodological critique of this evidence. Existing tests have concentrated
 on deviations of subjects from predictions in the message space of the
 action: bid deviations. The author suggests that it is more natural to
 evaluate subject behavior in expected payoff space. He concludes that the
 evidence against the simple models is not significant enough to warrant
 their rejection.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Strategic Voting in Agenda-Controlled Committee Experiments. 
Journal: American Economic Review

Issue: 4
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper reports results of committee voting experiments with a fixed
 agenda that specified a sequence of binary decisions. In this particular
 context, the agenda setter can control the ultimate committee decision if
 it is known whether voting behavior is myopic or strategic. Subjects
 initially voted in accordance with myopic voting rules; strategic behavior
 was more prevalent with experience. The use of the same induced
 preferences in successive meetings was more likely to induce strategic
 voting than the provision of public information concerning the numbers of
 voters of each preference type.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Effect of Wage Bargains on the Stock Market Value of the Firm. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 774-800
Issue: 4
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The author estimates the change in the value of common stock resulting
 from an unexpected change in collectively bargained labor costs. Using
 bargaining unit wage data and NYSE stock returns, he estimates a dollar
 for dollar trade-off between these variables. This result is consistent
 with stock valuations based on present value maximizing managerial
 decisions; that is, the results are consistent with Hotelling's lemma. The
 author also finds support for the hypothesis that collective bargains
 maximize the sum of shareholder and union member wealth; that is, the
 results are consistent with strong efficiency in the contracting
 environment.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 801-15
Issue: 4
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Private information models of strikes suggest that the strike is used as
 an information revealing device by the union in the presence of
 asymmetrical information. A testable prediction of these models is that
 there is a negative relationship between strikes and the unpredicted
 component of the wage. This paper finds evidence of such a relationship in
 a large sample of U.S. labor contracts. The real wage falls by about 3
 percent after a strike lasting one hundred days.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Agency Costs, Net Worth, and Business Fluctuations. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 14-31
Issue: 1
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a simple neoclassical model of the business cycle in
 which the condition of borrowers' balance sheets is a source of output
 dynamics. The mechanism is that higher borrower net worth reduces the
 agency costs of financing real capital investments. Business upturns
 improve net worth, lower agency costs, and increase investment, which
 amplifies the upturn; vice versa, for downturns. Shocks that affect net
 worth (as in a debt-deflation) can initiate fluctuations.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Cheap Talk and the Fed: A Theory of Imprecise Policy Announcements. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 32-42
Issue: 1
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the problem faced by the Federal Reserve in
 announcing its private information about its future policies. Because it
 would like to manipulate expectations and pursue a time-inconsistent
 policy, the Fed cannot reveal its policy objectives precisely and
 credibly. It can, however, communicate some information about its goals
 through the "cheap talk" mechanism of Vincent Crawford and Joel Sobel:
 making announcements that are imprecise, and only giving ranges within
 which these goals may lie.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper shows that, under fairly general conditions, lending to small
 countries must be supported by the direct sanctions available to creditors
 and cannot be supported by a country's "reputation for repayment." This
 distinction is critically important for understanding the true underlying
 nature of sovereign lending contracts and for comparing policy
 alternatives for dealing with the developing country debt problem.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Optimal Contracts with Lock-In. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 51-68
Issue: 1
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The authors analyze incomplete long-term contracts when buyers incur
 relationship-specific set-up costs and sellers choose product or service
 quality that is not verifiable to third parties. If set-up costs are
 observable, the first-best outcome can be achieved even though contracts
 cannot enforceably specify quality; this does not even require long-term
 contracts. If set-up costs are unobservable, however, then long-term price
 contracts can strictly outperform short-term contracts. Equilibrium may
 involve either inefficiently low quality with no buyer switching or
 efficient quality with inefficient switching. A policy of taxing
 switching, or the availability of "budget-breaking" third parties, can
 improve welfare.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Inflexible Rules in Incentive Problems. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 69-84
Issue: 1
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  In practice, contracts generally involve "standard terms" or "rules,"
 allowing for variations only under "exceptional" circumstances. The
 authors develop a simple model in which optimal contracts display this
 feature, even in the absence of transactions costs and bounded
 rationality. Rules arise when an agent has "countervailing incentives" to
 misrepresent his private information. These incentives are optimally
 created by endowing the agent with a critical factor of production ex
 ante. The implications of the findings are examined in three different
 settings: (1) regulating the activities of a firm that also participates
 in unregulated markets; (2) labor contracting involving mobility
 restrictions; and (3) legal contracting with provisions for renegotiation.    Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Quality Distortion by a Discriminating Monopolist. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 96-105
Issue: 1
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The standard model of monopolistic imperfect quality discrimination
 involving consumer self-selection has shown that no distortion occurs at
 the highest quality level, while all lower quality levels are degraded in
 order to maintain profitable market segmentation. This result flows from
 the assumption that consumers with a higher total utility of quality also
 have a higher marginal utility of quality. The paper develops a reasonable
 model in which the standard assumption is not satisfied, and this
 alternative model yields vastly different conclusions regarding the form
 of quality distortion. In particular, quality may be enhanced, not
 degraded, to maintain profitable market segmentation.	 Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Gradual Reforms of Capital Income Taxation. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 106-24
Issue: 1
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes the intertemporal allocation effects of anticipated
 tax rate changes, reconsidering the recommendations of the Meade Committee
 in a perfect foresight general equilibrium model of economic growth. It is
 shown that the R-base (or consumption) tax can be more distortionary than
 an income tax and that a revenue-neutral integration of corporate and
 personal taxation will lower social welfare. Moreover, it is argued that a
 dividend tax dominates the R-base tax because it places its distortions on
 the financial, rather than on the real, side of the economy.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Efficiency of the Market for Single-Family Homes. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 125-37
Issue: 1
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Tests of the efficiency of single family home prices are performed using
 repeat sales prices of 39,210 individual homes in Atlanta, Chicago,
 Dallas, and San Francisco/Oakland for 1970-86. The market does not appear
 to be efficient. Year-to-year changes in prices tend to be followed by
 changes in the same direction in the subsequent year. Moreover,
 information about real interest rates does not appear to be incorporated
 in prices. There is, thus, a profitable trading rule for persons who are
 free to time the purchase of their homes. Still, overall, individual
 housing price changes are not very forecastable.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 138-77
Issue: 1
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper evaluates alternative explanations for the dramatic increase
 in black employment in South Carolina manufacturing that occurred in the
 mid-1960s. Black progress in traditionally segregated sectors of
 manufacturing in operation at the time Jim Crow laws were passed cannot be
 attributed to tight labor markets, the decline of agriculture, or the
 growth of education of the black workforce. The only plausible explanation
 is federal government civil rights and affirmative action policy. For
 newer industries that entered the state on a large scale after World War
 II, the growth of skills among blacks accounts for black economic
 progress.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Is the Test Score Decline Responsible for the Productivity Growth Decline? 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 178-97
Issue: 1
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The test score decline between 1967 and 1980 was large (about 1.25 grade
 level equivalents) and historically unprecedented. New estimates of the
 trends in academic achievement, of the effect of academic achievement on
 productivity, and of trends in the quality of the work force are
 developed. The test score decline did not cause the post-1965 productivity
 growth slowdown, but it did contribute to its perpetuation. If test scores
 had continued to grow after 1967 at the rate prevailing in the previous
 quarter century, labor force quality would have been 2.9 percent ($86
 billion) greater in 1987, 5.5 percent greater in 2000, and 6.7 percent
 greater in 2010.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Health and Earnings of Rejected Disability Insurance Applicants. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 482-503
Issue: 3
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Applicants for Social Security disability benefits who fail to pass the
 medical screening form a natural "control" group for beneficiaries. Data
 drawn from the 1972 and 1978 surveys of the disabled done for the Social
 Security Administration show that fewer than 50 percent of rejected male
 applicants work. Typical earnings of those that do are less than 59
 percent of median earnings for other men their age. These data cast doubt
 on recent econometric work that suggests that the disincentive effects of
 the Social Security Disability Program have been substantial.	 Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   In Quest of the Slutsky Diamond. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 468-81
Issue: 3
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The Slutsky equation can be constructed as a parallelogram (a diamond),
 the area of which is proportional to the elasticity of substitution. This
 construction permits to show immediately that demand functions become
 concave on an interval if the elasticity of substitution increases
 sufficiently. Also, the diamond sheds light on the fact that the
 production level increases with the elasticity of substitution. As an
 application, the author shows that the elasticity of substitution has a
 direct bearing not only on the rate of growth of an economy, but also on
 the very existence of sustained growth.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Dependents and the Demand for Life Insurance. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 452-67
Issue: 3
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  A breadwinner's demand for life insurance depends on the demographic
 structure of his or her household. The author captures the relationship by
 extending Menahem E. Yaari's life insurance framework to include the
 preferences of all household members explicitly. In many households, the
 insured is the husband and the beneficiaries are his wife and offspring.
 Their demand for insurance of the husband's life is derived from a life
 cycle model in which income is uncertain. The results are intuitively
 appealing in that they describe the explicit calculation made by
 purchasers of life insurance. Empirical estimates based on observed life
 insurance ownership also are encouraging.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Simple Analytics of Debt-Equity Swaps. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 440-51
Issue: 3
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Recent attempts to resolve the international debt crisis have lead some
 countries to engage in debt-equity swaps. This paper explores conditions
 under which such transactions are beneficial to the debtor, as well as the
 creditors. It identifies a market failure that may prevent the emergence
 of mutually beneficial swaps and analyzes the effects of swaps on the
 investment level in the debtor country.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Measuring the Efficiency Cost of Taxing Risky Capital Income. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 427-39
Issue: 3
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper derives a measure of the efficiency cost of taxing risky
 capital income in an infinite horizon stochastic model. The resulting
 expression differs from all those proposed in the existing literature. The
 correct measure of efficiency cost will normally be smaller than any of
 those used in policy studies, possibly dramatically so. Uncertainty
 changes the expression for efficiency cost through effects arising not
 only from stochastic capital gains on existing capital, but also from
 stochastic costs of replacing existing capital. The latter effect reduces
 efficiency costs and normally outweighs the first effect.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Preference Reversals without the Independence Axiom. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 408-26
Issue: 3
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The preference reversal phenomenon was believed to be inconsistent with
 the transitivity axiom of decision theory. However, recent theoretical
 papers have demonstrated that the preference reversals that were observed
 in earlier experiments could be explained by subject violations of the
 independence axiom or the compound lottery axiom. Therefore, those
 preference reversals are not known to be inconsistent with generalization
 of expected utility theory that replace the independence axiom. The
 present paper reports the results of experiments in which a substantial
 proportion of subject responses violate the asymmetry axiom. These results
 are inconsistent with expected utility theory and its generalizations.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Three Variants on the Allais Example. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 392-407
Issue: 3
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Three variants on the famous Allais example were administered to student
 subjects. Two variants involved small changes in the example, yet greatly
 diminished the qualitative behavior known as the Allais Paradox. The third
 variant is almost a direct test of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's
 certainty effect against Mark Machina's fanning out hypothesis; the
 results favor the certainty effect over the fanning out hypothesis for at
 least the case of straight line indifference curves.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Electronic Mail Game: Strategic Behavior under "Almost Common Knowledge." 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 385-91
Issue: 3
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper addresses a paradoxical game theoretic example which is
 closely related to the coordinated attack problem. Two players have to
 play one of two possible coordination games. Only one of them receives
 information about the coordination game to be played. It is shown that
 even if a large (but finite) number of propositions of the type "i knows
 that j knows that i knows... that the game is G" are true, the game
 theoretic situation is very different from when the coordination game
 played is common knowledge. The example emphasizes the importance of the
 common knowledge assumption in game theory.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   An Experimental Study of Sequential Bargaining. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 355-84
Issue: 3
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  In a study of alternating offer bargaining with discounting, perfect
 equilibrium was found to have little predictive power under the
 conventional assumption that bargainers' utility is measured by their
 monetary payoffs. Instead, the authors' data exhibit a first mover
 advantage, independent of the equilibrium prediction. However the pattern
 of rejected offers and counterproposals shows bargainers' utility was not
 measured by their monetary payoffs. The authors also reanalyze data from
 earlier experiments, finding a similar pattern of rejections and
 counterproposals. This suggests that uncontrolled nonmonetary components
 of utility may have played a role in those experiments also, offering a
 possible explanation for the mutually inconsistent conclusions reached.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Inventories as Factors of Production and Economic Fluctuations. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 338-54
Issue: 3
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a theory of inventory investment by
 stage-of-processing, and uses it to examine the role of inventory
 investment in economic fluctuations. The model, in which inventories are
 treated as factors of production, is estimated for four durable goods
 industries. Three conclusions emerge from the estimation. First, the
 estimates generally satisfy the theoretical restrictions. Second, the
 elasticity of inventory demand with respect to output is high, indicating
 an important accelerator effect. Finally, the estimates suggest that
 shifts in the demand for inventories are an important source of economic
 fluctuations.	 Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Sensitivity of Tests of the Intertemporal Allocation of Consumption to Near-Rational Alternatives. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 319-37
Issue: 3
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Suppose a consumer sets consumption equal to income each period, rather
 than following the optimal permanent income decision rule. How much
 utility does he lose? This paper finds that the answer is typically less
 than 10 cents-$1 per quarter in environments specified by popular tests on
 aggregate data. It includes calculations of the costs of excess
 sensitivity and excess smoothness to income and interest rate changes and
 the costs of ignoring information. It concludes that the theory does not
 make predictions for aggregate tests that are robust to small costs, such
 as information or transactions.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review

Volume: 79
Year: 1989

Abstract:
  This paper examines the effects of changes in financial disclosure
 attributed to the Securities Act of 1933 on the distribution of returns
 earned by investors. The regulation's effects should be most pronounced
 where private information costs were the greatest. Empirical tests control
 for prior stock market issues (experience) and the existence of
 third-party appraisal. Findings suggest that, prior to regulation,
 investors held rational price expectations in markets characterized by low
 information costs. The dispersion of abnormal returns (investors' forecast
 errors) is significantly lower following the Securities Act.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Social Security as Trade among Living Generations. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1182-95
Issue: 5
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors study social security legislated endogenously by altruistic,
 overlapping generations. Starting from a steady-state equilibrium without
 social security, both generations living in a period can gain from
 legislation that mandates transfers from young to old in that and all
 subsequent periods. The social security allocation is Pareto optimal.
 Later living pairs of generations may lose, but do not amend the law.	 Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1165-81
Issue: 5
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The author compares the incentives firms have to produce individual
 components compatible with components of other manufacturers instead of
 "systems" composed of components that are incompatible with components of
 competing manufacturers. He shows that, even in the absence of positive
 consumption externalities (" network" externalities), prices and profits
 will be higher in the regime of compatibility. Equilibrium total surplus
 could be higher in either regime. Both regimes overprovide variety
 compared to the surplus-maximizing solution.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   A Traditional Interpretation of Macroeconomic Fluctuations. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1146-64
Issue: 5
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Under the traditional interpretation of macroeconomic fluctuations,
 aggregate demand shocks move output and prices in the same direction,
 while aggregate supply shocks move output and prices in opposite
 directions. This paper examines the joint behavior of U.S. output,
 unemployment, prices, wages, and nominal money and asks whether it is
 consistent with this interpretation. The answer is a qualified yes.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Why Don't the Prices of Stocks and Bonds Move Together? 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1132-45
Issue: 5
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The 1970s were associated with very low real interest rates and a large
 drop in equity values relative to dividends and earnings. This paper
 explores the possible roles of increased risk and reduced productivity
 growth in accounting for the behavior of bond and stock prices in a simple
 general equilibrium model. Both disturbances unambiguously lower the
 riskless interest rate, but may cause the stock market to respond
 perversely depending on the degree of aversion to intertemporal
 substitution and the share of the corporate sector in total wealth.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   On the Relation between Reschedulings and Bank Value. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1117-31
Issue: 5
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The effect of developing country loan reschedulings on large U.S. banks
 is investigated using an event study methodology. The major finding
 concerns the evolving nature of the impact of loan reschedulings. During
 1978-80, reschedulings had a positive effect on bank returns, in contrast
 to the negative impact found for the 1981-83 period. An explanation for
 these results is provided by a model of the rescheduling process that
 recognizes the noncompetitive aspects of rescheduling negotiation.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper estimates and evaluates monetary policy rules within the
 context of a structural open economy macroeconomic model of the United
 States under flexible exchange rates. The major result is that a monetary
 policy rule, which stabilizes the rate of growth of nominal GNP, receives
 considerable empirical support. The rule provides a better fit than a
 number of alternatives, including strict inflation stability, strict
 output stability, and real exchange rate stabilization.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1088-1105
Issue: 5
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The excess sensitivity of consumption to current income fluctuations is
 higher in countries where consumers borrow less. Low levels of consumer
 debt can result either from capital market imperfections or from a low
 demand for loans. The evidence suggests that the former view is more
 appropriate than the latter, and thus supports the hypothesis that excess
 sensitivity may be attributed to liquidity constraints, rather than to
 other factors.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Import Competition and the Stock Market Return to Capital. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1065-87
Issue: 5
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors measure the responsiveness of returns to capital invested in
 six U.S. industries to shocks to the prices of competing import goods.
 Unanticipated, positive shocks to import prices cause higher than normal
 stock-market returns in all six industries. The magnitudes of these
 responses are consistent with the hypothesis that capital is highly
 specific to its sector of use in five of the six industries studied.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Effects of Capital Income Taxation on International Competitiveness and Trade Flows. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1045-64
Issue: 5
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Using an intertemporal equilibrium model, this paper analyzes how lower
 source-based taxes on capital income impact trade performance and
 international competitiveness. It shows that, depending on import shares
 and intertemporal and intratemporal substitution elasticities, capital
 accumulation may induce changes in real interest rates and the terms of
 trade that stimulate domestic saving--even if financial capital is
 perfectly mobile internationally. Import shares appear important
 determinants of exchange-rate effects. Numerical simulations illustrate
 these results.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  A dynastic cycle is a periodic alternation of society between despotism
 and anarchy. In a society of farmers, rulers, and bandits, population
 growth simultaneously impoverishes farmers and reduces the ruler's surplus
 per head. Society evolves into a despotic stationary state or into a
 dynastic cycle dependent on whether poverty among farmers chokes off
 population growth before the surplus shrinks to the point where rulers
 turn to banditry.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Issue: 5
Volume: 79
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The apparent convergence of OECD income levels since 1950 is subjected to
 rigorous testing that suggests that there has occurred a systematic
 process of catching up in levels of total factor productivity. An
 econometric model of relative economic growth exhibits parameter stability
 over three decades, including the period after 1973, and statistical
 robustness, particularly with respect to sample selection. A reassessment
 is made of OECD comparative economic growth performance.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Volume: 79
Year: 1989

Abstract:
  This paper examines effects of the legal rules for property division at
 divorce on investment in human capital during marriage. The authors show
 that current rules generally lead to suboptimal levels of investment and
 spousal support, or to inequitable distribution of the returns from such
 investment, or both. They propose a new rule that performs better than the
 existing rules on both efficiency and equity criteria and that requires no
 more information than the existing rules.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

  Empirical results in this paper indicate that firm-specific wage growth

 finding suggests that within-firm wage growth is mainly determined by
 contemporaneous productivity growth. The results provide no evidence that
 contractual considerations are an important source of firm-specific wage
 growth.   Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  The existence of geographically mediated "spillovers" from university
 research to commercial innovation is explored using state-level
 time-series data on corporate patents, corporate R&D, and university
 research. A significant effect of university research on corporate patents
 is found, particularly in the areas of drugs and medical technology, and
 electronics, optics, and nuclear technology. In addition, university
 research appears to have an indirect effect on local innovation by
 inducing industrial R&D spending.  Copyright 1989 by American Economic Association.
