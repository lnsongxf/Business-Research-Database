Title:   Forecasting the Depression: Harvard versus Yale. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 595-612
Issue: 4
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Was the Depression forecastable? After the crash, how long should it have
 taken contempo rary forecasters to realize how severe the downturn was
 going to be? These questions are addressed by studying the predictions of
 the Harv ard Economic Service and Yale's Irving Fisher during 1929 and the
 ear ly 1930s. The data assembled by the Harvard and Yale forecasters, tog
 ether with modern historical data, are subjected to statistical analy sis
 to learn whether their verbal pronouncements were consistent with the
 data. Both the Harvard and Yale forecasters were systematically too
 optimistic. Yet, nothing in the data suggests that the optimism w as
 unwarranted.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Issue: 4
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  An unemployment rate for the urban population living in the European
 U.S.S.R. for the late 1970s is calculated from a survey of 2,793 former
 Sovi et citizens residing in the United States. Patterns of unemployment i
 ncidence, frequency of multiple spells, and unemployment duration by
 demographic characteristics are compared with U.S. patterns. In contr ast,
 similar unemployment rates for Soviet men and women, and a posit ive
 relation between education and unemployment, are found. The Sovie t
 unemployment rate is low compared to Western rates for the 1970s, b ut has
 been matched by West Germany and Japan in high-employment year s.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Costs of Price Adjustment and the Welfare Economics of Inflation and Disinflation. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 633-46
Issue: 4
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper studies the welfare consequences of inflation and disinflation
 in a model in which monopol istic firms incur a fixed cost of price
 adjustment. It is shown that a moderately increasing price level is
 associated with higher social welfare than a perfectly stable price level,
 and the model therefore provides theoretical support for the widespread
 belief that a little bit of inflation is good for the economy.
 Nevertheless, it is also tr ue that the eradication of a moderate
 inflation leads to an increase in social welfare.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The author studies models in which debt repudiation, openly or through
 inflation, is possible. The government maximizes the utility of the
 representative individual, and the author focuses on n o-precommitment
 equilibria of the Barro-Gordon type. He shows cases i n which the
 existence of government bonds generate multiple perfect-f oresight
 equilibria. However, price indexation and/or interest-rate c eilings are
 shown to be possible solutions of the equilibrium multipl icity problem.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Social Contracts as Assets: A Possible Solution to the Time-Consistency Problem. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 662-77
Issue: 4
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors present a new solution to the time-consistency problem that
 appears capable of enforcing ex ante policy i n settings where other
 enforcement mechanisms do not work. The soluti on involves a social
 contract that specifies the optimal ex ante poli cy and is effectively
 sold by successive old generations to successiv e young generations, who
 pay for the social contract through intergen erational transfers. Both old
 and young generations have an economic incentive to fulfill the social
 contract. The authors apply the solut ion to show how an equilibrium
 without excessive capital taxation can be enforced, despite an ongoing
 temptation to impose ex post capital levies.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors present a model suggesting that innovative output is
 influenced by R&D and market struc ture characteristics. Using a new and
 direct measure of innovation in a cross-section regression model
 estimating the total number of inno vations and large- and small-firm
 innovations, they find that: (1) th e total number of innovations is
 negatively related to concentration and unionization, and positively
 related to R&D, skilled labor, and t he degree to which large firms
 comprise the industry; and (2) these d eterminants have disparate effects
 on large and small firms.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 691-700
Issue: 4
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper investigates second-best (transfers in kind) and third-best
 (subsidies and taxes) Pare to optima in a simple model were government
 lacks full information ab out consumer types (who is able, who is infirm).
 These Pareto optima rely on self-selection. The authors show that those
 second-best Paret o optima which are not also first-best (some do exist)
 can only be su pported by rationing. They also show that every third-best
 optimum, o ther than the equal-income Walrasian equilibrium, is
 Pareto-dominated by some second-best optimum. In addition, standard
 "willingness-to- pay" cost-benefit tests are inappropriate in this
 environment.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  This paper derives the essential elements of tax systems as the outcome
 of rational behavior in a model w here government maximizes expected
 support and where opposition to ta xation depends on the loss in full
 income. The analysis treats the le vel of expenditures as endogenous and
 integrates the influence of adm inistration costs with that of political
 and economic factors. Tax st ructure is shown to be a system of related
 components in equilibrium. A final section compares results to two
 alternative approaches, opti mal taxation and the Leviathan model.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Plea Bargaining and Prosecutorial Discretion. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 713-28
Issue: 4
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A model of plea bargaining with asymmetric information is presented. The
 prosecutor's private information consists of the strength of the case,
 while the defendant's private information consists of h is guilt or
 innocence. In equilibrium, a fraction of cases are dismis sed because they
 are too likely to involve an innocent defendant; in the remaining cases,
 the prosecutor's offer of a sentence in exchange for a plea of guilty
 reveals the strength of the case. It is shown t hat unlimited
 prosecutorial discretion may be socially disadvantageou s since it carries
 with it the requirement of sequential rationality.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Domestic Politics, Foreign Interests, and International Trade Policy. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 719-45
Issue: 4
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper is directed at explaining the political choice of voluntary
 export restr aints as means of restriction of international trade. Tariffs
 are com pared with voluntary export restraints in a setting of competition
 be tween candidates for political office who use trade-policy pronouncem
 ents as a means of seeking political support from foreign and domesti c
 producer interests. With tariffs, the candidates take politically d
 ivisive policy positions. Voluntary export restraints are politically
 conciliatory and can offer mutual gain to foreign and domestic produ cer
 interests. The potential for foreign producer gain underlies the
 voluntariness of voluntary export restraints. It is no candidate's po
 litical interest to choose a tariff to formulate a trade-policy posit ion
 if a voluntary export restraint is feasible.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Assisting Domestic Industries under International Oligopoly: The Relevance of the Nature of Competition to Optimal Policies. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 746-58
Issue: 4
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Optimal trade and industrial policies are derived for a home market that
 is supplied by a domestic firm and a foreign firm. The optimal policy
 combination can be quite sensitive to the nature of the duopoly's
 competition. For example, for some cost and demand s tructures, the
 optimal policy under Cournot competition consists of a domestic production
 tax and a tariff, but that under Bertrand compet ition consists of a
 production subsidy and free trade.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 759-72
Issue: 4
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper views all interpersonal trade as Ricardian, while all
 international trade reflects each country's factor endowment. The model
 provides the logical link betwe en Heckscher-Ohlin and Ricardo. The
 strength of the model is that it allows simpler and more robust theorems
 about trade, welfare, and fac tor payments. Factor price equalization
 holds universally and Stolper -Samuelson is not tied to the number of
 goods or factors. A key resul t is that the old Mill theorem that the
 small country gains all from trade is incorrect. Trade patterns with three
 factors and two goods a re completely characterized.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Hyteresis in Import Prices: The Beachhead Effect. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 773-85
Issue: 4
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper shows that temporary real exchange rate fluctuations can have
 persistent (hysteretic) effects on trade. Specifically, when market-entry
 costs are sunk, sufficiently large exchange rate shocks alter domestic
 market structure and thereby induce hysteresis. This simple result has
 strong implications for exchange rate theory, t rade policy, and
 estimation of trade equations. Empirical evidence su ggests that the
 recent dollar overvaluation induced hysteresis in U.S. import prices.
 Namely, the aggregate pass-through equation (of exchange rates to import
 prices) shifted in the 1980s. The shift's nature and timing is broadly
 consistent with the hysteresis hypothesis.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Effects of Fiscal Policies when Incomes Are Uncertain: A Contradiction to Ricardian Equivalence. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 14-23
Issue: 1
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper shows that, when future earnings are uncertain, the
 substitution of deficit fin ance for tax finance (or the introduction of
 an unfunded social secur ity program) can raise consumption even if all
 bequests reflect inter generational altruism. An operative bequest motive
 therefore need not imply Ricardian equivalence. This conclusion follows
 from the result , derived in the paper, that the uncertainty of future
 income makes t he existence of a future bequest uncertain to the
 prospective donor.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Asset Prices, Commodity Prices, and Money: A General Equilibrium, Rational Expectations Model. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 24-45
Issue: 1
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  An expected-utility-maximizing investor spends his portfolio income on
 commodities and real balances. Commodity prices and asset payoffs are
 determined endogenously in general equilibrium. The impact of commodity
 prices on investor welfare yields surprising relationships among the
 expected returns required on financial assets. Real (monetary)
 disturbances can generate a neg ative (positive) correlation between
 inflation and equity payoffs, but the expected nominal return on the
 equity can still be less (greater) than the nominal interest rate. The
 expected nominal return on an indexed bond can be greater than on a
 nominal bond. The expected real return on an equity can be lower than on
 an indexed bond.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Effects of Commodity Price Stabilization Programs. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 46-58
Issue: 1
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors analyze the effects of commodity programs in
 which the government attempts to support and stabilize price through open
 market purchases and sales. Specifically, they as sess the effects of such
 programs on the U.S. soybean market using a rational-expectations model
 that allows for private storage, expected -price-responsive production,
 and arbitrary support and release price s. A salient feature of the model
 is that private storage and product ion behavior adjusts to changes in
 government policy. Stochastic simu lations of the market model demonstrate
 that price stabilization prog rams can reduce long-run market price and
 destabilize producer revenu e.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  The authors analyze trade in both legitimate and counterfeit products.
 Domestic firms ow n trademarks and establish reputations for delivering
 high-quality pr oducts in a steady-state equilibrium. Foreign suppliers
 export legiti mate low-quality merchandise and counterfeits of domestic
 brand-name merchandise. Heterogeneous home consumers either purchase
 low-quality imports or brand-name products, rationally expecting some
 degree of counterfeiting of the latter. The authors describe the positive
 and normative effects of counterfeiting in comparison with a no-counterfe
 iting benchmark. They also provide a welfare analysis of border inspe
 ction policy and of policy regarding the disposition of counterfeit g oods
 that are confiscated at the border.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  While foreign investment augments the capital stock, it also affects land
 prices. If it causes land values to rise, then the resulting capital gain
 benefits current landowners, but the perma nent effect can be to reduce
 welfare. Other things equal, more-crowde d countries have higher land
 prices and lower steady-state welfare, b ut their net foreign indebtedness
 depends on technology, savings beha vior, and the interest rate. Even when
 it does not affect the domesti c capital stock, a land tax raises
 steady-state welfare.	 Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 89-107
Issue: 1
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Implicit markets capture compensation for intraurban and interregional
 differe nces in amenities and yield differences in housing prices and
 wages. These pecuniary differences become preference-based weights in a
 qual ity-of-life index. Hedonic equations are estimated using microdata fr
 om the 1980 Census and assembled county-based amenity data on climati c,
 environmental, and urban conditions. Ranking of 253 urban counties reveals
 substantial variation within, as well as among, the 185 urba n areas. The
 quality-of-life differences across counties within one S MSA is almost
 one-half of the difference between the top- and bottom- ranked counties in
 the nation.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Division of Markets is Limited by the Extent of Liquidity (Spatial Competition with Externalities). 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 108-21
Issue: 1
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Liquidity considerations will limit the number of markets in a
 competitive economy. Welfare implications are ambigious. Since liquidity
 is a positive externality, there may be too little liquidity per market at
 a noncooperative equilibrium and too many markets compared to the
 surplus-maximizing market structure.  But liquidity is also
 self-reinforcing.  Given an existing equilibrium, new markets may not open
 because nobody wants to use a new market with low liquidity. There may be
 too few markets to achieve efficiency. A nondiscriminating monopolist will
 operate smaller and more numerous markets compared to optimality as well
 as to the equilibrium of independent auctioneers.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Issue: 1
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The strategic incentives, with respect to the choice of price policy in
 spatial competition, are analyzed in a duopoly model. Price discrimination
 emerges as the unique equilibriu m outcome in games with either
 simultaneous choice of policy and pric e or sequential choice where firms
 may commit first to uniform mill p ricing before the actual market stage.
 Nevertheless, profits may be h igher with uniform pricing. The authors'
 models are applied to analyz e some common business practices that arise
 in geographical pricing, like the basing point system, and in the pricing
 of varieties or opti ons from a base product in a product-differentiation
 context.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Cooperation, Harassment, and Involuntary Unemployment: An Insider-Outsider Approach. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 167-88
Issue: 1
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The authors present a theory of involuntary unemployment which explains
 why the unemployed workers ("outsiders" ) are unable or unwilling to find
 jobs even though they are prepared to work for less than the prevailing
 wages of incumbent workers ("in siders"). The outsiders do not underbid
 the insiders since, were the y to do so, the insiders would withdraw

Title:   Bertrand Competition for Inputs and Walrasian Outcomes. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 189-201
Issue: 1
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Market making by merchants, who obtain stock from suppliers and resell it
 to con sumers, is modeled as a two-stage pricing game with winner-take-all
 c ompetition for the inputs (in contrast to fixed-capacity models). The re
 is a unique, subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) which is Walr asian
 for elastic demand and non-Walrasian for inelastic demand. Alte rnatively,
 when merchants first sell forward contracts to consumers a nd then compete
 for supplies, the unique SPNE is always Walrasian. Th us, the author has
 an equilibrium model in which Walrasian price aris es not from the
 benevolent actions of a fictitious auctioneer, but fr om optimal
 price-setting behavior of merchants.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  A computer-controlled portfolio selection task with three risky assets
 and either with or without a riskless asset was devised to test
 experimentally assumptions underlying the separation theorem and the
 capital asset pricing model. Two differently paid groups of subjects
 completed individually up to 300 portfolio selection problems. Although
 most of the subjects diversified among the risky assets, the introduction
 of a riskless asset did not have the effect predicted by the separation
 theorem, nor were the subjects affected by systematic changes in the
 variance-covariance matrix governing the risky returns. However,
 performance improved as the reward was increased tenfold.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Long-term Relationships Governed by Short-term Contracts. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 485-99
Issue: 3
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper studies the effects of contract duration on the incentive to
 invest in a relationship when its parties are rational and have perfect
 information, and contracts are complete, ex cept that short-term contracts
 specify only current-period actions. T hen, short-term contracting
 distorts investment decisions only when t he efficient plan involves
 mainly sunk-cost investment and the relati onship plays a
 consumption-smoothing role. There is a general, but no t universal,
 tendency to underinvest.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Limited Contract Enforcement and Strategic Renegotiation. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 471-84
Issue: 3
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a strategic theory of contract renegotiation. In this
 theory, suboptimal contracts are put in place initially to protect one
 party against undesirable a ctions by another party and are renegotiated
 once the danger is past. The authors develop a model to establish the
 cases in which simple contracts cannot achieve desirable outcomes, so that
 only a complicated contract or renegotiation will serve. Unlike most
 previous accounts of contract renegotiation, this theory does not rely on
 exogenous uncertainty to motivate renegotiation.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   When Actions Speak Louder Than Prospects. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 463-70
Issue: 3
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Many theories of individual choice under risk and uncertainty are formu
 lated in terms of preferences over prospects, i.e., probability distr
 ibutions of consequences. By contrast, regret theory is formulated in
 terms of actions, i.e., n-tuples of state-contingent consequences. W hat
 appear from the viewpoint of prospect-based theories to be innocu ous
 rephrasings of choice problems are predicted by regret theory to cause
 people to reverse their choices. This paper follows up earlier results
 with a new kind of experimental test. The new evidence favors regret
 theory.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Public-Utility Regulators Are Only Human: A Positive Theory of Rational Constraints. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 444-62
Issue: 3
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Positive models of public-utility regulation should capture personal
 incentives of regulators. A regulatory objective function is specified by
 appea l to standard human concerns coupled with politics and processes
 pecu liar to public-utility regulation. Constraints a rational regulator w
 ould impose on the firm are thereby derived, and connections between
 regulatory objectives and regulatory rules illuminated. Results inclu de
 theoretical rationales for "rate-of-return" regulation in a worl d of
 certainty, and a largely neglected type of "rate-of-return" re gulation
 under (symmetric) uncertainty. Other forms of regulation sho uld also be
 explicable in terms of personal motives of human regulato rs.	 Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   On the Organization of Rural Markets and the Process of Economic Development. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 431-43
Issue: 3
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors consider how the organization of rural markets will affect
 capital accumul ation and long-run aggregate income in the development
 process. They show that in a simple, dual economy, overlapping-generations
 model, c apital accumulation and aggregate income will be lowest when both
 fac tor markets in the agricultural sector are fully competitive. Both ca
 pital and aggregate income will be higher when land is not traded but the
 labor market is competitive, and highest in the absence of compe titive
 markets in both factors in the agricultural sector, when incom e
 distribution favors rural workers over landlords.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Quality, Quantity, and Spatial Variation of Price. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 418-30
Issue: 3
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper develops and implements a method for estimating price
 elasticities of demand using cross-sectional household survey data.
 Geographically clustered households report unit values, which when
 corrected for quality effects and for measurement error, indicate the
 underlying spatial variation in prices, and can be matched to variation in
 demand patterns. A simple model of quality choice is proposed, while the
 correction for measurement error exploits the clustered design of such
 surveys. Data from a 1979 household survey from the Ivory Coast are used
 to estimate price elasticities for beef, meat, fish, cereals, and
 starches.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Investment, Capacity Utilization, and the Real Business Cycle. 
Journal: American Economic Review

Year: 1988

Abstract:
  This paper adopts Keynes' view that shocks to the marginal efficiency of
 i nvestment are important for business fluctuations, but incorporates i t
 in a neoclassical framework with endogenous capacity utilization. I
 ncreases in the efficiency of newly produced investment goods stimula te
 the formation of "new" capital and more intensive utilization and
 accelerated depreciation of "old" capital. Theoretical and quantitat ive
 analysis suggests that the shocks and transmission mechanism stud ied here
 may be important elements of business cycles.	 Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 395-401
Issue: 3
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The optimal tariff for a large country equals the reciprocal of the
 foreign export elasticity of supply. However, if prod uction decisions
 occur before consumption decisions, the ex ante opti mal tariff is not
 time consistent because the ex post elasticity is l ess than the ex ante
 elasticity. The author shows all countries are w orse off if the large
 country cannot precommit to its ex ante optimal tariff, and that all
 countries can gain if the large country taxes d omestic production of
 importables.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Trade in Risky Assets. 
Journal: American Economic Review

Issue: 3
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  A theory of the international trade pattern in risky assets is developed
 by applying the law of comparative advantage to asset trade. According to
 this l aw, there is a tendency for a country to import assets that have
 rela tively high autarky prices. It is examined how autarky prices are aff
 ected by international differences in stochastic properties of output
 /endowments, the rate of time preference, the degree of risk aversion ,
 and subjective beliefs, and how such differences predict overall ca pital
 account deficits or surpluses as well as the composition of the capital
 account into trade in specific risky assets.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 362-74
Issue: 3
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the effects of restrictions on international
 financial m arkets in a general equilibrium, rational expectations model
 of a two -country world. State-contingent financial markets allow
 households t o allocate wealth optimally across states so that the
 imposition of e xchange and capital controls has, roughly speaking, only
 substitution effects but no wealth effect. Taxes or quantitative controls
 on purc hases of foreign currency and on the income from foreign assets
 reduc e international trade in goods, lower ex post welfare in the country
 in which they are imposed, and affect nominal prices and the exchange
 rate.	 Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Dynamic Strategic Monetary Policies and Coordination in Interdependent Economies. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 341-61
Issue: 3
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper develops strategic monetary policies using a standard
 two-country macro model under flexible exchange rates. The equilibria
 considered include feedback Nash and feedback Stackelberg, both of which
 are compared to the Pareto optimal cooperative equilibrium. The optimal
 policies are obtained as feedback rules in which real money supplies are
 adjusted to movements in the real exchange rate. The properties of these
 policies and their welfare implications are analyzed using numerical
 simulations. The contrast in the present results with those obtained
 previously for a short-run horizon suggest the importance of both
 intertemporal and intratemporal tradeoffs in the d etermination of optimal
 strategic policies.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   International Macroeconomic Policy Coordination When Policymakers Do Not Agree on the True Model. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 318-40
Issue: 3
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors relax the assumption of the literature on international
 coordination that policymakers know the true model. T wo countries will
 still be able to agree on a cooperative policy pack age that each believes
 will improve the objective function relative t o the Nash noncooperative
 solution. However, the bargaining solution may move the target variables
 in the wrong direction. These points ar e illustrated with monetary and
 fiscal multipliers taken from simulat ions of ten leading econometric
 models. Out of 1,000 possible combina tions of models that could represent
 U.S. beliefs, non-U.S. beliefs, and the true model, monetary coordination
 improves U.S. welfare in on ly 546 cases.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Altruism within the Family Reconsidered: Do Nice Guys Finish Last? 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1034-45
Issue: 5
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors criticize the view that the presence of
 altruism either increases the benefits of group interactions or improves
 the allocation of resources within families. They demonstrate first that
 altruism can alter the social utility possibility frontier in surprising
 and sometimes unfortunate ways. Next, they argue that, in a variety of
 situations, altruism entails exploitability and therefore causes family
 members to behav e in ways that leave all parties worse off. Specifically,
 an altruist may take u ndesirable actions in order to discourage
 subsequent exploitation. In addition, altruists have difficulty enforcing
 agreements in that they may be extremely reluctant to punish betrayals.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Marginal Efficiency Cost of Redistribution. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1019-33
Issue: 5
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The efficiency effects of redistributive policies are analyzed using a
 computational general equilibrium model, based on U.S. data for 1979. For
 parameter values considered most reasonable, a tax-financed universal cash
 grant generates losses for the higher-income groups that exceed the gains
 of the lower-income groups by 50 to 130 percent. These efficiency costs
 are substantially below those calculated by other authors. The marginal
 efficiency cost of redistribution through wage subsidies is near zero and
 can be negative. Social preferences regarding inequality need not be
 anywhere near Rawlsian in order for society to prefer further
 redistribution.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Imperfect Information and Staggered Price Setting. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 999-1018
Issue: 5
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Many Keynesian macroeconomic models are based on the assumption that
 firms change prices at different times. This paper presents an explanation
 for this "staggered" price setting. The authors develop a model in which
 firms have imperfect knowledge of the current state of the economy and
 gain information by observing the prices set by others. This gives each
 firm an incentive to set its price shortly after other firms set theirs.
 Staggering can be the equilibrium outcome. In addition, the information
 gains can make staggering socially optimal even though it increases
 aggregate fluctuations.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Regulating a Monopolist with Unknown Demand. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 986-98
Issue: 5
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors analyze the optimal regulatory policy when the firm has
 better information about demand than the regulator from the outset of
 their relationship. The firm's cost structure is common knowledge, but
 monitoring of output is prohibitively costly. The authors find that, when
 marginal production costs increase with output, the firm command s no
 rents from its private information and the efficient price is established
 for each realization of demand. In contrast, with declining marginal
 costs, the same price is established by the regulator for all demand
 realizations and the firm's rents can be substantial. Overall, major
 qualitative differences in the optimal regulatory policy arise when the
 firm's private information concerns demand rather than costs.	 Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Franchising and Risk Management. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 954-68
Issue: 5
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Franchising is an important and controversial form of vertical
 integration. Allegations of opportunistic behavior by franchisors have led
 to calls for public regulation and in some states "fairness in
 franchising" laws. The advisability of such regulation depends on the
 long-run incentives to franchise. If franchising is a temporary step on
 the path to complete ownership integration, regulation may be called for.
 Alternatively, if complete or partial franchising is a permanen t market
 solution, regulation is at least contestable. This paper offer s new
 evidence on the incentives to franchise.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 936-53
Issue: 5
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The theory of clearance sales is expanded and applied to explain why
 markups, markdowns, and the frequency of sales of merchandise sold by
 department stores have increased dramatically in recent years and why they
 differ across merchandise groups. Tha major theme of the paper is that the
 growing role of fashion and product variety is an important reason for
 these increases and for the differences between merchandise groups. The
 growing importance of fashion is illustrated by documenting the declining
 use of whites and the increasing use of colors and prints. Estimates of
 the effects of imports, and technological and demographic changes on
 markups and markdowns, are presented.	 Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Market Incentives for Safe Commercial Airline Operation. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 913-35
Issue: 5
Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Airlines are insured against most direct costs of an accident, but they
 cannot insure against demand loss. Some have argued that such consumer
 reaction will discipline unsafe operations. The authors' estimation of
 deviations from expected demand following accidents finds little or no
 effect prior to airline deregulation and weak indication of a response to
 recent crashes. These results are consistent with the changes the authors
 find in an airline's equity value following an accident, which are
 statistically significant, but quite small relative to the total social
 cost of the accident.	 Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  The mathematical complexity of auction theory has restricted empirical
 work to qualitative tests of its basic predictions, with mixed results.
 This paper exploits the theory of order statistics to derive a Nash bid
 function that is linear in its parameters , allowing direct estimati on by
 linear least squares. The bid function is fitted to a cross section of
 auctions for highway construction contracts from thirty-three states, and
 provides support for several hypotheses of the theory of common-value
 auctions.   Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.

Volume: 78
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper examines federal auctions for drain age leases on the Outer
 Continental Shelf from 1959 to 1969. These are leases that are adjacent to
 tracts on which a deposit has been discovered. The authors find that the
 data strongly support the hypotheses that neighbor firms are better
 informed about the value of a lease than nonneighbor firms; that neighbor
 firms coordinate their bidding decisions; and that both types of firms bid
 strategically in accordance with the Bayesian-Na sh equilibrium model for
 first-price, sealed-bid auctions with asymmetric information.  Copyright 1988 by American Economic Association.
