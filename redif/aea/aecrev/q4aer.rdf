Title:   Bonuses to Workers and Employers to Reduce Unemployment: Randomized Trials in Illinois. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 513-30
Issue: 4
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  New claimants for Unemployment Insurance were randomly assigned to one of
 two experiments that were designed to hasten reemployment. In the first, a
 500 dollar bonus was offered to claimants who obtained employment within
 eleven weeks. This experiment reduced the number of weeks of insured
 unemployment, averaged over all assigned claimants whether or not they
 participated, by more than one week. In the second experiment, the bonus
 was offered to the claimant's subsequent employer. This experiment reduced
 the weeks of insured unemployment for only one important group-white
 women--by about one week.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Self-Selection and the Earnings of Immigrants. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 531-53
Issue: 4
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes the way in which the earnings of the immigrant
 population may be expected to differ from the earnings of the native
 population because of the endogeneity of the migration decision. The
 conditions that determine the nature of the self-selection are derived and
 depend on economic and political characteristics of the sending and
 receiving countries. The empirical analysis shows that differences in the
 U.S. earnings of immigrants with the same measured skills, but from
 different home countries, are attributable to variations in conditions in
 the country of origin at the time of migration.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Measuring the Value of a Public Good: An Empirical Comparison of Elicitation Procedures. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 554-66
Issue: 4
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The problems associated with accurately measuring the value of a public
 good in an applied setting are considered. The values obtained from
 hypothetical elicitation procedures are compared and contrasted with those
 obtained in a marketplace. When hypothetical measurements are elicited in
 the field, buying-selling discrepancies similar to those predicted by
 psychological models of behavior are observed. However, when the
 market-like elicitation process is repeated, values are more consistent
 with diminishing marginal utility. The authors cannot reject the
 hypothesis that these individuals exhibit loss- aversion behavior. The
 marketplace, however, is a strong disciplinarian of limiting this type of
 behavior.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Sex Discrimination in Labor Markets: The Role of Statistical Evidenc e. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 567-83
Issue: 4
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Correlations between statistically-measured wage discrimination and
 confidential survey reports of discrimination are used to estimate the
 relative importance of statistical evidence in determining womens'
 self-assessed discrimination levels. Statistical evidence is found to be
 considerably less important than other "nonstatistical" evidence. Assuming
 courts weigh statistical versus other evidence as individuals do, the
 effects of making statistical evidence admissible are calculated. Young,
 well-educated women are predicted to be the main beneficiaries of this
 policy.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Optimal Use of Nonmonetary Sanctions as a Deterrent. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 584-92
Issue: 4
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A theoretical model of deterrence is studied in which the imposition of
 nonmonetary (as opposed to monetary) sanctions is socially costly. It is
 therefore desirable that the system of sanctions be designed so that
 sanctions are imposed infrequently. If courts possess perfect information,
 the optimal system is such that sanctions are never imposed-all who can be
 deterred will be--but, realistically, courts' information will be
 imperfect and sanctions will be imposed.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   If Homo Economicus Could Choose His Own Utility Function, Would He Want One with a Conscience? 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 593-604
Issue: 4
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A blush may reveal a lie and cause great embarrassment at the moment. But
 in situations that require trust, there can be great advantage in being
 known to be a blusher. This paper develops a model in which tastes are
 determined endogenously for their capacity to help solve an important
 class of market failures. The common feature of these market failures is
 that they require people to bind themselves to courses of action that will
 later seem unattractive. The tastes that emerge are very different from
 the ones assumed in conventional rational-choice models.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Capital-Energy Complementarity Debate Revisited. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 605-14
Issue: 4
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper argues that the empirical disagreement as to whether capital
 and energy are complements or substitutes is not likely to be reconciled
 with aggregate data. It demonstrates that price-induced changes in the
 composition of output can cause either outcome in the aggregate, even if
 no technical substitution is possible. Substitution by consumers and
 changes in the relative incomes of consumers and foreigners are identified
 as key factors in determining which outcome arises.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Externalities from Contract Length. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 615-29
Issue: 4
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  An increase in the length of a firm's labor contract contributes to
 rigidity in the aggregate price level. This increases the variance of
 aggregate demand but decreases the variance of other firms' real wages.
 Under certain conditions, the net effect is to increase the variance of
 other firms' employment. This negative externality implies that the
 equilibrium contract length in a decentralized economy is greater than the
 social optimum-in other words, wages are too rigid.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Social Security and Individual Welfare: Precautionary Saving, Borrowing Constraints, and the Payroll Tax. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 630-46
Issue: 4
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the impact of social security on national saving and
 individual welfare in the presence of realistic capital-market
 imperfections: market failure in the private provision of annuities and
 restrictions on borrowing against anticipated future wages. The
 introduction of social security increases lifetime welfare and reduces
 national saving if borrowing restrictions are absent. However, the
 increase in individual welfare is reduced, and in some cases eliminated,
 when borrowing constraints are taken into consideration. The substantial
 difference suggests the importance of reexamining the proportional payroll
 tax finance of social security.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Monopolistic Competition and the Effects of Aggregate Demand. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 647-66
Issue: 4
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  How important is monopolistic competition to an understanding of the
 effects of aggregate demand on output? The authors ask this question at
 three levels. Can monopolistic competition, by itself, explain why
 aggregate demand affects output? Can it, together with other
 imperfections, generate effects of aggregate demand in a way that perfect
 competition cannot? If so, can it give an accurate account of the res
 ponse of the economy to aggregate demand movements? The answers are no,
 yes, and yes.	 Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Inventories and the Volatility of Production. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 667-79
Issue: 4
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A stylized fact associated with inventory behavior is that the variance
 of production exceeds the variance of sales. This paper presents a model
 of production decisions with demand uncertainty that incorporates no
 nnegativity constraints on inventories. Even with no productivity shocks,
 optimal behavior by the firm is consistent with this stylized fact either
 if demand exhibits positive serial correlation, or if the firm can backlog
 excess demand. The reason is that a demand shock affects both the actual
 inventory level (given unchanged production) and the desired level.
 Production must replenish the stock and adjust to the new desired level.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a rigorous partial equilibrium analysis of the
 determinants of margin al welfare cost (MWC) of taxes on labor earnings.
 It shows that four key parameters interact to determine the magnitude of
 MWC. Using aggregate data and plausible ranges of values for the
 parameters, MWC can vary from under 10 percent to more than 300 percent of
 marginal tax revenue. Intermediate parameter values sugge st MWC is in the
 25-50 percent range. However, the more extreme estimates cannot be ruled
 out on the basis of available evidence, suggesting that MWC cannot yet be   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Distribution of Public Services: An Exploration of Local Governmental Preferences. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 37-49
Issue: 1
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  A local governmental welfare function is specified to explore two of its
 central characteristics: the equity-productivity trade-off and
 differential weights across neighborhoods. The constrained maximization
 model is estimated using service outcomes (safety) in the welfare
 function, as opposed to publicly provided inputs (police), over
 neighborhoods. The equity-productivity trade-off is found to be
 considerable, and not all neighborhoods are weighted equally. The results
 show that inequality aversion and unequal concern by local government over
 service outcomes must be addressed explicitly to understand the observed
 distribution of publicly provided inputs, with important implications for
 standard analysis of local governmental behavior.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Intertemporal Labor Supply and Long-term Employment Contracts. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 50-68
Issue: 1
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The authors compare the implications of a symmetric information
 contracting model and a dynamic labor supply model for changes in earnings
 and hours. A simple test is whether earnings changes are more variable
 than hours changes, as predicted by the labor supply model, or less
 variable, as predicted by the contracting model. The authors apply this
 test to two longitudinal surveys of adult men and find that earnings are
 somewhat more variable than hours for men who never change employers. The
 estimates suggest that changes in earnings and hours not associated with
 survey measurement error occur at fixed wage rates.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 69-77
Issue: 1
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a positive comparison of the outcomes of several
 alternative allocation systems (the queue system, convertible and
 nonconvertible rations, and the unhindered market) to distribute the
 limited quantity of a deficit good among heterogeneous individuals. The
 authors show that, for the poor, the ranking of systems (from better to
 worse) is: convertible rations, nonconvertible rations, the queue system,
 and nonintervention. The rich are found to be better off under
 nonintervention than under other systems. These and other results are
 notably robust not only to many parameters of the economy, but also to
 certain types of commodity taxes and administrative costs.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 93-106
Issue: 1
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The adjustment of relative prices to exchange rate movements is explained
 in an industrial organization approach. Given labor costs in the
 respective currencies, exchange rate movements change costs for firms
 selling in the home market and thus disturb the industry equilibrium. The
 extent of absolute and relative price adjustment is shown to depend on
 market integration, product substitutability, the relative number of
 domestic and foreign firms, and the market structure. The impact of
 exchange rates on prices is illustrated in a variety of approaches
 including the Cournot, A. Dixit and J. Stiglitz_(1977), and S.
 Salop_(1979) models. Some empirical evidence is offered in support of the
 theory.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  Exchange-rate management is possible only if the government pursues
 consistent monetary and fiscal policies. The authors constructa model in
 which the real consequences of exchange-rate management depend on the
 precise time pattern of these policies. The authors study the constraints
 on feasible policies and the comparative dynamics of disinflation by means
 of exchange-rate targeting. Theoretical results are consistent with
 exchange-rate-managed disinflation attempts in Argentina, Chile, and
 Israel.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  This paper generalizes the Global Correspondence Principle by extending,
 in two major ways, Samuelson's_(1971) analysis of the exchange-rate
 response to an international purchasing-power transfer. First, the authors
 analyze the price effect of a shift in anyparameter, not necessarily a
 transfer. Second, the authors explore the resulting adjustments in any
 nonprice variable such as welfare. As the analysis shows, the direction of
 these adjustments depends neither on whether they are small or large nor
 on whether equilibrium is locally stable or unstable. Thus, the authors
 generalize the conventional algebra of comparative statics, which
 typically assumes small shifts from a stable equilibrium.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Using Survey Data to Test Standard Propositions Regarding Exchange Rate Expectations. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 133-53
Issue: 1
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Survey data provide a new measure of exchange-rate expectations superior
 to the forward rate in that no risk premium interferes. The authors test
 standard propositions using three sources of survey data. The authors
 estimate extrapolative, adaptive, and regressive models of expectations.
 Static or "random walk" expectations and bandwagon expectations are
 rejected: variables other than the contemporaneous spot rate receive
 positive weight. A 10 percent appreciation of the dollar generates an
 expectation of future depreciation over the coming year estimated at 2
 percent. In comparing expectations to the true process governing the spot
 rate, the authors find statistically significant bias.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Welfare Effects of Third-Degree Price Discrimination in. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 154-67
Issue: 1
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The author examines third-degree price discrimination by an upstream
 monopolist in an intermediate good market. Discrimination is motivated by
 the fact that downstream firms differ in their abilities to integrate
 backward into supply of the input. The author shows that under reasonable
 specifications of equilibrium, price discrimination leads to all buyers
 facing higher input prices. In other cases, discrimination raises some
 prices and lowers others. The author derives conditions under which
 discrimination lowers welfare by reducing total output and shows that in
 some markets discrimination will raise welfare by preventing socially
 inefficient backward integration.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Contract Duration and Relationship-Specific Investments: Empirical Evidence from Coal Markets. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 168-85
Issue: 1
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper examines empirically the importance of relationship
 investments in determining the duration of coal contracts negotiated
 between coal suppliers and electric utilities, using data for 277 coal
 contracts. For each contract, measures of the duration of contractual
 commitments agreed to by the parties at the contract execution stage and
 measures of the importance of relationship specific investments are
 developed. The results provide strong support for the view that buyers and
 sellers make longer commitments to the terms of future trade at the
 contract execution stage, and rely less on repeated bargaining, when
 relationship-specific investments are more important.	 Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Voluntary Donations and Public Expenditures in a Federal System. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 24-36
Issue: 1
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Proponents of the new federalism argue that nonprofit organizations and
 local governments will fully offset federal social service expenditure
 cutbacks. The author analyzes this proposition as a competitive game in
 which donations are motivated by private and public good considerations.
 The author characterizes the response of political-economic equilibrium to
 exogenous changes in federal expenditures when local voters are cognizant
 of donor reactions. Partial replacement is the most likely outcome, though
 others are possible.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review

Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Trade in a Tiebout EconomyThis paper explores both the positive and
 normative aspects of interregional commodity trade in a "Tiebout e
 conomy," i.e., a many-region economy with perfect labor mobility and
 endogenous government decision making. For a model with scale econom ies
 in public good consumption, it is shown that any equilibrium is a
 symmetric; regions containing the same types of individuals and production
 possibilities nevertheless differ in the traded goods which they produce
 and the public-good levels which they provide residents. In fact, each
 region specializes in producing only one of the traded private goods. The
 paper proves that an equilibrium is Pareto efficient.	 Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Two-moment Decision Models and Expected Utility Maximization. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 421-30
Issue: 3
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Two-moment decision models are consistent with expected utility
 maximization only if the choice set or the agent's preferences are
 restricted. All currently available restrictions, such as quadratic
 utility or normality, are either theoretically deficient and/or
 empirically rejected. This paper identifies another restriction which is
 sufficient to ensure consistency between the two approaches and confirms
 that it holds in many economic models. Implications of this restriction
 for moment model analysis are then derived.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  The authors study the rivalry between two firms to develop an innovation
 in a dynamic setting that allows for post-development dissemination of the
 innovation, such as licensing or imitation. This dissemination may cause
 the noninnovating firm to benefit from the discovery. When this occurs,
 conventional results in the economics of R&D no longer need apply They
 find that industry leaders will tend to develop minor innovations, but
 will develop major innovations only if imitation is difficult.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Awarding Monopoly Franchises. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 375-87
Issue: 3
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors analyze how to award a monopoly franchise when the objective
 is to maximize expected consumers' surplus net of transfer payments to the
 producer. Potential producers initially possess independent private
 information about uncertain production costs. Only the chosen producer
 subsequently observes realized production costs. After awarding the
 franchise to the producer with the lowest expected costs, prices are
 optimally set above realized marginal cost. These ex post distortions
 foster more competitive bidding ex ante. The distortions for any bid-cost
 pair are invariant to the number of bidders, n, though expected
 distortions and profits decline with n.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Adjustment of Expectations to a Change in Regime: A Study of the Founding of the Federal Reserve. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 358-74
Issue: 3
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The founding of the Federal Reserve System in 1914 led to a substantial
 change in the behavior of nominal interest rates. The authors examine the
 timing of this change and the speed with which it was effected. They then
 use data on the term structure of interest rates to determine how
 expectations responded. Their results indicate that the change in policy
 regime was rapid and that individuals quickly understood the new
 environment they were facing.	 Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  This paper compiles comparative measures of output per worker in 1975 in
 four socialist and seven Western market economy (WME) countries, and
 explores sources of observed differences between the two groups of
 countries in that regard. Such differences seem explicable only partially
 by reference to differences in per worker capital stock and farm land. A
 residual disparity of 25 to 34 percent in favor of WME countries appears
 to testify to superior efficiency in the latter.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   A General Equilibrium Analysis of Partial-Equilibrium Welfare Measures: The Case of Climate Change. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 331-41
Issue: 3
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper reports the results of an evaluation of partial-equilibrium
 welfare measures of the effects of large multisector shocks to an economic
 system. A nine a developed economy was used in the analysis. The findings
 indicate that the errors in single-sector, partial-equilibrium welfare
 measures depend on the consistency in the signs and approximate magnitude
 of indirect price effects. Disparities in either the direction or size of
 price changes in the indirectly affected markets can lead to large errors
 in the partial-equilibrium welfare measures.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Emigration to South Africa's Mines. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 313-30
Issue: 3
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Temporary migration from five countries to South Africa's mines is
 examined; Both determinants of migration and economic consequences are
 investigated econometrically, during 1946-78. Emigration is shown to (1)
 diminish crop production in the short-run; (2) enhance crop productivity
 and cattle accumulation through invested remittances in the long-run; and
 (3) escalate plantation wages. Conflicting interests exist between local
 employers and the mines. Forms of state intervention adopted and discussed
 include forced labor, emigration quotas, and compulsory population
 relocation.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Savings of the Elderly and Desired Bequests. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 298-312
Issue: 3
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Cross-section data often show that the wealth of the elderly increases
 with age even at advanced ages. These and other results suggest that the
 life-cycle hypothesis of consumption should be augmented to include a
 bequest motive for saving. In this paper, the author proposes a model of
 bequests, and a test for a bequ est motive. Using panel data, he finds
 that over a ten-year period the elderly in the data set dissaved, in
 contradiction to most cross- section results. The test offers no support
 for a bequest motive.	 Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Job Duration, Seniority, and Earnings. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 278-97
Issue: 3
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  An important stylized fact about labor markets is that workers with
 longer seniority with their current employer have higher earnings than
 other workers with the same total labor market experience. This study
 shows that workers in longer jobs earn more throughout than workers in a
 series of shorter jobs and that the measured positive cross-sectional
 return seniority is largely a statistical artifact due to the correlation
 of seniority with an omitted variable representing the quality of the
 worker, the job, or the worker-employer match. The implication is tha t
 earnings do not, in fact, rise very much with seniority.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Health Insurance and the Demand for Medical Care: Evidence from a Randomized Experiment. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 251-77
Issue: 3
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors estimate how cost sharing, the portion of the bill the
 patient pays, affects demand for medical services. The data come from a
 randomized experiment. A catastrophic insurance plan reduces expend itures
 31 percent relative to zero out-of-pocket price. The price elasticity is
 approximately A0.2. The post-World War II growth in medical expenditures
 is either largely attributable to technological change induced by
 increased insurance coverage, a hypothesis that cannot be tested, or to
 factors other than increased insurance coverage. The authors reject the
 hypothesis that less favorable coverage of outpatient services increases
 total expenditure, e.g., by deterring preventive care. Coauthors are

 of agents to communicate to one an other values of contemporary shocks and
 to keep track of histories of past transfers or past announced shocks.
 This paper formalizes this idea and focuses on communication-accounting
 systems. The theory of this paper allows a formal, stylized representation
 of a variety of systems and allows one to make precise the sense in which
 various systems are more or less limited. Oral assignment systems,
 portable object systems, written message systems, and telecommunication
 systems are considered.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Equilibrium Incentives in Oligopoly. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 927-40
Issue: 5
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors examine the incentives which competing principals give their
 agents, focusing on two oligopoly models where owners write incentive
 contracts with the ir managers. Under Cournot quantity competition, each
 manager's margi nal payment for production will exceed the firm's marginal
 profit. De viations from profit maximization are reduced by ex ante
 uncertainty about costs and increased by ex ante correlation between the
 firms' c osts. In contrast, in a differentiated goods market with price
 compet ition, managers receive less than their marginal profit. In
 general, a principal will distort his agent's incentives when the agent
 compet es with agents of competing principals.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Relative Rigidity of Monopoly Pricing. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 917-26
Issue: 5
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper seeks to explain why monopolies keep their nominal prices
 constant for longer periods than do tight oligopolies. The authors show
 that cost changes create a larger incentive for duopolists to change their
 prices, while demand changes tend to have a greater effect on a
 monopolist. When both costs and demand are affected by small changes in
 the overall price level, the cost effect dominates. In the presence of a
 small fixed cost of changing prices, therefore, duopolists change their
 prices in response to smaller perturbations in underlying conditions.	 Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Priority Service: Pricing, Investment, and Market Organization. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 899-916
Issue: 5
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Priority service offers a menu of contingent contracts for distribution
 of scarce supplies. Prices inducing customers' efficient self-selection
 are expectations of spot prices for comparable service. Customers'
 selections reveal the benefit of capacity expansion. Priority service can
 be implemented via sale of "priority points" or via provision of
 compensatory insurance. Sever al priority classes suffice to obtain most
 of the efficiency gains. P riority service Pareto dominates random
 rationing if excess revenue i s refunded equally to customers.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Issue: 5
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper considers the effect of precommitment in contests where the
 rivals expend effort to win a prize. With two asymmetric players, it is
 found that the favorite will commit effort at a higher level than that in
 a Nash equilibrium without commitment, and the underdog at a lower level.
 With many players, the absence of an odds -on favorite among the rivals is
 sufficient to ensure overcommitment by any one player. Applications to
 sports, oligopoly, and rent seekin g are discussed.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Ski-Lift Pricing, with Applications to Labor and Other. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 875-90
Issue: 5
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The market for ski runs or amusement rides often features admission
 tickets with no explicit price per ride. Therefore, the equilibrium i
 nvolves queues, which are systematically longer during peak periods s uch
 as weekends. Moreover, the prices of admission tickets are much l ess
 responsive than the length of queues to variations in demand, eve n when
 these variations are predictable. Despite the queues and stick y prices,
 the authors show that the outcomes are nearly efficient und er plausible
 conditions. They then show that similar results obtain f or some familiar
 congestion problems and for profit-sharing schemes i n the labor market.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   An Equilibrium Model with Involuntary Unemployment at Flexible, Competitive Prices and Wages. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 856-74
Issue: 5
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a general-equilibrium model in which all prices and
 quantities transacted are the direct choices of econom ic agents: there is
 no Walrasian auctioneer. Multiple subgame perfect equilibria exist with
 prices and wages at their Walrasian levels. Among the equilibrium
 allocations are the Walrasian ones, but there a re also outcomes in which
 price- and wage-taking workers are rationed in the labor market and are
 unable to sell all the labor they want a t the prevailing wage. This
 involuntary unemployment results from sel f-fulfilling expectations of
 inadequate excess demand as in some inte rpretations of Keynes's ideas.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Cyclical Behavior of Marginal Cost and Price. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 838-55
Issue: 5
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The author examines the cyclical behavior of price/marginal cost margins
 for U.S. manufac turing after 1956. Short-run marginal cost is markedly
 procyclical. This is primarily due to procyclical overtime payments,
 incurred beca use employment is not perfectly flexible. In most
 industries, output price fails to respond to the cyclical movement in
 marginal cost; so price/marginal cost margins are markedly
 countercyclical. The res ults contradict business cycle theories that
 explain low production i n a recession by a high real cost of producing;
 they support theories that explain low production in a recession by the
 inability of firms to sell their output.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Discretionary Trade Policy and Excessive Protection. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 823-37
Issue: 5
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper proposes a positive theory of tariff formation based on the
 idea that the optimal trade policy may be time inconsistent. A benevolent
 government, with redistributive goals, may have an incentive to provide
 unexpected protection, since the redistributive effects of trade policy
 are larger if the policy is unanticipated. The suboptimal, but time
 consistent, policy involves an excessive amount of protection.
 Furthermore, in a time-consistent equilibrium, tariffs may dominate
 production subsidies. Thus, the requirement of time consistency can lead
 to a reversal of the traditional normative ordering of tariffs and
 subsidies as instruments of trade policy.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Vertical Product Differentiation and North-South Trade. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 810-22
Issue: 5
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors study international trade between the North and the South
 where the industrial sector produces goods of different quality. The North
 exports high-quality products, the South low-quality products. Faster
 population growth in the South changes the spectrum of products exported
 by every country, and so does faster technical progress in the southern
 industrial sector. The latter leads also to the introduction of new
 high-quality products and the abandonment of old low-quality products. In
 all cases, there is a product cycle; the North abandons the production of
 its lowest-quality products which are subsequently produced in the South.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 791-809
Issue: 5
Volume: 77
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek model predicts relationships among industry
 input requirements, country resource supplies, and international trade in
 commodities. These relationships are tested using data on twelve
 resources, and the trade of twenty-seven countries in 1967. The
 Heckscher-Ohlin propositions that trade reveals gross and relative factor
 abundance are not supported by these data. The Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek
 equations among input requirements, resource supplies, and trade are also
 rejected in favor of weaker models that allow technological differences
 and measurement errors.   Copyright 1987 by American Economic Association.
