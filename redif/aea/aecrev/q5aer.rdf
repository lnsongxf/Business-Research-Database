Abstract:
  This paper extends pre-existing results concerning voluntary private

 themagnitude of their own contributions only insofar as these
 contributions affect the aggregate level of expenditures is shown to have
 untenable implications. The analysis suggests that a reexaminationof the

Title:   Child Support, Welfare Dependency, and Poverty. 
Journal: American Economic Review

Issue: 4
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Female-headed families have among the highest poverty rates of any major
 demographic group in the United States. The purpose of this paperis to
 investigate empirically the effectiveness of current child-support
 enforcement policies and to determine their role in reducing poverty and
 welfare dependency. A special supplement to the April 1982 Current
 Population Survey provides the data for the analysis. The results indicate
 that child support enforce-ment may represent an effective means for
 re-ducing welfare program costs but isunlikely to have a dramatic effect
 on either welfare de-pendency or poverty.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  A model of price leadership is used to estimate the welfare losses dueto

 independently, an hypothesis confirmed empirically, the deadweight lossis
 estimated at 0.114 percent of GNP based on a sample of 445 four-digit
 industries. This estimate lends strong support to Arnold C.Harberger's
 finding of thirty years ago.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

  Measuring the social gains from recent technological advances is

Abstract:
  Community standards of fairness for the setting of prices and wages were
 elicited by telephone surveys. In customer or labor markets it
 isacceptable for a firm to raise prices (or cut wages) when profits
 arethreatened, and to maintain prices when costs diminish. It is unfair
 toexploit shifts in demand by raising prices or cutting wages. Several
 market anomalies are explained by assuming that these standards of
 fairness influence the behavior of firms.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Issue: 4
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors present new ways of looking at economic organizations
 andsystems. Individuals' judgments entail errors (they sometimes reject
 good projects and accept bad projects). The architecture of an
 economicsystem, specifying how the decision making units are organized
 togetherwithin a system, who gathers what information, and who
 communicates what with whom, affects its performance both because it
 influences thenature of errors that individuals make within the system,
 and becauseit has a critical effect on the aggregation of individuals'
 errors. Theperformance of two polar architectures, decentralized
 (polyarchical) versus centralized (hierarchical) decision-making
 authorities are analyzed and compared.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   In Defense of Base Drift. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 692-700
Issue: 4
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The Federal Reserve has been criticized for allowing the base from which
 it calculates its target growth paths for the monetary aggregatesto drift
 from year to year in response to past deviations from target.Drift in the
 base implies that target misses permanently affect the levels of the
 monetary aggregates. Using a simple theoretical model, this paper shows
 that the optimal degree of base drift consistent withprice stability
 depends on the importance of permanent versus transitory income and
 velocity disturbances. Neither zero base drift nor complete base drift are
 likely to be compatible with price stability.	 Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Ricardian Consumers with Keynesian Propensities. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 676-91
Issue: 4
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper examines Ricardian equivalence in a world in which taxes
 arenot lump sum, but are levied on risky labor income. It shows that
 themarginal propensity to consume out of a tax cut, coupled with a
 futureincome tax increase, can be substantial under plausible assumptions.
 Indeed, the MPC out of a tax cut can be closer to the Keynesian valuethat
 ignores the future tax liabilities than to the Ricardian value that treats
 future taxes as if they were lump sum.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   A Tax-Based Test for Nominal Rigidities. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 659-75
Issue: 4
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  In classical macroeconomic models with flexible wages and prices, whether
 a tax is levied on producers or consumers does not affect itsultimate
 incidence. If wages or prices are rigid in the short run, however, then
 shifting a tax from one side of the market to the othermay have real
 effects. Tax changes, therefore, provide potential testsfor the presence
 of nominal rigidities. This paper examines the priceand output effects of
 revenue-neutral shifts between direct and indirect taxation. The results
 provide evidence against the view thatwages and prices are completely
 flexible in the short run.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Rigidity of Prices. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 637-58
Issue: 4
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper uses evidence on individual transaction prices to analyze
 price behavior. The evidence shows that, for many transactions,
 pricesremain rigid for periods exceeding one year. The rigidity of price
 ispositively correlated with industry concentration. For several
 productsthe correlation of price changes across buyers is low. The paper
 alsoinvestigates the relationship between price rigidity, price change,
 andthe length of time a buyer and seller have been doing business
 together. The author interprets the evidence as emphasizing the importance
 of nonprice rationing and the inadequacy of models in whichprice movements
 alone clear markets.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  The U.S. dollar price of the U.K. pound sterling is tested for a
 speculative bubble, defined as a period with a nonzero median in
 excessreturns. A nonparametric procedure is developed, which controls for
 data mining over the period of flexible exchange rates, and finds a
 negative bubble in the excess return to holding sterling rather than
 dollar assets during the period 1981-84. Possible interpretations
 arebootstrap equilibria (rational bubbles), nonsym-metric fundamentals,
 and nonrational expectations.	 Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review

Year: 1986
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper takes the results of an employment and training program
 thatwas run as a field experiment, in which the participants were
 randomlyassigned into a treatment or a control group, and compares these
 results to the estimates that might have been produced by an
 econometrician who evaluated the program using the same econometric
 procedures that have been used in the program evaluation literature. This
 comparison shows that many of these econometric procedures fail
 toreplicate the experimentally determined results, and suggests that
 researchers should be aware of the potential for specification errorsin
 other nonexperimental evaluations.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

  This paper examines the role of replication in empirical economic

 extent and causes of failures to replicate published results in economics.
 The findings suggest that inadvertent errors in published empirical

Title:   Prizes and Incentives in Elimination Tournaments. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 701-15
Issue: 4
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Sequential-elimination career games promote survival-of-the-fittest
 competitors. However, top prizes must be elevated to provide performance
 incentives in later stages of the game. The option value of achieving a
 high rank encourages performance effort in early rounds, but the
 continuation option plays out toward the finals. Concentrating an extra
 share of the purse on the top prize replaces the option value of early
 stage competition and ensures that contestants who have achieved high
 ranks do not rest of their laurels in attempting to climb higher.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 82-109
Issue: 1
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper employs monthly, industry-level data in a study of
 Depression-era labor markets. As in Robert Lucas (1970), the model
 usedhere assumes that employers can vary total labor input not only by
 changing the number of workers but also by changing the length of thework
 week. (This assumption seems particularly relevant to the 1930s, aperiod
 in which work weeks fluctuated sharply.) With aggregate demandtreated as
 exogenous and in conjunction with additional elements, themodel seems able
 to provide an empirical explanation of the behavior ofthe key labor market
 time series, including hours of work and real wages.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Rational and Self-fulfilling Balance-of-Payments Crises. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 72-81
Issue: 1
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Speculative attacks on a pegged exchange rate must sometimes occur
 ifasset-price paths are to be free of abnormal profit opportunities.
 Suchattacks are fully rational, as they reflect the market's response to
 aregime breakdown that is inevitable. The authors shows that under
 someexpectations about policy, balance-of-payments crises can also be
 purely self-fulfilling events. In such cases even a permanently
 viableregime may collapse, and the economy will possess multiple
 equilibriacorresponding to different subjective assessments of the
 probability ofa crisis. The behavior of the domestic interest rate will
 naturally reflect the possibility of a speculative attack.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Illegal Immigration: The Host-Country Problem. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 56-71
Issue: 1
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This theoretical treatment, motivated by U.S. debate, of host policy
 toward illegal immigration, develops a simple equilibrium model with
 border interdiction. The model casts doubt on standard econometric
 approaches, and identifies three key policy problems likely to
 emerge.These motivate a search for additional tools, and internal
 enforcement(employer sanctions as in proposed U.S. reforms) is considered.
 The paper presents a detailed analysis of how a combination of
 interdictionand internal enforcement can deal with the problem.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   An Operational Measure of Liquidity. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 43-55
Issue: 1
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Embedding the process of selling an asset in a search environment enables
 one to provide an exact definition of liquidity: an asset's liquidity is
 the expected time until it is sold while pursuing an optimal (in the sense
 of maximization of expected discounted net proceeds) policy. This analysis
 reveals that this definition is compatible with most other notions of
 liquidity and, in particular, with those of John Maynard Keynes,
 impatience, the discount associatedwith a quick sale, predictability, and
 flexibility.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Informational Implications of Interest Rate Rules. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 33-42
Issue: 1
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper compares interest rate and money supply rules. The analysisis
 conducted within a rational expectations macro model that incorporates
 flexible prices and informational frictions. With differential
 information, interest rate targets can affect the information content of
 market prices and real activity, but these realconsequences can always be
 replicated by an appropriately chosen moneystock rule with feedback to
 economic activity. However, when the policyauthority lacks information
 about the state of the economic system, itfaces a discrete choice between
 an interest rate peg and strict moneystock control.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 177-90
Issue: 1
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper constructs a general equilibrium model of North-South tradein
 which the North continually introduces new goods. The rate at
 whichtechnology diffuses to the South is a function of differences in the
 cost of production in the two regions. The key result of the model is that
 labor force growth in the South initially increases real wages inthe North
 (a standard result in classical trade models), but in the long run reduces
 Northern wages by accelerating the transfer of technology and drawing
 capital out of the North as well.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Inventories and Interest Rates: A Critique of the Buffer Stock Model. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 168-76
Issue: 1
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Economists generally test for the effect of interest rates on inventories
 by including some measure of the real interest rate in a standard flexible
 accelerator-buffer stock model. This paper presentsseveral reasons for
 concluding that this approach is incorrect and demonstrates how interest
 rate effects can be introduced into decisionrules derived under the
 assumption of optimizing behavior by firms. Decision rules for finished
 good inventories, output, and price are estimated using monthly
 observations on the food and kindred product industry. The results
 generally conform to the predictions of the theory.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Issue: 1
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  A common view of golden parachutes and shark repellents is that they are
 designed by management to insulate itself from the discipline imposed by
 the market for corporate control and so are harmful to shareholders. This
 paper offers an alternative view that these devicesare beneficial to
 shareholders because they allow better contracting between manager and
 shareholders. Evidence on the incidence of goldenparachutes and on the
 compensation-tenure relationship for managers of golden parachute firms
 supports the alternative view.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Issue: 1
Volume: 76
Year: 1986

Abstract:
  A new data set for approximately 1,000 largest manufacturing firms inthe
 United States during 1957-77 is analyzed using a standard production
 function framework augmented by the addition of R&D "capital" and "mix"
 variables. The results indicate that R&D continued to contribute to
 productivity growth with no significant decline in its effectiveness in
 the 1970s as compared to the 1960s; that the contribution of basic
 research was significantly higher than its nominal ratio would imply; and
 that federally financed R&D expenditures had a positive but smaller effect
 on the productivity growth of these firms than the comparable contribution
 of privately financed R&D expenditures.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Retail Pricing and Clearance Sales. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 14-32
Issue: 1
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Sellers of new products are faced with having to guess demand conditions
 to set price appropriately. But sellers are able to adjustprice over time
 and to learn from past mistakes. Additionally, it is not necessary that
 all goods be sold with certainty. It is sometimes better to set a high
 price and to risk no sale. This process is modeledto explain retail
 pricing behavior and the time distribution of transactions. Prices start
 high and fall as a function of time on theshelf. The initial price and
 rate of decline can be predicted and depends on thinness of the market,
 the proportion of customers who are"window shoppers," and other observable
 characteristics.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Financial Panics, the Seasonality of the Nominal Interest Rate, and theFounding of the Fed. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 125-40
Issue: 1
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  After the founding of the Fed in 1914, the frequency of financial panics
 and the size of the seasonal movements in nominal interest ratesboth
 declined substantially. This paper establishes that the Fed, by carrying
 out the seasonal open market policy that eliminated the seasonal in
 nominal interest rates, caused the decrease in the frequency of panics.
 Since seasonal movements are anticipated and financial panics are probably
 real events, the results show that an anticipated monetary policy had real
 effects on the economy.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Tests of the Rational Expectations Hypothesis. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 110-24
Issue: 1
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper reviews evidence on the structure of anticipation from a
 number of empirical studies. Jack Muth's "rational expectations
 hypothesis" is compared with a variety of alternative models, including
 Ferber's Law, the "implicit expectations" model of Edwin Mills, and Muth's
 new "errors in the variables" model. The cumulative evidence is of such
 strength as to compel the suspension of belief in the concept of rational
 expectations. This implies that it is a mistake to proceed under the
 maintained hypothesis that expectations are rational; instead, it is
 necessary to test the sensitivity of empirical and theoretical results to
 alternative assumptions about the structure by which anticipations are
 generated.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Pages: 437-54
Issue: 3
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper presents an empirical test of two contrasting models of
 contracting in marital relationships. The major distinction between the
 two models concerns the role of information. The first model assumes that
 ex post information about the value of opportunities outside the
 relationship is symmetric. The second model assumes that information is
 asymmetric. Each assumption leads to different implications about the
 effects of rules allowing unilateral versus mutual divorce decisions on
 the probability of initiating and terminating the marriage and on the
 distribution of marital resources at divorce.	 Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 314-34
Issue: 3
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This study of output data for the periods 1866-1914 and 1947-82 shows
 that much of the apparent stabilization of the postwar economy is an
 artifact of the way the historical data are constructed. When the methods
 used to form the historical index of industrial production are replicated
 for the postwar era, the consistent data show less than half the
 stabilization apparent in modern data. The excess volatility of
 thehistorical data is due to the overrepresentation of materials and
 intermediate goods in the early indexes of total industrial production.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Issue: 3
Volume: 76
Year: 1986

Abstract:
  This paper presents estimates of the distributional welfare impacts ofthe
 actual price rises of energy and nonenergy commodities during the1970-80
 decade in the United States. Measures of welfare changes basedon net
 compensating variations are computed for families that differ with respect
 to demographic characteristics, initial total expenditurelevels, and total
 expenditure growth profiles over the decade. For comparison, measures of
 welfare change based solely on the changes inenergy prices are computed.
 The author shows that welfare differencesdue to initial expenditure levels
 or demographic profiles are minor incomparison to welfare differences due
 to different expenditure growthprofiles.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

 followingWorld War I. These data reveal that there were significant
 effects onemployment in the three territories. Unemployment peaked in
 Poland at alittle less than 13 percent; in Hungary at 12 percent and
 probably higher; and in Austria at 7 percent. An attempt is made to
 identify those considerations that contributed to the emergence of
 unemploymentwith the advent of monetary stabilization.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Unemployment Insurance and Labor Contracts under Asymmetric Information: Theory and Facts. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 365-77
Issue: 3
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The paper provides evidence to show that many U.S. labor contracts
 havelittle or no private unemployment insurance provision. A model of an
 optional contract under asymmetric information, with no private
 unemployment insurance, is presented. Underemployment and
 involuntaryunemployment may coexist.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   The Design of Procurement Contracts. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 378-89
Issue: 3
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper investigates the interaction between bidding for
 procurementprograms and fractional buys. This problem is analyzed from the
 standpoint of a cost-minimizing procuring agent. It is shown that
 underimperfect competition, a multiple-source purchase is generally
 preferred to a single-source contract. Similarly, the author demonstrates
 that a (strictly) intermediate cost sharing arrangement,i.e., an incentive
 contract, dominates either the cost-plus or the firm-fixed price
 arrangements.	 Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   A Supergame-Theoretic Model of Price Wars during Booms. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 390-407
Issue: 3
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper studies implicitly colluding oligopolists facing
 fluctuatingdemand. The credible threat of future punishments provides the
 discipline that facilitates collusion. However, the authors find that the
 temptation to unilaterally deviate from the collusive outcome is often
 greater when demand is high. To moderate this temptation, the optimizing
 oligopoly reduces its profitability at such times, resultingin lower
 prices. The behavior of the railroads in the 1880s, the automobile
 industry in the 1950s, the cyclical behavior of cement prices, and of
 price-cost margins are consistent with this theory. Thereduction of price
 by the oligopolistic sectors may have macro consequences.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   An Analysis of the Selection of Arbitrators. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 408-22
Issue: 3
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes alternative mechanisms for the selection of
 arbitrators. The authors review key institutional features of the
 threemost prevalent mechanisms for selecting arbitrators: rank/veto,
 alternate strike, and rotating panel. They present a more formal analysis
 in which these mechanisms are treated as economic games, andanalyze the
 alternative mechanisms in terms of the incentives they provide for
 strategic behavior and the efficiency of any equilibrium strategies that
 exist. Some implications of varying selected parametersof each mechanism
 are derived and the general role of arbitrator selection mechanisms in the
 process of bargaining under the threat ofarbitration are considered.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 423-36
Issue: 3
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper outlines the steps involved in constructing a new panel
 dataset of U.S. contract negotiations and strike activity. This data set
 has a much broader coverage of firms and unions than micro data sets
 analyzed to date. Key findings include the discovery that the variability,
 and not the level of firm profitability, affects the probability of a
 strike. Personal characteristics of the union workforce also emerge as key
 determinants of strike activity. Finally,strikes are found to be more
 likely when the local labor market is tight, but less likely when the
 industry labor market is tight.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Labor Supply and Marital Separation. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 455-69
Issue: 3
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Panel data are used to estimate the effect of marital separation on labor
 supply. Female labor supply increases substantially and male labor supply
 declines marginally, lending support to the theory of specialization
 within the household. The most interesting finding is that women began to
 increase their labor supply well before the actualsplit occurs, suggesting
 either that shocks to labor supply change divorce probabilities or that
 women with a higher likelihood of divorcework more. This argument is
 pursued by constructing and estimating a simultaneous model of labor
 supply and divorce risk.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1103-16
Issue: 5
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes the effects of income differentials in fertility on
 Lorenz curves and standard inequality measures. The role of
 intergenerational mobility is examined and incorporated into
 counterfactual simulations based on Brazilian data. Two standard
 inequality measures move in opposite directions in both the steady state
 and the transition in response to the elimination of fertility
 differentials. The counterfactuals confirm the theoretical predictions of
 misleading intertemporal inequality comparisons in the presence of
 differential fertility.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Abstract:
  The equilibrium of capital and equilibrium market prices are derived for
 a world economy with a unified securities market, mobile capital, no
 uncertainty, and varying tax rates on different sources of income in each
 country. The paper then characterizes optimal tax rates for a small
 country in this setting, focusing on the peculiar incentives created when
 the before-tax rate of return differs among securities due to differences
 in their typical tax treatment.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Productivity Growth, Convergence, and Welfare: What the Long-run Data Show. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1072-85
Issue: 5
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Maddison's 1870-1979 data are analyzed, showing the historically
 unprecedented growth in productivity, GDP per capita and exports and the
 remarkable convergence of productivities of industrialized market
 economies, with convergence apparently shared by planned economies but not
 less developed countries. Productivity lag's relation to
 "deindustrialization," unemployment and balance of payments is examined.
 The data confirm that U.S. productivity growth fell behind its
 extraordinary postwar peak but probably not below its long term level. It
 is also shown that more rapid productivity growth of other countries may
 only be a normal concommitant of convergence.	 Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1045-71
Issue: 5
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper presents an empirical analysis of firm-specific employment and
 wage outcomes for mechanics in the domestic airlines industry. A dynamic
 contracting model is presented that incorporates both costly employment
 adjustment and potential gaps between contract wage rates and the
 opportunity value of workers' time. The model gives a useful description
 of the employment-output linkage in the data, but is less successful in
 capturing the dynamic relation between employment, contract wage rates,
 and wage rates outside the airline industry.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Is Increased Price Flexibility Stabilizing? 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1031-44
Issue: 5
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper uses John Taylor's model of overlapping contracts to show that
 increased wage and price flexibility can easily be destabilizing because
 of the Mundell effect. While lower prices increase output, the expectation
 of falling prices decreases output. Simulations based on realistic
 parameter values suggest that increases in price flexibility might well
 increase the cyclical variability of output in the United States.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Nominal Contracts in a Bimetallic Standard. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1012-30
Issue: 5
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  As its central feature, a bimetallic standard grants nominal debtors an
 option to deliver either of two metals. With results from the option
 pricing literature,construction of a formula to evaluate the bimetallic
 option in debt instruments is straightforward. With this formula, one can
 compute the option value in a wide range of nineteenth-century U.S.
 Treasury securities. Posession of the option values permits an adjustment
 of the yields on U.S. securities to make them comparable to yields on
 nonmetallic European securities. Evaluating the option allows the
 estimation of transfers from debtors to creditors.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Explaining the Volume of Trade: An Eclectic Approach. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 1002-11
Issue: 5
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Divide the world into a capital-abundant North and a labor-abundant
 South. Subdivide the North into two identical regions, East and
 West.Modern trade theory predicts intraindustry trade in differentiated
 manufactured goods between East and West, and traditional interindustry
 trade based on factor endowments between North and South. But the theory
 offers no conclusions about the volume of trade , and gives no real role
 to demand in determining trade flows. The model developed here explains
 both the volume and the direction of trade by combining nonhomothetic
 preferences with scale economies and differences in endowments.   Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 984-1001
Issue: 5
Volume: 76
Year: 1986

Abstract:
  This paper quantifies the effects of exogenous variations in the state of
 technology (technological opportunity) and of the R&D of other firms
 (spillovers of R&D) on the productivity of firms' R&D. The R&D
 productivity is increased by the R&D of "technological neighbors," though
 neighbors' R&D lowers the profits and market value of low-R&D-intensity
 firms. Firms are shown to adjust the technological composition of their
 R&D in response to technological opportunity.	 Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Title:   Horizontal vs. Vertical Information Structure of the Firm. 
Journal: American Economic Review
Pages: 971-83
Issue: 5
Volume: 76
Year: 1986
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper compares the efficiency of two information structures of the
 firm in coordinating operational decisions among
 technologically-interrelated constituent units (shops) whose costs are
 uncertain. The structures compared are a hierarchical one in which the
 capability of management to monitor and respond to emergent events at the
 shop level is bounded; and a horizontal one inwhich production decisions
 are coordinated among shops without the centralization of information, but
 the capability of semiautonomous problem-solving by component units im
