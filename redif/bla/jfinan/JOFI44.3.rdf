Title: Institutional Markets, Financial Marketing, and Financial Innovation 
Author-Name: STEPHEN A. ROSS  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Firms
 and institutions are monitored and controlled through a complex set of
 implicit and explicit contractual relations. Because of these agency
 theoretic relations, institutional behavior in financial markets is not a
 simple reflection of the preference structures of individuals.
 Institutional preferences give rise to a demand for new financial
 instruments and innovations, even when the returns on these instruments
 are “spanned” in the sense of complete pricing. The innovations can be
 thought of as solving moral hazard problems. An agency theoretic example
 serves to illustrate the demand, supply, and financial marketing of
 stripped securities. In short, institutions matter.

Title: Market Created Risk 
Author-Name: ALAN KRAUS  
Author-Name: MAXWELL SMITH  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We
 develop a multiperiod rational expectations model of securities market
 equilibrium in which equilibrium prices may move between periods even
 though it is common knowledge that no new information has arrived about
 ultimate security payoffs. This happens because investors know they have
 imperfect information about the endowments of other investors and this
 knowledge affects their probability beliefs about the prices that will
 prevail at the intermediate trading date. These beliefs are reflected in
 the equilibrium at the initial trading date when investors focus on the
 probabilities of intermediate capital gains and losses, rather than
 ultimate payoffs.

Title: Pricing Contingent Claims under Interest Rate and Asset Price Risk 
Author-Name: NAOKI KISHIMOTO  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This
 paper presents a general framework for pricing contingent claims under
 interest rate and asset price uncertainty. The framework extends Ho and
 Lee's (1986) valuation framework by allowing not only future interest
 rates but also future asset prices to depend on the current term structure
 of interest rates. The approach is shown to provide risk-neutral valuation
 relationships that are consistent with the initial term structure of
 interest rates and can be applied to valuation of a broad class of assets
 including stock options, convertible bonds, and junk bonds.

Title: Arbitrage-Based Estimation of Nonstationary Shifts in the Term Structure of Interest Rates 
Author-Name: ROBERT R. BLISS JR. 
Author-Name: EHUD I. RONN  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>The
 purpose of this paper is to provide a test of a state-dependent
 multinomial model of intertemporal changes in the term structure of
 interest rates. The theoretical background for the model comes from Ho and
 Lee (1986). The current paper extends their model in several significant
 ways. First, we perform diagnostic tests on the data to demonstrate that
 the empirical results reject a binomial model in favor of a trinomial one.
 After theoretically deriving the appropriate trinomial model, the current
 paper extends their model to allow for state-dependent shifts which are
 determined by the set of ex ante observable state variables. The
 methodology for the study utilizes OLS regressions to identify the
 exogenous explanatory variables which drive the hypothesized trinomial
 process of term structure evolution. The empirical tests indicate that the
 set of state variables explains a significant portion of the variability
 in the shifts of the term structure over time. The model also identifies
 and quantifies a set of variables which impact on changes in the term
 structure of interest rates.

Title: Management Buyouts: Evidence on Taxes as a Source of Value 
Author-Name: STEVEN KAPLAN  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This
 paper estimates the value of tax benefits in 76 management buyouts of
 public companies completed in the period 1980 to 1986. The median value of
 tax benefits, estimated at the time the buyout company goes private, has a
 lower bound of 21% and an upper bound of 143% of the premium paid to
 pre-buyout shareholders. The estimated value depends on the rate buyout
 debt is repaid and the tax rate applied to the interest deductions. The
 paper also presents evidence on the actual taxes paid and debt repayment
 rates by these companies after the buyout. The results in this paper
 suggest that tax benefits are an important source of the wealth gains in
 management buyouts.

Title: Disclosure Decisions by Firms and the Competition for Price Efficiency 
Author-Name: MICHAEL J. FISHMAN  
Author-Name: KATHLEEN M. HAGERTY  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This
 paper develops a model of the relationship between investment decisions by
 firms and the efficiency of the market prices of their securities. It is
 shown that more efficient security prices can lead to more efficient
 investment decisions. This provides firms with the incentive to increase
 price efficiency by voluntarily disclosing information about the firm.
 Disclosure decisions are studied. It is shown that firms may expend more
 resources on disclosure than is socially optimal. This is in contrast to
 the concern implicit in mandatory disclosure rules that firms will expend
 too few resources on disclosure.

Title: Firm Value and the Choice of Offering Method in Initial Public Offerings 
Author-Name: NANCY L. BOWER  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>A firm
 raising capital in an initial public offering faces the problems of
 choosing between a firm-commitment and a best-efforts offering and of how
 to convey information about its value to potential investors. The offering
 method chosen affects both the firm's cost of obtaining capital and
 investors' perceptions about firm value. A partially pooling, partially
 separating equilibrium is found where high-valued firms have information
 about their values revealed in a firm-commitment offering, while
 low-valued firms use best-efforts offerings and are unable to distinguish
 themselves from other firms.

Title: Debt-for-Equity Swaps under a Rational Expectations Equilibrium 
Author-Name: VIHANG R. ERRUNZA  
Author-Name: ARTHUR F. MOREAU  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This
 paper analyzes LDC debt-for-equity swaps under a rational expectations
 equilibrium. Under full information, the swap can never be strictly
 preferred by the LDC, the MNC, and the bank. Under the postulated
 informational asymmetry assumptions the same results obtain, leading to
 the “lemons” market in reverse. Under rational expectations, the swap can
 only occur if the loan is correctly valued relative to all private
 information in the economy. Given that some swaps do occur, future models
 must reflect the unique features of swaps.

Title: The Size and Incidence of the Losses from Noise Trading 
Author-Name: J. BRADFORD DE LONG  
Author-Name: ANDREI SHLEIFER  
Author-Name: LAWRENCE H. SUMMERS  
Author-Name: ROBERT J. WALDMANN  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Recent
 empirical research has identified a significant amount of volatility in
 stock prices that cannot easily be explained by changes in fundamentals;
 one interpretation is that asset prices respond not only to news but also
 to irrational “noise trading.” We assess the welfare effects and incidence
 of such noice trading using an overlapping-generations model that gives
 investors short horizons. We find that the additional risk generated by
 noise trading can reduce the capital stock and consumption of the economy,
 and we show that part of that cost may be borne by rational investors. We
 conclude that the welfare costs of noise trading may be large if the
 magnitude of noise in aggregate stock prices is as large as suggested by
 some of the recent empirical litrature on the excess volatility of the
 market.

Title: Asset Pricing in Partially Segmented Markets: Evidence from the Finnish Market 
Author-Name: PEKKA T. HIETALA  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This
 paper analyzes asset pricing in a partially segmented market where
 citizens of a small country are allowed to hold only their domestic
 securities, whereas the rest of the investors (“foreigners”) are
 essentially allowed to hold all securities. In this market setting it may
 occur that the citizens of the small country are willing to pay less for
 their domestic securities than are the foreign investors. The paper
 derives equilibrium required rates of return for different investors in
 this market setting which perfectly occurred in Finland and tests this
 equilibrium model using data from the Finnish stock market. Empirical
 results are consistent with the hypotheses derived from the model.

Abstract:

 comovements in real stock prices between the U.K. and the U.S. appear to
 be too large to be accounted for in terms of the comovements of real
 dividends between the countries even after consideration of the
 possibility of information pooling. When consideration is made of the
 comovements of real interest rates between the countries, there is weaker
 evidence of excess comovement of price.

Title: Information Losses in a Dynamic Model of Credit 
Author-Name: WILLIAM W. LANG  
Author-Name: LEONARD I. NAKAMURA  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This
 paper examines dynamic information losses associated with loan
 terminations. We assume that the aggregated returns of current borrowers
 contain information about the mean returns to future borrowers. In a
 competitive loan market, the value of this information is not fully
 internalized by individual borrowers and lenders, and loan decisions fail
 to be first best. Introducing heterogeneous borrowers, who know their own
 risk characteristics better than lenders, safer borrowers are less willing
 to borrow when risk premia rise. As they cease borrowing, the information
 generated in credit markets becomes noisier and this tends to increase
 risk premia. The model produces alternating and persistent periods of
 “tight” and “loose” credit.

Title: An Empirical Investigation of U.S. Firms in Reorganization

Author-Name: WALTER N. TOROUS  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>The
 purpose of this paper is to understand the institutional features of
 Chapter 11 from an empirical examination of thirty firms that have emerged
 from reorganization. We find the recontracting framework of Chapter 11 to
 be complex, lengthy, and costly. Violations of absolute priority in favor
 of stockholders are frequently encountered. These deviations may result
 from the bargaining process of Chapter 11 or from a recontracting process
 between creditors and stockholders which recognizes the ability of
 stockholder-oriented management to preserve firm value. An example of such
 recontracting addresses Myers' underinvestment problem. An investigation
 of the effects of Chapter 11 on the pricing of risky debt is also
 provided.

Title: Free Cash Flow and Stockholder Gains in Going Private Transactions 
Author-Name: KENNETH LEHN  
Author-Name: ANNETTE POULSEN  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We
 investigate the source of stockholder gains in going private transactions.
 We find support for the hypothesis advanced by Jensen that a major source
 of these gains is the mitigation of agency problems associated with free
 cash flow. Using a sample of 263 going private transactions from 1980
 through 1987, our results indicate a significant relationship between
 undistributed cash flow and a firm's decision to go private. In addition,
 we find that premiums paid to stockholders are significantly related to
 undistributed cash flow. These results are especially strong for firms
 that went private between 1984 and 1987 and also for firms whose managers
 owned relatively little equity before the going private transaction.

Title: The Term Structure of Interest Rates in a Partially Observable Economy 
Author-Name: DAVID FELDMAN  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This
 paper investigates the term structure of interest rates in a multiperiod
 production and exchange economy with incomplete information. Unable to
 observe their stochastic investment opportunities, investors engage in
 dynamic Bayesian inference. This results in the endogenous identification
 of a more complex production function which generates a richer term
 structure, resembling the one that actual market prices imply. In
 addition, this paper introduces a characteristic function of the term
 structure and demonstrates that, in contrast with a fully observable
 economy, the widely investigated expectations hypothesis holds true only
 if interest rates are nonstochastic.
