Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This study shows that
 the guardians behind underaged accounts are successful at picking stocks.
 Moreover, they tend to channel their best trades through the accounts of
 children, especially when they trade just before major earnings
 announcements, large price changes, and takeover announcements. Building
 on these results, we argue that the proportion of total trading activity
 through underaged accounts (labeled BABYPIN) should serve as an effective
 proxy for the probability of information trading in a stock. Consistent
 with this claim, we show that investors demand a higher return for holding
 stocks with a greater likelihood of private information, proxied by
 BABYPIN.

Title: Product Market Threats, Payouts, and Financial Flexibility

Author-Name: NAGPURNANAND PRABHALA  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We examine how
 product market threats influence firm payout policy and cash holdings.
 Using firms' product text descriptions, we develop new measures of
 competitive threats. Our primary measure, product market fluidity,
 captures changes in rival firms' products relative to the firm's products.
 We show that fluidity decreases firm propensity to make payouts via
 dividends or repurchases and increases the cash held by firms, especially
 for firms with less access to financial markets. These results are
 consistent with the hypothesis that firms' financial policies are
 significantly shaped by product market threats and dynamics.

Title: Biased Beliefs, Asset Prices, and Investment: A Structural Approach 
Author-Name: AYDOĞAN ALTI  
Author-Name: PAUL C. TETLOCK  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We structurally
 estimate a model in which agents’ information processing biases can cause
 predictability in firms’ asset returns and investment inefficiencies. We
 generalize the neoclassical investment model by allowing for two
 biases—overconfidence and overextrapolation of trends—that distort agents’
 expectations of firm productivity. Our model's predictions closely match
 empirical data on asset pricing and firm behavior. The estimated bias
 parameters are well identified and exhibit plausible magnitudes.
 Alternative models without either bias or with efficient investment fail
 to match observed return predictability and firm behavior. These results
 suggest that biases affect firm behavior, which in turn affects return
 anomalies.

Title: Sources of Entropy in Representative Agent Models 
Author-Name: DAVID BACKUS  
Author-Name: MIKHAIL CHERNOV  
Author-Name: STANLEY ZIN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We propose two
 data-based performance measures for asset pricing models and apply them to
 models with recursive utility and habits. Excess returns on risky
 securities are reflected in the pricing kernel's dispersion and riskless
 bond yields are reflected in its dynamics. We measure dispersion with
 entropy and dynamics with horizon dependence, the difference between
 entropy over several periods and one. We compare their magnitudes to
 estimates derived from asset returns. This exercise reveals tension
 between a model's ability to generate one-period entropy, which should be
 large, and horizon dependence, which should be small.

Title: Do Peer Firms Affect Corporate Financial Policy? 
Author-Name: MARK T. LEARY  
Author-Name: MICHAEL R. ROBERTS  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We show that peer
 firms play an important role in determining corporate capital structures
 and financial policies. In large part, firms' financing decisions are
 responses to the financing decisions and, to a lesser extent, the
 characteristics of peer firms. These peer effects are more important for
 capital structure determination than most previously identified
 determinants. Furthermore, smaller, less successful firms are highly
 sensitive to their larger, more successful peers, but not vice versa. We
 also quantify the externalities generated by peer effects, which can
 amplify the impact of changes in exogenous determinants on leverage by
 over 70%.

Title: When Uncertainty Blows in the Orchard: Comovement and Equilibrium Volatility Risk Premia 
Author-Name: ANDREA BURASCHI  
Author-Name: FABIO TROJANI  
Author-Name: ANDREA VEDOLIN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We provide novel
 evidence for an equilibrium link between investors' disagreement, the
 market price of volatility and correlation, and the differential pricing
 of index and individual equity options. We show that belief disagreement
 is positively related to (i) the wedge between index and individual
 volatility risk premia, (ii) the different slope of the smile of index and
 individual options, and (iii) the correlation risk premium. Priced
 disagreement risk also explains returns of option volatility and
 correlation trading strategies in a way that is robust to the inclusion of
 other risk factors and different market conditions.

Title: An Anatomy of Commodity Futures Risk Premia

Author-Name: ROB GOORBERGH  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We identify two types
 of risk premia in commodity futures returns: spot premia related to the
 risk in the underlying commodity, and term premia related to changes in
 the basis. Sorting on forecasting variables such as the futures basis,
 return momentum, volatility, inflation, hedging pressure, and liquidity
 results in sizable spot premia between 5% and 14% per annum and term
 premia between 1% and 3% per annum. We show that a single factor, the
 high-minus-low portfolio from basis sorts, explains the cross-section of
 spot premia. Two additional basis factors are needed to explain the term
 premia.

Title: A Mean-Variance Benchmark for Intertemporal Portfolio Theory 
Author-Name: JOHN H. COCHRANE  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Mean-variance
 portfolio theory can apply to streams of payoffs such as dividends
 following an initial investment. This description is useful when returns
 are not independent over time and investors have nonmarketed income.
 Investors hedge their outside income streams. Then, their optimal payoff
 is split between an indexed perpetuity—the risk-free payoff—and a long-run
 mean-variance efficient payoff. “Long-run” moments sum over time as well
 as states of nature. In equilibrium, long-run expected returns vary with
 long-run market betas and outside-income betas. State-variable hedges do
 not appear.

Title: Asset Pricing with Dynamic Margin Constraints 
Author-Name: OLEG RYTCHKOV  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper provides a
 novel theoretical analysis of how endogenous time-varying margin
 requirements affect capital market equilibrium. I find that margin
 requirements, when there are no other market frictions, reduce the
 volatility and correlation of returns as well as the risk-free rate, but
 increase the market price of risk, the risk premium, and the price of
 risky assets. Furthermore, margin requirements generate a strong
 cross-sectional dispersion of stock return volatilities. The results
 emphasize that a general equilibrium analysis may reverse the conclusions
 of a partial equilibrium analysis often employed in the literature.

Title: Strategic Asset Allocation in Money Management 
Author-Name: SULEYMAN BASAK  
Author-Name: DMITRY MAKAROV  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper analyzes
 the dynamic portfolio choice implications of strategic interaction among
 money managers who compete for fund flows. We study such interaction
 between two risk-averse managers in continuous time, characterizing
 analytically their unique equilibrium investments. Driven by chasing and
 contrarian mechanisms when one is well ahead, they gamble in the opposite
 direction when their performance is close. We also examine multiple and
 mixed-strategy equilibria. Equilibrium policy of each manager crucially
 depends on the opponent's risk attitude. Hence, client investors concerned
 about how a strategic manager may trade on their behalf should also learn
 competitors' characteristics.

Title: Mergers and Acquisitions Accounting and the Diversification Discount 
Author-Name: CLÁUDIA CUSTÓDIO  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>q-based measures of
 the diversification discount are biased upward by mergers and acquisitions
 and its accounting implications. Under purchase accounting, acquired
 assets are reported at their transaction value, which typically exceeds
 the target's pre-merger book value. Thus, measured q tends to be lower for
 the merged firm than for the portfolio of pre-merger entities. Because
 conglomerates are more acquisitive than focused firms, their q tends to be
 lower. To mitigate this bias, I subtract goodwill from the book value of
 assets and a substantial part of the diversification discount is
 eliminated. Market-to-sales-based measures do not have this bias.

Title: Who Writes the News? Corporate Press Releases during Merger Negotiations 
Author-Name: KENNETH R. AHERN  
Author-Name: DENIS SOSYURA  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Firms have an
 incentive to manage media coverage to influence their stock prices during
 important corporate events. Using comprehensive data on media coverage and
 merger negotiations, we find that bidders in stock mergers originate
 substantially more news stories after the start of merger negotiations,
 but before the public announcement. This strategy generates a short-lived
 run-up in bidders' stock prices during the period when the stock exchange
 ratio is determined, which substantially impacts the takeover price. Our
 results demonstrate that the timing and content of financial media
 coverage may be biased by firms seeking to manipulate their stock price.
