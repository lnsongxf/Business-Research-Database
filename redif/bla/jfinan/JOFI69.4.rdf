Title: Mutual Fund Performance and the Incentive to Generate Alpha 
Author-Name: DIANE DEL GUERCIO  
Author-Name: JONATHAN REUTER  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>To rationalize the
 well-known underperformance of the average actively managed mutual fund,
 we exploit the fact that retail funds in different market segments compete
 for different types of investors. Within the segment of funds marketed
 directly to retail investors, we show that flows chase risk-adjusted
 returns, and that funds respond by investing more in active management.
 Importantly, within this direct-sold segment, we find no evidence that
 actively managed funds underperform index funds. In contrast, we show that
 actively managed funds sold through brokers face a weaker incentive to
 generate alpha and significantly underperform index funds.

Title: Time-Varying Fund Manager Skill 
Author-Name: MARCIN KACPERCZYK  
Author-Name: STIJN VAN NIEUWERBURGH  
Author-Name: LAURA VELDKAMP  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We propose a new
 definition of skill as general cognitive ability to pick stocks or time
 the market. We find evidence for stock picking in booms and market timing
 in recessions. Moreover, the same fund managers that pick stocks well in
 expansions also time the market well in recessions. These fund managers
 significantly outperform other funds and passive benchmarks. Our results
 suggest a new measure of managerial ability that weighs a fund's market
 timing more in recessions and stock picking more in booms. The measure
 displays more persistence than either market timing or stock picking alone
 and predicts fund performance.

Title: Liquidity Measurement Problems in Fast, Competitive Markets: Expensive and Cheap Solutions 
Author-Name: CRAIG W. HOLDEN  
Author-Name: STACEY JACOBSEN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Do fast, competitive
 markets yield liquidity measurement problems when using the popular
 Monthly Trade and Quote (MTAQ) database? Yes. MTAQ yields distorted
 measures of spreads, trade location, and price impact compared with the
 expensive Daily Trade and Quote (DTAQ) database. These problems are driven
 by (1) withdrawn quotes, (2) second (versus millisecond) time stamps, and
 (3) other causes, including canceled quotes. The expensive solution, using
 DTAQ, is first-best. For financially constrained researchers, the cheap
 solution—using MTAQ with our new Interpolated Time technique, adjusting
 for withdrawn quotes, and deleting economically nonsensical states—is
 second-best. These solutions change research inferences.

Title: Securitization and Capital Structure in Nonfinancial Firms: An Empirical Investigation 
Author-Name: MICHAEL LEMMON  
Author-Name: LAURA XIAOLEI LIU  
Author-Name: MIKE QINGHAO MAO  
Author-Name: GREG NINI  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Contrary to recent
 accounts of off-balance-sheet securitization by financial firms, we show
 that asset securitization by nonfinancial firms provides a valuable form
 of financing for shareholders without harming debtholders. Using data from
 firms’ SEC filings, we find that securitization is attractive to firms in
 the middle of the credit quality distribution, which are the firms with
 the most to gain. Upon initiation, firms experience positive abnormal
 stock returns and zero abnormal bond returns, and largely use the
 securitization proceeds to repay existing debt. Securitization minimizes
 financing costs by reducing expected bankruptcy costs and providing access
 to segmented credit markets.

Title: Merger Negotiations with Stock Market Feedback 
Author-Name: SANDRA BETTON

Author-Name: KARIN S. THORBURN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Do preoffer target
 stock price runups increase bidder takeover costs? We present model-based
 tests of this issue assuming runups are caused by signals that inform
 investors about potential takeover synergies. Rational deal anticipation
 implies a relation between target runups and markups (offer value minus
 runup) that is greater than minus one-for-one and inherently nonlinear. If
 merger negotiations force bidders to raise the offer with the runup—a
 costly feedback loop where bidders pay twice for anticipated target
 synergies—markups become strictly increasing in runups. Large-sample tests
 support rational deal anticipation in runups while rejecting the costly
 feedback loop.

Title: Stock Options as Lotteries 
Author-Name: BRIAN H. BOYER  
Author-Name: KEITH VORKINK  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We investigate the
 relationship between ex ante total skewness and holding returns on
 individual equity options. Recent theoretical developments predict a
 negative relationship between total skewness and average returns, in
 contrast to the traditional view that only coskewness is priced. We find,
 consistent with recent theory, that total skewness exhibits a strong
 negative relationship with average option returns. Differences in average
 returns for option portfolios sorted on ex ante skewness range from 10% to
 50% per week, even after controlling for risk. Our findings suggest that
 these large premiums compensate intermediaries for bearing unhedgeable
 risk when accommodating investor demand for lottery-like options.

Title: Skin in the Game and Moral Hazard 
Author-Name: GILLES CHEMLA  
Author-Name: CHRISTOPHER A. HENNESSY  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>What determines
 securitization levels, and should they be regulated? To address these
 questions we develop a model where originators can exert unobservable
 effort to increase expected asset quality, subsequently having private
 information regarding quality when selling ABS to rational investors.
 Absent regulation, originators may signal positive information via junior
 retentions or commonly adopt low retentions if funding value and price
 informativeness are high. Effort incentives are below first-best absent
 regulation. Optimal regulation promoting originator effort entails a menu
 of junior retentions or one junior retention with size decreasing in price
 informativeness. Zero retentions and opacity are optimal among regulations
 inducing zero effort.

Title: Measuring Readability in Financial Disclosures 
Author-Name: TIM LOUGHRAN  
Author-Name: BILL MCDONALD  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Defining and
 measuring readability in the context of financial disclosures becomes
 important with the increasing use of textual analysis and the Securities
 and Exchange Commission's plain English initiative. We propose defining
 readability as the effective communication of valuation-relevant
 information. The Fog Index—the most commonly applied readability
 measure—is shown to be poorly specified in financial applications. Of
 Fog's two components, one is misspecified and the other is difficult to
 measure. We report that 10-K document file size provides a simple
 readability proxy that outperforms the Fog Index, does not require
 document parsing, facilitates replication, and is correlated with
 alternative readability constructs.

Title: Alpha and Performance Measurement: The Effects of Investor Disagreement and Heterogeneity 
Author-Name: WAYNE FERSON  
Author-Name: JERCHERN LIN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>The literature has
 not established that a positive alpha, as traditionally measured, means
 that an investor would want to buy a fund. When alpha is defined using the
 client's utility function, a positive alpha generally means the client
 would want to buy. When markets are incomplete, investors will disagree
 about the attractiveness of a fund. We provide bounds on the expected
 disagreement with a traditional alpha and study the cross-sectional
 relation of disagreement and investor heterogeneity with the flow response
 to past fund alphas. The effects are both economically and statistically
 significant.

Title: The Executive Turnover Risk Premium 
Author-Name: FLORIAN S. PETERS  
Author-Name: ALEXANDER F. WAGNER  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We establish that
 CEOs of companies experiencing volatile industry conditions are more
 likely to be dismissed. At the same time, accounting for various other
 factors, industry risk is unlikely to be associated with CEO compensation
 other than through dismissal risk. Using this identification strategy, we
 document that CEO turnover risk is significantly positively associated
 with compensation. This finding is important because job-risk-compensating
 wage differentials arise naturally in competitive labor markets. By
 contrast, the evidence rejects an entrenchment model according to which
 powerful CEOs have lower job risk and at the same time secure higher
 compensation.

Title: Presidential Address: Investment Noise and Trends 
Author-Name: ROBERT F. STAMBAUGH  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>During the past few
 decades, the fraction of the equity market owned directly by individuals
 declined significantly. The same period witnessed investment trends that
 include the growth of indexing as well as shifts by active managers toward
 lower fees and more index-like investing. I develop an equilibrium model
 linking these investment trends to the decline in individual ownership,
 interpreting the latter as a reduction in noise trading. Active management
 corrects most noise trader–induced mispricing, and the fraction left
 uncorrected shrinks as noise traders' stake in the market declines. Less
 mispricing then dictates a smaller footprint for active management.
