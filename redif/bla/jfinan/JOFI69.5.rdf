Title: The TIPS-Treasury Bond Puzzle 
Author-Name: MATTHIAS FLECKENSTEIN  
Author-Name: FRANCIS A. LONGSTAFF  
Author-Name: HANNO LUSTIG  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We show that the
 price of a Treasury bond and an inflation-swapped Treasury
 Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) issue exactly replicating the cash
 flows of the Treasury bond can differ by more than $20 per $100 notional.
 Treasury bonds are almost always overvalued relative to TIPS. Total
 TIPS-Treasury mispricing has exceeded $56 billion, representing nearly 8%
 of the total amount of TIPS outstanding. We find direct evidence that the
 mispricing narrows as additional capital flows into the markets. This
 provides strong support for the slow-moving-capital explanation of
 arbitrage persistence.

Title: Corporate Innovations and Mergers and Acquisitions 
Author-Name: JAN BENA  
Author-Name: KAI LI  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Using a large and
 unique patent-merger data set over the period 1984 to 2006, we show that
 companies with large patent portfolios and low R&D expenses are acquirers,
 while companies with high R&D expenses and slow growth in patent output
 are targets. Further, technological overlap between firm pairs has a
 positive effect on transaction incidence, and this effect is reduced for
 firm pairs that overlap in product markets. We also show that acquirers
 with prior technological linkage to their target firms produce more
 patents afterwards. We conclude that synergies obtained from combining
 innovation capabilities are important drivers of acquisitions.

Title: Have Rating Agencies Become More Conservative? Implications for Capital Structure and Debt Pricing 
Author-Name: RAMIN P. BAGHAI  
Author-Name: HENRI SERVAES  
Author-Name: ANE TAMAYO  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Rating agencies have
 become more conservative in assigning corporate credit ratings over the
 period 1985 to 2009; holding firm characteristics constant, average
 ratings have dropped by three notches. This change does not appear to be
 fully warranted because defaults have declined over this period. Firms
 affected more by conservatism issue less debt, have lower leverage, hold
 more cash, are less likely to obtain a debt rating, and experience lower
 growth. Their debt spreads are lower than those of unaffected firms with
 the same rating, which implies that the market partly undoes the impact of
 conservatism on debt prices. This evidence suggests that firms and capital
 markets do not perceive the increase in conservatism to be fully
 warranted.

Title: Private Equity Performance: What Do We Know?

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We study the
 performance of nearly 1,400 U.S. buyout and venture capital funds using a
 new data set from Burgiss. We find better buyout fund performance than
 previously documented—performance has consistently exceeded that of public
 markets. Outperformance versus the S&P 500 averages 20% to 27% over a
 fund's life and more than 3% annually. Venture capital funds outperformed
 public equities in the 1990s, but underperformed in the 2000s. Our
 conclusions are robust to various indices and risk controls. Performance
 in Cambridge Associates and Preqin is qualitatively similar to that in
 Burgiss, but is lower in Venture Economics.

Title: The Media and the Diffusion of Information in Financial Markets: Evidence from Newspaper Strikes 
Author-Name: JOEL PERESS  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>The media are
 increasingly recognized as key players in financial markets. I investigate
 their causal impact on trading and price formation by examining national
 newspaper strikes in several countries. Trading volume falls 12% on strike
 days. The dispersion of stock returns and their intraday volatility are
 reduced by 7%, while aggregate returns are unaffected. Moreover, analysis
 of return predictability indicates that newspapers propagate news from the
 previous day. These findings demonstrate that the media contribute to the
 efficiency of the stock market by improving the dissemination of
 information among investors and its incorporation into stock prices.

Title: Shaping Liquidity: On the Causal Effects of Voluntary Disclosure 
Author-Name: KARTHIK BALAKRISHNAN  
Author-Name: MARY BROOKE BILLINGS  
Author-Name: BRYAN KELLY  
Author-Name: ALEXANDER LJUNGQVIST  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Can managers
 influence the liquidity of their firms’ shares? We use plausibly exogenous
 variation in the supply of public information to show that firms actively
 shape their information environments by voluntarily disclosing more
 information than regulations mandate and that such efforts improve
 liquidity. Firms respond to an exogenous loss of public information by
 providing more timely and informative earnings guidance. Responses appear
 motivated by a desire to reduce information asymmetries between retail and
 institutional investors. Liquidity improves as a result and in turn
 increases firm value. This suggests that managers can causally influence
 their cost of capital via voluntary disclosure.

Title: The Joint Cross Section of Stocks and Options

Author-Name: NUSRET CAKICI  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Stocks with large
 increases in call (put) implied volatilities over the previous month tend
 to have high (low) future returns. Sorting stocks ranked into decile
 portfolios by past call implied volatilities produces spreads in average
 returns of approximately 1% per month, and the return differences persist
 up to six months. The cross section of stock returns also predicts option
 implied volatilities, with stocks with high past returns tending to have
 call and put option contracts that exhibit increases in implied volatility
 over the next month, but with decreasing realized volatility. These
 predictability patterns are consistent with rational models of informed
 trading.

Title: Agency Conflicts and Cash: Estimates from a Dynamic Model 
Author-Name: BORIS NIKOLOV  
Author-Name: TONI M. WHITED  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Which agency problems
 affect corporate cash policy? To answer this question, we estimate a
 dynamic model of finance and investment with three mechanisms that
 misalign managerial and shareholder incentives: limited managerial
 ownership of the firm, compensation based on firm size, and managerial
 perquisite consumption. We find that perquisite consumption critically
 impacts cash policy. Size-based compensation also matters, but less. Firms
 with lower blockholder and institutional ownership have higher managerial
 perquisite consumption, low managerial ownership is a key factor in the
 secular upward trend in cash holdings, and agency plays little role in
 small firms' substantial cash holdings.

Title: Financial Protectionism? First Evidence 
Author-Name: ANDREW K. ROSE  
Author-Name: TOMASZ WIELADEK  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We examine large
 public interventions in the financial sector, such as bank
 nationalizations and search for “financial protectionism,” a decrease in
 the quantity and/or an increase in the price of loans that banks from one
 country make to borrowers resident in another. We use a bank-level panel
 data set spanning all U.K.-resident banks between 1997Q3 and 2010Q1. After
 nationalization, foreign banks reduced their fraction of British loans by
 about 11% and increased their effective interest rates by about 70 basis
 points. In contrast, nationalized British banks did not significantly
 change either their loan mix or effective interest rates.

Title: What's Not There: Odd Lots and Market Data 
Author-Name: MAUREEN O'HARA  
Author-Name: CHEN YAO  
Author-Name: MAO YE  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We investigate
 odd-lot trades in equity markets. Odd lots are increasingly used in
 algorithmic and high-frequency trading, but are not reported to the
 consolidated tape or in databases such as TAQ. In our sample, the median
 number of odd-lot trades is 24% but in some stocks odd lots are 60% or
 more of trading. Odd-lot trades contribute 35% of price discovery,
 consistent with informed traders using odd lots to avoid detection.
 Omitting odd-lot trades leads to inaccuracies in order imbalance measures
 and makes sentiment measures unreliable. Excluding odd lots from the
 consolidated tape raises important regulatory issues.

Author-Name: CLARA VEGA  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We study the impact
 of algorithmic trading (AT) in the foreign exchange market using a long
 time series of high-frequency data that identify computer-generated
 trading activity. We find that AT causes an improvement in two measures of
 price efficiency: the frequency of triangular arbitrage opportunities and
 the autocorrelation of high-frequency returns. We show that the reduction
 in arbitrage opportunities is associated primarily with computers taking
 liquidity. This result is consistent with the view that AT improves
 informational efficiency by speeding up price discovery, but that it may
 also impose higher adverse selection costs on slower traders. In contrast,
 the reduction in the autocorrelation of returns owes more to the
 algorithmic provision of liquidity. We also find evidence consistent with
 the strategies of algorithmic traders being highly correlated. This
 correlation, however, does not appear to cause a degradation in market
 quality, at least not on average.

Title: Does Stock Liquidity Enhance or Impede Firm Innovation? 
Author-Name: VIVIAN W. FANG  
Author-Name: XUAN TIAN  
Author-Name: SHERI TICE  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We aim to tackle the
 longstanding debate on whether stock liquidity enhances or impedes firm
 innovation. This topic is of interest because innovation is crucial for
 firm- and national-level competitiveness and stock liquidity can be
 altered by financial market regulations. Using a difference-in-differences
 approach that relies on the exogenous variation in liquidity generated by
 regulatory changes, we find that an increase in liquidity causes a
 reduction in future innovation. We identify two possible mechanisms
 through which liquidity impedes innovation: increased exposure to hostile
 takeovers and higher presence of institutional investors who do not
 actively gather information or monitor.
