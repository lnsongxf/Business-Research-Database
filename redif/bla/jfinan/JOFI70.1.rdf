Title: Taxes and Corporate Policies: Evidence from a Quasi Natural Experiment 
Author-Name: CRAIG DOIDGE  
Author-Name: ALEXANDER DYCK  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We document important
 interactions between tax incentives and corporate policies using a “quasi
 natural experiment” provided by a surprise announcement that imposed
 corporate taxes on a group of Canadian publicly traded firms. The
 announcement caused a dramatic decrease in value. Prospective tax shields
 partially offset the losses, adding 4.6% to firm value on average, and
 vary with the tax status of the marginal investor. Further, firms adjust
 leverage, payout, cash holdings, and investment in response to changing
 tax incentives. Overall, the event study and time series evidence supports
 the view that taxes are important for corporate decision making.

Title: Taking the Long Way Home: U.S. Tax Evasion and Offshore Investments in U.S. Equity and Debt Markets 
Author-Name: MICHELLE HANLON

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We empirically
 investigate one form of illegal investor-level tax evasion and its effect
 on foreign portfolio investment. In particular, we examine a form of
 round-tripping tax evasion in which U.S. individuals hide funds in
 entities located in offshore tax havens and then invest those funds in
 U.S. securities markets. Employing Becker's (<link
 href="#jofi12120-bib-0006"/>) economic theory of crime, we identify the
 tax evasion component by examining how foreign portfolio investment varies
 with changes in the incentives to evade and the risks of detection. To our
 knowledge, this is the first empirical evidence of investor-level tax
 evasion affecting cross-border equity and debt investment.

Title: Do Acquisitions Relieve Target Firms’ Financial Constraints? 
Author-Name: ISIL EREL  
Author-Name: YEEJIN JANG  
Author-Name: MICHAEL S. WEISBACH  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Managers often claim
 that target firms are financially constrained prior to being acquired and
 that these constraints are eased following the acquisition. Using a large
 sample of European acquisitions, we document that the level of cash that
 target firms hold, the sensitivity of cash to cash flow, and the
 sensitivity of investment to cash flow all decline, while investment
 increases following the acquisition. These effects are stronger in deals
 that are more likely to be associated with financing improvements. Our
 findings suggest that acquisitions relieve financial frictions in target
 firms, especially when the target firm is relatively small.

Title: Borrower Misreporting and Loan Performance 
Author-Name: MARK J. GARMAISE  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Borrower misreporting
 is associated with seriously adverse loan outcomes. Significantly more
 residential mortgage borrowers reported personal assets just above round
 number thresholds than just below. Borrowers who reported above-threshold
 assets were almost 25 percentage points more likely to become delinquent
 (mean delinquency was 20%). For applicants with unverified assets, the
 increase in delinquency was greater than 40 percentage points.
 Misreporting was most frequent in areas with low financial literacy or
 social capital. Incorporating behavioral cues such as threshold effects
 into a risk assessment model improves its ability to uncover
 delinquencies, though at a cost of mischaracterizing some safe loans.

Title: How Stable Are Corporate Capital Structures? 
Author-Name: HARRY DeANGELO  
Author-Name: RICHARD ROLL  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Leverage
 cross-sections more than a few years apart differ markedly, with
 similarities evaporating as the time between them lengthens. Many firms
 have high and low leverage at different times, but few keep debt-to-assets
 ratios consistently above 0.500. Capital structure stability is the
 exception, not the rule, occurs primarily at low leverage, and is
 virtually always temporary, with many firms abandoning low leverage during
 the post-war boom. Industry-median leverage varies widely over time.
 Target-leverage models that place little or no weight on maintaining a
 particular ratio do a good job replicating the substantial instability of
 the actual leverage cross-section.

Title: Click or Call? Auction versus Search in the Over-the-Counter Market 
Author-Name: TERRENCE HENDERSHOTT  
Author-Name: ANANTH MADHAVAN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Over-the-counter
 (OTC) markets dominate trading in many asset classes. Will electronic
 trading displace traditional OTC “voice” trading? Can electronic and voice
 systems coexist? What types of securities and trades are best suited for
 electronic trading? We study these questions by focusing on an innovation
 in electronic trading technology that enables investors to simultaneously
 search many bond dealers. We show that periodic one-sided electronic
 auctions are a viable and important source of liquidity even in inactively
 traded instruments. These mechanisms are a natural compromise between
 bilateral search in OTC markets and continuous double auctions in
 electronic limit order books.

Title: A Crisis of Banks as Liquidity Providers 
Author-Name: VIRAL V. ACHARYA  
Author-Name: NADA MORA  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Can banks maintain
 their advantage as liquidity providers when exposed to a financial crisis?
 While banks honored credit lines drawn by firms during the 2007 to 2009
 crisis, this liquidity provision was only possible because of explicit,
 large support from the government and government-sponsored agencies. At
 the onset of the crisis, aggregate deposit inflows into banks weakened and
 their loan-to-deposit shortfalls widened. These patterns were pronounced
 at banks with greater undrawn commitments. Such banks sought to attract
 deposits by offering higher rates, but the resulting private funding was
 insufficient to cover shortfalls and they reduced new credit.

Title: Money Doctors 
Author-Name: NICOLA GENNAIOLI  
Author-Name: ANDREI SHLEIFER  
Author-Name: ROBERT VISHNY  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We present a new
 model of investors delegating portfolio management to professionals based
 on trust. Trust in the manager reduces an investor's perception of the
 riskiness of a given investment, and allows managers to charge fees. Money
 managers compete for investor funds by setting fees, but because of trust,
 fees do not fall to costs. In equilibrium, fees are higher for assets with
 higher expected return, managers on average underperform the market net of
 fees, but investors nevertheless prefer to hire managers to investing on
 their own. When investors hold biased expectations, trust causes managers
 to pander to investor beliefs.

Title: Inflation Risk in Corporate Bonds 
Author-Name: JOHNNY KANG  
Author-Name: CAROLIN E. PFLUEGER  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We argue that
 corporate bond yields reflect fears of debt deflation. When debt is
 nominal, unexpectedly low inflation increases real liabilities and default
 risk. In a real business cycle model with optimal but infrequent capital
 structure choice, more uncertain or procyclical inflation leads to
 quantitatively important increases in corporate log yields in excess of
 default-free log yields. A panel of credit spread indexes from six
 developed countries shows that credit spreads rise by 14 basis points if
 inflation volatility or the inflation-stock correlation increases by one
 standard deviation.

Title: The Pre-FOMC Announcement Drift 
Author-Name: DAVID O. LUCCA  
Author-Name: EMANUEL MOENCH  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We document large
 average excess returns on U.S. equities in anticipation of monetary policy
 decisions made at scheduled meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee
 (FOMC) in the past few decades. These pre-FOMC returns have increased over
 time and account for sizable fractions of total annual realized stock
 returns. While other major international equity indices experienced
 similar pre-FOMC returns, we find no such effect in U.S. Treasury
 securities and money market futures. Other major U.S. macroeconomic news
 announcements also do not give rise to preannouncement excess equity
 returns. We discuss challenges in explaining these returns with standard
 asset pricing theory.

Author-Name: CASEY DOUGAL  
Author-Name: CHRISTOPHER A. PARSONS  
Author-Name: SHERIDAN TITMAN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We find that a firm's
 investment is highly sensitive to the investments of other firms
 headquartered nearby, even those in very different industries. A firm's
 investment also responds to fluctuations in the cash flows and stock
 prices (q) of local firms outside its sector. These patterns do not appear
 to reflect exogenous area shocks such as local shocks to labor or real
 estate values, but rather suggest that local agglomeration economies are
 important determinants of firm investment and growth.

Title: Short-Term Debt as Bridge Financing: Evidence from the Commercial Paper Market 
Author-Name: MATTHIAS KAHL  
Author-Name: ANIL SHIVDASANI  
Author-Name: YIHUI WANG  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We analyze why firms
 use nonintermediated short-term debt by studying the commercial paper (CP)
 market. Using a comprehensive database of CP issuers and issuance
 activity, we show that firms use CP to provide start-up financing for
 capital investment. Firms’ CP issuance is driven by a desire to minimize
 transaction costs associated with raising capital for new investment. We
 show that firms with high rollover risk are less likely to enter the CP
 market, borrow less CP, and borrow more from bank credit lines. Further,
 CP is often refinanced with long-term bond issuance to reduce rollover
 risk.
