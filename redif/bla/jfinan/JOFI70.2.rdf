Title: The Recovery Theorem 
Author-Name: STEVE ROSS  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We can only estimate
 the distribution of stock returns, but from option prices we observe the
 distribution of state prices. State prices are the product of risk
 aversion—the pricing kernel—and the natural probability distribution. The
 Recovery Theorem enables us to separate these to determine the market's
 forecast of returns and risk aversion from state prices alone. Among other
 things, this allows us to recover the pricing kernel, market risk premium,
 and probability of a catastrophe and to construct model-free tests of the
 efficient market hypothesis.

Title: On the Design of Contingent Capital with a Market Trigger 
Author-Name: SURESH SUNDARESAN  
Author-Name: ZHENYU WANG  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Contingent capital
 (CC), which aims to internalize the costs of too-big-to-fail in the
 capital structure of large banks, has been under intense debate by policy
 makers and academics. We show that CC with a market trigger, in which
 direct stakeholders are unable to choose optimal conversion policies, does
 not lead to a unique competitive equilibrium unless value transfer at
 conversion is not expected ex ante. The “no value transfer” restriction
 precludes penalizing bank managers for taking excessive risk. Multiplicity
 or absence of equilibrium introduces the potential for price uncertainty,
 market manipulation, inefficient capital allocation, and frequent
 conversion errors.

Title: Aggregate Jump and Volatility Risk in the Cross-Section of Stock Returns 
Author-Name: MARTIJN CREMERS

Author-Name: DAVID WEINBAUM  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We examine the
 pricing of both aggregate jump and volatility risk in the cross-section of
 stock returns by constructing investable option trading strategies that
 load on one factor but are orthogonal to the other. Both aggregate jump
 and volatility risk help explain variation in expected returns. Consistent
 with theory, stocks with high sensitivities to jump and volatility risk
 have low expected returns. Both can be measured separately and are
 important economically, with a two-standard-deviation increase in jump
 (volatility) factor loadings associated with a 3.5% to 5.1% (2.7% to 2.9%)
 drop in expected annual stock returns.

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We offer the first
 empirical evidence on the adverse effect of credit default swap (CDS)
 coverage on subprime mortgage defaults. Using a large database of
 privately securitized mortgages, we find that higher defaults concentrate
 in mortgage pools with concurrent CDS coverage, and within these pools the
 loans originated after or shortly before the start of CDS coverage have an
 even higher delinquency rate. The results are robust across zip code and
 origination quarter cohorts. Overall, we show that CDS coverage helped
 drive higher mortgage defaults during the financial crisis.

Title: Estimating Oil Risk Factors Using Information from Equity and Derivatives Markets 
Author-Name: I-HSUAN ETHAN CHIANG  
Author-Name: W. KEENER HUGHEN  
Author-Name: JACOB S. SAGI  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We introduce a novel
 approach to estimating latent oil risk factors and establish their
 significance in pricing nonoil securities. Our model, which features four
 factors with simple economic interpretations, is estimated using both
 derivative prices and oil-related equity returns. The fit is excellent in
 and out of sample. The extracted oil factors carry significant risk
 premia, and are significantly related to macroeconomic variables as well
 as portfolio returns sorted on characteristics and industry. The average
 nonoil portfolio exhibits a sensitivity to the oil factors amounting to a
 sixth (in magnitude) of that of the oil industry itself.

Title: The Effect of Succession Taxes on Family Firm Investment: Evidence from a Natural Experiment 
Author-Name: MARGARITA TSOUTSOURA  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper provides
 causal evidence on the impact of succession taxes on firm investment
 decisions and transfer of control. Using a 2002 policy change in Greece
 that substantially reduced the tax on intrafamily transfers of businesses,
 I show that succession taxes lead to a more than 40% decline in investment
 around family successions, slow sales growth, and a depletion of cash
 reserves. Furthermore, succession taxes strongly affect the decision to
 sell or retain the firm within the family. I conclude by discussing
 implications of my findings for firms in the United States and Europe.

Title: Yesterday's Heroes: Compensation and Risk at Financial Firms 
Author-Name: ING-HAW CHENG  
Author-Name: HARRISON HONG  
Author-Name: JOSÉ A. SCHEINKMAN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Many believe that
 compensation, misaligned from shareholders’ value due to managerial
 entrenchment, caused financial firms to take risks before the financial
 crisis of 2008. We argue that, even in a classical principal-agent setting
 without entrenchment and with exogenous firm risk, riskier firms may offer
 higher total pay as compensation for the extra risk in equity stakes borne
 by risk-averse managers. Using long lags of stock price risk to capture
 exogenous firm risk, we confirm our conjecture and show that riskier firms
 are also more productive and more likely to be held by institutional
 investors, who are most able to influence compensation.

Title: Subsidizing Liquidity: The Impact of Make/Take Fees on Market Quality 
Author-Name: KATYA MALINOVA  
Author-Name: ANDREAS PARK  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Facing increased
 competition over the last decade, many stock exchanges changed their
 trading fees to maker-taker pricing, an incentive scheme that rewards
 liquidity suppliers and charges liquidity demanders. Using a change in
 trading fees on the Toronto Stock Exchange, we study whether and why the
 breakdown of trading fees between liquidity demanders and suppliers
 matters. Posted quotes adjust after the change in fee composition, but the
 transaction costs for liquidity demanders remain unaffected once fees are
 taken into account. However, as posted bid-ask spreads decline, traders
 (particularly retail) use aggressive orders more frequently, and adverse
 selection costs decrease.

Title: How Does Household Portfolio Diversification Vary with Financial Literacy and Financial Advice? 
Author-Name: HANS-MARTIN VON GAUDECKER  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Household investment
 mistakes are an important concern for researchers and policymakers alike.
 Portfolio underdiversification ranks among those mistakes that are
 potentially most costly. However, its roots and empirical importance are
 poorly understood. I estimate quantitatively meaningful diversification
 statistics and investigate their relationship with key variables. Nearly
 all households that score high on financial literacy or rely on
 professionals or private contacts for advice achieve reasonable investment
 outcomes. Compared to these groups, households with below-median financial
 literacy that trust their own decision-making capabilities lose an
 expected 50 bps on average. All group differences stem from the top of the
 loss distribution.

Title: Defined Contribution Pension Plans: Sticky or Discerning Money? 
Author-Name: CLEMENS SIALM  
Author-Name: LAURA T. STARKS  
Author-Name: HANJIANG ZHANG  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Participants in
 defined contribution (DC) retirement plans rarely adjust their portfolio
 allocations, suggesting that their investment choices and consequent money
 flows are sticky and not discerning. However, participants’ inertia could
 be offset by DC plan sponsors, who adjust the plan's investment options.
 We examine these countervailing influences on flows into U.S. mutual
 funds. We find that flows into funds from DC assets are more volatile and
 exhibit more performance sensitivity than non-DC flows, primarily due to
 adjustments to the investment options by the plan sponsors. Thus, DC
 retirement money is less sticky and more discerning than non-DC money.

Title: Incentivizing Calculated Risk-Taking: Evidence from an Experiment with Commercial Bank Loan Officers 
Author-Name: SHAWN COLE  
Author-Name: MARTIN KANZ  
Author-Name: LEORA KLAPPER  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We conduct an
 experiment with commercial bank loan officers to test how performance
 compensation affects risk assessment and lending. High-powered incentives
 lead to greater screening effort and more profitable lending decisions.
 This effect is muted, however, by deferred compensation and limited
 liability, two standard features of loan officer compensation contracts.
 We find that career concerns and personality traits affect loan officer
 behavior, but show that the response to incentives does not vary with
 traits such as risk-aversion, optimism, or overconfidence. Finally, we
 present evidence that incentives distort the assessment of credit risk,
 even among professionals with many years of experience.

Title: Size Anomalies in U.S. Bank Stock Returns 
Author-Name: PRIYANK GANDHI  
Author-Name: HANNO LUSTIG  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>The largest
 commercial bank stocks, ranked by total size of the balance sheet, have
 significantly lower risk-adjusted returns than small- and medium-sized
 bank stocks, even though large banks are significantly more levered. We
 uncover a size factor in the component of bank returns that is orthogonal
 to the standard risk factors, including small minus big, which has the
 right covariance with bank returns to explain the average risk-adjusted
 returns. This factor measures size-dependent exposure to bank-specific
 tail risk. These findings are consistent with government guarantees that
 protect shareholders of large banks, but not small banks, in disaster
 states.
