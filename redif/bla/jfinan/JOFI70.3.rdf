Title: Corporate Taxes and Securitization

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Most banks pay
 corporate income taxes, but securitization vehicles do not. Our model
 shows that, when a bank faces strong loan demand but limited deposit
 market power, this tax asymmetry creates an incentive to sell loans
 despite less-efficient screening and monitoring of sold loans. Moreover,
 loan-selling increases as a bank's corporate income tax rate and capital
 requirement rise. Our empirical tests show that U.S. commercial banks sell
 more of their mortgages when they operate in states that impose higher
 corporate income taxes. A policy implication is that tax-induced
 loan-selling will rise if banks’ required equity capital increases.

Title: Change You Can Believe In? Hedge Fund Data Revisions 
Author-Name: ANDREW J. PATTON

Author-Name: MICHAEL STREATFIELD  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We analyze the
 reliability of voluntary disclosures of financial information, focusing on
 widely-employed publicly-available hedge fund databases. Tracking changes
 to statements of historical performance recorded between 2007 and 2011, we
 find that historical returns are routinely revised. These revisions are
 not merely random or corrections of earlier mistakes; they are partly
 forecastable by fund characteristics. Funds that revise their performance
 histories significantly and predictably underperform those that have never
 revised, suggesting that unreliable disclosures constitute a valuable
 source of information for investors. These results speak to current
 debates about mandatory disclosures by financial institutions to market
 regulators.

Title: Innovation, Growth, and Asset Prices 
Author-Name: HOWARD KUNG  
Author-Name: LUKAS SCHMID  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We examine the asset
 pricing implications of a production economy whose long-term growth
 prospects are endogenously determined by innovation and R&D. In
 equilibrium, R&D endogenously drives a small, persistent component in
 productivity that generates long-run uncertainty about economic growth.
 With recursive preferences, households fear that persistent downturns in
 economic growth are accompanied by low asset valuations and command
 high-risk premia in asset markets. Empirically, we find substantial
 evidence for innovation-driven low-frequency movements in aggregate growth
 rates and asset market valuations. In short, equilibrium growth is risky.

Title: Dividend Dynamics and the Term Structure of Dividend Strips 
Author-Name: FREDERICO BELO  
Author-Name: PIERRE COLLIN-DUFRESNE  
Author-Name: ROBERT S. GOLDSTEIN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Many leading asset
 pricing models are specified so that the term structure of dividend
 volatility is either flat or upward sloping. These models predict that the
 term structures of expected returns and volatilities on dividend strips
 (i.e., claims to dividends paid over a prespecified interval) are also
 upward sloping. However, the empirical evidence suggests otherwise. This
 discrepancy can be reconciled if these models replace their proposed
 dividend dynamics with processes that generate stationary leverage ratios.
 Under such policies, shareholders are forced to divest (invest) when
 leverage is low (high), which shifts risk from long- to short-horizon
 dividend strips.

Title: CEO Connectedness and Corporate Fraud 
Author-Name: VIKRAMADITYA KHANNA  
Author-Name: E. HAN KIM  
Author-Name: YAO LU  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We find that
 connections CEOs develop with top executives and directors through their
 appointment decisions increase the risk of corporate fraud.
 Appointment-based CEO connectedness in executive suites and boardrooms
 increases the likelihood of committing fraud and decreases the likelihood
 of detection. Additionally, it decreases the expected costs of fraud by
 helping conceal fraudulent activity, making CEO dismissal less likely upon
 discovery, and lowering the coordination costs of carrying out illegal
 activity. Connections based on network ties through past employment,
 education, or social organization memberships have insignificant effects
 on fraud. Appointment-based CEO connectedness warrants attention from
 regulators, investors, and corporate governance specialists.

Title: Anchoring on Credit Spreads 
Author-Name: CASEY DOUGAL  
Author-Name: JOSEPH ENGELBERG  
Author-Name: CHRISTOPHER A. PARSONS  
Author-Name: EDWARD D. VAN WESEP  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper documents
 that the path of credit spreads since a firm's last loan influences the
 level at which it can currently borrow. If spreads have moved in the
 firm's favor (i.e., declined), it is charged a higher interest rate than
 is justified by current fundamentals, whereas if spreads have moved to the
 firm's detriment, it is charged a lower rate. We evaluate several possible
 explanations for this finding, and conclude that anchoring to past deal
 terms is most plausible.

Title: Is a VC Partnership Greater Than the Sum of Its Partners? 
Author-Name: MICHAEL EWENS  
Author-Name: MATTHEW RHODES-KROPF  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper
 investigates whether individual venture capitalists have repeatable
 investment skill and the extent to which their skill is impacted by the
 venture capital (VC) firm where they work. We examine a unique data set
 that tracks the performance of individual venture capitalists' investments
 over time and as they move between firms. We find evidence of skill and
 exit style differences even among venture partners investing at the same
 VC firm at the same time. Furthermore, our estimates suggest the partners'
 human capital is two to five times more important than the VC firm's
 organizational capital in explaining performance.

Title: The WACC Fallacy: The Real Effects of Using a Unique Discount Rate 
Author-Name: PHILIPP KRÜGER  
Author-Name: AUGUSTIN LANDIER  
Author-Name: DAVID THESMAR  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>In this paper, we
 test whether firms properly adjust for risk in their capital budgeting
 decisions. If managers use a single discount rate within firms, we expect
 that conglomerates underinvest (overinvest) in relatively safe (risky)
 divisions. We measure division relative risk as the difference between the
 division's asset beta and a firm-wide beta. We establish a robust and
 significant positive relationship between division-level investment and
 division relative risk. Next, we measure the value loss due to this
 behavior in the context of acquisitions. When the bidder's beta is lower
 than that of the target, announcement returns are significantly lower.

Title: Rewarding Trading Skills without Inducing Gambling 
Author-Name: IGOR MAKAROV  
Author-Name: GUILLAUME PLANTIN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper develops a
 model of active asset management in which fund managers may forgo
 alpha-generating strategies, preferring instead to make negative-alpha
 trades that enable them to temporarily manipulate investors' perceptions
 of their skills. We show that such trades are optimally generated by
 taking on hidden tail risk, and are more likely to occur when fund
 managers are impatient and when their trading skills are scalable, and
 generate a high profit per unit of risk. We propose long-term contracts
 that deter this behavior by dynamically adjusting the dates on which the
 manager is compensated in response to her cumulative performance.

Title: The Effect of Providing Peer Information on Retirement Savings Decisions

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Using a field
 experiment in a 401(k) plan, we measure the effect of disseminating
 information about peer behavior on savings. Low-saving employees received
 simplified plan enrollment or contribution increase forms. A randomized
 subset of forms stated the fraction of age-matched coworkers participating
 in the plan or age-matched participants contributing at least 6% of pay to
 the plan. We document an oppositional reaction: the presence of peer
 information decreased the savings of nonparticipants who were ineligible
 for 401(k) automatic enrollment, and higher observed peer savings rates
 also decreased savings. Discouragement from upward social comparisons
 seems to drive this reaction.
