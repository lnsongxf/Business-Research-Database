Title: The Brain Gain of Corporate Boards: Evidence from China

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We study the impact
 of directors with foreign experience on firm performance in emerging
 markets. Using a unique data set from China, we exploit the introduction
 of policies to attract talented emigrants and increase the supply of
 individuals with foreign experience in different provinces at different
 times. We document that performance increases after firms hire directors
 with foreign experience and identify the channels through which the
 emigration of talent may lead to a brain gain. Our findings provide
 evidence on how directors transmit knowledge about management practices
 and corporate governance to firms in emerging markets.

Title: The Value of Control and the Costs of Illiquidity 
Author-Name: RUI ALBUQUERQUE  
Author-Name: ENRIQUE SCHROTH  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We develop a search
 model of block trades that values the illiquidity of controlling stakes.
 The model considers several dimensions of illiquidity. First, following a
 liquidity shock, the controlling blockholder is forced to sell, possibly
 to a less efficient acquirer. Second, this sale may occur at a fire sale
 price. Third, absent a liquidity shock, a trade occurs only if a potential
 buyer arrives. Using a structural estimation approach and U.S. data on
 trades of controlling blocks of public corporations, we estimate the value
 of control, blockholders' marketability discount, and dispersed
 shareholders' illiquidity-spillover discount.

Title: Information Diversity and Complementarities in Trading and Information Acquisition 
Author-Name: ITAY GOLDSTEIN  
Author-Name: LIYAN YANG  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We analyze a model in
 which different traders are informed of different fundamentals that affect
 the security value. We identify a source for strategic complementarities
 in trading and information acquisition: aggressive trading on information
 about one fundamental reduces uncertainty in trading on information about
 the other fundamental, encouraging more trading and information
 acquisition on that fundamental. This tends to amplify the effect of
 exogenous changes in the underlying information environment. Due to
 complementarities, greater diversity of information in the economy
 improves price informativeness. We discuss the relation between our model
 and recent financial phenomena and derive testable empirical implications.

Title: Investment Decisions of Nonprofit Firms: Evidence from Hospitals 
Author-Name: MANUEL ADELINO  
Author-Name: KATHARINA LEWELLEN  
Author-Name: ANANT SUNDARAM  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper examines
 investment choices of nonprofit hospitals. It tests how shocks to cash
 flows caused by the performance of the hospitals’ financial assets affect
 hospital expenditures. Capital expenditures increase, on average, by 10 to
 28 cents for every dollar received from financial assets. The sensitivity
 is similar to that found earlier for shareholder-owned corporations.
 Executive compensation, other salaries, and perks do not respond
 significantly to cash flow shocks. Hospitals with an apparent tendency to
 overspend on medical procedures do not exhibit higher investment-cash flow
 sensitivities. The sensitivities are higher for hospitals that appear
 financially constrained.

Title: The Impact of Incentives and Communication Costs on Information Production and Use: Evidence from Bank Lending 
Author-Name: JUN (QJ) QIAN  
Author-Name: PHILIP E. STRAHAN  
Author-Name: ZHISHU YANG  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>In 2002 and 2003,
 many Chinese banks implemented reforms that delegated authority to
 individual loan officers. The change followed China's entrance into the
 WTO and offers a plausibly exogenous shock to loan officer incentives to
 produce information. We find that the bank's internal risk rating becomes
 a stronger predictor of loan interest rates and ex post outcomes after
 reform. When the loan officer and the branch president who approves the
 loan work together longer, the rating also becomes more strongly related
 to loan prices and outcomes. Our results highlight how incentives and
 communication costs affect information production and use.

Title: A Model of Mortgage Default 
Author-Name: JOHN Y. CAMPBELL  
Author-Name: JOÃO F. COCCO  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>In this paper, we
 solve a dynamic model of households' mortgage decisions incorporating
 labor income, house price, inflation, and interest rate risk. Using a
 zero-profit condition for mortgage lenders, we solve for equilibrium
 mortgage rates given borrower characteristics and optimal decisions. The
 model quantifies the effects of adjustable versus fixed mortgage rates,
 loan-to-value ratios, and mortgage affordability measures on mortgage
 premia and default. Mortgage selection by heterogeneous borrowers helps
 explain the higher default rates on adjustable-rate mortgages during the
 recent U.S. housing downturn, and the variation in mortgage premia with
 the level of interest rates.

Title: A Comparative-Advantage Approach to Government Debt Maturity 
Author-Name: ROBIN GREENWOOD  
Author-Name: SAMUEL G. HANSON  
Author-Name: JEREMY C. STEIN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We study optimal
 government debt maturity in a model where investors derive monetary
 services from holding riskless short-term securities. In a setting where
 the government is the only issuer of such riskless paper, it trades off
 the monetary premium associated with short-term debt against the
 refinancing risk implied by the need to roll over its debt more often. We
 extend the model to allow private financial intermediaries to compete with
 the government in the provision of short-term money-like claims. We argue
 that, if there are negative externalities associated with private money
 creation, the government should tilt its issuance more toward short
 maturities, thereby partially crowding out the private sector's use of
 short-term debt.

Title: Capital and Labor Reallocation within Firms 
Author-Name: XAVIER GIROUD  
Author-Name: HOLGER M. MUELLER  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We document how a
 positive shock to investment opportunities at one plant (“treated plant”)
 spills over to other plants within the same firm, but only if the firm is
 financially constrained. To provide the treated plant with resources, the
 firm's headquarters withdraws capital and labor from other plants,
 especially plants that are relatively less productive, not part of the
 firm's core industries, and located far away from headquarters. As a
 result of the resource reallocation, aggregate firm-wide productivity
 increases. We do not find evidence of capital or labor spillovers among
 plants of financially unconstrained firms.

Title: Do Prices Reveal the Presence of Informed Trading? 
Author-Name: PIERRE COLLIN-DUFRESNE  
Author-Name: VYACHESLAV FOS  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Using a comprehensive
 sample of trades from Schedule 13D filings by activist investors, we study
 how measures of adverse selection respond to informed trading. We find
 that on days when activists accumulate shares, measures of adverse
 selection and of stock illiquidity are lower, even though prices are
 positively impacted. Two channels help explain this phenomenon: (1)
 activists select times of higher liquidity when they trade, and (2)
 activists use limit orders. We conclude that, when informed traders can
 select when and how to trade, standard measures of adverse selection may
 fail to capture the presence of informed trading.

Title: Transparency in the Financial System: Rollover Risk and Crises 
Author-Name: MATTHIEU BOUVARD  
Author-Name: PIERRE CHAIGNEAU  
Author-Name: ADOLFO DE MOTTA  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We present a theory
 of optimal transparency when banks are exposed to rollover risk.
 Disclosing bank-specific information enhances the stability of the
 financial system during crises, but has a destabilizing effect in normal
 economic times. Thus, the regulator optimally increases transparency
 during crises. Under this policy, however, information disclosure signals
 a deterioration of economic fundamentals, which gives the regulator ex
 post incentives to withhold information. This commitment problem precludes
 a disclosure policy that provides ex ante optimal insurance against
 aggregate shocks, and can result in excess opacity that increases the
 likelihood of a systemic crisis.

Title: Does Going Public Affect Innovation? 
Author-Name: SHAI BERNSTEIN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper
 investigates the effects of going public on innovation by comparing the
 innovation activity of firms that go public with firms that withdraw their
 initial public offering (IPO) filing and remain private. NASDAQ
 fluctuations during the book-building phase are used as an instrument for
 IPO completion. Using patent-based metrics, I find that the quality of
 internal innovation declines following the IPO, and firms experience both
 an exodus of skilled inventors and a decline in the productivity of the
 remaining inventors. However, public firms attract new human capital and
 acquire external innovation. The analysis reveals that going public
 changes firms' strategies in pursuing innovation.

Title: Presidential Address: Does Finance Benefit Society?

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Academics’ view of
 the benefits of finance vastly exceeds societal perception. This
 dissonance is at least partly explained by an underappreciation by
 academia of how, without proper rules, finance can easily degenerate into
 a rent-seeking activity. I outline what finance academics can do, from a
 research point of view and from an educational point of view, to promote
 good finance and minimize the bad.
