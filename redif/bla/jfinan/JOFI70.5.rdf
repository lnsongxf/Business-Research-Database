Title: Reaching for Yield in the Bond Market 
Author-Name: BO BECKER  
Author-Name: VICTORIA IVASHINA  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper studies
 reaching for yield—investors’ propensity to buy riskier assets to achieve
 higher yields—in the corporate bond market. We show that insurance
 companies reach for yield in choosing their investments. Consistent with
 lower rated bonds bearing higher capital requirements, insurance firms
 prefer to hold higher rated bonds. However, conditional on credit ratings,
 insurance portfolios are systematically biased toward higher yield, higher
 CDS bonds. This behavior is related to the business cycle being most
 pronounced during economic expansions. It is also characteristic of firms
 with poor corporate governance and for which the regulatory capital
 requirement is more binding.

Title: Asymmetric Learning from Financial Information 
Author-Name: CAMELIA M. KUHNEN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This study asks
 whether investors learn differently from gains versus losses. I find
 experimental evidence that indicates that being in the negative domain
 leads individuals to form overly pessimistic beliefs about available
 investment options. This pessimism bias is driven by people reacting more
 to low outcomes in the negative domain relative to the positive domain.
 Such asymmetric learning may help explain documented empirical patterns
 regarding the differential role of poor versus good economic conditions on
 investment behavior and household economic choices.

Title: Wall Street Occupations

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Many finance jobs
 entail the risk of large losses, and hard-to-monitor effort. We analyze
 the equilibrium consequences of these features in a model with optimal
 dynamic contracting. We show that finance jobs feature high compensation,
 up-or-out promotion, and long work hours, and are more attractive than
 other jobs. Moral hazard problems are exacerbated in booms, even though
 pay increases. Employees whose talent would be more valuable elsewhere can
 be lured into finance jobs, while the most talented employees might be
 unable to land these jobs because they are “too hard to manage.”

Title: Outsourcing in the International Mutual Fund Industry: An Equilibrium View 
Author-Name: OLEG CHUPRININ  
Author-Name: MASSIMO MASSA  
Author-Name: DAVID SCHUMACHER  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We study outsourcing
 relationships among international asset management firms. We find that, in
 companies that manage both outsourced and in-house funds, in-house funds
 outperform outsourced funds by 0.85% annually (57% of the expense ratio).
 We attribute this result to preferential treatment of in-house funds via
 the preferential allocation of IPOs, trading opportunities, and
 cross-trades, especially at times when in-house funds face steep outflows
 and require liquidity. We explain preferential treatment with agency
 problems: it increases with the subcontractor's market power and the
 difficulty of monitoring the subcontractor, and decreases with the
 subcontractor's amount of parallel in-house activity.

Title: Informational Frictions and Commodity Markets 
Author-Name: MICHAEL SOCKIN  
Author-Name: WEI XIONG  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper develops a
 model with a tractable log-linear equilibrium to analyze the effects of
 informational frictions in commodity markets. By aggregating dispersed
 information about the strength of the global economy among goods producers
 whose production has complementarity, commodity prices serve as price
 signals to guide producers' production decisions and commodity demand. Our
 model highlights important feedback effects of informational noise
 originating from supply shocks and futures market trading on commodity
 demand and spot prices. Our analysis illustrates the weakness common in
 empirical studies on commodity markets of assuming that different types of
 shocks are publicly observable to market participants.

Title: The Cost of Capital for Alternative Investments 
Author-Name: JAKUB W. JUREK  
Author-Name: ERIK STAFFORD  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Traditional risk
 factor models indicate that hedge funds capture pre-fee alphas of 6% to
 10% per annum over the period from 1996 to 2012. At the same time, the
 hedge fund return series is not reliably distinguishable from the returns
 of mechanical S&P 500 put-writing strategies. We show that the high excess
 returns to hedge funds and put-writing are consistent with an equilibrium
 in which a small subset of investors specialize in bearing downside market
 risks. Required rates of return in such an equilibrium can dramatically
 exceed those suggested by traditional models, affecting inference about
 the attractiveness of these investments.

Title: The Beauty Contest and Short-Term Trading 
Author-Name: GIOVANNI CESPA  
Author-Name: XAVIER VIVES  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Short-termism need
 not breed informational price inefficiency even when generating beauty
 contests. We demonstrate this claim in a two-period market with persistent
 liquidity trading and risk-averse, privately informed, short-term
 investors and find that prices reflect average expectations about
 fundamentals and liquidity trading. Informed investors engage in
 “retrospective” learning to reassess inferences (about fundamentals) made
 during the trading game's early stages. This behavior introduces strategic
 complementarities in the use of information and can yield two stable
 equilibria that can be ranked in terms of liquidity, volatility, and
 informational efficiency. We derive implications that explain market
 anomalies as well as empirical regularities.

Title: CEO Turnover and Relative Performance Evaluation 
Author-Name: DIRK JENTER  
Author-Name: FADI KANAAN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper shows that
 CEOs are fired after bad firm performance caused by factors beyond their
 control. Standard economic theory predicts that corporate boards filter
 out exogenous industry and market shocks from firm performance before
 deciding on CEO retention. Using a hand-collected sample of 3,365 CEO
 turnovers from 1993 to 2009, we document that CEOs are significantly more
 likely to be dismissed from their jobs after bad industry and, to a lesser
 extent, after bad market performance. A decline in industry performance
 from the 90-super-th to the 10-super-th percentile doubles the probability
 of a forced CEO turnover.

Title: The Role of Institutional Investors in Voting: Evidence from the Securities Lending Market 
Author-Name: REENA AGGARWAL  
Author-Name: PEDRO A. C. SAFFI  
Author-Name: JASON STURGESS  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper
 investigates voting preferences of institutional investors using the
 unique setting of the securities lending market. Investors restrict
 lendable supply and/or recall loaned shares prior to the proxy record date
 to exercise voting rights. Recall is higher for investors with greater
 incentives to monitor, for firms with poor performance or weak governance,
 and for proposals where returns to governance are likely higher. At the
 subsequent vote, recall is associated with less support for management and
 more support for shareholder proposals. Our results indicate that
 institutions value their vote and use the proxy process to affect
 corporate governance.

Title: Market Making Contracts, Firm Value, and the IPO Decision 
Author-Name: HENDRIK BESSEMBINDER  
Author-Name: JIA HAO  
Author-Name: KUNCHENG ZHENG  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We examine the
 effects of secondary market liquidity on firm value and the IPO decision.
 Competitive aftermarket liquidity provision is associated with reduced
 welfare and a discounted secondary market price that can dissuade IPOs.
 The competitive market fails in particular for firms or at times when
 uncertainty regarding fundamental value and asymmetric information are
 large in combination. In these cases, firm value and welfare are improved
 by a contract where the firm engages a designated market maker to enhance
 liquidity. Such contracts represent a market solution to a market
 imperfection, particularly for small, growth firms.

Title: Arbitrage Asymmetry and the Idiosyncratic Volatility Puzzle 
Author-Name: ROBERT F. STAMBAUGH  
Author-Name: JIANFENG YU  
Author-Name: YU YUAN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Buying is easier than
 shorting for many equity investors. Combining this arbitrage asymmetry
 with the arbitrage risk represented by idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL)
 explains the negative relation between IVOL and average return. The
 IVOL-return relation is negative among overpriced stocks but positive
 among underpriced stocks, with mispricing determined by combining 11
 return anomalies. Consistent with arbitrage asymmetry, the negative
 relation among overpriced stocks is stronger, especially for stocks less
 easily shorted, so the overall IVOL-return relation is negative. Further
 supporting our explanation, high investor sentiment weakens the positive
 relation among underpriced stocks and, especially, strengthens the
 negative relation among overpriced stocks.

Title: Hidden Liquidity: Some New Light on Dark Trading 
Author-Name: ROBERT BLOOMFIELD  
Author-Name: MAUREEN O'HARA  
Author-Name: GIDEON SAAR  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Using a laboratory
 market, we investigate how the ability to hide orders affects traders’
 strategies and market outcomes in a limit order book environment. We find
 that order strategies are greatly affected by allowing hidden liquidity,
 with traders substituting nondisplayed for displayed shares and changing
 the aggressiveness of their trading. As traders adapt their behavior to
 the different opacity regimes, however, most aggregate market outcomes
 (such as liquidity and informational efficiency) are not affected as much.
 We also find that opacity appears to increase the profits of informed
 traders but only when their private information is very valuable.
