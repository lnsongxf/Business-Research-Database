Title: Blocks, Liquidity, and Corporate Control 
Abstract:
 The paper develops a simple model of corporate ownership structure in
 which costs and benefits of ownership concentration are analyzed. The
 model compares the liquidity benefits obtained through dispersed corporate
 ownership with the benefits from efficient management control achieved by
 some degree of ownership concentration. The paper reexamines the
 free-rider problem in corporate control in the presence of liquidity
 trading, derives predictions for the trade and pricing of blocks, and
 provides criteria for the optimal choice of ownership structure. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Why Do Companies Go Public? An Empirical Analysis 
Abstract:
 Using a large database of private firms in Italy, we analyze the
 determinants of initial public offerings (IPOs) by comparing the ex ante
 and ex post characteristics of IPOs with those of private firms. The
 likelihood of an IPO is increasing in the company's size and the
 industry's market-to-book ratio. Companies appear to go public not to
 finance future investments and growth, but to rebalance their accounts
 after high investment and growth. IPOs are also followed by lower cost of
 credit and increased turnover in control. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Large Shareholders as Monitors: Is There a Trade-Off between Liquidity and Control? 
Abstract:
 This paper analyzes the incentives of large shareholders to monitor public
 corporations. We investigate the hypothesis that a liquid stock market
 reduces large shareholders' incentives to monitor because it allows them
 to sell their stocks more easily. Even though this is true, a liquid
 market also makes it less costly to hold larger stakes and easier to
 purchase additional shares. We show that this fact is important if
 monitoring is costly: market liquidity mitigates the problem that small
 shareholders free ride on the effort of the large shareholder. We find
 that liquid stock markets are beneficial because they make corporate
 governance more effective. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Ownership Structure, Speculation, and Shareholder Intervention 
Abstract:
 An institution holding shares in a firm can use information about the firm
 both for trading ("speculation") and for deciding whether to intervene to
 improve firm performance. Intervention increases the value of the
 institution's existing shareholdings, but intervention only increases the
 institution's trading profits if it enhances the precision of the
 institution's information relative to that of uninformed traders. Thus,
 the ability to speculate can increase or decrease institutional
 intervention. We examine key factors that affect the intervention
 decision, the usefulness of "short-swing" provisions and restricted shares
 in encouraging institutional intervention, and implications for ownership
 structure across different firms. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Debt, Leases, Taxes, and the Endogeneity of Corporate Tax Status 
Abstract:
 We provide evidence that corporate tax status is endogenous to financing
 decisions, which induces a spurious relation between measures of financial
 policy and many commonly used tax proxies. Using a forward-looking
 estimate of "before-financing" corporate marginal tax rates, we document a
 negative relation between operating leases and tax rates, and a positive
 relation between debt "levels" and tax rates. This is the first
 unambiguous evidence supporting the hypothesis that low tax rate firms
 lease more, and have lower debt levels, than high tax rate firms. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Equity Carve-Outs and Managerial Discretion 
Abstract:
 This study proposes a managerial discretion hypothesis of equity
 carve-outs in which managers value control over assets and are reluctant
 to carve out subsidiaries. Thus, managers undertake carve-outs only when
 the firm is capital constrained. Consistent with this hypothesis, firms
 that carve out subsidiaries exhibit poor operating performance and high
 leverage prior to carve-outs. Also consistent with this hypothesis, in
 carve-outs wherein funds raised are used to pay down debt, the average
 excess stock return of + 6.63 percent is significantly greater than the
 average excess stock return of  - 0.01 percent for carve-outs wherein
 funds are retained for investment purposes. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Real Rates, Expected Inflation, and Inflation Risk Premia 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the term structure of real rates, expected inflation,
 and inflation risk premia. The analysis is based on new estimates of the
 real term structure derived from the prices of index-linked and nominal
 debt in the U.K. I find strong evidence to reject both the Fisher
 Hypothesis and versions of the Expectations Hypothesis for real rates. The
 estimates also imply the presence of time-varying inflation risk premia
 throughout the term structure. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Deutsche Mark-Dollar Volatility: Intraday Activity Patterns, Macroeconomic Announcements, and Longer Run Dependencies 
Abstract:
 This paper provides a detailed characterization of the volatility in the
 deutsche mark-dollar foreign exchange market using an annual sample of
 five-minute returns. The approach captures the intraday activity patterns,
 the macroeconomic announcements, and the volatility persistence (ARCH)
 known from daily returns. The different features are separately quantified
 and shown to account for a substantial fraction of return variability,
 both at the intraday and daily level. The implications of the results for
 the interpretation of the fundamental "driving forces" behind the
 volatility process is also discussed. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: International Momentum Strategies 
Abstract:
 International equity markets exhibit medium-term return continuation.
 Between 1980 and 1995 an internationally diversified portfolio of past
 medium-term Winners outperforms a portfolio of medium-term Losers after
 correcting for risk by more than 1 percent per month. Return continuation
 is present in all twelve sample countries and lasts on average for about
 one year. Return continuation is negatively related to firm size, but is
 not limited to small firms. The international momentum returns are
 correlated with those of the United States which suggests that exposure to
 a common factor may drive the profitability of momentum strategies. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Underwriter Reputation, Initial Returns, and the Long-Run Performance of IPO Stocks 
Abstract:
 We find that the underperformance of IPO stocks relative to the market
 over a three-year holding period is less severe for IPOs handled by more
 prestigious underwriters. Consistent with prior studies, we also find that
 IPOs managed by more reputable underwriters are associated with less
 short-run underpricing. Among the various existing proxies for underwriter
 reputation, the Carter-Manaster measure is the most significant in the
 context of initial returns and also in the context of the three-year
 performance of IPOs. The study also provides an updated list of the
 Carter-Manaster measure for various underwriters. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Actual Share Reacquisitions in Open-Market Repurchase Programs 
Abstract:
 Unlike Dutch auction repurchases and tender offers, open-market repurchase
 programs do not precommit firms to acquire a specified number of shares.
 In a sample of 450 programs from 1981 to 1990, firms on average acquire 74
 to 82 percent of the shares announced as repurchase targets within three
 years of the repurchase announcement. We find that share repurchases are
 negatively related to prior stock price performance, suggesting that firms
 increase their purchasing depending on its degree of perceived
 undervaluation. In addition, repurchases are positively related to levels
 of cash flow, which is consistent with liquidity arguments. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Stock Splits: Evidence from Mutual Funds 
Abstract:
 Mutual fund splits occur in high-priced funds after unusually high
 returns. Split factors are related to the deviation of a fund's price from
 the mean of all fund prices. Post-split prices are below the mean of other
 funds' prices. Post-split numbers of shareholders and assets do not
 increase compared with funds having similar rates of asset growth.
 However, I find evidence that mutual fund splits bring per account
 shareholdings back up to normal levels. I argue that signaling, liquidity,
 and tick size theories do not apply to mutual fund splits. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: The Value of a Finance Journal Publication 
Abstract:
 The empirical analysis examines the salary and publication records of 311
 finance professors at public research universities to calculate the worth
 of a top finance journal article. Within rank, salary regressions provide
 measures of the direct returns of a journal publication, while probit
 models consider the indirect returns that result from promotion.
 Ultimately, the analysis uses a reduced form salary equation to measure
 both the direct and indirect effects of publishing a journal article.
 Depending on professorial rank, the present value of the first top finance
 journal article is between $19,493 and $33,754, with the additional result
 of large returns to subsequent publications. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Around and Around: The Expectations Hypothesis 
Abstract:
 We show how to construct models of the term structure of interest rates in
 which the expectations hypothesis holds. McCulloch (1993) presents such a
 model, thereby contradicting an assertion by Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross
 (1981), but his example is Gaussian and falls outside the class of
 finite-dimensional Markovian models. We generalize McCulloch's model in
 three ways: (i) We provide an arbitrage-free characterization of the
 unbiased expectations hypothesis in terms of forward rates; (ii) we extend
 this characterization to a whole class of expectations hypotheses; and
 (iii) we show how to construct finite-dimensional Markovian and
 non-Gaussian examples. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Informed Traders and Price Variations in the Betting Market for Professional Basketball Games 
Abstract:
 This paper examines betting line changes from the opening to the closing
 of the point spread betting market on National Basketball Association
 games for evidence of informed trader betting. We show that within-betting
 period line changes significantly improve the accuracy of betting lines as
 forecasts of game outcomes. We examine individual line change magnitudes
 and show that these are directly and proportionately related to biases in
 opening lines. Further, line changes are of sufficient magnitude to remove
 these biases by the close of betting. We interpret these results as
 evidence that informed traders are influential in this market. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Caveat Compounder: A Warning about Using the Daily CRSP Equal-Weighted Index to Compute Long-Run Excess Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper issues a warning that compounding daily returns of the Center
 for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) equal-weighted index can lead to
 surprisingly large biases. The differences between the monthly returns
 compounded from the daily tapes and the monthly CRSP equal-weighted
 indices is almost 0.43 percent per month, or 6 percent per year. This
 difference amounts to one-third of the average monthly return, and is
 large enough to reverse the conclusions of a paper using the daily tape to
 compute the return on the benchmark portfolio. We also investigate the
 sources of these biases and suggest several alternative strategies to
 avoid them. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.
