Title: Option Volume and Stock Prices: Evidence on Where Informed Traders Trade 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the informational role of transactions volume in
 options markets. We develop an asymmetric information model in which
 informed traders may trade in option or equity markets. We show conditions
 under which informed traders trade options, and we investigate the
 implications of this for the linkage between markets. Our model predicts
 an important informational role for the volume of particular types of
 option trades. We empirically test our model's hypotheses with intraday
 option data. Our main empirical result is that negative and positive
 option volumes contain information about future stock prices. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: The Conditional Performance of Insider Trades 
Abstract:
 This paper estimates the performance of insider trades on the closely held
 Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE) during a period of lax enforcement of insider
 trading regulations. Our data permit construction of a portfolio that
 tracks all movements of insiders in and out of the OSE firms. Using three
 alternative performance estimators in a time-varying expected return
 setting, we document zero or negative abnormal performance by insiders.
 The results are robust to a variety of trade characteristics. Applying the
 performance measures to mutual funds on the OSE, we also document some
 evidence that the average mutual fund outperforms the insider portfolio. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Nonparametric Estimation of State-Price Densities Implicit in Financial Asset Prices 
Abstract:
 Implicit in the prices of traded financial assets are Arrow-Debreu prices
 or, with continuous states, the state-price density (SPD). We construct a
 nonparametric estimator for the SPD implicit in option prices and we
 derive its asymptotic sampling theory. This estimator provides an
 arbitrage-free method of pricing new, complex, or illiquid securities
 while capturing those features of the data that are most relevant from an
 asset-pricing perspective, for example, negative skewness and excess
 kurtosis for asset returns, and volatility "smiles" for option prices. We
 perform Monte Carlo experiments and extract the SPD from actual S&P 500
 option prices. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: On Stable Factor Structures in the Pricing of Risk: Do Time-Varying Betas Help or Hurt? 
Abstract:
 There is now considerable evidence suggesting that estimated betas of
 unconditional capital asset pricing models (CAPMs) exhibit statistically
 significant time variation. Therefore, many have advocated the use of
 conditional CAPMs. If we succeed in capturing the dynamics of beta risk,
 we are sure to outperform constant beta models. However, if the beta risk
 is inherently misspecified, there is a real possibility that we commit
 serious pricing errors, potentially larger than with a constant
 traditional beta model. In this paper we show that this is indeed the
 case, namely that pricing errors with constant traditional beta models are
 smaller than with conditional CAPMs. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Resolving the Puzzling Intertemporal Relation between the Market Risk Premium and Conditional Market Variance: A Two-Factor Approach 
Abstract:
 The existing empirical literature fails to agree on the nature of the
 intertemporal relation between risk and return. This paper attempts to
 resolve the issue by estimating a conditional two-factor model motivated
 by Merton's intertemporal capital asset pricing model. When long-term
 government bond returns are included as a second factor, the "partial"
 relation between the market risk premium and conditional market variance
 is found to be positive and significant. The paper also helps explain the
 convoluted empirical relation between the market risk premium, conditional
 market variance, and the nominal risk-free rate previously reported in the
 literature. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Block Share Purchases and Corporate Performance 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the causes and consequences of activist block
 share purchases in the 1980s. We find that activist investors were most
 likely to purchase large blocks of shares in highly diversified firms with
 poor profitability. Activists were not less likely to purchase blocks in
 firms with shark repellents and employee stock ownership plans. Activist
 block purchases were followed by increases in asset divestitures,
 decreases in mergers and acquisitions, and abnormal share price
 appreciation. Industry-adjusted operating profitability also rose. This
 evidence supports the view that the market for partial corporate control
 plays an important role in limiting agency costs in U.S. corporations. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: On the Costs of a Bank-Centered Financial System: Evidence from the Changing Main Bank Relations in Japan 
Abstract:
 We examine the effects of bank-firm relationships on firm performance in
 Japan. When access to capital markets is limited, close bank-firm ties
 increase the availability of capital to borrowing firms, but do not lead
 to higher profitability or growth. The cost of capital of firms with close
 bank ties is higher than that of their peers. This indicates that most of
 the benefits from these relationships are appropriated by the banks.
 Finally, the slow growth rates of bank clients suggest that banks
 discourage firms from investing in risky, profitable projects. However,
 liberalization of financial markets reduces the banks' market power. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Investor Reaction to Salient News in Closed-End Country Funds 
Abstract:
 We use panel data on prices and net asset values to test whether dramatic
 country-specific news affects the response of closed-end country fund
 prices to asset value. In a typical week, prices underreact to changes in
 fundamentals; the (short-run) elasticity of price with respect to asset
 value is significantly less than one. In weeks with news appearing on the
 front page of "The New York Times", prices react much more; the elasticity
 of price with respect to asset value is closer to one. These results are
 consistent with the hypothesis that news events lead some investors to
 react more quickly. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Overreaction and Insider Trading: Evidence from Growth and Value Portfolios 
Abstract:
 Insider transactions are not random across growth and value stocks. We
 find that insider buying climbs as stocks change from growth to value
 categories. Insider buying also is greater after low stock returns, and
 lower after high stock returns. These findings are consistent with a
 version of overreaction which says that prices of value stocks tend to lie
 below fundamental values, and prices of growth stocks tend to lie above
 fundamental values. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: The Impact of Options Trading on the Market Quality of the Underlying Security: An Empirical Analysis 
Abstract:
 We find that option listings are associated with a decrease in the
 variance of the pricing error, a decrease in the adverse selection
 component of the spread, and an increase in the relative weight placed by
 the specialist on public information in revising prices for the underlying
 stocks. We also find that there is a decrease in the spread and increases
 in quoted depth, trading volume, trading frequency, and transaction size
 after option listings. Overall, our results suggest that option listings
 improve the market quality of the underlying stocks. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: The Foreign Exchange Exposure of Japanese Multinational Corporations 
Abstract:
 We find that about 25 percent of our sample of 171 Japanese
 multinationals' stock returns experienced economically significant
 positive exposure effects for the period January 1979 to December 1993.
 The extent to which a firm is exposed to exchange-rate fluctuations can be
 explained by the level of its export ratio and by variables that are
 proxies for its hedging needs. Highly leveraged firms, or firms with low
 liquidity, tend to have smaller exposures. Foreign exposure is found to
 increase with firm size. We also find that keiretsu multinationals are
 more exposed to exchange-rate risk than nonkeiretsu firms. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: An Analysis of Bidding in the Japanese Government Bond Auctions 
Abstract:
 We examine the bidding patterns and auction profits in the Japanese
 Government Bond (JGB) auctions and empirically test the predictions of
 auction theory. We find that the average profit in JGB auctions is not
 reliably different from zero, and the degree of competition and the level
 of uncertainty are insignificant in determining auction profits. The
 winning shares of the U.S. dealers are positively related to auction
 profits, whereas the winning shares of their Japanese counterparts show a
 negative association. We also find that the share of winnings of Japanese
 dealers tends to be correlated with the share of winnings of their
 compatriot dealers but a similar relation is not found for U.S. dealers. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Takeovers of Privately Held Targets, Methods of Payment, and Bidder Returns 
Abstract:
 We examine bidder returns at the announcement of a takeover proposal when
 the target firm is privately held. In stock offers, bidders experience a
 positive abnormal return, which contrasts with the negative abnormal
 return typically found for bidders acquiring a publicly traded target. On
 the other hand, bidders experience no abnormal return in cash offers. Our
 analysis suggests that the positive wealth effect is related to monitoring
 activities by target shareholders and, to an extent, reduced information
 asymmetries. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Managerial Ownership, the Method of Payment for Acquisitions, and Executive Job Retention 
Abstract:
 This study investigates how acquiring and target firm managers'
 preferences for control rights motivate the payment for corporate
 acquisitions. We expect that managers of target firms who value influence
 in combined firms will prefer to receive stock. One reason top managers
 desire influence is to enhance their chances of retaining jobs in the
 combined firm. Our analysis shows a strong, positive association between
 managerial ownership of target firms and the likelihood of acquisitions
 for stock. We also find that managers of target firms are more likely to
 retain jobs in combined firms when they receive stock rather than cash. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.
