Title: Taxes, Financing Decisions, and Firm Value 
Abstract:
 We use cross-sectional regressions to study how a firm's value is related
 to dividends and debt. With a good control for profitability, the
 regressions can measure how the taxation of dividends and debt affects
 firm value. Simple tax hypotheses say that value is negatively related to
 dividends and positively related to debt. We find the opposite. We infer
 that dividends and debt convey information about profitability (expected
 net cash flows) missed by a wide range of control variables. This
 information about profitability obscures any tax effects of financing
 decisions. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Does Corporate Lending by Banks and Finance Companies Differ? Evidence on Specialization in Private Debt Contracting 
Abstract:
 This paper establishes empirically the existence of specialization in
 private-market corporate lending, adding a new dimension to the public
 versus private debt distinctions now common in the literature. Comparing
 corporate loans made by banks and by finance companies, we find that the
 two types of intermediaries are equally likely to finance
 information-problematic firms. However, finance companies tend to serve
 observably riskier borrowers, particularly more leveraged borrowers.
 Evidence supports both regulatory and reputation-based explanations for
 this specialization. In passing, we shed light on various theories of debt
 contracting and intermediation and present facts about finance companies. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Dividends, Asymmetric Information, and Agency Conflicts: Evidence from a Comparison of the Dividend Policies of Japanese and U.S. Firms 
Abstract:
 We compare dividend policies of U.S. and Japanese firms, partitioning the
 Japanese data into keiretsu, independent, and hybrid firms. We examine the
 correlation between dividend changes and stock returns, and the reluctance
 to change dividends. Results are consistent with the joint hypotheses that
 Japanese firms, particularly keiretsu-member firms, face less information
 asymmetry and fewer agency conflicts than U.S. firms, and that information
 asymmetries and/or agency conflicts affect dividend policy. Japanese firms
 experience smaller stock price reactions to dividend omissions and
 initiations, they are less reluctant to omit and cut dividends, and their
 dividends are more responsive to earnings changes. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Survival of the Fittest or the Fattest? Exit and Financing in the Trucking Industry 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the impact that capital market imperfections have on
 the natural selection of the most efficient firms by estimating the effect
 of the prederegulation level of leverage on the survival of trucking firms
 after the Carter deregulation. Highly leveraged carriers are less likely
 to survive the deregulation shock, even after controlling for various
 measures of efficiency. This effect is stronger in the imperfectly
 competitive segment of the motor carrier industry. High debt seems to
 affect survival by curtailing investments and reducing the price per
 ton-mile that a carrier can afford to charge after deregulation. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Do Asset Fire Sales Exist? An Empirical Investigation of Commercial Aircraft Transactions 
Abstract:
 This paper uses commercial aircraft transactions to determine whether
 capital constraints cause firms to liquidate assets at discounts to
 fundamental values. Results indicate that financially constrained airlines
 receive lower prices than their unconstrained rivals when selling used
 narrow-body aircraft. Capital constrained airlines are also more likely to
 sell used aircraft to industry outsiders, especially during market
 downturns. Further evidence that capital constraints affect liquidation
 prices is provided by airlines' asset acquisition activity. Unconstrained
 airlines significantly increase buying activity when aircraft prices are
 depressed; this pattern is not observed for financially constrained
 airlines. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Hedging and Coordinated Risk Management: Evidence from Thrift Conversions 
Abstract:
 We provide an explanation for hedging as a means of allocating rather than
 reducing risk. We argue that when increases in total risk are costly,
 firms optimally allocate risk by reducing (increasing) exposure to risks
 that provide zero (positive) economic rents. Our evidence shows that
 mutual thrifts that convert to stock institutions increase total risk
 following conversion, consistent with their increased abilities and
 incentives for risk taking. They achieve this increase by hedging
 interest-rate risk and increasing credit risk. We provide some evidence
 that risk-management activities are related to growth capacity and
 management compensation structure attained at conversion. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: The Determinants of Stock Price Exposure: Financial Engineering and the Gold Mining Industry 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the exposure of North American gold mining firms to
 changes in the price of gold. The average mining stock moves 2 percent for
 each 1 percent change in gold prices, but exposures vary considerably over
 time and across firms. As predicted by valuation models, gold firm
 exposures are significantly negatively related to the firm's hedging and
 diversification activities and to gold prices and gold return volatility,
 and are positively related to firm leverage. Simple discounted cash flow
 models produce useful exposure predictions but they systematically
 overestimate exposures, possibly due to their failure to reflect
 managerial flexibility. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: What Are the Research Standards for Full Professor of Finance? 
Abstract:
 Based on a sample of 126 recently promoted faculty, different standards
 for full professor are observed between top 20 finance departments and
 lower ranked departments. Full professors affiliated with a top 20
 department place an average of 1 out of 3 articles in either "Journal of
 Finance, Review of Financial Studies", or "Journal of Financial Economics"
 compared to 1 out of 6 articles for professors at lower-ranked schools.
 Total citations and cites per year are also significantly different
 between top- and lower-ranked departments, but total articles and articles
 per year are not significantly different between these two groupings. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: The Financial and Operating Performance of Newly Privatized Firms: Evidence from Developing Countries 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the change in the financial and operating performance
 of 79 companies from 21 developing countries that experienced full or
 partial privatization during the period from 1980 to 1992. We use
 accounting performance measures adjusted for market effects in addition to
 unadjusted accounting performance measures. Both unadjusted and
 market-adjusted results show significant increases in profitability,
 operating efficiency, capital investment spending, output, employment
 level, and dividends. We also find a decline in leverage following
 privatization but this change is significant only for unadjusted leverage
 ratios. Our results are generally robust when we partition our data into
 various subsamples. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Is There Private Information in the FX Market? The Tokyo Experiment 
Abstract:
 We provide evidence of private information in the foreign exchange market.
 The evidence comes from the introduction of trading in Tokyo over the
 lunch hour. Lunch-return variance doubles with the introduction of
 trading, which cannot be due to public information since the flow of
 public information did not change with the trading rules. We then exploit
 microstructure theory to discriminate between the two alternatives:
 private information and mispricing. Four key results support the
 predictions of private-information models. Three of these involve changes
 in the intraday volatility U-shape. The fourth is that opening trade
 causes mispricing's share in variance to fall. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Is the Risk of Bankruptcy a Systematic Risk? 
Abstract:
 Several studies suggest that a firm distress risk factor could be behind
 the size and the book-to-market effects. A natural proxy for firm distress
 is bankruptcy risk. If bankruptcy risk is systematic, one would expect a
 positive association between bankruptcy risk and subsequent realized
 returns. However, results demonstrate that bankruptcy risk is not rewarded
 by higher returns. Thus, a distress factor is unlikely to account for the
 size and book-to-market effects. Surprisingly, firms with high bankruptcy
 risk earn lower than average returns since 1980. A risk-based explanation
 cannot fully explain the anomalous evidence. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Does the Medium Matter? The Relations among Bankruptcy Petition Filings, Broadtape Disclosure, and the Timing of Price Reactions 
Abstract:
 Drawing on a comprehensive sample of 330 bankruptcy petition filings from
 1980 to 1993, we find that most of the market reaction does not occur on
 the bankruptcy petition filing date when the information becomes publicly
 available. Rather, most of the reaction occurs when news of the bankruptcy
 filing is more widely disseminated via the Broadtape. This "Broadtape
 announcement effect" persists after controlling for firm size, exchange
 listing, and predisclosure information. These are primarily timing
 differences since abnormal returns cumulated over an 11-day window
 centered on the filing date do not differ significantly across Broadtape
 disclosure date classifications. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.
