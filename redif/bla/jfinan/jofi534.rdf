Title: Agency Costs, Risk Management, and Capital Structure 
Abstract:
 The joint determination of capital structure and investment risk is
 examined. Optimal capital structure reflects both the tax advantages of
 debt less default costs (Modigliani and Miller (1958, 1963)), and the
 agency costs resulting from asset substitution (Jensen and Meckling
 (1976)). Agency costs restrict leverage and debt maturity and increase
 yield spreads, but their importance is small for the range of environments
 considered. Risk management is also examined. Hedging permits greater
 leverage. Even when a firm cannot precommit to hedging, it will still do
 so. Surprisingly, hedging benefits often are greater when agency costs are
 low.  Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Optimal Financial Crises 
Abstract:
 Empirical evidence suggests that banking panics are related to the
 business cycle and are not simply the result of "sunspots." Panics occur
 when depositors perceive that the returns on bank assets are going to be
 unusually low. We develop a simple model of this. In this setting, bank
 runs can be first-best efficient: they allow efficient risk sharing
 between early and late withdrawing depositors and they allow banks to hold
 efficient portfolios. However, if costly runs or markets for risky assets
 are introduced, central bank intervention of the right kind can lead to a
 Pareto improvement in welfare. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: An Asymptotic Theory for Estimating Beta-Pricing Models Using Cross-Sectional Regression 
Abstract:
 Without the assumption of conditional homoskedasticity, a general
 asymptotic distribution theory for the two-stage cross-sectional
 regression method shows that the standard errors produced by the
 Fama-MacBeth procedure do not necessarily overstate the precision of the
 risk premium estimates. When factors are misspecified, estimators for risk
 premiums can be biased, and the "t"-value of a premium may converge to
 infinity in probability even when the true premium is zero. However, when
 a beta-pricing model is misspecified, the "t"-values for firm
 characteristics generally converge to infinity in probability, which
 supports the use of firm characteristics in cross-sectional regressions
 for detecting model misspecification. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: The Dow Theory: William Peter Hamilton's Track Record Reconsidered 
Abstract:
 Alfred Cowles' test of the Dow Theory apparently provides strong evidence
 against the ability of Wall Street's most famous chartist to forecast the
 stock market. Cowles (1934) analyzes editorials published by the chief
 exponent of the Dow Theory, William Peter Hamilton. We review Cowles'
 evidence and find that it supports the contrary conclusion. Hamilton's
 timing strategies actually yield high Sharpe ratios and positive alphas
 for the period 1902 to 1929. Neural net modeling to replicate Hamilton's
 market calls provides interesting insight into the Dow Theory and allows
 us to examine the properties of the theory itself out of sample. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: The Influence of Institutions on Corporate Governance through Private Negotiations: Evidence from TIAA-CREF 
Abstract:
 This paper analyzes the process of private negotiations between financial
 institutions and the companies they attempt to influence. It relies on a
 private database consisting of the correspondence between TIAA-CREF and 45
 firms it contacted about governance issues between 1992 and 1996. This
 correspondence indicates that TIAA-CREF is able to reach agreements with
 targeted companies more than 95 percent of the time. In more than 70
 percent of the cases, this agreement is reached without shareholders
 voting on the proposal. We verify independently that at least 87 percent
 of the targets subsequently took actions to comply with these agreements. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Credit Risk in Private Debt Portfolios 
Abstract:
 Default, loss severity, and average loss rates for a large sample of
 privately placed bonds are presented and compared with loss experience for
 publicly issued bonds. The chance of very large portfolio losses is
 estimated and some determinants of such losses are analyzed. Results show
 ex ante riskier classes of private debt perform better on average than
 public debt. Both diversification and the riskiness of individual
 portfolio assets influence the bad tail of the portfolio loss
 distribution. Private placements are similar to corporate loans in that
 both are monitored private debt. The results are thus relevant to
 management and securitization of private debt portfolios generally. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: The Declining Credit Quality of U.S. Corporate Debt: Myth or Reality? 
Abstract:
 In recent years, the number of downgrades in corporate bond ratings has
 exceeded the number of upgrades, leading some to conclude that the credit
 quality of U.S. corporate debt has declined. However, an alternative
 explanation of this apparent decline in credit quality is that the rating
 agencies are now using more stringent standards in assigning ratings. An
 ordered probit analysis of a panel of firms from 1978 through 1995
 suggests that rating standards have indeed become more stringent, implying
 that at least part of the downward trend in ratings is the result of
 changing standards. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.
