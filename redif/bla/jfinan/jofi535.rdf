Title: How Costly is Financial (Not Economic) Distress? Evidence from Highly Leveraged Transactions that Became Distressed 
Abstract:
 This paper studies thirty-one highly leveraged transactions (HLTs) that
 become financially, not economically, distressed. The net effect of the
 HLT and financial distress (from pretransaction to distress resolution,
 market- or industry-adjusted) is to increase value slightly. This finding
 strongly suggests that, overall, the HLTs of the late 1980s created value.
 We present quantitative and qualitative estimates of the (direct and
 indirect) costs of financial distress and their determinants. We estimate
 financial distress costs to be 10 to 20 percent of firm value. For a
 subset of firms that do not experience an adverse economic shock,
 financial distress costs are negligible. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Asset Efficiency and Reallocation Decisions of Bankrupt Firms 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates whether Chapter 11 bankruptcy provides a mechanism
 by which insolvent firms are efficiently reorganized and the assets of
 unproductive firms are effectively redeployed. We argue that incentives to
 reorganize depend on the level of demand and industry conditions. Using
 plant-level data, we find that Chapter 11 status is much less important
 than industry conditions in explaining the productivity, asset sales, and
 closure conditions of Chapter 11 bankrupt firms. This suggests that firms
 that elect to enter into Chapter 11 incur few real economic costs. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Tax and Liquidity Effects in Pricing Government Bonds 
Abstract:
 Daily data from interdealer government bond brokers are examined for tax
 and liquidity effects. We use two approaches to create cash flow matching
 portfolios of similar securities and look for pricing discrepancies
 associated with liquidity or tax effects. We also look for the presence of
 tax and liquidity effects by including a liquidity term when fitting a
 cubic spline to the after-tax yield curve. We find evidence of tax timing
 options and liquidity effects. However, the effects are much smaller than
 previously reported and the effects of liquidity are primarily due to high
 volume bonds with long maturities. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Earnings and Expected Returns 
Abstract:
 The aggregate dividend payout ratio forecasts excess returns on both
 stocks and corporate bonds in postwar U.S. data. High dividends forecast
 high returns. High earnings forecast low returns. The correlation of
 earnings with business conditions gives them predictive power for returns;
 they contain information about future returns that is not captured by
 other variables. Dividends and earnings contribute substantial explanatory
 power at short horizons. For forecasting long-horizon returns, however,
 only (scaled) stock prices matter. Forecasts of low long-horizon stock
 returns in the mid-1990s are caused not by earnings or dividends, but by
 high stock prices. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Costly Search and Mutual Fund Flows 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the flows of funds into and out of equity mutual funds.
 Consumers base their fund purchase decisions on prior performance
 information, but do so asymmetrically, investing disproportionately more
 in funds that performed very well the prior period. Search costs seem to
 be an important determinant of fund flows. High performance appears to be
 most salient for funds that exert higher marketing effort, as measured by
 higher fees. Flows are directly related to the size of the fund's complex
 as well as the current media attention received by the fund, which lower
 consumers' search costs. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Do Inventories Matter in Dealership Markets? Evidence from the London Stock Exchange 
Abstract:
 Using London Stock Exchange data, we test the central implication of the
 canonical model of Ho and Stoll (1983) that relative inventory differences
 determine dealer behavior. We find that relative inventories explain which
 dealers obtain large trades and show that movements between best ask, best
 bid, and straddle are highly correlated with both standardized and
 relative inventory changes. We show that the mean reversion in inventories
 is highly nonlinear and increasing in inventory levels. We show that a key
 determinant of variations in interdealer trading is inventories and that
 interdealer trading plays an important role in managing large inventory
 positions. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Does Risk Sharing Motivate Interdealer Trading? 
Abstract:
 We use unique data from the London Stock Exchange to test whether
 interdealer trade facilitates inventory risk sharing among dealers. We
 develop a methodology that focuses on periods of "extreme"
 inventories-inventory cycles. We further distinguish between inventory
 cycles that are unanticipated and those that are anticipated because of
 "worked" orders. The pattern of interdealer trade during inventory cycles
 matches theoretical predictions for the direction of trade and the
 inventories of trade counterparts. We also show that London dealers
 receive higher trading revenues for taking larger positions. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: An Equilibrium Analysis of Hedging with Liquidity Constraints, Speculation, and Government Price Subsidy in a Commodity Market 
Abstract:
 We develop a simple commodity model to analyze (i) the effects of hedging
 with liquidity constraints, due to producers' inability to bear unlimited
 trading losses, (ii) the role of speculation in the process of risk
 allocation between consumers and producers, and (iii) the equilibrium
 implications of government price subsidies to the producers. We find that
 (1) liquidity constraints can cause futures prices to exhibit mean
 reversion, which then makes speculation profitable; (2) speculation tends
 to make futures price volatility an increasing function of futures price;
 and (3) government price subsidy, if actively hedged by the producers,
 serves to lower the futures risk premium and reduce futures volatility. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Relationship Banking, Liquidity, and Investment in the German Industrialization 
Abstract:
 Close bank relationships are thought to ameliorate firms' liquidity
 constraints-a phenomenon frequently measured by liquidity sensitivity of
 investment. Using German firms during the formative years of universal
 banking (1903-1913), this paper shows that, even controlling for selection
 bias, investment is more sensitive to internal liquidity for
 bank-networked firms than unattached firms. The firm exhibiting the
 greatest liquidity sensitivity, however, faced no apparent liquidity
 constraint. The findings yield two implications: they support recent
 research rejecting a linear relationship between liquidity sensitivity and
 financing constraints, and they suggest that relationship banking provides
 no consistent lessening of firms' liquidity sensitivity. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Evidence on Price Stabilization and Underpricing in Early IPO Returns 
Abstract:
 Using data on 560 firm-commitment initial public offerings of common stock
 for the 1982-1983 period, we find that the cross-sectional distribution of
 one-day returns is modeled better as a mixture of two distributions, with
 the parameter estimates of one distribution being consistent with
 underpricing and the other with price stabilization. Further, the evidence
 that early IPO returns are drawn from a mixture distribution persists for
 at least four weeks. The implications of these results for the analysis of
 IPO returns are illustrated by examining the influence of a measure of ex
 ante price uncertainty on IPO pricing. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Are Investors Reluctant to Realize Their Losses? 
Abstract:
 I test the disposition effect, the tendency of investors to hold losing
 investments too long and sell winning investments too soon, by analyzing
 trading records for 10,000 accounts at a large discount brokerage house.
 These investors demonstrate a strong preference for realizing winners
 rather than losers. Their behavior does not appear to be motivated by a
 desire to rebalance portfolios, or to avoid the higher trading costs of
 low priced stocks. Nor is it justified by subsequent portfolio
 performance. For taxable investments, it is suboptimal and leads to lower
 after-tax returns. Tax-motivated selling is most evident in December. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Capital Gains Taxation and Stock Market Activity: Evidence from IPOs 
Abstract:
 Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA '86), long-term capital gains
 were taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains, presenting investors
 with an opportunity to increase their after-tax return by delaying the
 sale of appreciated assets until after they qualified for long-term status
 and selling depreciated assets prior to long-term qualification. Using a
 sample of Initial Public Offerings, I find that stocks that appreciated
 prior to long-term qualification exhibit increased volume and decreased
 returns just after their qualification date, while stocks that depreciated
 prior to long-term qualification exhibit these effects just prior to their
 qualification date. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: On the Inverse of the Covariance Matrix in Portfolio Analysis 
Abstract:
 The goal of this paper is the derivation and application of a direct
 characterization of the "inverse "of the covariance matrix central to
 portfolio analysis. Such a characterization, in terms of a few primitive
 constructs, provides the basis for new and illuminating expressions for
 key concepts as the optimal holding of a given risky asset and the slope
 of the risk-return efficiency frontier faced by the individual investor.
 The building blocks of the inverse turn out to be the regression
 coefficients and residual variance obtained by regressing the asset's
 excess return on the set of excess returns for all other risky assets. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.
