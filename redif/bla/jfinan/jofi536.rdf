Title: Investor Psychology and Security Market Under- and Overreactions 
Abstract:
 We propose a theory of securities market under- and overreactions based on
 two well-known psychological biases: investor overconfidence about the
 precision of private information; and biased self-attribution, which
 causes asymmetric shifts in investors' confidence as a function of their
 investment outcomes. We show that overconfidence implies negative long-lag
 autocorrelations, excess volatility, and, when managerial actions are
 correlated with stock mispricing, public-event-based return
 predictability. Biased self-attribution adds positive short-lag
 autocorrelations ("momentum"), short-run earnings "drift," but negative
 correlation between future returns and long-term past stock market and
 accounting performance. The theory also offers several untested
 implications and implications for corporate financial policy. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Volume, Volatility, Price, and Profit When All Traders Are Above Average 
Abstract:
 People are overconfident. Overconfidence affects financial markets. How
 depends on who in the market is overconfident and on how information is
 distributed. This paper examines markets in which price-taking traders, a
 strategic-trading insider, and risk-averse marketmakers are overconfident.
 Overconfidence increases expected trading volume, increases market depth,
 and decreases the expected utility of overconfident traders. Its effect on
 volatility and price quality depend on who is overconfident. Overconfident
 traders can cause markets to underreact to the information of rational
 traders. Markets also underreact to abstract, statistical, and highly
 relevant information, and they overreact to salient, anecdotal, and less
 relevant information. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Earnings Management and the Long-Run Market Performance of Initial Public Offerings 
Abstract:
 Issuers of initial public offerings (IPOs) can report earnings in excess
 of cash flows by taking positive accruals. This paper provides evidence
 that issuers with unusually high accruals in the IPO year experience poor
 stock return performance in the three years thereafter. IPO issuers in the
 most "aggressive" quartile of earnings managers have a three-year
 aftermarket stock return of approximately 20 percent less than IPO issuers
 in the most "conservative" quartile. They also issue about 20 percent
 fewer seasoned equity offerings. These differences are statistically and
 economically significant in a variety of specifications. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Value versus Growth: The International Evidence 
Abstract:
 Value stocks have higher returns than growth stocks in markets around the
 world. For the period 1975 through 1995, the difference between the
 average returns on global portfolios of high and low book-to-market stocks
 is 7.68 percent per year, and value stocks outperform growth stocks in
 twelve of thirteen major markets. An international capital asset pricing
 model cannot explain the value premium, but a two-factor model that
 includes a risk factor for relative distress captures the value premium in
 international returns. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: International Cross-Listing and Order Flow Migration: Evidence from an Emerging Market 
Abstract:
 Policymakers in emerging markets are increasingly concerned about the
 consequences for the domestic equity market when companies list stock
 abroad. We show that the effects of cross-listing depend on the quality of
 intermarket information linkages. We investigate these issues with unique
 data from the Mexican equity market. The impact of cross-listing is
 complex-balancing the costs of order flow migration against the benefits
 of increased intermarket competition. These effects are exacerbated by
 equity investment barriers that induce segmentation of the domestic equity
 market. Consequently, the benefits and costs of cross-listing are not
 evenly spread over all classes of shareholders. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Stock Returns, Dividend Yields, and Taxes 
Abstract:
 Using an improved measure of a common stock's annualized dividend yield,
 we document that risk-adjusted NYSE stock returns increase in dividend
 yield during the period from 1963 to 1994. This relation between return
 and yield is robust to various specifications of multifactor asset pricing
 models that incorporate the Fama-French factors. The magnitude of the
 yield effect is too large to be explained by a "tax penalty" on dividend
 income and is not explained by previously documented anomalies.
 Interestingly, the effect is primarily driven by smaller market
 capitalization stocks and zero-yield stocks. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Implied Volatility Functions: Empirical Tests 
Abstract:
 Derman and Kani (1994), Dupire (1994), and Rubinstein (1994) hypothesize
 that asset return volatility is a deterministic function of asset price
 and time, and develop a deterministic volatility function (DVF) option
 valuation model that has the potential of fitting the observed cross
 section of option prices exactly. Using S&P 500 options from June 1988
 through December 1993, we examine the predictive and hedging performance
 of the DVF option valuation model and find it is no better than an ad hoc
 procedure that merely smooths Black-Scholes (1973) implied volatilities
 across exercise prices and times to expiration. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Law, Finance, and Firm Growth 
Abstract:
 We investigate how differences in legal and financial systems affect
 firms' use of external financing to fund growth. We show that in countries
 whose legal systems score high on an efficiency index, a greater
 proportion of firms use long-term external financing. An active, though
 not necessarily large, stock market and a large banking sector are also
 associated with externally financed firm growth. The increased reliance on
 external financing occurs in part because established firms in countries
 with well-functioning institutions have lower profit rates. Government
 subsidies to industry do not increase the proportion of firms relying on
 external financing. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Are Financial Markets Overly Optimistic about the Prospects of Firms That Issue Equity? Evidence from Voluntary versus Involuntary Equity Issuances by Banks 
Abstract:
 This paper examines firm performance around announcements of common stock
 issues. We study the banking industry in which some stock issues are made
 voluntarily by managers, and other issues are involuntary. We find that
 banks that voluntarily issue common stock experience a significant drop in
 the matched adjusted operating performance following the issue, a
 significant drop in benchmark firms' adjusted stock prices following the
 issue, and systematically negative market reactions to post-issue
 quarterly earnings announcements. Banks that issue common stock
 involuntarily experience values for these measures that are not
 significantly different from those of the benchmark firm(s). Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Venture Capital Distributions: Short-Run and Long-Run Reactions 
Abstract:
 Venture capital distributions, a legal form of insider trading, provides
 an ideal arena for examining the share price impact of transactions by
 informed parties. These sales, which occur after substantial run-ups in
 share value, generate a substantial price reaction immediately around the
 event. In the months after distribution, returns apparently continue to be
 negative. When the short- and long-run reactions are decomposed, they are
 consistent with the view that venture capitalists use inside information
 to time stock distributions: Distributions of firms brought public by
 lower quality underwriters and of less seasoned firms have more negative
 price reactions. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: The Gains from Takeover Deregulation: Evidence from the End of Interstate Banking Restrictions 
Abstract:
 This paper uses interstate banking deregulation to explore the benefits of
 takeover deregulation and how these benefits are distributed across
 different firms. We find large and significant abnormal returns around the
 Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 which imply it
 created $85 billion of value in the banking industry. Consistent with an
 active market for corporate control allowing beneficial consolidation and
 providing needed discipline, there is a strong negative relationship
 between banks' abnormal returns and their prior performance. Consistent
 with managerial entrenchment limiting takeover discipline, banks with
 higher insider ownership, lower outside block ownership, and/or less
 independent boards have lower abnormal returns. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Short Sales Are Almost Instantaneously Bad News: Evidence from the Australian Stock Exchange 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the market reaction to short sales on an intraday
 basis in a market setting where short sales are transparent immediately
 following execution. We find a mean reassessment of stock value following
 short sales of up to  - 0.20 percent with adverse information impounded
 within fifteen minutes or twenty trades. Short sales executed near the end
 of the financial year and those related to arbitrage and hedging
 activities are associated with a smaller price reaction; trades near
 information events precipitate larger price reactions. The evidence is
 generally weaker for short sales executed using limit orders relative to
 market orders. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: The Relation Between Treasury Yields and Corporate Bond Yield Spreads 
Abstract:
 Because the option to call a corporate bond should rise in value when bond
 yields fall, the relation between noncallable Treasury yields and spreads
 of corporate bond yields over Treasury yields should depend on the
 callability of the corporate bond. I confirm this hypothesis for
 investment-grade corporate bonds. Although yield spreads on both callable
 and noncallable corporate bonds fall when Treasury yields rise, this
 relation is much stronger for callable bonds. This result has important
 implications for interpreting the behavior of yields on commonly used
 corporate bond indexes, which are composed primarily of callable bonds. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.

Title: Output, Stock Volatility, and Political Uncertainty in a Natural Experiment: Germany, 1880-1940 
Abstract:
 Why does stock volatility increase when output declines? The theory of
 investment under uncertainty implies that political uncertainty may
 simultaneously increase volatility and reduce output. Though cause and
 effect are typically hard to separate, the transition from Imperial to
 Weimar Germany offers a natural experiment because major political events
 left clear traces on stock prices. Current and past increases in
 volatility are associated with output declines, consistent with U.S.
 experience. However, political events are more clearly the source of
 volatility, and the results support the view that the relationship between
 volatility and output reflects the joint effects of political factors. Copyright The American Finance Association 1998.
