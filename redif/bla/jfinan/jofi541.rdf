Title: Effects of Market Reform on the Trading Costs and Depths of Nasdaq Stocks 
Abstract:
 The relative merits of dealer versus auction markets have been a subject
 of significant and sometimes contentious debate. On January 20, 1997, the
 Securities and Exchange Commission began implementing reforms that would
 permit the public to compete directly with Nasdaq dealers by submitting
 binding limit orders. Additionally, superior quotes placed by Nasdaq
 dealers in private trading venues began to be displayed in the Nasdaq
 market. We measure the impact of these new rules on various measures of
 performance, including trading costs and depths. Our results indicate that
 quoted and effective spreads fell dramatically without adversely affecting
 market quality. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Payments for Order Flow on Nasdaq 
Abstract:
 We present a model of Nasdaq that includes the two ways in which
 marketmakers compete for order flow: quotes and direct payments. Brokers
 in our model can execute small trades through a computerized system,
 preferencing arrangements with marketmakers, or vertical integration into
 market making. The comparative statics in our model differ from those of
 the traditional model of dealer markets, which does not capture important
 institutional features of Nasdaq. We also show that the empirical evidence
 is inconsistent with the traditional model, which suggests that
 preferencing and vertical integration are important components in
 understanding Nasdaq. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Costs of Equity Capital and Model Mispricing 
Abstract:
 Costs of equity for individual firms are estimated in a Bayesian framework
 using several factor-based pricing models. Substantial prior uncertainty
 about mispricing often produces an estimated cost of equity close to that
 obtained with mispricing precluded, even for a stock whose average return
 departs significantly from the pricing model's prediction. Uncertainty
 about which pricing model to use is less important, on average, than
 within-model parameter uncertainty. In the absence of mispricing
 uncertainty, uncertainty about factor premiums is generally the largest
 source of overall uncertainty about a firm's cost of equity, although
 uncertainty about betas is nearly as important. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Incomplete Markets and Security Prices: Do Asset-Pricing Puzzles Result from Aggregation Problems? 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates Euler equations involving security prices and
 household-level consumption data. It provides a useful complement to many
 existing studies of consumption-based asset pricing models that use a
 representative-agent framework, because the Euler equations under
 investigation hold even if markets are incomplete. It also provides a
 useful complement to simulation-based studies of market incompleteness.
 The empirical evidence indicates that the theory is rejected by the data
 along several dimensions. The results therefore indicate that some
 well-documented asset-pricing puzzles do not result from aggregation
 problems for the preferences under investigation. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Improved Methods for Tests of Long-Run Abnormal Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 We analyze tests for long-run abnormal returns and document that two
 approaches yield well-specified test statistics in random samples. The
 first uses a traditional event study framework and buy-and-hold abnormal
 returns calculated using carefully constructed reference portfolios.
 Inference is based on either a skewness-adjusted "t"-statistic or the
 empirically generated distribution of long-run abnormal returns. The
 second approach is based on calculation of mean monthly abnormal returns
 using calendar-time portfolios and a time-series "t"-statistic. Though
 both approaches perform well in random samples, misspecification in
 nonrandom samples is pervasive. Thus, analysis of long-run abnormal
 returns is treacherous. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Two-Pass Tests of Asset Pricing Models with Useless Factors 
Abstract:
 In this paper we investigate the properties of the standard two-pass
 methodology of testing beta pricing models with misspecified factors. In a
 setting where a factor is useless, defined as being independent of all the
 asset returns, we provide theoretical results and simulation evidence that
 the second-pass cross-sectional regression tends to find the beta risk of
 the useless factor priced more often than it should. More surprisingly,
 this misspecification bias exacerbates when the number of time series
 observations increases. Possible ways of detecting useless factors are
 also examined. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Herding among Investment Newsletters: Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
 A model is developed which implies that if an analyst has high reputation
 or low ability, or if there is strong public information that is
 inconsistent with the analyst's private information, she is likely to
 herd. Herding is also common when informative private signals are
 positively correlated across analysts. The model is tested using data from
 analysts who publish investment newsletters. Consistent with the model's
 implications, the empirical results indicate that a newsletter analyst is
 likely to herd on "Value Line's "recommendation if her reputation is high,
 if her ability is low, or if signal correlation is high. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: An Empirical Comparison of Forward-Rate and Spot-Rate Models for Valuing Interest-Rate Options 
Abstract:
 Our main goal is to investigate the question of which interest-rate
 options valuation models are better suited to support the management of
 interest-rate risk. We use the German market to test seven spot-rate and
 forward-rate models with one and two factors for interest-rate warrants
 for the period from 1990 to 1993. We identify a one-factor forward-rate
 model and two spot-rate models with two factors that are not significantly
 outperformed by any of the other four models. Further rankings are
 possible if additional criteria are applied. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Are Tax Effects Important in the Long-Run Fisher Relationship? Evidence from the Municipal Bond Market 
Abstract:
 Are nominal bonds appropriately discounted for taxes? Empirical estimates
 of the response of nominal interest rates to changes in inflation, the
 Fisher effect, have failed to produce a definitive answer. Four reasons
 have been put forward as possible explanations: (i) Tobin effects, (ii)
 fiscal illusion, (iii) peso problems, and (iv) different estimators.
 Utilizing data on taxable and tax-exempt bond interest rates and several
 different estimators, we find that the Fisher effect estimates are always
 larger for the taxable bond relative to the tax-exempt bond, suggesting
 that fiscal illusion and different estimators cannot account for the
 previous results. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Banks and Corporate Control in Japan 
Abstract:
 Using a large sample of Japanese firm level data, we find that Japanese
 banks act primarily in the short term interests of creditors when dealing
 with firms outside bank groups. Corporate control mechanisms other than
 bank oversight appear necessary in these firms. When dealing with firms in
 bank groups, banks may act in the broader interests of a range of
 stakeholders, including shareholders. However, our findings are also
 consistent with banks "propping up" troubled bank group firms. We conclude
 that bank oversight need not lead to value maximizing corporate
 governance. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: How Long Do Junk Bonds Spend in Default? 
Abstract:
 This paper analyzes junk bond defaults during 1980 to 1991 to determine
 which factors affect the length of time spent in default. Bondholder
 holdouts are not a significant problem, as firms with proportionately more
 bonds have shorter default spells. In contrast, bank debt is associated
 with slower restructurings. Bargaining problems arising from contingent
 liabilities, lawsuits, and size delay the process, although multiple bond
 classes do not. Neither information problems nor firm value appear to
 matter. HLTs do not resolve their defaults at a significantly faster pace.
 Defaults tend to take less time in the 1990s, despite Drexel's
 disappearance from the market. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Optimal Risk Management Using Options 
Abstract:
 This article provides an analytical solution to the problem of an
 institution optimally managing the market risk of a given exposure by
 minimizing its Value-at-Risk using options. The optimal hedge consists of
 a position in a single option whose strike price is independent of the
 level of expense the institution is willing to incur for its hedging
 program. This optimal strike price depends on the distribution of the
 asset exposure, the horizon of the hedge, and the level of protection
 desired by the institution. Moreover, the costs associated with a
 suboptimal choice of exercise price are economically significant. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Pricing Options under Generalized GARCH and Stochastic Volatility Processes 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we develop an efficient lattice algorithm to price European
 and American options under discrete time GARCH processes. We show that
 this algorithm is easily extended to price options under generalized GARCH
 processes, with many of the existing stochastic volatility bivariate
 diffusion models appearing as limiting cases. We establish one unifying
 algorithm that can price options under almost all existing GARCH
 specifications as well as under a large family of bivariate diffusions in
 which volatility follows its own, perhaps correlated, process. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Determinants of the Consumer Bankruptcy Decision 
Abstract:
 Qualitative choice models of consumers' decisions to file for bankruptcy
 and their choice of bankruptcy chapter are estimated jointly, combining
 choice-based sampling techniques with a nested estimation procedure.
 Medical and credit card debt are found to be the strongest contributors to
 bankruptcy, with homeownership playing an important role with respect to
 both the decision to declare bankruptcy and the choice of bankruptcy
 alternative. The potential effects of legal changes relating to property
 exemptions and dischargeable debt categories are found to encourage debt
 repayment through Chapter 13. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.
