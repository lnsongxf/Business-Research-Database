Title: Were the Good Old Days That Good? Changes in Managerial Stock Ownership Since the Great Depression 
Abstract:
 We document that ownership by officers and directors of publicly traded
 firms is on average higher today than earlier in the century. Managerial
 ownership has risen from 13 percent for the universe of exchange-listed
 corporations in 1935, the earliest year for which such data exist, to 21
 percent in 1995. We examine in detail the robustness of the increase and
 explore hypotheses to explain it. Higher managerial ownership has not
 substituted for alternative corporate governance mechanisms. Lower
 volatility and greater hedging opportunities associated with the
 development of financial markets appear to be important factors explaining
 the increase in managerial ownership. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Corporate Ownership Around the World 
Abstract:
 We use data on ownership structures of large corporations in 27 wealthy
 economies to identify the ultimate controlling shareholders of these
 firms. We find that, except in economies with very good shareholder
 protection, relatively few of these firms are widely held, in contrast to
 Berle and Means's image of ownership of the modern corporation. Rather,
 these firms are typically controlled by families or the State. Equity
 control by financial institutions is far less common. The controlling
 shareholders typically have power over firms significantly in excess of
 their cash flow rights, primarily through the use of pyramids and
 participation in management. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Capital Structure and Corporate Control: The Effect of Antitakeover Statutes on Firm Leverage 
Abstract:
 We find that firms protected by "second generation" state antitakeover
 laws substantially reduce their use of debt, and that unprotected firms do
 the reverse. This result supports recent models in which the threat of
 hostile takeover motivates managers to take on debt they would otherwise
 avoid. An implication is that legal barriers to takeovers may increase
 corporate slack. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Leverage and Corporate Performance: Evidence from Unsuccessful Takeovers 
Abstract:
 This paper finds that, on average, targets that terminate takeover offers
 significantly increase their leverage ratios. Targets that increase their
 leverage ratios the most reduce capital expenditures, sell assets, reduce
 employment, increase focus, and realize cash flows and share prices that
 outperform their benchmarks in the five years following the failed
 takeover. Our evidence suggests that leverage-increasing targets act in
 the interests of shareholders when they terminate takeover offers and that
 higher leverage helps firms remain independent not because it entrenches
 managers, but because it commits managers to making the improvements that
 would be made by potential raiders. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Mutual Fund Herding and the Impact on Stock Prices 
Abstract:
 We analyze the trading activity of the mutual fund industry from 1975
 through 1994 to determine whether funds "herd" when they trade stocks and
 to investigate the impact of herding on stock prices. Although we find
 little herding by mutual funds in the average stock, we find much higher
 levels in trades of small stocks and in trading by growth-oriented funds.
 Stocks that herds buy outperform stocks that they sell by 4 percent during
 the following six months; this return difference is much more pronounced
 among small stocks. Our results are consistent with mutual fund herding
 speeding the price-adjustment process. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Can Costs of Consumption Adjustment Explain Asset Pricing Puzzles? 
Abstract:
 We investigate Grossman and Laroque's (1990) conjecture that costs of
 adjusting consumption can account, in part, for the empirical failure of
 the consumption-based capital asset pricing model (CCAPM). We incorporate
 small fixed costs of consumption adjustment into a CCAPM with
 heterogeneous agents. We find that undetectably small consumption
 adjustment costs can account for much of the discrepancy between the
 observed variance of nondurable aggregate consumption growth and the
 predictions of the CCAPM, and can partially reconcile nondurable
 consumption data with the observed equity premium. We conclude that the
 CCAPM's implications are nonrobust to extremely small adjustment costs. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: The Sampling Error in Estimates of Mean-Variance Efficient Portfolio Weights 
Abstract:
 This paper presents an exact finite-sample statistical procedure for
 testing hypotheses about the weights of mean-variance efficient
 portfolios. The estimation and inference procedures on efficient portfolio
 weights are performed in the same way as for the coefficients in an OLS
 regression. OLS "t"- and "F"-statistics can be used for tests on efficient
 weights, and when returns are multivariate normal, these statistics have
 exact "t" and "F" distributions in a finite sample. Using 20 years of data
 on 11 country stock indexes, we find that the sampling error in estimates
 of the weights of a global efficient portfolio is large. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: The Relationship between Firm Investment and Financial Status 
Abstract:
 Firm investment decisions are shown to be directly related to financial
 factors. Investment decisions of firms with high creditworthiness
 (according to traditional financial ratios) are extremely sensitive to the
 availability of internal funds; less creditworthy firms are much less
 sensitive to internal fund availability. This large sample evidence is
 based on an objective sorting mechanism and supports the results of Kaplan
 and Zingales (1997), who also find that investment outlays of the least
 constrained firms are the most sensitive to internal cash flow. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: The Financing and Redeployment of Specific Assets 
Abstract:
 We model the role various forms of nonrecourse secured debt play in
 efficiently redeploying assets whose value is state-specific. Ex ante, an
 entrepreneur and an asset redeployer make noncontractible state-specific
 investments in the primary and next-best uses of an asset, respectively.
 The redeployer provides a secured nonrecourse loan equal to the value of
 the asset in the critical state that separates the good and bad states. In
 the event of a bad state, this contract averts ex post bargaining over the
 asset's quasi-rents on redeployment and leaves the parties' ex ante
 investments undistorted. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Differences in Trading Behavior across NYSE Specialist Firms 
Abstract:
 Using a sample of NYSE-listed equities from 1992, this study examines
 whether market maker performance differs across specialist firms. We find
 that spreads and depth differ across specialist firms, but the
 competitiveness of NYSE quotes relative to other exchanges does not appear
 to be affected by these differences. Differences are also evident in
 measures of transitory volatility and in the frequency and duration of
 order-imbalance trading halts. The results suggest that specialists have a
 significant effect on execution costs, liquidity, and noise in security
 prices and that these effects are not completely eliminated by competition
 or the NYSE's monitoring mechanisms. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: A Specialist's Quoted Depth and the Limit Order Book 
Abstract:
 By partitioning quoted depth into the specialist's contribution and the
 limit order book's contribution, the paper investigates whether
 specialists manage quoted depth to reduce adverse selection risk. The
 results show that both specialists and limit order traders reduce depth
 around information events, thereby reducing their exposure to adverse
 selection costs. Moreover, specialists' quotes may reflect only the limit
 order book on the side (or sides) of the market where they believe there
 is a chance of informed trading. Changes in quoted depth are consistent
 with specialists managing their inventory as well as having knowledge of
 the stock's future value. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: On the Cross-Sectional Relation between Expected Returns, Betas, and Size 
Abstract:
 In this paper, I set up scenarios where the mean-variance capital asset
 pricing model is true and where it is false. Then I investigate whether
 the coefficients from regressions of population expected excess returns on
 population betas, and expected excess returns on betas and size, allow us
 to distinguish between the scenarios. I show that the coefficients from
 either ordinary least squares or generalized least squares regressions do
 not allow us to tell whether the model is true or false. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: How Are Derivatives Used? Evidence from the Mutual Fund Industry 
Abstract:
 We investigate investment managers' use of derivatives by comparing return
 distributions for equity mutual funds that use and do not use derivatives.
 In contrast to public perception, derivative users have risk exposure and
 return performance that are similar to nonusers. We also analyze changes
 in fund risk in response to prior fund performance. Changes in risk are
 substantially less severe for funds using derivatives, consistent with the
 explanation that managers use derivatives to reduce the impact of
 performance on risk. We provide new evidence regarding the implications of
 cash flows and managerial gaming for the relation between performance and
 risk. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.
