Title: The Performance of Hedge Funds: Risk, Return, and Incentives 
Abstract:
 Hedge funds display several interesting characteristics that may influence
 performance, including: flexible investment strategies, strong managerial
 incentives, substantial managerial investment, sophisticated investors,
 and limited government oversight. Using a large sample of hedge fund data
 from 1988-1995, we find that hedge funds consistently outperform mutual
 funds, but not standard market indices. Hedge funds, however, are more
 volatile than both mutual funds and market indices. Incentive fees explain
 some of the higher performance, but not the increased total risk. The
 impact of six data-conditioning biases is explored. We find evidence that
 positive and negative survival-related biases offset each other. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Are Some Mutual Fund Managers Better Than Others? Cross-Sectional Patterns in Behavior and Performance 
Abstract:
 We examine whether mutual fund performance is related to characteristics
 of fund managers that may indicate ability, knowledge, or effort. In
 particular, we study the relationship between performance and the
 manager's age, the average composite SAT score at the manager's
 undergraduate institution, and whether the manager has an MBA. Although
 the raw data suggest striking return differences between managers with
 different characteristics, most of these can be explained by behavioral
 differences between managers and by selection biases. After adjusting for
 these, some performance differences remain. In particular, managers who
 attended higher-SAT undergraduate institutions have systematically higher
 risk-adjusted excess returns. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Is Money Smart? A Study of Mutual Fund Investors' Fund Selection Ability 
Abstract:
 A previous study finds evidence to support selection ability among active
 fund investors for equity funds listed in 1982. Using a large sample of
 equity funds, I find evidence that funds that receive more money
 subsequently perform significantly better than those that lose money. This
 effect is short-lived and is largely but not completely explained by a
 strategy of betting on winners. In the aggregate, there is no significant
 evidence that funds that receive more money subsequently beat the market.
 However, it is possible to earn positive abnormal returns by using the
 cash flow information for small funds. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Investment Decisions Depend on Portfolio Disclosures 
Abstract:
 A weekly database of retail money fund portfolio statistics is
 uneconomical for retail investors to observe, so it allows direct
 comparison of disclosed and undisclosed portfolios. This makes possible a
 more direct and unambiguous test for "window dressing" than elsewhere in
 the literature. The analysis shows that funds allocating between
 government and private issues hold more in government issues around
 disclosures than at other times, consistent with the theory that
 intermediaries prefer to disclose safer portfolios. Cross-sectional
 comparisons locate the most intense rebalancing in the worst recent
 performers. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Global Stock Markets in the Twentieth Century 
Abstract:
 Long-term estimates of expected return on equities are typically derived
 from U.S. data only. There are reasons to suspect that these estimates are
 subject to survivorship, as the United States is arguably the most
 successful capitalist system in the world. We collect a database of
 capital appreciation indexes for 39 markets going back to the 1920s. For
 1921 to 1996, U.S. equities had the highest real return of all countries,
 at 4.3 percent, versus a median of 0.8 percent for other countries. The
 high equity premium obtained for U.S. equities appears to be the exception
 rather than the rule. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: The Effects of Market Segmentation and Investor Recognition on Asset Prices: Evidence from Foreign Stocks Listing in the United States 
Abstract:
 Non-U.S. firms cross-listing shares on U.S. exchanges as American
 Depositary Receipts earn cumulative abnormal returns of 19 percent during
 the year before listing, and an additional 1.20 percent during the listing
 week, but incur a loss of 14 percent during the year following listing. We
 show how these unusual share price changes are robust to changing market
 risk exposures and are related to an expansion of the shareholder base and
 to the amount of capital raised at the time of listing. Our tests provide
 support for the market segmentation hypothesis and Merton's (1987)
 investor recognition hypothesis. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: The Persistence of IPO Mispricing and the Predictive Power of Flipping 
Abstract:
 This paper examines underwriters' pricing errors and the information
 content of first-day trading activity in IPOs. We show that first-day
 winners continue to be winners over the first year, and first-day dogs
 continue to be relative dogs. Exceptions are "extra-hot" IPOs, which
 provide the worst future performance. We also demonstrate that large,
 supposedly informed, traders "flip" IPOs that perform the worst in the
 future. IPOs with low flipping generate abnormal returns of 1.5 percentage
 points per month over the first six months beginning on the third day. We
 show that flipping is predictable and conclude that underwriters' pricing
 errors are intentional. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: The Going-Public Decision and the Development of Financial Markets 
Abstract:
 This paper explores the linkages between stock price efficiency, the
 choice between private and public financing, and the development of
 capital markets in emerging economies. Generally, the advantage of public
 financing is high if costly information is diverse and cheap to acquire,
 and if investors receive valuable information without cost. The value of
 public firms generally depends on public market size, which implies that
 there can be a positive externality associated with going public, so that
 an inferior equilibrium can exist where too few firms go public. The model
 is consistent with empirical observations on financial market development. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Merging Markets 
Abstract:
 We study the causes and effects of the competition for order flow by U.S.
 regional stock exchanges. We trace the origins of competition for order
 flow to a change in the role of regional exchanges from being venues for
 listing local securities to being more direct competitors for the order
 flow of NYSE listings. We study the way regionals competed for order flow,
 concentrating on a series of stock-exchange mergers that occurred in the
 midst of this transition of the regional exchanges. The merging exchanges
 attracted market share and experienced narrower bid-ask spreads. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Evidence on the Determinants of Credit Terms Used in Interfirm Trade 
Abstract:
 Trade credit is created whenever a supplier offers terms that allow the
 buyer to delay payment. In this paper we document the rich variation in
 interfirm credit terms and credit policies across industries. We examine
 empirically the firm's basic credit policy choices: whether to extend
 credit or to require cash payment; and, if credit is extended, whether to
 adopt simple net terms or terms with discounts for prompt payment. We also
 examine determinants of variations in two-part terms. Results are
 supportive primarily of theories that explain credit terms as contractual
 solutions to information problems concerning product quality and buyer
 creditworthiness. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: A Reexamination of the Conglomerate Merger Wave in the 1960s: An Internal Capital Markets View 
Abstract:
 One possible explanation for bidding firms earning positive abnormal
 returns in diversifying acquisitions in the 1960s is that internal capital
 markets were expected to overcome the information deficiencies of the
 less-developed capital markets. Examining 392 bidder firms during the
 1960s, we find the highest bidder returns when financially "unconstrained"
 buyers acquire "constrained" targets. This result holds while controlling
 for merger terms and for different proxies used to classify firms facing
 costly external financing. We also find that bidders generally retain
 target management, suggesting that management may have provided
 company-specific operational information, while the bidder provided
 capital-budgeting expertise. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Ex Ante Bond Returns and the Liquidity Preference Hypothesis 
Abstract:
 We provide a formal test of the liquidity preference hypothesis (LPH),
 that is, the monotonicity of ex ante term premiums, using nonparametric
 estimates that do not require a structural model for conditional expected
 returns. Although the point estimates of the term premiums are consistent
 with previous conclusions in the literature regarding violations of the
 LPH, the test statistics are generally insignificant, even when powerful
 conditioning information is used. These results illustrate the importance
 of correctly accounting for correlations across maturities and of formally
 testing the inequality restrictions implied by the LPH. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Number of Shareholders and Stock Prices: Evidence from Japan 
Abstract:
 Merton (1987) proposes that an increase in a firm's investor base
 increases the firm's value. In Japan, companies can reduce their stock's
 minimum trading unit-the number of shares in a "round lot"-which
 facilitates trading in the stock by small investors. We find that a
 reduction in the minimum trading unit greatly increases a firm's base of
 individual investors and its stock liquidity, and is associated with a
 significant increase in the stock price. Further, the stock price
 appreciation is positively related to an increase in the number of
 shareholders. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.
