Title: A Critique of the Stochastic Discount Factor Methodology 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we point out that the widely used stochastic discount
 factor (SDF) methodology ignores a fully specified model for asset
 returns. As a result, it suffers from two potential problems when asset
 returns follow a linear factor model. The first problem is that the risk
 premium estimate from the SDF methodology is unreliable. The second
 problem is that the specification test under the SDF methodology has very
 low power in detecting misspecified models. Traditional methodologies
 typically incorporate a fully specified model for asset returns, and they
 can perform substantially better than the SDF methodology. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Do Industries Explain Momentum? 
Abstract:
 This paper documents a strong and prevalent momentum effect in industry
 components of stock returns which accounts for much of the individual
 stock momentum anomaly. Specifically, momentum investment strategies,
 which buy past winning stocks and sell past losing stocks, are
 significantly less profitable once we control for industry momentum. By
 contrast, industry momentum investment strategies, which buy stocks from
 past winning industries and sell stocks from past losing industries,
 appear highly profitable, even after controlling for size, book-to-market
 equity, individual stock momentum, the cross-sectional dispersion in mean
 returns, and potential microstructure influences. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Optimal Leverage and Aggregate Investment 
Abstract:
 We analyze the optimal financing of investment projects when managers must
 exert unobservable effort and can also switch to less profitable riskier
 ventures. Optimal financial contracts can be implemented by a combination
 of debt and equity when the risk-shifting problem is the most severe while
 stock options are also needed when the effort problem is the most severe.
 Worsening of the moral hazard problems leads to decreases in investment
 and output at the macroeconomic level. Moreover, aggregate leverage
 decreases with the risk-shifting problem and increases with the effort
 problem. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Conditioning Variables and the Cross Section of Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 Previous studies identify predetermined variables that predict stock and
 bond returns through time. This paper shows that loadings on the same
 variables provide significant cross-sectional explanatory power for stock
 portfolio returns. The loadings are significant given the three factors
 advocated by Fama and French (1993) and the four factors of Elton, Gruber,
 and Blake (1995). The explanatory power of the loadings on lagged
 variables is robust to various portfolio grouping procedures and other
 considerations. The results carry implications for risk analysis,
 performance measurement, cost-of-capital calculations, and other
 applications. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Transition Densities for Interest Rate and Other Nonlinear Diffusions 
Abstract:
 This paper applies to interest rate models the theoretical method
 developed in Aït-Sahalia (1998) to generate accurate closed-form
 approximations to the transition function of an arbitrary diffusion. While
 the main focus of this paper is on the maximum-likelihood estimation of
 interest rate models with otherwise unknown transition functions,
 applications to the valuation of derivative securities are also briefly
 discussed. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: The Financial and Operating Performance of Privatized Firms during the 1990s 
Abstract:
 This study compares the pre- and postprivatization financial and operating
 performance of 85 companies from 28 industrialized countries that were
 privatized through public share offerings for the period from 1990 through
 1996. We document significant increases in profitability, output,
 operating efficiency, and dividend payments-and significant decreases in
 leverage ratios-for our full sample of firms after privatization, and for
 most subsamples examined. Capital expenditures increase significantly in
 absolute terms, but not relative to sales. Employment declines, but
 insignificantly. Combined with results from two previous, directly
 comparable studies, these findings strongly suggest that privatization
 yields significant performance improvements. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Local Return Factors and Turnover in Emerging Stock Markets 
Abstract:
 The factors that drive cross-sectional differences in expected stock
 returns in emerging equity markets are qualitatively similar to those that
 have been documented for developed markets. Emerging market stocks exhibit
 momentum, small stocks outperform large stocks, and value stocks
 outperform growth stocks. There is no evidence that high beta stocks
 outperform low beta stocks. A Bayesian analysis of the return premiums
 shows that the combined evidence of developed and emerging markets
 strongly favors the hypothesis that similar return factors are present in
 markets around the world. Finally, there exists a strong cross-sectional
 correlation between the return factors and share turnover. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Market Risk and Model Risk for a Financial Institution Writing Options 
Abstract:
 Derivatives valuation and risk management involve heavy use of
 quantitative models. To develop a quantitative assessment of model risk as
 it affects the basic option writing strategy that might be followed by a
 financial institution, we conduct an empirical simulation, with and
 without hedging, using data from 1976 to 1996. Results indicate that
 imperfect models and inaccurate volatility forecasts create sizable risk
 exposure for option writers. We consider to what extent the damage due to
 model risk can be limited by pricing options using a higher volatility
 than the best estimate from historical data. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.
