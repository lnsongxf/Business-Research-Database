Title: Optimal Investment, Growth Options, and Security Returns 
Abstract:
 As a consequence of optimal investment choices, a firm's assets and growth
 options change in predictable ways. Using a dynamic model, we show that
 this imparts predictability to changes in a firm's systematic risk, and
 its expected return. Simulations show that the model simultaneously
 reproduces: (i) the time-series relation between the book-to-market ratio
 and asset returns; (ii) the cross-sectional relation between
 book-to-market, market value, and return; (iii) contrarian effects at
 short horizons; (iv) momentum effects at longer horizons; and (v) the
 inverse relation between interest rates and the market risk premium. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Estimating Portfolio and Consumption Choice: A Conditional Euler Equations Approach 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a nonparametric approach to examine how portfolio and
 consumption choice depends on variables that forecast time-varying
 investment opportunities. I estimate single-period and multiperiod
 portfolio and consumption rules of an investor with constant relative risk
 aversion and a one-month to 20-year horizon. The investor allocates wealth
 to the NYSE index and a 30-day Treasury bill. I find that the portfolio
 choice varies significantly with the dividend yield, default premium, term
 premium, and lagged excess return. Furthermore, the optimal decisions
 depend on the investor's horizon and rebalancing frequency. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Data-Snooping, Technical Trading Rule Performance, and the Bootstrap 
Abstract:
 In this paper we utilize White's Reality Check bootstrap methodology
 (White (1999)) to evaluate simple technical trading rules while
 quantifying the data-snooping bias and fully adjusting for its effect in
 the context of the full universe from which the trading rules were drawn.
 Hence, for the first time, the paper presents a comprehensive test of
 performance across all technical trading rules examined. We consider the
 study of Brock, Lakonishok, and LeBaron (1992), expand their universe of
 26 trading rules, apply the rules to 100 years of daily data on the Dow
 Jones Industrial Average, and determine the effects of data-snooping. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: What is the Intrinsic Value of the Dow? 
Abstract:
 We model the time-series relation between price and intrinsic value as a
 cointegrated system, so that price and value are long-term convergent. In
 this framework, we compare the performance of alternative estimates of
 intrinsic value for the Dow 30 stocks. During 1963-1996, traditional
 market multiples (e.g., B/P, E/P, and D/P ratios) have little predictive
 power. However, a V/P ratio, where V is based on a residual income
 valuation model, has statistically reliable predictive power. Further
 analysis shows time-varying interest rates and analyst forecasts are
 important to the success of V. Alternative forecast horizons and risk
 premia are less important. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Performance Evaluation with Transactions Data: The Stock Selection of Investment Newsletters 
Abstract:
 This paper analyzes the equity-portfolio recommendations made by
 investment newsletters. Overall, there is no significant evidence of
 superior stock-picking ability for this sample of 153 newsletters.
 Moreover, there is no evidence of abnormal short-run performance
 persistence ("hot hands"). The comprehensive and bias-free transactions
 database also allows for insights into the precision of performance
 evaluation. Using a measure of precision defined in the paper, a
 transactions-based approach yields a median improvement of 10 percent over
 a corresponding factor model. This compares favorably with the precision
 gained by adding factors to the CAPM. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Inefficiency in Analysts' Earnings Forecasts: Systematic Misreaction or Systematic Optimism? 
Abstract:
 A rational analysis of analyst behavior predicts that analysts immediately
 and without bias incorporate information into their forecasts. Several
 studies document analysts' tendency to systematically underreact to
 information. Underreaction is inconsistent with rationality. Other studies
 indicate that analysts systematically overreact to new information or that
 they are systematically optimistic. This study discriminates between these
 three hypotheses by examining the interaction between the nature of
 information and the type of reaction by analysts. The evidence indicates
 that analysts underreact to negative information, but overreact to
 positive information. These results are consistent with systematic
 optimism in response to information. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Preferencing, Internalization, Best Execution, and Dealer Profits 
Abstract:
 The practices of preferencing and internalization have been alleged to
 support collusion, cause worse execution, and lead to wider spreads in
 dealership style markets relative to auction style markets. For a sample
 of London Stock Exchange stocks, we find that preferenced trades pay
 higher spreads, however they do not generate higher dealer profits.
 Internalized trades pay lower, not higher, spreads. We do not find a
 relation between the extent of preferencing or internalization and spreads
 across stocks. These results do not lend support to the "collusion"
 hypothesis but are consistent with a "costly search and trading
 relationships" hypothesis. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: CEO Involvement in the Selection of New Board Members: An Empirical Analysis 
Abstract:
 We study whether CEO involvement in the selection of new directors
 influences the nature of appointments to the board. When the CEO serves on
 the nominating committee or no nominating committee exists, firms appoint
 fewer independent outside directors and more gray outsiders with conflicts
 of interest. Stock price reactions to independent director appointments
 are significantly lower when the CEO is involved in director selection.
 Our evidence may illuminate a mechanism used by CEOs to reduce pressure
 from active monitoring, and we find a recent trend of companies removing
 CEOs from involvement in director selection. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: The Equity Performance of Firms Emerging from Bankruptcy 
Abstract:
 This study assesses the stock return performance of 131 firms emerging
 from Chapter 11. Using differing estimates of expected returns, we
 consistently find evidence of large, positive excess returns in 200 days
 of returns following emergence. We also examine the reaction of our sample
 firms' equity returns to their earnings announcements after emergence from
 Chapter 11. The positive and significant reactions suggest that our
 results are driven by the market's expectational errors, not
 mismeasurement of risk. The results provide an interesting contrast, but
 not a contradiction, to previous work that has documented poor operating
 performance for firms emerging from Chapter 11. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: The Slope of the Credit Yield Curve for Speculative-Grade Issuers 
Abstract:
 Many theoretical bond pricing models predict that the credit yield curve
 facing risky bond issuers is downward-sloping. Previous empirical research
 (Sarig and Warga (1989), Fons (1994)) supports these models. Our study
 examines sets of bonds issued by the same firm with equal priority in the
 liability structure, but with different maturities, thus holding credit
 quality constant. We find, counter to prior research, that risky bonds
 typically have upward-sloping credit yield curves. Moreover, when we
 combine our matched sets of bonds (no longer controlling credit quality),
 the estimated slope is negative, indicating a sample selection bias
 problem associated with maturity. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Liquidity Provision and Noise Trading: Evidence from the "Investment Dartboard" Column 
Abstract:
 How does increased noise trading affect market liquidity and trading
 costs? We use "The Wall Street Journal"'s "Investment Dartboard" column,
 which stimulates noise trading, as a natural experiment to evaluate models
 of the bid-ask spread. We find that substantial increases in trading
 volume and significant but temporary abnormal returns occur when analysts
 recommend stocks in this column, especially when recommendations come from
 analysts with successful contest track records. We also find an increase
 in liquidity and a decrease in the adverse selection component of the
 bid-ask spread. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Price Formation and Liquidity in the U.S. Treasury Market: The Response to Public Information 
Abstract:
 The arrival of public information in the U.S. Treasury market sets off a
 two-stage adjustment process for prices, trading volume, and bid-ask
 spreads. In a brief first stage, the release of a major macroeconomic
 announcement induces a sharp and nearly instantaneous price change with a
 reduction in trading volume, demonstrating that price reactions to public
 information do not require trading. The spread widens dramatically at
 announcement, evidently driven by inventory control concerns. In a
 prolonged second stage, trading volume surges, price volatility persists,
 and spreads remain moderately wide as investors trade to reconcile
 residual differences in their private views. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.
