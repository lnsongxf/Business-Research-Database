Title: The Corporate Cost of Capital and the Return on Corporate Investment 
Abstract:
 We estimate the internal rates of return earned by nonfinancial firms on
 (i) the initial market values of their securities and (ii) the cost of
 their investments. The return on value is an estimate of the overall
 corporate cost of capital. The estimate of the real cost of capital for
 1950-96 is 5.95 percent. The real return on cost is larger, 7.38 percent,
 so on average corporate investment seems to be profitable. A by-product of
 calculating these returns is information about the history of corporate
 earnings, investment, and financing decisions that is perhaps more
 interesting than the returns. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Corporate Cash Reserves and Acquisitions 
Abstract:
 Cash-rich firms are more likely than other firms to attempt acquisitions.
 Stock return evidence shows that acquisitions by cash-rich firms are value
 decreasing. Cash-rich bidders destroy seven cents in value for every
 excess dollar of cash reserves held. Cash-rich firms are more likely to
 make diversifying acquisitions and their targets are less likely to
 attract other bidders. Consistent with the stock return evidence, mergers
 in which the bidder is cash-rich are followed by abnormal declines in
 operating performance. Overall, the evidence supports the agency costs of
 free cash flow explanation for acquisitions by cash-rich firms. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Executive Compensation, Strategic Competition, and Relative Performance Evaluation: Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
 We examine compensation contracts for managers in imperfectly competitive
 product markets. We show that strategic interactions among firms can
 explain the lack of relative performance-based incentives in which
 compensation decreases with rival firm performance. The need to soften
 product market competition generates an optimal compensation contract that
 places a positive weight on both own and rival performance. Firms in more
 competitive industries place greater weight on rival firm performance
 relative to own firm performance. We find empirical evidence of a positive
 sensitivity of compensation to rival firm performance that is increasing
 in the degree of competition in the industry. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Home Bias at Home: Local Equity Preference in Domestic Portfolios 
Abstract:
 The strong bias in favor of domestic securities is a well-documented
 characteristic of international investment portfolios, yet we show that
 the preference for investing close to home also applies to portfolios of
 domestic stocks. Specifically, U.S. investment managers exhibit a strong
 preference for locally headquartered firms, particularly small, highly
 levered firms that produce nontraded goods. These results suggest that
 asymmetric information between local and nonlocal investors may drive the
 preference for geographically proximate investments, and the relation
 between investment proximity and firm size and leverage may shed light on
 several well-documented asset pricing anomalies. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Can the Gains from International Diversification Be Achieved without Trading Abroad? 
Abstract:
 We examine whether portfolios of domestically traded securities can mimic
 foreign indices so that investment in assets that trade only abroad is not
 necessary to exhaust the gains from international diversification. We use
 monthly data from 1976 to 1993 for seven developed and nine emerging
 markets. Return correlations, mean-variance spanning, and Sharpe ratio
 test results provide strong evidence that gains beyond those attainable
 through home-made diversification have become statistically and
 economically insignificant. Finally, we show that the incremental gains
 from international diversification beyond home-made diversification
 portfolios have diminished over time in a way consistent with changes in
 investment barriers. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: The Dynamics of Discrete Bid and Ask Quotes 
Abstract:
 This paper presents an empirical microstructure model of bid and ask
 quotes that features discreteness, random costs of market making, and ARCH
 volatility effects. Applied to intraday quotes at 15-minute intervals for
 Alcoa (a randomly chosen Dow stock), the results show that quote exposure
 costs contain stochastic components that are persistent and large relative
 to the deterministic intraday "U" components. Analysis of the filtered
 estimates of the system suggest that bid and ask costs contain common
 components, and that these costs reflect risk as proxied by ARCH variance
 forecasts. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: A Unified Theory of Underreaction, Momentum Trading, and Overreaction in Asset Markets 
Abstract:
 We model a market populated by two groups of boundedly rational agents:
 "newswatchers" and "momentum traders." Each newswatcher observes some
 private information, but fails to extract other newswatchers' information
 from prices. If information diffuses gradually across the population,
 prices underreact in the short run. The underreaction means that the
 momentum traders can profit by trend-chasing. However, if they can only
 implement simple (i.e., univariate) strategies, their attempts at
 arbitrage must inevitably lead to overreaction at long horizons. In
 addition to providing a unified account of under- and overreactions, the
 model generates several other distinctive implications. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Bank Deposit Rate Clustering: Theory and Empirical Evidence 
Abstract:
 Like security prices, retail deposit interest rates cluster around
 integers and "even" fractions. However, explanations for security price
 clustering are incompatible with deposit rate clustering. A theory based
 on the limited recall of retail depositors is proposed. It predicts that
 banks tend to set rates at integers and that rates are "sticky" at these
 levels. The propensity for integer rates increases with the level of
 wholesale interest rates and deposit market concentration. When banks set
 noninteger rates, rates are more likely to be just above, rather than just
 below, integers. The paper finds substantial empirical support for the
 theory's implications. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: International Evidence on the Value of Corporate Diversification 
Abstract:
 The valuation effect of diversification is examined for large samples of
 firms in Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom for 1992 and 1994. We find
 no significant diversification discount in Germany, but a significant
 diversification discount of 10 percent in Japan and 15 percent in the U.K.
 Concentrated ownership in the hands of insiders enhances the valuation
 effect of diversification in Germany, but not in Japan or the U.K. For
 Japan, only firms with strong links to an industrial group have a
 diversification discount. These findings suggest that international
 differences in corporate governance affect the impact of diversification
 on shareholder wealth. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Tax Incentives to Hedge 
Abstract:
 For corporations facing tax-function convexity, hedging lowers expected
 tax liabilities, thereby providing an incentive to hedge. We use
 simulation methods to investigate convexity induced by tax-code
 provisions. On average, the tax function is convex (although in
 approximately 25 percent of cases it is concave). Carrybacks and
 carryforwards increase the range of income with incentives to hedge; other
 tax-code provisions have minor impacts. Among firms facing convex tax
 functions, average tax savings from a five percent reduction in the
 volatility of taxable income are about 5.4 percent of expected tax
 liabilities; in extreme cases, these savings exceed 40 percent. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Herding and Feedback Trading by Institutional and Individual Investors 
Abstract:
 We document strong positive correlation between changes in institutional
 ownership and returns measured over the same period. The result suggests
 that either institutional investors positive-feedback trade more than
 individual investors or institutional herding impacts prices more than
 herding by individual investors. We find evidence that both factors play a
 role in explaining the relation. We find no evidence, however, of return
 mean-reversion in the year following large changes in institutional
 ownership-stocks institutional investors purchase subsequently outperform
 those they sell. Moreover, institutional herding is positively correlated
 with lag returns and appears to be related to stock return momentum. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: The Impact of Trader Type on the Futures Volatility-Volume Relation 
Abstract:
 We examine the volatility-volume relation in futures markets using volume
 data categorized by type of trader. We find that the positive
 volatility-volume relation is driven by the general public, a group of
 traders who are distant from the trading floor and therefore without
 precise information on order flow. Clearing members and floor traders who
 observe order flow often decrease volatility. Our findings are consistent
 with Shalen's (1993) hypothesis that uninformed traders who cannot
 differentiate liquidity demand from fundamental value change increase
 volatility. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: Call Options, Points, and Dominance Restrictions on Debt Contracts 
Abstract:
 We analyze the impact of a contract's length, callability, amortization,
 and original discount by arbitrage methods. Among instruments that are
 callable without penalty, longer instruments command a higher interest
 rate because the borrower possesses the option of repaying relatively more
 slowly. However, the rate on longer self-amortizing loans cannot be
 substantially larger than for shorter ones because the payments decrease
 with contract length. Bounds on the trade-off between points and rate for
 callable debt are characterized using the trade-off for noncallable debt
 and the property that the value of the prepayment option increases with
 the loan's interest rate. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: The Stochastic Volatility of Short-Term Interest Rates: Some International Evidence 
Abstract:
 This paper estimates a stochastic volatility model of short-term riskless
 interest rate dynamics. Estimated interest rate dynamics are broadly
 similar across a number of countries and reliable evidence of stochastic
 volatility is found throughout. In contrast to stock returns, interest
 rate volatility exhibits faster mean-reverting behavior and innovations in
 interest rate volatility are negligibly correlated with innovations in
 interest rates. The less persistent behavior of interest rate volatility
 reflects the fact that interest rate dynamics are impacted by transient
 economic shocks such as central bank announcements and other macroeconomic
 news. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.

Title: The Delisting Bias in CRSP's Nasdaq Data and Its Implications for the Size Effect 
Abstract:
 We investigate the bias in CRSP's Nasdaq data due to missing returns for
 delisted stocks. We find that the missing returns are large and negative
 on average, and that delisted stocks experience a substantial decrease in
 liquidity. We estimate that using a corrected return of  - 55 percent for
 missing performance-related delisting returns corrects the bias. We
 revisit previous work which finds a size effect among Nasdaq stocks. After
 correcting for the delisting bias, there is no evidence that there ever
 was a size effect on Nasdaq. Our results are inconsistent with most
 risk-based explanations of the size effect. Copyright The American Finance Association 1999.
