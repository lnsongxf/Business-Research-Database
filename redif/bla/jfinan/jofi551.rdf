Title: Agency Problems and Dividend Policies around the World 
Abstract:
 This paper outlines and tests two agency models of dividends. According to
 the "outcome model," dividends are paid because minority shareholders
 pressure corporate insiders to disgorge cash. According to the "substitute
 model," insiders interested in issuing equity in the future pay dividends
 to establish a reputation for decent treatment of minority shareholders.
 The first model predicts that stronger minority shareholder rights should
 be associated with higher dividend payouts; the second model predicts the
 opposite. Tests on a cross section of 4,000 companies from 33 countries
 with different levels of minority shareholder rights support the outcome
 agency model of dividends. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: The Cost of Diversity: The Diversification Discount and Inefficient Investment 
Abstract:
 We model the distortions that internal power struggles can generate in the
 allocation of resources between divisions of a diversified firm. The model
 predicts that if divisions are similar in the level of their resources and
 opportunities, funds will be transferred from divisions with poor
 opportunities to divisions with good opportunities. When diversity in
 resources and opportunities increases, however, resources can flow toward
 the most inefficient division, leading to more inefficient investment and
 less valuable firms. We test these predictions on a panel of diversified
 U.S. firms during the period from 1980 to 1993 and find evidence
 consistent with them. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Agency Costs and Ownership Structure 
Abstract:
 We provide measures of absolute and relative equity agency costs for
 corporations under different ownership and management structures. Our base
 case is Jensen and Meckling's (1976) zero agency-cost firm, where the
 manager is the firm's sole shareholder. We utilize a sample of 1,708 small
 corporations from the FRB/NSSBF database and find that agency costs (i)
 are significantly higher when an outsider rather than an insider manages
 the firm; (ii) are inversely related to the manager's ownership share;
 (iii) increase with the number of nonmanager shareholders, and (iv) to a
 lesser extent, are lower with greater monitoring by banks. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Financing Policy, Basis Risk, and Corporate Hedging: Evidence from Oil and Gas Producers 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the hedging policies of oil and gas producers between
 1992 and 1994. My evidence shows that the extent of hedging is related to
 financing costs. In particular, companies with greater financial leverage
 manage price risks more extensively.My evidence also shows that the
 likelihood of hedging is related to economies of scale in hedging costs
 and to the basis risk associated with hedging instruments. Larger
 companies and companies whose production is located primarily in regions
 where prices have a high correlation with the prices on which
 exchange-traded derivatives are based are more likely to manage risks. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: The Exploitation of Relationships in Financial Distress: The Case of Trade Credit 
Abstract:
 This paper develops optimal pricing, lending, and renegotiation strategies
 for companies in relationships where one firm is highly dependent on the
 other. Long-term trade-creditor firm relationships induce dependent trade
 creditors to grant more concessions in debt renegotiations than
 nondependent creditors. Anticipating these larger renegotiation
 concessions, not only do less financially stable firms prefer trade
 credit, but all firms agree to pay a higher interest rate for trade
 credit. The model also explains the existence of "teaser" interest rates
 and convenience classes. Findings are consistent with those of the
 relationship-lending literature. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Portfolio Selection and Asset Pricing Models 
Abstract:
 Finance theory can be used to form informative prior beliefs in financial
 decision making. This paper approaches portfolio selection in a Bayesian
 framework that incorporates a prior degree of belief in an asset pricing
 model. Sample evidence on home bias and value and size effects is
 evaluated from an asset-allocation perspective. U.S. investors' belief in
 the domestic CAPM must be very strong to justify the home bias observed in
 their equity holdings. The same strong prior belief results in large and
 stable optimal positions in the Fama-French book-to-market portfolio in
 combination with the market since the 1940s. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Investing for the Long Run when Returns Are Predictable 
Abstract:
 We examine how the evidence of predictability in asset returns affects
 optimal portfolio choice for investors with long horizons. Particular
 attention is paid to estimation risk, or uncertainty about the true values
 of model parameters. We find that even after incorporating parameter
 uncertainty, there is enough predictability in returns to make investors
 allocate substantially more to stocks, the longer their horizon. Moreover,
 the weak statistical significance of the evidence for predictability makes
 it important to take estimation risk into account; a long-horizon investor
 who ignores it may overallocate to stocks by a sizeable amount. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Bad News Travels Slowly: Size, Analyst Coverage, and the Profitability of Momentum Strategies 
Abstract:
 Various theories have been proposed to explain momentum in stock returns.
 We test the gradual-information-diffusion model of Hong and Stein (1999)
 and establish three key results. First, once one moves past the very
 smallest stocks, the profitability of momentum strategies declines sharply
 with firm size. Second, holding size fixed, momentum strategies work
 better among stocks with low analyst coverage. Finally, the effect of
 analyst coverage is greater for stocks that are past losers than for past
 winners. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that
 firm-specific information, especially negative information, diffuses only
 gradually across the investing public. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Trading and Returns under Periodic Market Closures 
Abstract:
 This paper studies how market closures affect investors' trading policies
 and the resulting return-generating process. It shows that closures
 generate rich patterns of time variation in trading and returns, including
 those consistent with empirical findings: (1) U-shaped patterns in the
 mean and volatility of returns over trading periods, (2) higher trading
 activity around the close and open, (3) more volatile open-to-open returns
 than close-to-close returns, (4) higher returns over trading periods than
 over nontrading periods, (5) more volatile returns over trading periods
 than over nontrading periods. It also shows that closures can make prices
 more informative about future payoffs. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Is the Short Rate Drift Actually Nonlinear? 
Abstract:
 Aït-Sahalia (1996) and Stanton (1997) use nonparametric estimators applied
 to short-term interest rate data to conclude that the drift function
 contains important nonlinearities. We study the finite-sample properties
 of their estimators by applying them to simulated sample paths of a
 square-root diffusion. Although the drift function is linear, both
 estimators suggest nonlinearities of the type and magnitude reported in
 Aït-Sahalia (1996) and Stanton (1997). Combined with the results of a
 weighted least squares estimator, this evidence implies that nonlinearity
 of the short rate drift is not a robust stylized fact. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Sorting Out Sorts 
Abstract:
 In this paper we analyze the theoretical implications of sorting data into
 groups and then running asset pricing tests within each group. We show
 that the way this procedure is implemented introduces a bias in favor of
 rejecting the model under consideration. By simply picking enough groups
 to sort into, the true asset pricing model can be shown to have no
 explanatory power within each group. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Stock Splits, Tick Size, and Sponsorship 
Abstract:
 A traditional explanation for stock splits is that they increase the
 number of small shareholders who own the stock. A possible reason for the
 increase is that the minimum bid-ask spread is wider after a split and
 brokers have more incentive to promote a stock. I document a large number
 of small buy orders following Nasdaq and NYSE/AMEX splits during 1993 to
 1994. I also find strong evidence that trading costs increase, and weak
 evidence that costs of market making decline following splits. This is
 consistent with splits acting as an incentive to brokers to promote
 stocks. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Effectiveness of Capital Regulation at U.S. Commercial Banks, 1985 to 1994 
Abstract:
 Unless priced and administered appropriately, a governmental safety net
 enhances risk-shifting opportunities for banks. This paper quantifies
 regulatory efforts to use capital requirements to control risk-shifting by
 U.S. banks during 1985 to 1994 and investigates how much risk-based
 capital requirements and other deposit-insurance reforms improved this
 control. We find that capital discipline did not prevent large banks from
 shifting risk onto the safety net. Banks with low capital and
 debt-to-deposits ratios overcame outside discipline better than other
 banks. Mandates introduced by 1991 legislation have improved but did not
 establish full regulatory control over bank risk-shifting incentives. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

 This study provides evidence that highly leveraged owner-managed

Title: The Effect of Options on Stock Prices: 1973 to 1995 
Abstract:
 I show that the effect of option introductions on underlying stock prices
 is best described by a two-regime switching means model whose optimal
 switch date occurs in 1981. In accordance with previous studies, I find
 positive abnormal returns for options listed during 1973 to 1980. By
 contrast, I find negative abnormal returns for options listed in 1981 and
 later. Possible causes for this switch include the introduction of index
 options in 1982, the implementation  of regulatory changes in 1981, and
 the possibility that options expedite the dissemination of negative
 information. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.
