Title: Stock Market Liberalization, Economic Reform, and Emerging Market Equity Prices 
Abstract:
 A stock market liberalization is a decision by a country's government to
 allow foreigners to purchase shares in that country's stock market. On
 average, a country's aggregate equity price index experiences abnormal
 returns of 3.3 percent per month in real dollar terms during an
 eight-month window leading up to the implementation of its initial stock
 market liberalization. This result is consistent with the prediction of
 standard international asset pricing models that stock market
 liberalization may reduce the liberalizing country's cost of equity
 capital by allowing for risk sharing between domestic and foreign agents. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Foreign Speculators and Emerging Equity Markets 
Abstract:
 We propose a cross-sectional time-series model to assess the impact of
 market liberalizations in emerging equity markets on the cost of capital,
 volatility, beta, and correlation with world market returns.
 Liberalizations are defined by regulatory changes, the introduction of
 depositary receipts and country funds, and structural breaks in equity
 capital flows to the emerging markets. We control for other economic
 events that might confound the impact of foreign speculators on local
 equity markets. Across a range of specifications, the cost of capital
 always decreases after a capital market liberalization with the effect
 varying between 5 and 75 basis points. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Going Public without Governance: Managerial Reputation Effects 
Abstract:
 This paper addresses the agency problem between controlling shareholders
 and minority shareholders. This problem is common among public firms in
 many countries where the legal system does not effectively protect
 minority shareholders against oppression by controlling shareholders. We
 show that even without any explicit corporate governance mechanisms
 protecting minority shareholders, controlling shareholders can implicitly
 commit not to expropriate them. Stock prices of such companies are
 significantly higher and firms are more likely go public because of this
 reputation effect. Moreover, insiders divest shares gradually over time,
 at a rate that is negatively related to the degree of moral hazard. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Agency Conflicts in Public and Negotiated Transfers of Corporate Control 
Abstract:
 We analyze control transfers in firms with a dominant minority blockholder
 and otherwise dispersed owners, and show that the transaction mode is
 important. Negotiated block trades preserve a low level of ownership
 concentration, inducing more inefficient extraction of private benefits.
 In contrast, public acquisitions increase ownership concentration,
 resulting in fewer private benefits and higher firm value. Within our
 model, the incumbent and new controlling party prefer to trade the block
 because of the dispersed shareholders' free-riding behavior. We also
 explore the regulatory implications of this agency problem and its impact
 on the terms of block trades. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Can Relationship Banking Survive Competition? 
Abstract:
 How will banks evolve as competition increases from other banks and from
 the capital market? Will banks become more like capital market
 underwriters and offer passive transaction loans or return to their roots
 as relationship lending experts? These are the questions we address. Our
 key result is that as interbank competition increases, banks make "more"
 relationship loans, but each has lower added value for borrowers. Capital
 market competition "reduces" relationship lending (and bank lending
 shrinks), but each relationship loan has greater added value for
 borrowers. In both cases, welfare increases for some borrowers but not
 necessarily for all. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Some Evidence on the Uniqueness of Initial Public Debt Offerings 
Abstract:
 Debt initial public offerings (IPOs) represent a major shift in a firm's
 financing policy by both extending debt maturity and altering the
 public-private debt mix. In contrast to findings for seasoned debt
 offerings, we document a significantly negative stock price response to
 debt IPO announcements. This result is consistent with debt maturity and
 debt ownership structure theories. The equity wealth effect is negatively
 related to the offer's maturity, and positively related to the degree of
 bank monitoring. We find that firms with less information asymmetry and
 firms with higher growth opportunities experience a less adverse stock
 price response. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Mean Reversion across National Stock Markets and Parametric Contrarian Investment Strategies 
Abstract:
 For U.S. stock prices, evidence of mean reversion over long horizons is
 mixed, possibly due to lack of a reliable long time series. Using
 additional cross-sectional power gained from national stock index data of
 18 countries during the period 1969 to 1996, we find strong evidence of
 mean reversion in relative stock index prices. Our findings imply a
 significantly positive speed of reversion with a half-life of three to
 three and one-half years. This result is robust to alternative
 specifications and data. Parametric contrarian investment strategies that
 fully exploit mean reversion across national indexes outperform
 buy-and-hold and standard contrarian strategies. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Trading Is Hazardous to Your Wealth: The Common Stock Investment Performance of Individual Investors 
Abstract:
 Individual investors who hold common stocks directly pay a tremendous
 performance penalty for active trading. Of 66,465 households with accounts
 at a large discount broker during 1991 to 1996, those that trade most earn
 an annual return of 11.4 percent, while the market returns 17.9 percent.
 The average household earns an annual return of 16.4 percent, tilts its
 common stock investment toward high-beta, small, value stocks, and turns
 over 75 percent of its portfolio annually. Overconfidence can explain high
 trading levels and the resulting poor performance of individual investors.
 Our central message is that trading is hazardous to your wealth. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: How Does Information Quality Affect Stock Returns? 
Abstract:
 Using a simple dynamic asset pricing model, this paper investigates the
 relationship between the precision of public information about economic
 growth and stock market returns. After fully characterizing expected
 returns and conditional volatility, I show that (i) higher precision of
 signals tends to increase the risk premium, (ii) when signals are
 imprecise the equity premium is "bounded above" independently of
 investors' risk aversion, (iii) return volatility is U-shaped with respect
 to investors' risk aversion, and (iv) the relationship between conditional
 expected returns and conditional variance is ambiguous. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Option Prices, Implied Price Processes, and Stochastic Volatility 
Abstract:
 This paper characterizes all continuous price processes that are
 consistent with current option prices. This extends Derman and Kani
 (1994), Dupire (1994, 1997), and Rubinstein (1994), who only consider
 processes with deterministic volatility. Our characterization implies a
 volatility forecast that does not require a specific model, only current
 option prices. We show how arbitrary volatility processes can be adjusted
 to fit current option prices exactly, just as interest rate processes can
 be adjusted to fit bond prices exactly. The procedure works with many
 volatility models, is fast to calibrate, and can price exotic options
 efficiently using familiar lattice techniques. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Is Group Affiliation Profitable in Emerging Markets? An Analysis of Diversified Indian Business Groups 
Abstract:
 Emerging markets like India have poorly functioning institutions, leading
 to severe agency and information problems. Business groups in these
 markets have the potential both to offer benefits to member firms, and to
 destroy value. We analyze the performance of affiliates of diversified
 Indian business groups relative to unaffiliated firms. We find that
 accounting and stock market measures of firm performance initially decline
 with group diversification and subsequently increase once group
 diversification exceeds a certain level. Unlike U.S. conglomerates' lines
 of business, and similar to the affiliates of U.S. LBO associations,
 affiliates of the most diversified business groups outperform unaffiliated
 firms. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Demand Curves for Stocks "Do "Slope Down: New Evidence from an Index Weights Adjustment 
Abstract:
 Weights in the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 index are determined by the
 market values of the included stocks' public floats. In November 1996, the
 exchange implemented a previously announced revision of its definition of
 the public float. This revision, which increased the floats and the index
 weights of 31 stocks, conveyed no information and had no effect on the
 legal duties of shareholders. Affected stocks experienced statistically
 significant excess returns of 2.3 percent during the event week, and no
 price reversal occurred as trading volume returned to normal levels. These
 findings support downward sloping demand curves for stocks. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Trading Volume and Cross-Autocorrelations in Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper finds that trading volume is a significant determinant of the
 lead-lag patterns observed in stock returns. Daily and weekly returns on
 high volume portfolios lead returns on low volume portfolios, controlling
 for firm size. Nonsynchronous trading or low volume portfolio
 autocorrelations cannot explain these findings. These patterns arise
 because returns on low volume portfolios respond more slowly to
 information in market returns. The speed of adjustment of individual
 stocks confirms these findings. Overall, the results indicate that
 differential speed of adjustment to information is a significant source of
 the cross-autocorrelation patterns in short-horizon stock returns. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Truth in Mutual Fund Advertising: Evidence on Future Performance and Fund Flows 
Abstract:
 We examine a sample of 294 mutual funds that are advertised in "Barron's"
 or "Money" magazine. The preadvertisement performance of these funds is
 significantly higher than that of the benchmarks. We test whether the
 sponsors select funds to signal continued superior performance or they use
 the past superior performance to attract more money into the funds. Our
 analysis shows that there is no superior performance in the
 postadvertisement period. Thus, the results do not support the signaling
 hypothesis. On the other hand, we find that the advertised funds attract
 significantly more money in comparison with a group of control funds. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: A Model of Returns and Trading in Futures Markets 
Abstract:
 This paper develops an equilibrium model of a competitive futures market
 in which investors trade to hedge positions and to speculate on their
 private information. Equilibrium return and trading patterns are examined.
 (1) In markets where the information asymmetry among investors is small,
 the return volatility of a futures contract decreases with
 time-to-maturity (i.e., the Samuelson effect holds). (2) However, in
 markets where the information asymmetry among investors is large, the
 Samuelson effect need not hold. (3) Additionally, the model generates rich
 time-to-maturity patterns in open interest and spot price volatility that
 are consistent with empirical findings. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.
