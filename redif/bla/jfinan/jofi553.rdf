Title: Outside Equity 
Abstract:
 Equity financing is modeled when cash flows and asset values are not
 verifiable. Investors have enforceable property rights to the firm's
 assets, but cannot prevent insiders (managers or entrepreneurs) from
 capturing cash flow. Insiders must coinvest and pay in each period a
 dividend sufficient to ensure outside investors' participation for at
 least one more period. Intervention by the investors must be limited by an
 agreement with insiders or by costs of collective action. Basic models are
 extended to show why firms go public and why agency costs necessarily
 arise when the act of investment is not immediately verifiable. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: When the Underwriter Is the Market Maker: An Examination of Trading in the IPO Aftermarket 
Abstract:
 This paper examines aftermarket trading of underwriters and unaffiliated
 market makers in the three-month period after an IPO. We find that the
 lead underwriter is always the dominant market maker; he takes substantial
 inventory positions in the aftermarket trading, and co-managers play a
 negligible role in aftermarket trading. The lead underwriter engages in
 stabilization activity for less successful IPOs, and uses the
 overallotment option to reduce his inventory risk. Compensation to the
 underwriter arises primarily from fees, but aftermarket trading does
 generate positive profits, which are positively related to the degree of
 underpricing. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Stabilization Activities by Underwriters after Initial Public Offerings 
Abstract:
 Prior research has assumed that underwriters post a stabilizing bid in the
 aftermarket. We find instead that aftermarket activities are less
 transparent and include stimulating demand through short covering and
 restricting supply by penalizing the flipping of shares. In more than half
 of IPOs, a short position of an average 10.75 percent of shares offered is
 covered in 22 transactions over 16.6 days in the aftermarket, resulting in
 a loss of 3.61 percent of underwriting fees. Underwriters manage price
 support activities by using a combination of aftermarket short covering,
 penalty bids, and the selective use of the overallotment option. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: The Seven Percent Solution 
Abstract:
 Gross spreads received by underwriters on initial public offerings (IPOs)
 in the United States are much higher than in other countries. Furthermore,
 in recent years more than 90 percent of deals raising $20-80 million have
 spreads of exactly seven percent, three times the proportion of a decade
 earlier. Investment bankers readily admit that the IPO business is very
 profitable, and that they avoid competing on fees because they 'don't want
 to turn it into a commodity business.' We examine several features of the
 IPO underwriting business that result in a market structure where spreads
 are high. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Multiple versus Single Banking Relationships: Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
 A theory of the optimal number of banking relationships is developed and
 tested using matched bank-firm data. According to the theory, relationship
 banks may be unable to continue funding profitable projects owing to
 internal problems and a firm may thus have to refinance from
 nonrelationship banks. The latter, however, face an adverse selection
 problem, as they do not know the quality of the project, and may refuse to
 lend. In these circumstances, multiple banking can reduce the probability
 of an early liquidation of the project. The empirical evidence supports
 the predictions of the model. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Portfolio Choice and Asset Prices: The Importance of Entrepreneurial Risk 
Abstract:
 Using cross-sectional data from the SCF and Tax Model, we show that
 entrepreneurial income risk has a significant influence on portfolio
 choice and asset prices. We find that households with high and variable
 business income hold less wealth in stocks than other similarly wealthy
 households, although they constitute a significant fraction of the
 stockholding population. Similarly for nonentrepreneurs, holding stock in
 the firm where one works reduces the portfolio share of other common
 stocks. Finally, we show that adding proprietary income to a linear asset
 pricing model improves its performance over a similar model that includes
 only wage income. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: A Test of the Relative Pricing Effects of Dividends and Earnings: Evidence from Simultaneous Announcements in Japan 
Abstract:
 We study the pricing effects of dividend and earnings announcements by
 taking advantage of the unique setting in Japan where managers
 simultaneously announce the current year's dividends and earnings as well
 as forecasts of next year's dividends and earnings. Defining surprises as
 deviations from analysts' forecasts, we find that share price reactions
 are significantly affected by earnings surprises, especially management
 forecasts of next year's earnings. The information content of dividends is
 marginal and is restricted to announcements of next year's dividends.
 Consistent with Modigliani and Miller's dividend irrelevance proposition,
 current dividend surprises have no material impact on stock prices in
 Japan. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Firm Size and Cyclical Variations in Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 Recent imperfect capital market theories predict the presence of
 asymmetries in the variation of small and large firms' risk over the
 economic cycle. Small firms with little collateral should be more strongly
 affected by tighter credit market conditions in a recession state than
 large, better collateralized ones. This paper adopts a flexible
 econometric model to analyze these mplications empirically. Consistent
 with theory, small firms display the highest degree of asymmetry in their
 risk across recession and expansion states, which translates into a higher
 sensitivity of their expected stock returns with respect to variables that
 measure credit market conditions. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Conditional Skewness in Asset Pricing Tests 
Abstract:
 If asset returns have systematic skewness, expected returns should include
 rewards for accepting this risk. We formalize this intuition with an asset
 pricing model that incorporates conditional skewness. Our results show
 that conditional skewness helps explain the cross-sectional variation of
 expected returns across assets and is significant even when factors based
 on size and book-to-market are included. Systematic skewness is
 economically important and commands a risk premium, on average, of 3.60
 percent per year. Our results suggest that the momentum effect is related
 to systematic skewness. The low expected return momentum portfolios have
 higher skewness than high expected return portfolios. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Equilibrium Forward Curves for Commodities 
Abstract:
 We develop an equilibrium model of the term structure of forward prices
 for storable commodities. As a consequence of a nonnegativity constraint
 on inventory, the spot commodity has an embedded timing option that is
 absent in forward contracts. This option's value changes over time due to
 both endogenous inventory and exogenous transitory shocks to supply and
 demand. Our model makes predictions about volatilities of forward prices
 at different horizons and shows how conditional violations of the
 'Samuelson effect' occur. We extend the model to incorporate a permanent
 second factor and calibrate the model to crude oil futures data. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Price Discovery without Trading: Evidence from the Nasdaq Preopening 
Abstract:
 This paper studies Nasdaq market makers' activities during the one and
 one-half hour preopening period. Price discovery during the preopening is
 conducted via price signaling as opposed to the auction used to open the
 NYSE or the continuous market used during trading. In the absence of
 trades, Nasdaq dealers use crossed and locked inside quotes to signal to
 other market makers which direction the price should move. Furthermore, we
 find evidence of price leadership among market makers that bears little
 resemblance to their IPO\SEO lead underwriter participation. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Taking Stock: Equity-Based Compensation and the Evolution of Managerial Ownership 
Abstract:
 We investigate the impact of stock-based compensation on managerial
 ownership. We find that equity compensation succeeds in increasing
 incentives of lower-ownership managers, but higher-ownership managers
 negate much of its impact by selling previously owned shares. When
 executives exercise options to acquire stock, nearly all of the shares are
 sold. Our results illuminate dynamic aspects of managerial ownership
 arising from divergent goals of boards of directors, who use equity
 compensation for incentives, and managers, who respond by selling shares
 for diversification. The findings cast doubt on the frequent and important
 theoretical assumption that managers cannot hedge the risks of these
 awards. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Fund Advisor Compensation in Closed-End Funds 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the relation between the premium on closed-end funds
 and organizational features of the funds and advisors, including the
 compensation scheme of the investment advisor. We find that the fund
 premium is larger when: (a) the advisor's compensation is more sensitive
 to fund performance; (b) the assets managed by the advisor are
 concentrated in the fund in question; (c) the advisor manages "other"
 funds with low compensation sensitivity to performance and with low
 concentration of assets managed by the advisor; and (d) the advisor's
 compensation contract evaluates performance relative to a benchmark. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Financial Innovation and the Role of Derivative Securities: An Empirical Analysis of the Treasury STRIPS Program 
Abstract:
 The role that financial innovation plays in financial markets is very
 controversial. To provide insight into this role, we examine how market
 participants use the highly successful Treasury STRIPS program. We find
 that investors use the option to create Treasury-derivative STRIPS
 primarily to make markets more complete and take advantage of tax and
 accounting asymmetries. Although liquidity-related factors help explain
 differences in the prices of Treasury bonds and STRIPS, we find little
 evidence that the option to strip and reconstitute securities is used for
 speculative or arbitrage-related purposes. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Hedging Pressure Effects in Futures Markets 
Abstract:
 We present a simple model implying that futures risk premia depend on both
 own-market and cross-market hedging pressures. Empirical evidence from 20
 futures markets, divided into four groups (financial, agricultural,
 mineral, and currency) indicates that, after controlling for systematic
 risk, both the futures own hedging pressure and cross-hedging pressures
 from within the group significantly affect futures returns. These effects
 remain significant after controlling for a measure of price pressure.
 Finally, we show that hedging pressure also contains explanatory power for
 returns on the underlying asset, as predicted by the model. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: An Analysis of Finance Journal Impact Factors 
Abstract:
 This paper provides an analysis of the citation counts of articles
 published in the leading finance journals. It identifies the determinants
 of the most prevalent measure of influence for finance journals, the
 Social Sciences Citation Index impact factors. It finds that impact
 factors are affected by citations outside the finance field, are not
 affected by the distribution of published articles across subfields, and
 are good predictors of the long-term citation counts of articles. The
 citation impact factors are reduced for both the "Journal of Financial
 Economics" and "The Journal of Finance" by their publication of other than
 regular articles. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.
