Title: Presidential Address: Friction 
Abstract:
 The sources of trading friction are studied, and simple, robust empirical
 measures of friction are provided. Seven distinct measures of trading
 friction are computed from transactions data for 1,706 NYSE/AMSE stocks
 and 2,184 Nasdaq stocks. The measures provide insights into the magnitude
 of trading costs, the importance of informational versus real frictions,
 and the role of market structure. The degree to which the various measures
 are associated with each other and with trading characteristics of stocks
 is examined. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Asset Pricing at the Millennium 
Abstract:
 This paper surveys the field of asset pricing. The emphasis is on the
 interplay between theory and empirical work and on the trade-off between
 risk and return. Modern research seeks to understand the behavior of the
 stochastic discount factor (SDF) that prices all assets in the economy.
 The behavior of the term structure of real interest rates restricts the
 conditional mean of the SDF, whereas patterns of risk premia restrict its
 conditional volatility and factor structure. Stylized facts about interest
 rates, aggregate stock prices, and cross-sectional patterns in stock
 returns have stimulated new research on optimal portfolio choice,
 intertemporal equilibrium models, and behavioral finance. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Continuous-Time Methods in Finance: A Review and an Assessment 
Abstract:
 I survey and assess the development of continuous-time methods in finance
 during the last 30 years. The subperiod 1969 to 1980 saw a dizzying pace
 of development with seminal ideas in derivatives securities pricing, term
 structure theory, asset pricing, and optimal consumption and portfolio
 choices. During the period 1981 to 1999 the theory has been extended and
 modified to better explain empirical regularities in various subfields of
 finance. This latter subperiod has seen significant progress in
 econometric theory, computational and estimation methods to test and
 implement continuous-time models. Capital market frictions and bargaining
 issues are being increasingly incorporated in continuous-time theory. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: In Search of New Foundations 
Abstract:
 In this paper I argue that corporate finance theory, empirical research,
 practical applications, and policy recommendations are deeply rooted in an
 underlying theory of the firm. I also argue that although the existing
 theories have delivered very important and useful insights, they seem to
 be quite ineffective in helping us cope with the new type of firms that is
 emerging. I outline the characteristics that a new theory of the firm
 should satisfy and how such a theory could change the way we do corporate
 finance, both theoretically and empirically. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Mutual Fund Performance: An Empirical Decomposition into Stock-Picking Talent, Style, Transactions Costs, and Expenses 
Abstract:
 We use a new database to perform a comprehensive analysis of the mutual
 fund industry. We find that funds hold stocks that outperform the market
 by 1.3 percent per year, but their net returns underperform by one
 percent. Of the 2.3 percent difference between these results, 0.7 percent
 is due to the underperformance of nonstock holdings, whereas 1.6 percent
 is due to expenses and transactions costs. Thus, funds pick stocks well
 enough to cover their costs. Also, high-turnover funds beat the Vanguard
 Index 500 fund on a net return basis. Our evidence supports the value of
 active mutual fund management. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Foundations of Technical Analysis: Computational Algorithms, Statistical Inference, and Empirical Implementation 
Abstract:
 Technical analysis, also known as 'charting,' has been a part of financial
 practice for many decades, but this discipline has not received the same
 level of academic scrutiny and acceptance as more traditional approaches
 such as fundamental analysis. One of the main obstacles is the highly
 subjective nature of technical analysis-the presence of geometric shapes
 in historical price charts is often in the eyes of the beholder. In this
 paper, we propose a systematic and automatic approach to technical pattern
 recognition using nonparametric kernel regression, and we apply this
 method to a large number of U.S. stocks from 1962 to 1996 to evaluate the
 effectiveness of technical analysis. By comparing the unconditional
 empirical distribution of daily stock returns to the conditional
 distribution-conditioned on specific technical indicators such as
 head-and-shoulders or double bottoms-we find that over the 31-year sample
 period, several technical indicators do provide incremental information
 and may have some practical value. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Order Flow and Liquidity around NYSE Trading Halts 
Abstract:
 We study order flow and liquidity around NYSE trading halts. We find that
 market and limit order submissions and cancellations increase
 significantly during trading halts, that a large proportion of the limit
 order book at the reopen is composed of orders submitted during the halt,
 and that the market-clearing price at the reopen is a good predictor of
 future prices. Depth near the quotes is unusually low around trading
 halts, though specialists and/or floor traders appear to provide
 additional liquidity at these times. Finally, specialists appear to
 'spread the quote' prior to imbalance halts to convey information to
 market participants. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Corporate Reorganizations and Non-Cash Auctions 
Abstract:
 This paper extends the theory of non-cash auctions by considering the
 revenue and efficiency of using different securities. Research on
 bankruptcy and privatization suggests using non-cash auctions to increase
 cash-constrained bidder participation. We examine this proposal and
 demonstrate that securities may lead to higher revenue. However, bidders
 pool unless bids include debt,which results in possible repossession by
 the seller. This suggests all-equity outcomes are unlikely and explains
 the high debt of reorganized firms. Securities also inefficiently
 determine bidders' incentive contracts and the firm's capital structure.
 Therefore, we recommend a new cash auction for an incentive contract. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.
