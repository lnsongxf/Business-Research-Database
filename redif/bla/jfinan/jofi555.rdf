Title: How Big Are the Tax Benefits of Debt? 
Abstract:
 I integrate under firm-specific benefit functions to estimate that the
 capitalized tax benefit of debt equals 9.7 percent of firm value (or as
 low as 4.3 percent, net of personal taxes). The typical firm could double
 tax benefits by issuing debt until the marginal tax benefit begins to
 decline. I infer how aggressively a firm uses debt by observing the shape
 of its tax benefit function. Paradoxically, large, liquid, profitable
 firms with low expected distress costs use debt conservatively. Product
 market factors, growth options, low asset collateral, and planning for
 future expenditures lead to conservative debt usage. Conservative debt
 policy is persistent. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Specification Analysis of Affine Term Structure Models 
Abstract:
 This paper explores the structural differences and relative
 goodness-of-fits of affine term structure models (ATSMs). Within the
 family of ATSMs there is a trade-off between flexibility in modeling the
 conditional correlations and volatilities of the risk factors. This
 trade-off is formalized by our classification of "N"-factor affine family
 into "N"&plus; 1 non-nested subfamilies of models. Specializing to
 three-factor ATSMs, our analysis suggests, based on theoretical
 considerations and empirical evidence, that some subfamilies of ATSMs are
 better suited than others to explaining historical interest rate behavior. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Inference in Long-Horizon Event Studies: A Bayesian Approach with Application to Initial Public Offerings 
Abstract:
 Statistical inference in long-horizon event studies has been hampered by
 the fact that abnormal returns are neither normally distributed nor
 independent. This study presents a new approach to inference that
 overcomes these difficulties and dominates other popular testing methods.
 I illustrate the use of the methodology by examining the long-horizon
 returns of initial public offerings (IPOs). I find that the Fama and
 French (1993) three-factor model is inconsistent with the observed
 long-horizon price performance of these IPOs, whereas a
 characteristic-based model cannot be rejected. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Price Momentum and Trading Volume 
Abstract:
 This study shows that past trading volume provides an important link
 between 'momentum' and 'value' strategies. Specifically, we find that
 firms with high (low) past turnover ratios exhibit many glamour (value)
 characteristics, earn lower (higher) future returns, and have consistently
 more negative (positive) earnings surprises over the next eight quarters.
 Past trading volume also predicts both the magnitude and persistence of
 price momentum. Specifically, price momentum effects reverse over the next
 five years, and high (low) volume winners (losers) experience faster
 reversals. Collectively, our findings show that past volume helps to
 reconcile intermediate-horizon 'underreaction' and long-horizon
 'overreaction' effects. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Crossing Networks and Dealer Markets: Competition and Performance 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the interaction between dealer markets and a relatively
 new form of exchange, passive crossing networks, where buyers and sellers
 trade directly with one another. We find that the crossing network is
 characterized by both positive ('liquidity') and negative ('crowding')
 externalities, and we analyze the effects of its introduction on the
 dealer market. Traders who use the dealer market as a 'market of last
 resort' can induce dealers to widen their spread and can lead to more
 efficient subsequent prices, but traders who only use the crossing network
 can provide a counterbalancing effect by reducing adverse selection and
 inventory holding costs. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Imperfect Competition among Informed Traders 
Abstract:
 We analyze competition among informed traders in the continuous-time
 Kyle(1985) model, as Foster and Viswanathan (1996) do in discrete time. We
 explicitly describe the unique linear equilibrium when signals are
 imperfectly correlated and confirm the conjecture of Holden and
 Subrahmanyam (1992) that there is no linear equilibrium when signals are
 perfectly correlated. One result is that at some date, and at all dates
 thereafter, the market would have been more informationally efficient had
 there been a monopolist informed trader instead of competing traders. The
 relatively large amount of private information remaining near the end of
 trading causes the market to approach complete illiquidity. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Monitoring and Structure of Debt Contracts 
Abstract:
 This paper presents a theory of optimal debt structure when the moral
 hazard problem is severe. The main idea is that the optimal debt contract
 delegates monitoring to a single senior lender and that seniority allows
 the monitoring  senior lender to appropriate the full return from his
 monitoring activities. The theory explains (i) why debt contracts are
 prioritized, (ii) why short-term debt is senior to long-term debt, and
 (iii) why financial intermediaries usually hold short-term senior debt
 whereas long-term junior debt is widely held. Another implication of the
 theory is that covenant and maturity structures will be set to conform to
 the seniority structure. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: The Effect of Bank Relations on Investment Decisions: An Investigation of Japanese Takeover Bids 
Abstract:
 We study 154 domestic mergers in Japan during 1977 to 1993. In contrast to
 U.S. evidence, mergers are viewed favorably by investors of acquiring
 firms. We document a two-day acquirer abnormal return of 1.2 percent and a
 mean cumulative abnormal return of 5.4 percent for the duration of the
 takeover. Announcement returns display a strong positive association with
 the strength of acquirer's relationships with banks. The benefits of bank
 relations appear to be greater for firms with poor investment
 opportunities and when the banking sector is healthy. We conclude that
 close ties with informed creditors, such as banks, facilitate investment
 policies that enhance shareholder wealth. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: The Equity Share in New Issues and Aggregate Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 The share of equity issues in total new equity and debt issues is a strong
 predictor of U.S. stock market returns between 1928 and 1997. In
 particular, firms issue relatively more equity than debt just before
 periods of low market	returns. The equity share in new issues has stable
 predictive power in both halves of the sample period and after controlling
 for other known predictors. We do not find support for efficient market
 explanations of the results. Instead, the fact that the equity share
 sometimes predicts significantly negative market returns suggests
 inefficiency and that firms time the market component of their returns
 when issuing securities. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Order Flow, Transaction Clock, and Normality of Asset Returns 
Abstract:
 The goal of this paper is to show that normality of asset returns can be
 recovered through a stochastic time change. Clark (1973) addressed this
 issue by representing the price process as a subordinated process with
 volume as the lognormally distributed subordinator. We extend Clark's
 results and find the following: (i) stochastic time changes are
 mathematically much less constraining than subordinators; (ii) the
 cumulative number of trades is a better stochastic clock than the volume
 for generating virtually perfect normality in returns; (iii) this clock
 can be modeled nonparametrically, allowing both the time-change and price
 processes to take the form of jump diffusions. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Predictability and Transaction Costs: The Impact on Rebalancing Rules and Behavior 
Abstract:
 Recent papers show that predictability calibrated to U.S. data has a large
 effect on the rebalancing behavior of a multiperiod investor. We find that
 this continues to be true in the presence of realistic transaction costs.
 In particular, predictability causes the no-trade region for the
 risky-asset holding to become state dependent and, on average, wider and
 higher. Predictability also motivates the investor to spend considerably
 more on rebalancing and to rebalance more often. In other results, we find
 that introducing costly liquidation of the risky asset for consumption
 lowers the average allocation to the risky asset, though only marginally
 early in life. Our experiments also vary the nature of the return
 predictability and introduce return heteroskedasticity. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Does Option Compensation Increase Managerial Risk Appetite? 
Abstract:
 This paper solves the dynamic investment problem of a risk averse manager
 compensated with a call option on the assets he controls. Under the
 manager's optimal policy, the option ends up either deep in or deep out of
 the money. As the asset value goes to zero, volatility goes to infinity.
 However, the option compensation does not strictly lead to greater risk
 seeking. Sometimes, the manager's optimal volatility is less with the
 option than it would be if he were trading his own account. Furthermore,
 giving the manager more options causes him to reduce volatility. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: The American Put Option and Its Critical Stock Price 
Abstract:
 We derive an expression for the critical stock price for the American put.
 We start by expressing the put price as an integral involving
 first-passage probabilities. This approach yields intuition for Merton's
 result for the perpetual put. We then consider the finite-lived case.
 Using (1) the fact that the put value ceases to depend on time when the
 critical stock price is reached and (2) the result that an American put
 equals a European put plus an early-exercise premium, we derive the
 critical stock price. We approximate the critical-stock-price function to
 compute accurate put prices. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Time Variation of Ex-Dividend Day Stock Returns and Corporate Dividend Capture: A Reexamination 
Abstract:
 This paper documents some empirical facts about ex-day abnormal returns to
 high dividend yield stocks that are potentially subject to corporate
 dividend capture. We find that average abnormal ex-dividend day returns
 are uniformly negative in each year after the introduction of negotiated
 commission rates and that time variation in ex-day returns during the
 negotiated commission rates era is consistent with corporate tax-based
 dividend capture. Ex-day returns are more negative when the tax advantage
 to corporate dividend capture is greatest and more positive when increases
 in transaction costs and risk reduce incentives to engage in corporate
 tax-based dividend capture. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Stock Repurchases in Canada: Performance and Strategic Trading 
Abstract:
 During the 1980s, U.S. firms announcing stock repurchases earned favorable
 long-run returns. Recently, concerns have been raised over the robustness
 of these findings. This concern comes at a time of explosive growth in
 repurchase  programs. Thus, we study new evidence from the 1990s for 1,060
 Canadian repurchase programs. Moreover, because of Canadian law, we can
 carefully track repurchase activity monthly. Similarly to the situation in
 the United States, the Canadian stock market discounts the information in
 repurchase announcements, particularly for value stocks. Completion rates
 in Canada are sensitive to mispricing. Trades also appear linked to price
 movements; managers buy more shares when prices fall. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Equity Undervaluation and Decisions Related to Repurchase Tender Offers: An Empirical Investigation 
Abstract:
 This paper tests whether managers repurchase stock when their assessment
 of the firm's economic value exceeds the market value. Using the forecasts
 managers would have if they had perfect foresight, we estimate economic
 value using an earnings-based valuation model. The major findings are as
 follows: (1) 74 percent of the firms that repurchase shares via
 fixed-price tender offers are undervalued relative to their
 preannouncement economic value; this percentage is significantly lower for
 a control sample, (2) the tender premium is highly correlated with the
 magnitude of undervaluation, and (3) the decision to satisfy
 oversubscription demand is influenced significantly by the magnitude of
 undervaluation. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.
