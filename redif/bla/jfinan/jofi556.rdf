Title: A Theory of Bank Capital 
Abstract:
 Banks can create liquidity precisely because deposits are fragile and
 prone to runs. Increased uncertainty makes deposits excessively fragile,
 creating a role for outside bank capital. Greater bank capital reduces the
 probability of financial distress but also reduces liquidity creation. The
 quantity of capital influences the amount that banks can induce borrowers
 to pay. Optimal bank capital structure trades off effects on liquidity
 creation, costs of bank  distress, and the ability to force borrower
 repayment. The model explains the decline in bank capital over the last
 two centuries. It identifies overlooked consequences of having regulatory
 capital requirements and deposit insurance. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Time and the Price Impact of a Trade 
Abstract:
 We use Hasbrouck's (1991) vector autoregressive model for prices and
 trades to empirically test and assess the role played by the waiting time
 between consecutive transactions in the process of price formation. We
 find that as the time duration between transactions decreases, the price
 impact of trades, the speed of price adjustment to trade-related
 information, and the positive autocorrelation of signed trades all
 increase. This suggests that times when markets are most active are times
 when there is an increased presence of informed traders; we interpret such
 markets as having reduced liquidity. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: A Theory of Dividends Based on Tax Clienteles 
Abstract:
 This paper explains why some firms prefer to pay dividends rather than
 repurchase shares. When institutional investors are relatively less taxed
 than individual investors, dividends induce "ownership clientele" effects.
 Firms paying dividends attract relatively more institutions, which have a
 relative advantage in detecting high firm quality and in ensuring firms
 are well managed. The theory is consistent with some documented
 regularities, specifically both the presence and stickiness of dividends,
 and offers novel empirical implications, e.g., a prediction that it is the
 tax difference between institutions and retail investors that determines
 dividend payments, not the absolute tax payments. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: The Dark Side of Internal Capital Markets: Divisional Rent-Seeking and Inefficient Investment 
Abstract:
 We develop a two-tiered agency model that shows how rent-seeking behavior
 on the part of division managers can subvert the workings of an internal
 capital market. By rent-seeking, division managers can raise their
 bargaining power and extract greater overall compensation from the CEO.
 And because the CEO is herself an agent of outside investors, this extra
 compensation may take the form not of cash wages, but rather of
 preferential capital budgeting allocations. One interesting feature of our
 model is that it implies a kind of "socialism" in internal capital
 allocation, whereby weaker divisions get subsidized by stronger ones. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Competition on the Nasdaq and the Impact of Recent Market Reforms 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the effect of recent market reforms on the competitive
 structure of the Nasdaq. Our results show that changes in inventory and
 information costs cannot explain the post-reform decrease in bid-ask
 spreads. We interpret this as evidence that the reforms have reduced
 Nasdaq dealers' rents. Additionally, we find that the difference between
 NYSE and Nasdaq spreads have been greatly diminished with the new rules.
 Further, the reforms have resulted in an exit, "ceteris paribus", from the
 industry for market making. Overall, our results provide strong evidence
 that the reforms have improved competition on the Nasdaq. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Hostility in Takeovers: In the Eyes of the Beholder? 
Abstract:
 This paper examines whether hostile takeovers can be distinguished from
 friendly takeovers, empirically, based on accounting and stock performance
 data. Much has been made of this distinction in both the popular and the
 academic literature, where gains from hostile takeovers result from
 replacing incumbent managers and gains from friendly takeovers result from
 strategic synergies. Alternatively, hostility could reflect strategic
 choices made by the bidder or the target. Empirical tests show that most
 deals described as hostile in the press are not distinguishable from
 friendly deals in economic terms, except that hostile transactions involve
 publicity as part of the bargaining process. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Conflicts of Interest and Market Illiquidity in Bankruptcy Auctions: Theory and Tests 
Abstract:
 I develop and estimate a model of cash auction bankruptcy using data on
 205 Swedish firms. The results challenge arguments that cash auctions, as
 compared to reorganizations, are immune to conflicts of interest between
 claimholders but lead to inefficient liquidations. I show that a sale of
 the assets back to incumbent management is a common bankruptcy outcome.
 Sale-backs are more likely when they favor the bank at the expense of
 other creditors. On the other hand, inefficient liquidations are
 frequently avoided through sale-backs when markets are illiquid, that is,
 when industry indebtedness is high and the firm has few nonspecific
 assets. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Depositary Receipts, Country Funds, and the Peso Crash: The Intraday Evidence 
Abstract:
 We study the intraday impact of exchange rate news on emerging market
 American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) and closed-end country funds during
 the 1994 Mexican peso crisis. Peso exchange-rate changes affect prices and
 trading volumes of Latin American equities, and some closed-end fund
 behavior is consistent with "noise trader" theories of small investors.
 However, there is no evidence that peso depreciation triggers a
 significant sell-off of non-Mexican securities or that other non-Mexican
 trading patterns change at times of high peso news flow. Thus, the
 "Tequila Effect" is largely confined to price changes. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Investment Plans and Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 When the discount rate falls, investment should rise. Thus with
 time-varying discount rates and instantly changing investment, investment
 should positively covary with current stock returns and negatively covary
 with future stock returns. Aggregate nonresidential U.S. investment
 contradicts both these implications, probably because of investment lags.
 Investment plans, however, satisfy both implications. These investment
 plans, from a U.S. government survey of firms, are highly informative
 measures of expected investment and explain more than three-quarters of
 the variation in real annual aggregate investment growth. Plans have
 substantial forecasting power for excess stock returns, showing that
 time-varying risk premia affect investment. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Information Asymmetry, R&D, and Insider Gains 
Abstract:
 Although researchers have documented gains from insider trading, the
 sources of private information leading to information asymmetry and
 insider gains have not been comprehensively investigated. We focus on
 research and development (R&D)-an increasingly important yet poorly
 disclosed productive input-as a potential source of insider gains. Our
 findings, for the period from 1985 to 1997 indicate that insider gains in
 R&D-intensive firms are substantially larger than insider gains in firms
 without R&D. Insiders also take advantage of information on planned
 changes in R&D budgets. R&D is thus a major contributor to information
 asymmetry and insider gains, raising issues concerning management
 compensation, incentives, and disclosure policies. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: The Impact of Global Equity Offerings 
Abstract:
 This article examines the impact of U.S. firms issuing equity in multiple
 markets. We compare the stock price reactions to announcements of global
 equity offers to a control group of issues offered exclusively in the
 domestic U.S. market. All else equal, the adverse price reaction that
 typically accompanies equity issuance is reduced by 0.8 percent when some
 shares are sold abroad. The overall evidence suggests global offers are
 effective in expanding demand and reducing the price pressure effects
 associated with share issuance. The beneits of global offers appear to be
 associated with an increase in the number of foreign shareholders. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Corporate Equity Ownership, Strategic Alliances, and Product Market Relationships 
Abstract:
 This paper examines long-term block ownership by corporations and
 performance changes in firms with corporate block owners. We also examine
 potential reasons for corporate ownership including benefits in product
 market relationships, alleviation of financing constraints, and board
 monitoring by corporate owners. We find the largest significant increases
 in targets' stock prices, investment, and operating profitability when
 ownership is combined with alliances, joint ventures, and other product
 market relationships between purchasing and target firms, especially in
 industries with high research and development. Our findings are consistent
 with the conclusion that block ownership by corporations has significant
 benefits in product market relationships. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: The Relation between Stock Market Movements and NYSE Seat Prices 
Abstract:
 Exchange seat prices are widely reported and followed as measures of
 market sentiment. This paper analyzes the information content of NYSE seat
 prices using: (1) annual seat prices from 1869 to 1998, and (2) the
 complete record of trades, bids and offers for the seat market from 1973
 to 1994. Seat market volumes have predictive power regarding future stock
 market returns, consistent with a model where seat market activity is a
 proxy for unobserved factors affecting expected returns. We find
 abnormally large price movements in seats prior to October 1987,
 consistent with the hypothesis that seat prices capture market sentiment. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Reduction of Constraints on Arbitrage Trading and Market Efficiency: An Examination of Ex-Day Returns in Hong Kong after Introduction of Electronic Settlement 
Abstract:
 Previous research documents positive ex-dividend day returns in excess of
 one percent in the unique institutional setting of Hong Kong, where
 neither dividends nor capital gains are taxed. Short-term arbitrage trades
 around the ex-day were hampered by physical settlement procedures. After
 the recent switch to an electronic settlement system, which enables such
 trades, ex-day abnormal returns have declined to an insignificant 0.17
 percent. This drop is more pronounced for high-yield stocks, which are
 more likely to attract dividend capture trading. The evidence points to
 the crucial role of short-term traders in ensuring the pricing efficiency
 of financial markets. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title:  Explaining the Poor Performance of Consumption-based Asset Pricing Models 
Abstract:
 We show that the external habit-formation model economy of Campbell and
 Cochrane (1999) can explain why the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and
 its extensions are betterapproximate asset pricing models than is the
 standard onsumption-based model. The model economy produces time-varying
 expected  eturns, tracked by the dividend-price ratio. Portfolio-based
 models capture some of this variation in state variables, which a
 state-independent function of consumption cannot capture. Therefore,
 though the consumption-based model and CAPM are both perfect "conditional"
 asset pricing models, the portfolio-based models are better approximate
 "unconditional" asset pricing models. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: The Information Value of Bond Ratings 
Abstract:
 We test whether bond ratings contain pricing-relevant information by
 examining security price reactions to Moody's refinement of its rating
 system, which was not accompanied by any fundamental change in issuers'
 risks, was not preceded by any announcement, and was carried
 simultaneously for all bonds. We find that rating information does not
 affect firm value, but that debt value increases (decreases) and equity
 value falls (rises) when Moody's announces better- (worse-) than-expected
 ratings. We also find that when Moody's announces better- (worse-)
 than-expected ratings, the volatilities implied by prices of options on
 the fine-rated issuers' shares decline (rise). Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.

Title: Price Discovery in Initial Public Offerings and the Role of the Lead Underwriter 
Abstract:
 We examine the price discovery process of initial public offerings (IPOs)
 using a unique dataset. The first quote entered by the lead underwriter in
 the five-minute preopening window explains a large proportion of initial
 returns even for hot IPOs. Significant learning and price discovery
 continues to take place during these five minutes with hundreds of quotes
 being entered. The lead underwriter observes the quoting behavior of other
 market makers, particularly the wholesalers, and accordingly revises his
 own quotes. There is a strong positive relationship between initial
 returns and the time of day when trading starts in an IPO. Copyright The American Finance Association 2000.
