Title: Have Individual Stocks Become More Volatile? An Empirical Exploration of Idiosyncratic Risk 
Abstract:
 This paper uses a disaggregated approach to study the volatility of common
 stocks at the market, industry, and firm levels. Over the period from 1962
 to 1997 there has been a noticeable increase in firm-level volatility
 relative to market volatility. Accordingly, correlations among individual
 stocks and the explanatory power of the market model for a typical stock
 have declined, whereas the number of stocks needed to achieve a given
 level of diversification has increased. All the volatility measures move
 together countercyclically and help to predict GDP growth. Market
 volatility tends to lead the other volatility series. Factors that may be
 responsible for these findings are suggested. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Should Investors Avoid All Actively Managed Mutual Funds? A Study in Bayesian Performance Evaluation 
Abstract:
 This paper analyzes mutual-fund performance from an investor's
 perspective. We study the portfolio-choice problem for a mean-variance
 investor choosing among a risk-free asset, index funds, and actively
 managed mutual funds. To solve this problem, we employ a Bayesian method
 of performance evaluation; a key innovation in our approach is the
 development of a flexible set of prior beliefs about managerial skill. We
 then apply our methodology to a sample of 1,437 mutual funds. We find that
 some extremely skeptical prior beliefs nevertheless lead to economically
 significant allocations to active managers. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Capital Structures in Developing Countries 
Abstract:
 This study uses a new data set to assess whether capital structure theory
 is portable across countries with different institutional structures. We
 analyze capital structure choices of firms in 10 developing countries, and
 provide evidence that these decisions are affected by the same variables
 as in developed countries. However, there are persistent differences
 across countries, indicating that specific country factors are at work.
 Our findings suggest that although some of the insights from modern
 finance theory are portable across countries, much remains to be done to
 understand the impact of different institutional features on capital
 structure choices. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Strategic Trading in a Dynamic Noisy Market 
Abstract:
 This paper studies a dynamic model of a financial market with a strategic
 trader. In each period the strategic trader receives a privately observed
 endowment in the stock. He trades with competitive market makers to share
 risk. Noise traders are present in the market. After receiving a stock
 endowment, the strategic trader is shown to reduce his risk exposure
 either by selling at a decreasing rate over time or by selling and then
 buying back some of the shares sold. When the time between trades is
 small, the strategic trader reveals the information regarding his
 endowment very quickly. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: The Long-Run Stock Returns Following Bond Ratings Changes 
Abstract:
 Using essentially all Moody's bond ratings changes between 1970 and 1997,
 we find no reliable abnormal returns following upgrades. However, we find
 negative abnormal returns on the magnitude of 10 to 14 percent in the
 first year following downgrades. Additional results reveal that this
 underperformance is especially pronounced for small, low-credit-quality
 firms. Also, downgrades underperform in nearly all years in the sample,
 and a large part of the abnormal returns occur at subsequent earnings
 announcements. Thus, the evidence suggests that the poor returns result
 from an underreaction to the announcement of downgrades, rather than from
 lower systematic risk. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Learning about Predictability: The Effects of Parameter Uncertainty on Dynamic Asset Allocation 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the effects of uncertainty about the stock return
 predictability on optimal dynamic portfolio choice in a continuous time
 setting for a long-horizon investor. Uncertainty about the predictive
 relation affects the optimal portfolio choice through dynamic learning,
 and leads to a state-dependent relation between the optimal portfolio
 choice and the investment horizon. There is substantial market timing in
 the optimal hedge demands, which is caused by stochastic covariance
 between stock return and dynamic learning. The opportunity cost of
 ignoring predictability or learning is found to be quite substantial. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Explaining the Rate Spread on Corporate Bonds 
Abstract:
 The purpose of this article is to explain the spread between rates on
 corporate and government bonds. We show that expected default accounts for
 a surprisingly small fraction of the premium in corporate rates over
 treasuries. While state taxes explain a substantial portion of the
 difference, the remaining portion of the spread is closely related to the
 factors that we commonly accept as explaining risk premiums for common
 stocks. Both our time series and cross-sectional tests support the
 existence of a risk premium on corporate bonds. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Affine Term Structure Models and the Forward Premium Anomaly 
Abstract:
 One of the most puzzling features of currency prices is the "forward
 premium anomaly": the tendency for high interest rate currencies to
 appreciate. We characterize the anomaly in the context of affine models of
 the term structure of interest rates. In affine models, the anomaly
 requires either that state variables have asymmetric effects on state
 prices in different currencies or that nominal interest rates take on
 negative values with positive probability. We find the quantitative
 properties of either alternative to have important shortcomings. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Variance-ratio Statistics and High-frequency Data: Testing for Changes in Intraday Volatility Patterns 
Abstract:
 Variance-ratio tests are routinely employed to assess the variation in
 return volatility over time and across markets. However, such tests are
 not statistically robust and can be seriously misleading within a
 high-frequency context. We develop improved inference procedures using a
 Fourier Flexible Form regression framework. The practical significance is
 illustrated through tests for changes in the FX intraday volatility
 pattern following the removal of trading restrictions in Tokyo. Contrary
 to earlier evidence, we find nodiscernible changes outside of the Tokyo
 lunch period. We ascribe the difference to the fragile finite-sample
 inference of conventional variance-ratio procedures and a single outlier. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: The Economic Value of Volatility Timing 
Abstract:
 Numerous studies report that standard volatility models have low
 explanatory power, leading some researchers to question whether these
 models have economic value. We examine this question by using conditional
 mean-variance analysis to assess the value of volatility timing to
 short-horizon investors. We find that the volatility timing strategies
 outperform the unconditionally efficient static portfolios that have the
 same target expected return and volatility. This finding is robust to
 estimation risk and transaction costs. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Capital Gains Tax Rules, Tax-loss Trading, and Turn-of-the-year Returns 
Abstract:
 Changes in the capital gains tax rules facing individual investors do not
 affect the incentives for "window dressing" by institutional investors,
 but they can affect the incentives for year-end tax-induced trading by
 individual investors. Empirical evidence for the 1963 to 1996 period
 suggests that when the tax law encouraged taxable investors who accrued
 losses early in the year to realize their losses before year-end, the
 correlation between early year losses and turn-of-the-year returns was
 weaker than when the law did not provide such an early realization
 incentive. These findings suggest that tax-loss trading contributes to
 turn-of-the-year return patterns. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Rationality and Analysts' Forecast Bias 
Abstract:
 This paper proposes and tests a quadratic-loss utility function for
 modeling corporate earnings forecasting, where financial analysts trade
 off bias to improve management access and forecast accuracy. Optimal
 forecasts with minimum expected error are optimistically biased and
 exhibit predictable cross-sectional variation related to analyst and
 company characteristics. Empirical evidence from individual analyst
 forecasts is consistent with the model's predictions. These results
 suggest that positive and predictable bias may be a rational property of
 optimal earnings forecasts. Prior studies using classical notions of
 unbiasedness may have prematurely dismissed analysts' forecasts as being
 irrational or inaccurate. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Contagious Speculation and a Cure for Cancer: A Nonevent that Made Stock Prices Soar 
Abstract:
 A Sunday "New York Times" article on a potential development of new
 cancer-curing drugs caused EntreMed's stock price to rise from 12.063 at
 the Friday close, to open at 85 and close near 52 on Monday. It closed
 above 30 in the three following weeks. The enthusiasm spilled over to
 other biotechnology stocks. The potential breakthrough in cancer research
 already had been reported, however, in the journal "Nature", and in
 various popular newspapers (including the "Times") more than five months
 earlier. Thus, enthusiastic public attention induced a permanent rise in
 share prices, even though no genuinely new information had been presented. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Institutional Trading and Soft Dollars 
Abstract:
 Proprietary data allow us to distinguish between institutional investors'
 orders directed to soft-dollar brokers and those directed to other types
 of brokers. We find that soft-dollar brokers execute smaller orders in
 larger market value stocks. Allowing for differences in order
 characteristics, we estimate the incremental implicit cost of soft-dollar
 execution at 29 (24) basis points for buyer- (seller-) initiated orders.
 For large orders, incremental implicit costs are 41 (30) basis points for
 buys (sells). However, we document substantial variability in these
 estimates, and research services provided by soft-dollar brokers may at
 least partially offset these costs. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.
