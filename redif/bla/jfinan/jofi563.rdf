Title: Consumption, Aggregate Wealth, and Expected Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the role of fluctuations in the aggregate
 consumption-wealth ratio for predicting stock returns. Using U.S.
 quarterly stock market data, we find that these fluctuations in the
 consumption-wealth ratio are strong predictors of both real stock returns
 and excess returns over a Treasury bill rate. We also find that this
 variable is a better forecaster of future returns at short and
 intermediate horizons than is the dividend yield, the dividend payout
 ratio, and several other popular forecasting variables. Why should the
 consumption-wealth ratio forecast  asset returns? We show that a wide
 class of optimal models of consumer behavior imply that the log
 consumption-aggregate wealth (human capital plus asset holdings) ratio
 summarizes expected returns on aggregate wealth, or the market portfolio.
 Although this ratio is not observable, we provide assumptions under which
 its important predictive components for future asset returns may be
 xpressed in terms of observable variables, namely in terms of consumption,
 asset holdings and labor income. The framework implies that these
 variables are cointegrated, and that deviations from this shared trend
 summarize agents' expectations of future returns on the market portfolio. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Underreaction, Overreaction, and Increasing Misreaction to Information in the Options Market 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates options market reaction to changes in the
 instantaneous variance of the underlying asset. There are three main
 findings. First, options market investors underreact to individual daily
 changes in instantaneous variance. Second, these same investors overreact
 to periods of mostly increasing or mostly decreasing daily changes in
 instantaneous variance. Third, they tend to underreact (overreact) to
 current daily changes in instantaneous variance that are preceded mostly
 by daily changes of the opposite (same) sign. The third finding can
 reconcile the first two and is also consistent with well-established
 cognitive biases. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: The High-Volume Return Premium 
Abstract:
 The idea that extreme trading activity contains information about the
 future evolution of stock prices is investigated. We find that stocks
 experiencing unusually high (low) trading volume over a day or a week tend
 to appreciate (depreciate) over the course of the following month. We
 argue that this  "high-volume return premium" is consistent with the idea
 that shocks in the trading activity of a stock affect its visibility, and
 in turn the subsequent demand and price for that stock. Return
 autocorrelations, firm announcements, market risk, and liquidity do not
 seem to explain our results. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Overconfidence, Arbitrage, and Equilibrium Asset Pricing 
Abstract:
 This paper offers a model in which asset prices reflect both covariance
 risk and misperceptions of firms' prospects, and in which arbitrageurs
 trade against mispricing. In equilibrium, expected returns are linearly
 related to both risk and mispricing measures (e.g., fundamental/price
 ratios). With many securities, mispricing of idiosyncratic value
 components diminishes but systematic mispricing does not. The theory
 offers untested empirical implications about volume, volatility,
 fundamental/price ratios, and mean returns, and is consistent with several
 empirical findings. These include the ability of fundamental/price ratios
 and market value to forecast returns, and the domination of beta by these
 variables in some studies. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: The Efficient Use of Conditioning Information in Portfolios  
Abstract:
 We study the properties of unconditional minimum-variance portfolios in
 the presence of conditioning information. Such portfolios attain the
 smallest variance for a given mean among all possible portfolios formed
 using the conditioning information. We provide explicit solutions for "n"
 risky assets, either with or without a riskless asset. Our solutions
 provide insights into portfolio management problems and issues in
 conditional asset pricing. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Expected Option Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper examines expected option returns in the context of mainstream
 asset-pricing theory. Under mild assumptions, expected call returns exceed
 those of the underlying security and increase with the strike price.
 Likewise, expected put returns are below the risk-free rate and increase
 with the strike price. S&P index option returns consistently exhibit these
 characteristics. Under stronger assumptions, expected option returns vary
 linearly with option betas. However, zero-beta, at-the-money straddle
 positions produce average losses of approximately three percent per week.
 This suggests that some additional factor, such as systematic stochastic
 volatility, is priced in option returns. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: An Exploration of Neo-Austrian Theory Applied to Financial Markets 
Abstract:
 We attempt to translate Neo-Austrian ideas about the workings of financial
 markets, as originally advanced by F. A. Hayek, into the standard
 probabilistic language of modern finance. We focus on an apparent paradox,
 namely the insistence of Neo-Austrians on "order" (i.e., stationarity)
 together with "ever-reemerging inefficiencies". The paper's findings have
 implications beyond Neo-Austrian theory: They demonstrate how easy it is
 to reject market efficiency, but how much more difficult it is to discern
 the "nature of the inefficiency". We illustrate our findings with price
 data from the U.S. Treasury bill market over the period 1962 to 1999.
 There is ample evidence that the price of a three-month Treasury bill is
 not a random walk, yet the sign of the average price change is erratic, so
 that inference about the nature of the inefficiency is unreliable. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Do Depositors Punish Banks for Bad Behavior? Market Discipline, Deposit Insurance, and Banking Crises 
Abstract:
 This paper empirically investigates two issues largely unexplored by the
 literature on market discipline. We evaluate the interaction between
 market discipline and deposit insurance and the impact of banking crises
 on market discipline. We focus on the experiences of Argentina, Chile, and
 Mexico during the 1980s and 1990s. We find that depositors discipline
 banks by withdrawing deposits and by requiring higher interest rates.
 Deposit insurance does not appear to diminish the extent of market
 discipline. Aggregate shocks affect deposits and interest rates during
 crises, regardless of bank fundamentals, and investors' responsiveness to
 bank risk taking increases in the aftermath of crises. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: How Distance, Language, and Culture Influence Stockholdings and Trades 
Abstract:
 This paper documents that investors are more likely to hold, buy, and sell
 the stocks of Finnish firms that are located close to the investor, that
 communicate in the investor's native tongue, and that have chief
 executives of the same cultural background. The influence of distance,
 language, and culture is less prominent among the most investment-savvy
 institutions than among both households and less savvy institutions.
 Regression analysis indicates that the marginal effect of distance is less
 for firms that are more nationally known, for distances that exceed 100
 kilometers, and for investors with more diversified portfolios. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: On the Timing Ability of Mutual Fund Managers 
Abstract:
 Existing studies of mutual fund market timing analyze monthly returns and
 find little evidence of timing ability. We show that daily tests are more
 powerful and that mutual funds exhibit significant timing ability more
 often in daily tests than in monthly tests. We construct a set of
 synthetic fund returns in order to control for spurious results. The daily
 timing coefficients of the majority of funds are significantly different
 from their synthetic counterparts. These results suggest that mutual funds
 may possess more timing ability than previously documented. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: On the Term Structure of Default Premia in the Swap and LIBOR Markets 
Abstract:
 Existing theories of the term structure of swap rates provide an analysis
 of the Treasury-swap spread based on either a liquidity convenience yield
 in the Treasury market, or default risk in the swap market. Although these
 models do not focus on the relation between corporate yields and swap
 rates (the LIBOR-swap spread), they imply that the term structure of
 corporate yields and swap rates should be identical. As documented
 previously (e.g., in Sun, Sundaresan, and Wang (1993)) this is
 counterfactual. Here, we propose a model of the default risk imbedded in
 the swap term structure that is able to explain the LIBOR-swap spread.
 Whereas corporate bonds carry default risk, we argue that swap "contracts"
 are free of default risk. Because swaps are indexed on
 "refreshed"-credit-quality LIBOR rates, the spread between corporate
 yields and swap "rates" should capture the market's expectations of the
 probability of deterioration in credit quality of a corporate bond issuer.
 We model this feature and use our model to estimate the likelihood of
 future deterioration in credit quality from the LIBOR-swap spread. The
 analysis is important because it shows that the term structure of swap
 rates does not reflect the borrowing cost of a standard LIBOR credit
 quality issuer. It also has implications for modeling the dynamics of the
 swap term structure. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Why Do Money Fund Managers Voluntarily Waive Their Fees? 
Abstract:
 Over half of money fund managers voluntarily waive fees they have a
 contractual right to claim. Moreover, as a consequence of fee waivers,
 funds on average collect one half of reported expense ratios. Variation in
 fee waivers is significant and relates to differences in relative
 performance. Both low-performing retail and institutional funds waive fees
 to improve their net performance. More interestingly, high-performing
 retail, but not institutional, funds use fee waivers to strategically
 adjust net performance to increase expected fund flows. Despite fund flow
 incentives, high-performing institutional funds do not waive more because
 they cannot significantly improve their relative performance. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Insider Trading, Investment, and Liquidity: A Welfare Analysis 
Abstract:
 We compare equilibrium trading outcomes with and without participation by
 an informed insider, assuming inflexible ex ante aggregate investment
 choices by agents. Noise trading arises from aggregate uncertainty
 regarding other agents' intertemporal consumption preferences. The welfare
 levels of outsiders can thus be ascertained. The allocations without
 insider trading are not ex ante Pareto efficient, because our model
 differs from standard ones with negative exponential utility functions and
 normal returns. We characterize the  circumstances under which the
 revelation of payoff-relevant information via prices-arising from insider
 trading-benefits outsiders with stochastic liquidity needs, by improving
 risk-sharing among them. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.
