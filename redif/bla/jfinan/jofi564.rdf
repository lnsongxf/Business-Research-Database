Title: Presidential Address: Do Financial Institutions Matter? 
Abstract:
 In standard asset pricing theory, investors are assumed to invest directly
 in financial markets. The role of financial institutions is ignored. The
 focus in corporate finance is on agency problems. How do you ensure that
 managers act in shareholders' interests? There is an inconsistency in
 assuming that when you give your money to a financial institution there is
 no agency problem, but when you give it to a firm there is. It is argued
 that both areas need to take proper account of the role of financial
 institutions and markets. Appropriate concepts for analyzing particular
 situations should be used. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Merton H. Miller: His Contribution to Financial Economics 
Abstract:
 Merton Miller's status as a father of finance reflects the academic depth,
 breadth, and rigor of his writings and two important facets of his
 character. Merton was a man of great warmth and humor. He communicated his
 often challenging views via memorable phrases and anecdotes that have
 become part of the everyday language of the profession. Merton was also a
 man of great dedication. The whole profession has benefited from his
 devotion to his doctoral students, to his colleagues, and to his
 coauthors. This essay demonstrates how Merton's admiration for markets
 provided the foundation for all his research. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: The Equity Premium and Structural Breaks 
Abstract:
 A long return history is useful in estimating the current equity premium
 even if the historical distribution has experienced structural breaks. The
 long series helps not only if the timing of breaks is uncertain but also
 if one believes that large shifts in the premium are unlikely or that the
 premium is associated, in part, with volatility. Our framework
 incorporates these features along with a belief that prices are likely to
 move opposite to contemporaneous shifts in the premium. The estimated
 premium since 1834 fluctuates between 4 and 6 percent and exhibits its
 sharpest drop in the last decade. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Mental Accounting, Loss Aversion, and Individual Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 We study equilibrium firm-level stock returns in two economies: one in
 which investors are loss averse over the fluctuations of their stock
 portfolio, and another in which they are loss averse over the fluctuations
 of individual stocks that they own. Both approaches can shed light on
 empirical phenomena, but we find the second approach to be more
 successful: In that economy, the typical individual stock return has a
 high mean and excess volatility, and there is a large value premium in the
 cross section which can, to some extent, be captured by a commonly used
 multifactor model. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Variable Selection for Portfolio Choice 
Abstract:
 We study asset allocation when the conditional moments of returns are
 partly predictable. Rather than first model the return distribution and
 subsequently characterize the portfolio choice, we determine directly the
 dependence of the optimal portfolio weights on the predictive variables.
 We combine the predictors into a single index that best captures time
 variations in investment opportunities. This index helps investors
 determine which economic variables they should track and, more
 importantly, in what combination. We consider investors with both expected
 utility (mean variance and CRRA) and nonexpected utility (ambiguity
 aversion and prospect theory) objectives and characterize their market
 timing, horizon effects, and hedging demands. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Expectations Hypotheses Tests 
Abstract:
 We investigate the expectations hypotheses of the term structure of
 interest rates and of the foreign exchange market using vector
 autoregressive methods for U.S. dollar, Deutsche mark, and British pound
 interest rates and exchange rates. We examine Wald, Lagrange multiplier,
 and distance metric tests by iterating on approximate solutions that
 require only matrix inversions. Bias-corrected, constrained VARs provide
 Monte Carlo simulations. Wald tests grossly overreject the null, Lagrange
 multiplier tests slightly underreject, and distance metric tests
 overreject. A common interpretation emerges from the small sample
 statistics. The evidence against the expectations hypotheses is much less
 strong than under asymptotic inference. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Contagion as a Wealth Effect 
Abstract:
 Financial contagion is described as a wealth effect in a continuous-time
 model with two risky assets and three types of traders. Noise traders
 trade randomly in one market. Long-term investors provide liquidity using
 a linear rule based on fundamentals. Convergence traders with logarithmic
 utility trade optimally in both markets. Asset price dynamics are
 endogenously determined (numerically) as functions of endogenous wealth
 and exogenous noise. When convergence traders lose money, they liquidate
 positions in both markets. This creates contagion, in that returns become
 more volatile and more correlated. Contagion reduces benefits from
 portfolio diversification and raises issues for risk management. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Automated Versus Floor Trading: An Analysis of Execution Costs on the Paris and New York Exchanges 
Abstract:
 A global trend towards automated trading systems raises the important
 question of whether execution costs are, in fact, lower than on trading
 floors. This paper compares the trade execution costs of similar stocks in
 an automated trading structure (Paris Bourse) and a floor-based trading
 structure (NYSE). Results indicate that execution costs are higher in
 Paris than in New York after controlling for differences in adverse
 selection, relative tick size, and economic attributes across samples.
 These results suggest that the present form of the automated trading
 system may not be able to fully replicate the benefits of human
 intermediation on a trading floor. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: The Bright Side of Internal Capital Markets 
Abstract:
 We examine capital expenditure decisions of discount firms in response to
 Wal-Mart's entry into their markets. Before Wal-Mart's entry, focused
 incumbents and discount divisions of diversified incumbents are similar in
 size, geographic dispersion, and firm debt levels. However, discount
 divisions of diversified firms are significantly more productive. After
 Wal-Mart's entry, diversified firms are quicker to either "exit" the
 discount business or "stay and fight." Also, their capital expenditures
 are more sensitive to the productivity of their discount business.
 Internal capital markets function well, as transfers are away from the
 worsening discount divisions. It appears diversified firms make better
 investment decisions. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Investor Psychology and Asset Pricing 
Abstract:
 The basic paradigm of asset pricing is in vibrant flux. The purely
 rational approach is being subsumed by a broader approach based upon the
 psychology of investors. In this approach, security expected returns are
 determined by both "risk" and "misvaluation". This survey sketches a
 framework for understanding decision biases, evaluates the a priori
 arguments and the capital market evidence bearing on the importance of
 investor psychology for security prices, and reviews recent models. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.
