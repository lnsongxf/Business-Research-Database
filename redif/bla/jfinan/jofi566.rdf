Title: The Market for Corporate Assets: Who Engages in Mergers and Asset Sales and Are There Efficiency Gains? 
Abstract:
 We analyze the market for corporate assets. There is an active market for
 corporate assets, with close to seven percent of plants changing ownership
 annually through mergers, acquisitions, and asset sales in peak expansion
 years. The probability of asset sales and whole-firm transactions is
 related to firm organization and ex ante efficiency of buyers and sellers.
 The timing of sales and the pattern of efficiency gains suggests that the
 transactions that occur, especially through asset sales of plants and
 divisions, tend to improve the allocation of resources and are consistent
 with a simple neoclassical model of profit maximizing by firms. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: The Relative Valuation of Caps and Swaptions: Theory and Empirical Evidence 
Abstract:
 Although traded as distinct products, caps and swaptions are linked by
 no-arbitrage relations through the correlation structure of interest
 rates. Using a string market model, we solve for the correlation matrix
 implied by swaptions and examine the relative valuation of caps and
 swaptions. We find that swaption prices are generated by four factors and
 that implied correlations are lower than historical correlations.
 Long-dated swaptions appear mispriced and there were major pricing
 distortions during the 1998 hedge-fund crisis. Cap prices periodically
 deviate significantly from the no-arbitrage values implied by the
 swaptions market. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Dividend Changes and Future Profitability 
Abstract:
 We investigate the relation between dividend changes and future
 profitability, measured in terms of either future earnings or future
 abnormal earnings. Supporting "the information content of dividends
 hypothesis," we find that dividend changes provide information about the
 level of profitability in subsequent years, incremental to market and
 accounting data. We also document that dividend changes are positively
 related to earnings changes in each of the two years after the dividend
 change. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Characteristics of Risk and Return in Risk Arbitrage 
Abstract:
 This paper analyzes 4,750 mergers from 1963 to 1998 to characterize the
 risk and return in risk arbitrage. Results indicate that risk arbitrage
 returns are positively correlated with market returns in severely
 depreciating markets but uncorrelated with market returns in flat and
 appreciating markets. This suggests that returns to risk arbitrage are
 similar to those obtained from selling uncovered index put options. Using
 a contingent claims analysis that controls for the nonlinear relationship
 with market returns, and after controlling for transaction costs, we find
 that risk arbitrage generates excess returns of four percent per year. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: The Determinants of Credit Spread Changes 
Abstract:
 Using dealer's quotes and transactions prices on straight industrial
 bonds, we investigate the determinants of credit spread changes. Variables
 that should in theory determine credit spread changes have rather limited
 explanatory power. Further, the residuals from this regression are highly
 cross-correlated, and principal components analysis implies they are
 mostly driven by a single common factor. Although we consider several
 macroeconomic and financial variables as candidate proxies, we cannot
 explain this common systematic component. Our results suggest that monthly
 credit spread changes are principally driven by local supply/demand shocks
 that are independent of both credit-risk factors and standard proxies for
 liquidity. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: On the Perils of Financial Intermediaries Setting Security Prices: The Mutual Fund Wild Card Option 
Abstract:
 Economic distortions can arise when financial claims trade at prices set
 by an intermediary rather than direct negotiation between principals. We
 demonstrate the problem in a specific context, the exchange of open-end
 mutual fund shares. Mutual funds typically set fund share price (NAV)
 using an algorithm that fails to account for nonsynchronous trading in the
 fund's underlying securities. This results in predictable changes in NAV,
 which lead to exploitable trading opportunities. A modification to the
 pricing algorithm that corrects for nonsynchronous trading eliminates much
 of the predictability. However, there are many other potential sources of
 distortion when intermediaries set prices. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: A Theory of the Syndicate: Form Follows Function 
Abstract:
 We relate the organizational form of investment banking syndicates to
 moral hazard in team production. Although syndicates are dissolved upon
 deal completion, membership stability across deals represents a barrier to
 entry that enables the capture of quasi-rents. This improves incentives
 for individual bankers to cultivate investor relationships that translate
 into greater expected proceeds. Reputational concerns of lead bankers
 amplify the effect. We derive conditions under which restricted entry and
 designation of a lead banker strictly Pareto dominate, in which case it is
 also strictly Pareto dominant for the syndicate's fee to be greater than
 members' cost of participation. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Internal Monitoring Mechanisms and CEO Turnover: A Long-Term Perspective 
Abstract:
 We report evidence on chief executive officer (CEO) turnover during the
 1971 to 1994 period. We find that the nature of CEO turnover activity has
 changed over time. The frequencies of forced CEO turnover and outside
 succession both increased. However, the relation between the likelihood of
 forced CEO turnover and firm performance did not change significantly from
 the beginning to the end of the period we examine, despite substantial
 changes in internal governance mechanisms. The evidence also indicates
 that changes in the intensity of the takeover market are not associated
 with changes in the sensitivity of CEO turnover to firm performance. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Executive Compensation and Corporate Acquisition Decisions 
Abstract:
 By examining how executive compensation structure determines corporate
 acquisition decisions, we document a strong positive relation between
 acquiring managers' equity-based compensation (EBC) and stock price
 performance around and following acquisition announcements. This relation
 is highly robust when we control for acquisition mode (mergers), means of
 payment, managerial ownership, and previous option grants. Compared to low
 EBC managers, high EBC managers pay lower acquisition premiums, acquire
 targets with higher growth opportunities, and make acquisitions
 engendering larger increases in firm risk. EBC significantly explains
 postacquisition stock price performance even after controlling for
 acquisition mode, means of payment, and "glamour" versus "value"
 acquirers. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Bookbuilding and Strategic Allocation 
Abstract:
 In the bookbuilding procedure, an investment banker solicits bids for
 shares from institutional investors prior to pricing an equity issue. The
 banker then prices the issue and allocates shares at his discretion to the
 investors. We examine the books for 39 international equity issues. We
 find that the investment banker awards more shares to bidders who provide
 information in their bids. Regular investors receive favorable
 allocations, especially when the issue is heavily oversubscribed. The
 investment banker also favors revised bids and domestic investors. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: A Rose.com by Any Other Name 
Abstract:
 We document a striking positive stock price reaction to the announcement
 of corporate name changes to Internet-related dotcom names. This "dotcom"
 effect produces cumulative abnormal returns on the order of 74 percent for
 the 10 days surrounding the announcement day. The effect does not appear
 to be transitory; there is no evidence of a postannouncement negative
 drift. The announcement day effect is also similar across all firms,
 regardless of the firm's level of involvement with the Internet. A mere
 association with the Internet seems enough to provide a firm with a large
 and permanent value increase. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: Feedback from Stock Prices to Cash Flows 
Abstract:
 Feedback from financial market prices to cash flows arises when a firm's
 nonfinancial stakeholders, for example, its customers, employees, and
 suppliers, make decisions that are contingent on the information revealed
 by the price. Complementarities across stakeholders result in cascades,
 wherein relatively small stock price moves trigger substantial changes in
 asset values. This paper analyzes the relation between such feedback
 effects and parameters such as the information cost, the volatility of
 existing projects, the risk aversion of liquidity suppliers, and the
 precision of managerial information. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: A First Look at the Accuracy of the CRSP Mutual Fund Database and a Comparison of the CRSP and Morningstar Mutual Fund Databases 
Abstract:
 This paper examines problems in the "CRSP Survivor Bias Free U.S. Mutual
 Fund Database" (CRSP, 1998) and compares returns contained in it to those
 in Morningstar. The CRSP database has an omission bias that has the same
 effects as survivorship bias. Although all mutual funds are listed in
 CRSP, return data is missing for many and the characteristics of these
 funds differ from the populations. The CRSP return data is biased upward
 and merger months are inaccurately recorded about half the time.
 Differences in returns in Morningstar and CRSP are a problem for older
 data and small funds. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.

Title: The Stock Market Valuation of Research and Development Expenditures 
Abstract:
 We examine whether stock prices fully value firms' intangible assets,
 specifically research and development (R&D). Under current U.S. accounting
 standards, financial statements do not report intangible assets and R&D
 spending is expensed. Nonetheless, the average historical stock returns of
 firms doing R&D matches the returns of firms without R&D. However, the
 market is apparently too pessimistic about beaten-down R&D-intensive
 technology stocks' prospects. Companies with high R&D to equity market
 value (which tend to have poor past returns) earn large excess returns. A
 similar relation exists between advertising and stock returns. R&D
 intensity is positively associated with return volatility. Copyright The American Finance Association 2001.
