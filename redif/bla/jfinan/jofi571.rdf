Title: Market Timing and Capital Structure 
Abstract:
 It is well known that firms are more likely to issue equity when their
 market values are high, relative to book and past market values, and to
 repurchase equity when their market values are low. We document that the
 resulting effects on capital structure are very persistent. As a
 consequence, current capital structure is strongly related to historical
 market values. The results suggest the theory that capital structure is
 the cumulative outcome of past attempts to time the equity market. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Banks as Liquidity Providers: An Explanation for the Coexistence of Lending and Deposit-Taking 
Abstract:
 What ties together the traditional commercial banking activities of
 deposit-taking and lending? We argue that since banks often lend via
 commitments, their lending and deposit-taking may be two manifestations of
 one primitive function: the provision of liquidity on demand. There will
 be synergies between the two activities to the extent that both require
 banks to hold large balances of liquid assets: If deposit withdrawals and
 commitment takedowns are imperfectly correlated, the two activities can
 share the costs of the liquid-asset stockpile. We develop this idea with a
 simple model, and use a variety of data to test the model empirically. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: The World Price of Insider Trading 
Abstract:
 The existence and the enforcement of insider trading laws in stock markets
 is a phenomenon of the 1990s. A study of the 103 countries that have stock
 markets reveals that insider trading laws exist in 87 of them, but
 enforcement-as evidenced by prosecutions-has taken place in only 38 of
 them. Before 1990, the respective numbers were 34 and 9. We find that the
 cost of equity in a country, after controlling for a number of other
 variables, does not change after the introduction of insider trading laws,
 but decreases significantly after the first prosecution. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Mutual Fund Advisory Contracts: An Empirical Investigation 
Abstract:
 We investigate marginal compensation rates in mutual fund advisory
 contracts and find the following. Equity and foreign fund advisors receive
 higher marginal compensation than debt and domestic fund advisors.
 Advisors of funds with greater turnover receive higher marginal
 compensation. Also, closed-end fund advisors receive higher marginal
 compensation than open-end fund advisors. Finally, we find that marginal
 compensation is lower for advisors of large funds and members of large
 fund families. We argue that these differences in marginal compensation
 reflect differences in advisor marginal product, differences in the
 difficulty of monitoring performance, differences in control environments,
 and scale economies. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Economic Distress, Financial Distress, and Dynamic Liquidation 
Abstract:
 Many firms emerging from a debt restructuring remain highly leveraged,
 continue to invest little, perform poorly, and often reenter financial
 distress. The existing literature interprets these findings as
 inefficiencies arising from coordination problems among many creditors or
 an inefficient design of bankruptcy law. In contrast, this paper
 emphasizes that creditors lack the information that is needed to make
 quick and correct liquidation decisions. It can explain the long-term
 nature of financial distress solely as the result of dynamic learning
 strategies of creditors and suggests that it may be an unavoidable
 byproduct of an efficient resolution of financial distress. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Venture Capital and the Professionalization of Start-Up Firms: Empirical Evidence 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the impact venture capital can have on the development
 of new firms. Using a hand-collected data set on Silicon Valley start-ups,
 we find that venture capital is related to a variety of
 professionalization measures, such as human resource policies, the
 adoption of stock option plans, and the hiring of a marketing VP.
 Venture-capital-backed companies are also more likely and faster to
 replace the founder with an outside CEO, both in situations that appear
 adversarial and those mutually agreed to. The evidence suggests that
 venture capitalists play roles over and beyond those of traditional
 financial intermediaries. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Pass-through and Exposure 
Abstract:
 Firms differ in the extent to which they "pass through" changes in
 exchange rates into foreign currency prices and in their "exposure" to
 exchange rates-the responsiveness of their profits to changes in exchange
 rates. Because pricing affects profitability, a firm's pass-through and
 exposure should be related. This paper develops models of exporting firms
 under imperfect competition to study these related phenomena. From these
 models we derive the optimal pass-through decisions and the resulting
 exchange rate exposure. The models are estimated on eight Japanese export
 industries using both the price data pass-through and financial data for
 exposure. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: What Drives Firm-Level Stock Returns? 
Abstract:
 I use a vector autoregressive model (VAR) to decompose an individual
 firm's stock return into two components: changes in cash-flow expectations
 (i.e., cash-flow news) and changes in discount rates (i.e.,
 expected-return news). The VAR yields three main results. First,
 firm-level stock returns are mainly driven by cash-flow news. For a
 typical stock, the variance of cash-flow news is more than twice that of
 expected-return news. Second, shocks to expected returns and cash flows
 are positively correlated for a typical small stock. Third,
 expected-return-news series are highly correlated across firms, while
 cash-flow news can largely be diversified away in aggregate portfolios. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Government Ownership of Banks 
Abstract:
 We assemble data on government ownership of banks around the world. The
 data show that such ownership is large and pervasive, and higher in
 countries with low levels of per capita income, backward financial
 systems, interventionist and inefficient governments, and poor protection
 of property rights. Higher government ownership of banks in 1970 is
 associated with slower subsequent financial development and lower growth
 of per capita income and productivity. This evidence supports "political"
 theories of the effects of government ownership of firms. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Portfolio Choice in the Presence of Personal Illiquid Projects 
Abstract:
 Personal projects, such as a private business or the purchase of a home,
 influence individuals' portfolio choice. We conduct a theoretical analysis
 of this influence when financial assets are required to provide liquidity
 to personal projects. Due to this liquidity consideration, individuals
 behave in a more risk-averse fashion when there is a large penalty for
 discontinuing or underinvesting in the final stages of the projects. In
 addition, using data from the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances, we find
 that households that are saving to invest in their own businesses or in
 their own homes indeed have significantly safer financial portfolios. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: The Effects of Banking Mergers on Loan Contracts 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the effects of banking mergers on individual business
 borrowers. Using information on individual loan contracts between banks
 and companies, I analyze the effect of banking consolidation on banks'
 credit policies. I find that in-market mergers benefit borrowers if these
 mergers involve the acquisition of banks with small market shares.
 Interest rates charged by the consolidated banks decrease, but as the
 local market share of the acquired bank increases, the efficiency effect
 is offset by market power. Mergers have different distributional effects
 across borrowers. When banks become larger, they reduce the supply of
 loans to small borrowers. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Nonlinear Pricing Kernels, Kurtosis Preference, and Evidence from the Cross Section of Equity Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates nonlinear pricing kernels in which the risk factor
 is endogenously determined and preferences restrict the definition of the
 pricing kernel. These kernels potentially generate the empirical
 performance of nonlinear and multifactor models, while maintaining
 empirical power and avoiding ad hoc specifications of factors or
 functional form. Our test results indicate that preference-restricted
 nonlinear pricing kernels are both admissible for the cross section of
 returns and are able to significantly improve upon linear single- and
 multifactor kernels. Further, the nonlinearities in the pricing kernel
 drive out the importance of the factors in the linear multi-factor model. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Term Premia and Interest Rate Forecasts in Affine Models 
Abstract:
 The standard class of affine models produces poor forecasts of future
 Treasury yields. Better forecasts are generated by assuming that yields
 follow random walks. The failure of these models is driven by one of their
 key features: Compensation for risk is a multiple of the variance of the
 risk. Thus risk compensation cannot vary independently of interest rate
 volatility. I also describe a broader class of models. These "essentially
 affine" models retain the tractability of standard models, but allow
 compensation for interest rate risk to vary independently of interest rate
 volatility. This additional flexibility proves useful in forecasting
 future yields. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Ex Ante Costs of Violating Absolute Priority in Bankruptcy 
Abstract:
 A basic question for the design of bankruptcy law concerns whether value
 should be divided in accordance with absolute priority. Research done in
 the past decade has suggested that deviations from absolute priority have
 beneficial ex ante effects. In contrast, this paper shows that ex post
 deviations from absolute priority also have negative effects on ex ante
 decisions taken by shareholders. Such deviations aggravate the moral
 hazard problem with respect to project choice-increasing the
 equityholders' incentive to favor risky projects-as well as with respect
 to borrowing and dividend decisions. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: The Cadbury Committee, Corporate Performance, and Top Management Turnover 
Abstract:
 In 1992, the Cadbury Committee issued the "Code of Best Practice" which
 recommends that boards of U.K. corporations include at least three outside
 directors and that the positions of chairman and CEO be held by different
 individuals. The underlying presumption was that these recommendations
 would lead to improved board oversight. We empirically analyze the
 relationship between CEO turnover and corporate performance. CEO turnover
 increased following issuance of the "Code"; the negative relationship
 between CEO turnover and performance became stronger following the
 "Code"'s issuance; and the increase in sensitivity of turnover to
 performance was concentrated among firms that adopted the "Code". Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Bank Performance around the Introduction of a Section 20 Subsidiary 
Abstract:
 As of 1987, commercial banks in the United States were allowed to
 establish Section 20 subsidiaries to conduct investment-banking
 activities. A concern of regulators was that these activities would result
 in a decrease in performance of commercial banks relative to the risk
 being undertaken. This paper examines the performance of commercial banks
 around the establishment of a Section 20 subsidiary. We find that Section
 20 activities undertaken by banks result in increased industry-adjusted
 operating cash flow return on assets, due mainly to revenues from
 noncommercial-banking activities. Further, risk measures for the sample
 banks do not change significantly. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Continuous Trading or Call Auctions: Revealed Preferences of Investors at the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange 
Abstract:
 We use the move of Israeli stocks from call auction trading to continuous
 trading to show that investors have a preference for stocks that trade
 continuously. When large stocks move from call auction to continuous
 trading, the small stocks that still trade by call auction experience a
 significant loss in volume relative to the overall market volume. As small
 stocks move to continuous trading, they experience an increase in volume
 and positive abnormal returns because of the associated increase in
 liquidity. Overall, though, a move to continuous trading increases the
 volume of large stocks relative to small stocks. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.
