Title: Limited Arbitrage in Equity Markets 
Abstract:
 We examine 82 situations where the market value of a company is less than
 its subsidiary. These situations imply arbitrage opportunities, providing
 an ideal setting to study the risks and market frictions that prevent
 arbitrageurs from immediately forcing prices to fundamental values. For 30
 percent of the sample, the link between the parent and its subsidiary is
 severed before the relative value discrepancy is corrected. Furthermore,
 returns to a specialized arbitrageur would be 50 percent larger if the
 path to convergence was smooth rather than as observed. Uncertainty about
 the distribution of returns and characteristics of the risks limits
 arbitrage. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Rational Momentum Effects 
Abstract:
 Momentum effects in stock returns need not imply investor irrationality,
 heterogeneous information, or market frictions. A simple, single-firm
 model with a standard pricing kernel can produce such effects when
 expected dividend growth rates vary over time. An enhanced model, under
 which persistent growth rate shocks occur episodically, can match many of
 the features documented by the empirical research. The same basic
 mechanism could potentially account for underreaction anomalies in
 general. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Managerial Opportunism? Evidence from Directors' and Officers' Insurance Purchases 
Abstract:
 We analyze a sample of 72 IPO firms that went public between 1992 and 1996
 for which we have detailed proprietary information about the amount and
 cost of D&O liability insurance. If managers of IPO firms are exploiting
 superior inside information, we hypothesize that the amount of insurance
 coverage chosen will be related to the post-offering performance of the
 issuing firm's shares. Consistent with the hypothesis, we find a
 significant negative relation between the three-year post-IPO stock price
 performance and the insurance coverage purchased in conjunction with the
 IPO. One plausible interpretation is that, like insider securities
 transactions, D&O insurance decisions reveal opportunistic behavior by
 managers. This provides some motivation to argue that disclosure of the
 details of D&O insurance decisions, as is required in some other
 countries, is valuable. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: The Equity Premium 
Abstract:
 We estimate the equity premium using dividend and earnings growth rates to
 measure the expected rate of capital gain. Our estimates for 1951 to 2000,
 2.55 percent and 4.32 percent, are much lower than the equity premium
 produced by the average stock return, 7.43 percent. Our evidence suggests
 that the high average return for 1951 to 2000 is due to a decline in
 discount rates that produces a large unexpected capital gain. Our main
 conclusion is that the average stock return of the last half-century is a
 lot higher than expected. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Leaning for the Tape: Evidence of Gaming Behavior in Equity Mutual Funds 
Abstract:
 We present evidence that fund managers inflate quarter-end portfolio
 prices with last-minute purchases of stocks already held. The magnitude of
 price inflation ranges from 0.5 percent per year for large-cap funds to
 well over 2 percent for small-cap funds. We find that the cross section of
 inflation matches the cross section of incentives from the
 flow/performance relation, that a surge of trading in the quarter's last
 minutes coincides with a surge in equity prices, and that the inflation is
 greatest for the stocks held by funds with the most incentive to inflate,
 controlling for the stocks' size and performance. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Does Corporate Diversification Destroy Value? 
Abstract:
 We analyze several hundred firms that expand via acquisition and/or
 increase their number of business segments. The combined market reaction
 to acquisition announcements is positive but acquiring firm excess values
 decline after the diversifying event. Much of the excess value reduction
 occurs because our sample firms acquire already discounted business units,
 and not because diversifying destroys value. This implies that the
 standard assumption that conglomerate divisions can be benchmarked to
 typical stand-alone firms should be carefully reconsidered. We also show
 that excess value does not decline when firms increase their number of
 business segments because of pure reporting changes. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Do Conglomerate Firms Allocate Resources Inefficiently Across Industries? Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
 We develop a profit-maximizing neoclassical model of optimal firm size and
 growth across different industries based on differences in industry
 fundamentals and firm productivity. In the model, a conglomerate discount
 is consistent with profit maximization. The model predicts how
 conglomerate firms will allocate resources across divisions over the
 business cycle and how their responses to industry shocks will differ from
 those of single-segment firms. Using plant level data, we find that growth
 and investment of conglomerate and single-segment firms is related to
 fundamental industry factors and individual segment level productivity.
 The majority of conglomerate firms exhibit growth across industry segments
 that is consistent with optimal behavior. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: A Rational Expectations Model of Financial Contagion 
Abstract:
 We develop a multiple asset rational expectations model of asset prices to
 explain financial market contagion. Although the model allows contagion
 through several channels, our focus is on contagion through cross-market
 rebalancing. Through this channel, investors transmit idiosyncratic shocks
 from one market to others by adjusting their portfolios' exposures to
 shared macroeconomic risks. The pattern and severity of financial
 contagion depends on markets' sensitivities to shared macroeconomic risk
 factors, and on the amount of information asymmetry in each market. The
 model can generate contagion in the absence of news, as well as between
 markets that do not directly share macroeconomic risks. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: The Volatility and Price Sensitivities of Managerial Stock Option Portfolios and Corporate Hedging 
Abstract:
 We use estimates of the Black-Scholes sensitivity of managers' stock
 option portfolios to stock return volatility and the sensitivity of
 managers' stock and stock option portfolios to stock price to test the
 relationship between managers' risk preferences and hedging activities. We
 find that as the sensitivity of managers' stock and stock option
 portfolios to stock price increases, firms tend to hedge more. However, as
 the sensitivity of managers' stock option portfolios to stock return
 volatility increases, firms tend to hedge less. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Do Firms Hedge in Response to Tax Incentives? 
Abstract:
 There are two tax incentives for corporations to hedge: to increase debt
 capacity and interest tax deductions, and to reduce expected tax liability
 if the tax function is convex. We test whether these incentives affect the
 extent of corporate hedging with derivatives. Using an explicit measure of
 tax function convexity, we find no evidence that firms hedge in response
 to tax convexity. Our analysis does, however, indicate that firms hedge to
 increase debt capacity, with increased tax benefits averaging 1.1 percent
 of firm value. Our results also indicate that firms hedge because of
 expected financial distress costs and firm size. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Liquidity Provision and the Organizational Form of NYSE Specialist Firms 
Abstract:
 We examine the influence of NYSE specialist firm organizational form on
 the nature of liquidity provision. We compare closely held firms whose
 specialists provide liquidity with their own capital to widely held firms
 whose specialists provide liquidity with diffusely owned capital. We argue
 that specialists using their own capital have a greater incentive and
 ability to reduce adverse selection costs, but face a greater cost of
 capital. Differences in the proportion of spreads due to adverse selection
 costs, large trade frequency, the sensitivity between depth and spreads,
 and price stabilization support this argument. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: The Long-run Performance Following Dividend Initiations and Resumptions: Underreaction or Product of Chance? 
Abstract:
 We examine the long-term stock performance following dividend initiations
 and resumptions from 1927 to 1998. We show that postannouncement abnormal
 returns are significantly positive for equally weighted calendar time
 portfolios, but become insignificant when the portfolios are value
 weighted. Moreover, the equally weighted results are not robust across
 subsamples. We also document postannouncement reductions in the risk
 factor loadings of underlying stocks. Cross-sectionally, these reductions
 are negatively related to the contemporaneous price drifts, suggesting the
 price drifts may be a sample-specific result of chance. Our results
 underscore the importance of testing for changes in risk loadings in
 future long-term event studies. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Where Does "State Street" Lead? A First Look at Finance Patents, 1971 to 2000 
Abstract:
 This paper empirically examines patents for financial formulas and
 methods, whose patentability was recently confirmed in the litigation
 between State Street Bank and Trust and Signature Financial Group. The
 number of such filings and awards has been accelerating. Patent filings by
 academics have been very infrequent, which appears to be a consequence of
 a lack of awareness or interest on the part of faculty members, rather
 than any fundamental unsuitability of their research for patenting. The
 failure to cite academic research in this area appears to be problematic
 and may reflect patent examiners' limited exposure to finance research and
 patents. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Competition, Market Structure, and Bid-Ask Spreads in Stock Option Markets 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the effects of competition and market structure on
 equity option bid-ask spreads from 1986 to 1997. Options listed on
 multiple exchanges have narrower spreads than those listed on a single
 exchange, but the difference diminishes as option volume increases. Option
 spreads become wider when a competing exchange delists the option. Options
 traded under a "Designated Primary Marketmaker" (DPM) have narrower quoted
 spreads than those traded in a traditional open outcry crowd. Effective
 spreads are found to be slightly narrower under the DPM than in the crowd,
 but only since 1992, and only on low-volume options. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Risk Aversion, Transparency, and Market Performance 
Abstract:
 Using a model of market making with inventories based on Biais (1993), we
 find that investors obtain more favorable execution prices, and they hence
 invest more, when markets are fragmented. In our model, risk-averse
 dealers use less aggressive price strategies in more transparent markets
 (centralized) because quote dissemination alleviates uncertainty about the
 prices quoted by other dealers and, hence, reduces the need to compete
 aggressively for order flow. Further, we show that the move toward greater
 transparency (centralization) may have detrimental effects on liquidity
 and welfare. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Momentum, Business Cycle, and Time-varying Expected Returns 
Abstract:
 A growing number of researchers argue that time-series patterns in returns
 are due to investor irrationality and thus can be translated into abnormal
 profits. Continuation of short-term returns or momentum is one such
 pattern that has defied any rational explanation and is at odds with
 market efficiency. This paper shows that profits to momentum strategies
 can be explained by a set of lagged macroeconomic variables and payoffs to
 momentum strategies disappear once stock returns are adjusted for their
 predictability based on these macroeconomic variables. Our results provide
 a possible role for time-varying expected returns as an explanation for
 momentum payoffs. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.
