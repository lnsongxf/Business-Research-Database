Title: Range-Based Estimation of Stochastic Volatility Models 
Abstract:
 We propose using the price range in the estimation of stochastic
 volatility models. We show theoretically, numerically, and empirically
 that range-based volatility proxies are not only highly efficient, but
 also approximately Gaussian and robust to microstructure noise. Hence
 range-based Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood estimation produces highly
 efficient estimates of stochastic volatility models and extractions of
 latent volatility. We use our method to examine the dynamics of daily
 exchange rate volatility and find the evidence points strongly toward
 two-factor models with one highly persistent factor and one quickly
 mean-reverting factor. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: How Accurate Are Value-at-Risk Models at Commercial Banks? 
Abstract:
 In recent years, the trading accounts at large commercial banks have grown
 substantially and become progressively more diverse and complex. We
 provide descriptive statistics on the trading revenues from such
 activities and on the associated Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasts internally
 estimated by banks. For a sample of large bank holding companies, we
 evaluate the performance of banks' trading risk models by examining the
 statistical accuracy of the VaR forecasts. Although a substantial
 literature has examined the statistical and economic meaning of
 Value-at-Risk models, this article is the first to provide a detailed
 analysis of the performance of models actually in use. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Learning, Asset-Pricing Tests, and Market Efficiency 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the asset-pricing implications of parameter
 uncertainty. We show that, when investors must learn about expected cash
 flows, empirical tests can find patterns in the data that differ from
 those perceived by rational investors. Returns might appear predictable to
 an econometrician, or appear to deviate from the Capital Asset Pricing
 Model, but investors can neither perceive nor exploit this predictability.
 Returns may also appear excessively volatile even though prices react
 efficiently to cash-flow news. We conclude that parameter uncertainty can
 be important for characterizing and testing market efficiency. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Investor Protection and Corporate Valuation 
Abstract:
 We present a model of the effects of legal protection of minority
 shareholders and of cash-flow ownership by a controlling shareholder on
 the valuation of firms. We then test this model using a sample of 539
 large firms from 27 wealthy economies. Consistent with the model, we find
 evidence of higher valuation of firms in countries with better protection
 of minority shareholders and in firms with higher cash-flow ownership by
 the controlling shareholder. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: IPO Market Cycles: Bubbles or Sequential Learning? 
Abstract:
 Both IPO volume and average initial returns are highly autocorrelated.
 Further, more companies tend to go public following periods of high
 initial returns. However, we find that the level of average initial
 returns at the time of filing contains no information about that company's
 eventual underpricing. Both the cycles in initial returns and the lead-lag
 relation between initial returns and IPO volume are predominantly driven
 by information learned during the registration period. More positive
 information results in higher initial returns and more companies filing
 IPOs soon thereafter. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Dynamic Asset Allocation under Inflation 
Abstract:
 We develop a simple framework for analyzing a finite-horizon investor's
 asset allocation problem under inflation when only nominal assets are
 available. The investor's optimal investment strategy and indirect utility
 are given in simple closed form. Hedge demands depend on the investor's
 horizon and risk aversion and on the maturities of the bonds included in
 the portfolio. When short positions are precluded, the optimal strategy
 consists of investments in cash, equity, and a single nominal bond with
 optimally chosen maturity. Both the optimal stock-bond mix and the optimal
 bond maturity depend on the investor's horizon and risk aversion. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: An Empirical Investigation of Continuous-Time Equity Return Models 
Abstract:
 This paper extends the class of stochastic volatility diffusions for asset
 returns to encompass Poisson jumps of time-varying intensity. We find that
 any reasonably descriptive continuous-time model for equity-index returns
 must allow for discrete jumps as well as stochastic volatility with a
 pronounced negative relationship between return and volatility
 innovations. We also find that the dominant empirical characteristics of
 the return process appear to be priced by the option market. Our analysis
 indicates a general correspondence between the evidence extracted from
 daily equity-index returns and the stylized features of the corresponding
 options market prices. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: The Quality of ECN and Nasdaq Market Maker Quotes 
Abstract:
 This paper compares the quality of quotes submitted by electronic
 communication networks (ECNs) and by traditional market makers to the
 Nasdaq quote montage. An analysis of the most active Nasdaq stocks shows
 that ECNs not only post informative quotes, but also, compared to market
 makers, ECNs post quotes rapidly and are more often at the inside.
 Additionally, ECN quoted spreads are smaller than dealer quoted spreads.
 The evidence suggests that the proliferation of alternative trading
 venues, such as ECNs, may promote quote quality rather than fragmenting
 markets. Moreover, the results suggest that a more open book contributes
 to quote quality. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: New Evidence of the Impact of Dividend Taxation and on the Identity of the Marginal Investor 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the impact of a major change in dividend taxation
 introduced in the United Kingdom in July 1997. The reform was structured
 in such a way that the immediate impact fell almost entirely on the
 largest investor class in the United Kingdom, namely pension funds. We
 find significant changes in the valuation of dividend income after the
 reform, in particular for high-yielding companies. These results provide
 strong support for the hypothesis that taxation affects the valuation of
 companies, and that pension funds were the effective marginal investors
 for high-yielding companies. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Equilibrium Pricing and Optimal Hedging in Electricity Forward Markets 
Abstract:
 Spot power prices are volatile and since electricity cannot be
 economically stored, familiar arbitrage-based methods are not applicable
 for pricing power derivative contracts. This paper presents an equilibrium
 model implying that the forward power price is a downward biased predictor
 of the future spot price if expected power demand is low and demand risk
 is moderate. However, the equilibrium forward premium increases when
 either expected demand or demand variance is high, because of positive
 skewness in the spot power price distribution. Preliminary empirical
 evidence indicates that the premium in forward power prices is greatest
 during the summer months. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Do Banks Provide Financial Slack? 
Abstract:
 We study the decision to choose bank debt rather than public securities in
 a firm's marginal financing choice. Using a sample of 500 firms over the
 1980 to 1993 time period, we find that firms are relatively more likely to
 choose bank loans when variables that measure asymmetric information
 problems are elevated. The sensitivity of the likelihood of choosing bank
 debt to information problems is greater for firms with no public debt
 outstanding. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that banks
 help alleviate asymmetric information problems and that firms weigh these
 information benefits against a wide range of contracting costs when
 choosing bank financing. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Institutional Allocation in Initial Public Offerings: Empirical Evidence 
Abstract:
 We analyze institutional allocation in initial public offerings (IPOs)
 using a new data set of U.S. offerings between 1997 and 1998. We document
 a positive relationship between institutional allocation and day one IPO
 returns. This is partly explained by the practice of giving institutions
 more shares in IPOs with strong premarket demand, consistent with
 book-building theories. However, institutional allocation also contains
 private information about first-day IPO returns not reflected in premarket
 demand and other public information. Our evidence supports book-building
 theories of IPO underpricing, but suggests that institutional allocation
 in underpriced issues is in excess of that explained by book-building
 alone. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Nasdaq Trading Halts: The Impact of Market Mechanisms on Prices, Trading Activity, and Execution Costs 
Abstract:
 We study the effects of alternative halt and reopening procedures on
 prices, transaction costs, and trading activity for a sample of
 news-related trading halts on Nasdaq. For intraday halts that reopen after
 only a five-minute quotation period, inside quoted spreads more than
 double following halts and volatility increases to more than nine times
 normal levels. In contrast, halts that reopen the following day with a
 longer 90-minute quotation period are associated with insignificant spread
 effects and significantly dampened volatility effects. These results are
 consistent with the hypothesis that increased information transmission
 during the halt results in reduced posthalt uncertainty. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Empirical Analysis of the Yield Curve: The Information in the Data Viewed through the Window of Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross 
Abstract:
 This paper uses recent advances in Bayesian estimation methods to exploit
 fully and efficiently the time-series and cross-sectional empirical
 restrictions of the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model of the term structure.
 We examine the extent to which the cross-sectional data (five different
 instruments) provide information about the model. We find that the
 time-series restrictions of the two-factor model are generally consistent
 with the data. However, the model's cross-sectional restrictions are not.
 We show that adding a third factor produces a significant statistical
 improvement, but causes the average time-series fit to the yields
 themselves to deteriorate. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: An Analysis of the Determinants and Shareholder Wealth Effects of Mutual Fund Mergers 
Abstract:
 This study examines the determinants of mutual fund mergers and their
 subsequent wealth impact on shareholders of target and acquiring funds.
 Results indicate significant improvements in postmerger performance and a
 reduction in expense ratios for target fund shareholders. In contrast,
 acquiring fund shareholders experience a significant deterioration in
 postmerger performance. The net asset flows continue to remain negative
 for the combined fund in the year following the merger. The likelihood of
 a fund merger is inversely related to fund size for both within- and
 across-family mutual fund mergers. However, poor past performance is a
 significant determinant for only within-family mergers. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.
