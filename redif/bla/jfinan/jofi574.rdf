Title: Rational Asset Prices 
Abstract:
 The mean, covariability, and predictability of the return of different
 classes of financial assets challenge the rational economic model for an
 explanation. The unconditional mean aggregate equity premium is almost
 seven percent per year and remains high after adjusting downwards the
 sample mean premium by introducing prior beliefs about the stationarity of
 the price-dividend ratio and the (non)forecastability of the long-term
 dividend growth and price-dividend ratio. Recognition that idiosyncratic
 income shocks are uninsurable and concentrated in recessions contributes
 toward an explanation. Also borrowing constraints over the investors' life
 cycle that shift the stock market risk to the saving middle-aged consumers
 contribute toward an explanation. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: How Much Is Investor Autonomy Worth? 
Abstract:
 There is a worldwide trend towards defined contribution savings plans,
 where investors are often able to select their own portfolios. How much is
 this freedom of choice worth? We present retirement investors with
 information about the distribution of outcomes they could expect to obtain
 from the portfolios they picked for themselves, and the same information
 for the median portfolio selected by their peers. A majority of our survey
 participants actually prefer the median portfolio to the one they picked
 for themselves. We investigate various explanations for these findings and
 offer some evidence that the results are partly attributable to the fact
 that investors do not have well-defined preferences. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Is Disinflation Good for the Stock Market? 
Abstract:
 The stock market appreciates by an average of 24 percent in real dollar
 terms when countries attempt to stabilize annual inflation rates that are
 greater than 40 percent. In contrast, the average market response is 0
 when the pre-stabilization rate of inflation is less than 40 percent.
 These results suggest that the potential long-run benefits of
 stabilization may dominate short-run costs at high levels of inflation,
 but at low to moderate levels of inflation, benefits may be offset by
 costs in a present value sense. Stock market responses also help predict
 the change in inflation and output in the year following all 81
 stabilization efforts. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Dividends, Share Repurchases, and the Substitution Hypothesis 
Abstract:
 We show that repurchases have not only became an important form of payout
 for U.S. corporations, but also that firms finance their share repurchases
 with funds that otherwise would have been used to increase dividends. We
 find that young firms have a higher propensity to pay cash through
 repurchases than they did in the past and that repurchases have become the
 preferred form of initiating a cash payout. Although large, established
 firms have generally not cut their dividends, they also show a higher
 propensity to pay out cash through repurchases. These findings indicate
 that firms have gradually substituted repurchases for dividends. Our
 results also suggest that before 1983, regulatory constraints inhibited
 firms from aggressively repurchasing shares. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Do Bonds Span the Fixed Income Markets? Theory and Evidence for Unspanned Stochastic Volatility 
Abstract:
 Most term structure models assume bond markets are complete, that is, that
 all fixed income derivatives can be perfectly replicated using solely
 bonds. How ever, we find that, in practice, swap rates have limited
 explanatory power for returns on at-the-money straddles-portfolios mainly
 exposed to volatility risk. We term this empirical feature "unspanned
 stochastic volatility" (USV). While USV can be captured within an HJM
 framework, we demonstrate that bivariate models cannot exhibit USV. We
 determine necessary and sufficient conditions for trivariate Markov affine
 systems to exhibit USV. For such USV models, bonds alone may not be
 sufficient to identify all parameters. Rather, derivatives are needed. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Explaining the Diversification Discount 
Abstract:
 This paper argues that the documented discount on diversified firms is not
 per se evidence that diversification destroys value. Firms choose to
 diversify. We use three alternative econometric techniques to control for
 the endogeneity of the diversification decision, and find evidence
 supporting the self-selection of diversifying firms. We find a strong
 negative correlation between a firm's choice to diversify and firm value.
 The diversification discount always drops, and sometimes turns into a
 premium. There also exists evidence of self-selection by refocusing firms.
 These results point to the importance of explicitly modeling the
 endogeneity of the diversification status in analyzing its effect on firm
 value. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: What Do Returns to Acquiring Firms Tell Us? Evidence from Firms That Make Many Acquisitions 
Abstract:
 We study shareholder returns for firms that acquired five or more public,
 private, and/or subsidiary targets within a short time period. Since the
 same bidder chooses different types of targets and methods of payment, any
 variation in returns must be due to the characteristics of the target and
 the bid. Results indicate bidder shareholders gain when buying a private
 firm or subsidiary but lose when purchasing a public firm. Further, the
 return is greater the larger the target and if the bidder offers stock.
 These results are consistent with a liquidity discount, and tax and
 control effects in this market. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: A Review of IPO Activity, Pricing, and Allocations 
Abstract:
 We review the theory and evidence on IPO activity: why firms go public,
 why they reward first-day investors with considerable underpricing, and
 how IPOs perform in the long run. Our perspective is threefold: First, we
 believe that many IPO phenomena are not stationary. Second, we believe
 research into share allocation issues is the most promising area of
 research in IPOs at the moment. Third, we argue that asymmetric
 information is not the primary driver of many IPO phenomena. Instead, we
 believe future progress in the literature will come from nonrational and
 agency conflict explanations. We describe some promising such
 alternatives. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.
