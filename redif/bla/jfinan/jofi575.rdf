Title: Takeover Defenses of IPO Firms 
Abstract:
 Many firms deploy takeover defenses when they go public. IPO managers tend
 to deploy defenses when their compensation is high, shareholdings are
 small, and oversight from nonmanagerial shareholders is weak. The presence
 of a defense is negatively related to subsequent acquisition likelihood,
 yet has no impact on takeover premiums for firms that are acquired. These
 results do not support arguments that takeover defenses facilitate the
 eventual sale of IPO firms at high takeover premiums. Rather, they suggest
 that managers shift the cost of takeover protection onto nonmanagerial
 shareholders. Thus, agency problems are important even for firms at the
 IPO stage. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Information Production and Capital Allocation: Decentralized versus Hierarchical Firms 
Abstract:
 This paper asks how well different organizational structures perform in
 terms of generating information about investment projects and allocating
 capital to these projects. A decentralized approach-with small,
 single-manager firms-is most likely to be attractive when information
 about projects is "soft" and cannot be credibly transmitted. In contrast,
 large hierarchies perform better when information can be costlessly
 "hardened" and passed along inside the firm. The model can be used to
 think about the consequences of consolidation in the banking industry,
 particularly the documented tendency for mergers to lead to declines in
 small-business lending. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Who Blinks in Volatile Markets, Individuals or Institutions? 
Abstract:
 We investigate the relationship between the ownership structure and
 returns of firms on days when the absolute value of the market's return is
 two percent or more. We find that a firm's abnormal return on these days
 is related to the percentage of institutional ownership, that there is
 abnormally high turnover in the firm's shares on these days, and that this
 abnormal turnover is significantly related to the percentage of
 institutional ownership in the firm. Taken together, these results are
 consistent with positive feedback herding behavior on the part of some
 institutions, particularly mutual and pension funds. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Global Diversification, Industrial Diversification, and Firm Value 
Abstract:
 Using a sample of 44,288 firm-years between 1984 and 1997, we document an
 increase in the extent of global diversification over time. This trend
 does not reflect a substitution of global for industrial diversification.
 We also find that global diversification results in average valuation
 discounts of approximately the same magnitude as those for industrial
 diversification. Analysis of the changes in excess value associated with
 changes in diversification reveals that increases in global
 diversification reduce excess value, while reductions in global
 diversification increase excess value. These findings support the view
 that the costs of global diversification outweigh the benefits. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Survival Bias and the Equity Premium Puzzle 
Abstract:
 Previous authors have raised the concern that there could be serious
 survival bias in the observed U.S. equity premium. Contrary to
 conventional wisdom, we argue that the survival bias in the U.S. data is
 unlikely to be significant. To reach this conclusion, we introduce a
 general framework for modeling survival and derive a mathematical
 relationship between the ex ante survival probability and the average
 survival bias. This relationship reveals the fundamental difficulty facing
 the survival argument: High survival bias requires an ex ante probability
 of market failure, which seems unrealistically high given the history of
 world financial markets. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Term Structure of Interest Rates with Regime Shifts 
Abstract:
 We develop a term structure model where the short interest rate and the
 market price of risks are subject to discrete regime shifts. Empirical
 evidence from efficient method of moments estimation provides considerable
 support for the regime shifts model. Standard models, which include affine
 specifications with up to three factors, are sharply rejected in the data.
 Our diagnostics show that only the regime shifts model can account for the
 well-documented violations of the expectations hypothesis, the observed
 conditional volatility, and the conditional correlation across yields. We
 find that regimes are intimately related to business cycles. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Valuation of the Debt Tax Shield 
Abstract:
 In this study, we use cross-sectional regressions to estimate the value of
 the debt tax shield. Recognizing that debt is correlated with the value of
 operations along nontax dimensions, we estimate reverse regressions in
 which we regress future profitability on firm value and debt rather than
 regressing firm value on debt and profitability. Reversing the regressions
 mitigates bias and facilitates the use of market information to control
 for differences in risk and expected growth. Our estimated value for the
 debt tax shield is approximately 40 percent (10 percent) of debt balances
 (firm value), net of the personal tax disadvantage of debt. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Telling from Discrete Data Whether the Underlying Continuous-Time Model Is a Diffusion 
Abstract:
 Can discretely sampled financial data help us decide which continuous-time
 models are sensible? Diffusion processes are characterized by the
 continuity of their sample paths. This cannot be verified from the
 discrete sample path: Even if the underlying path were continuous, data
 sampled at discrete times will always appear as a succession of jumps.
 Instead, I rely on the transition density to determine whether the
 discontinuities observed are the result of the discreteness of sampling,
 or rather evidence of genuine jump dynamics for the underlying
 continuous-time process. I then focus on the implications of this approach
 for option pricing models. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Differences of Opinion and the Cross Section of Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 We provide evidence that stocks with higher dispersion in analysts'
 earnings forecasts earn lower future returns than otherwise similar
 stocks. This effect is most pronounced in small stocks and stocks that
 have performed poorly over the past year. Interpreting dispersion in
 analysts' forecasts as a proxy for differences in opinion about a stock,
 we show that this evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that prices
 will reflect the optimistic view whenever investors with the lowest
 valuations do not trade. By contrast, our evidence is inconsistent with a
 view that dispersion in analysts' forecasts proxies for risk. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: A Test of the Errors-in-Expectations Explanation of the Value/Glamour Stock Returns Performance: Evidence from Analysts' Forecasts 
Abstract:
 Several empirical studies show that investment strategies that favor the
 purchase of stocks with low prices relative to conventional measures of
 value yield higher returns. Some of these studies imply that investors are
 too optimistic about (glamour) stocks that have had good performance in
 the recent past and too pessimistic about (value) stocks that have
 performed poorly. We examine whether investors systematically overestimate
 (underestimate) the future earnings performance of glamour (value) stocks
 over the 1976 to 1997 period. Our results fail to support the
 extrapolation hypothesis that posits that the superior performance of
 value stocks is because investors make systematic errors in predicting
 future growth in earnings of out-of-favor stocks. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Corporate Diversification: What Gets Discounted? 
Abstract:
 Prior literature finds that diversified firms sell at a discount relative
 to the sum of the imputed values of their business segments. We explore
 this documented discount and argue that it stems from risk-reducing
 effects of corporate diversification. Consistent with this risk-reduction
 hypothesis, we find that (a) shareholder losses in diversification are a
 function of firm leverage, (b) all equity firms do not exhibit a
 diversification discount, and (c) using book values of debt to compute
 excess value creates a downward bias for diversified firms. Overall, the
 results indicate that diversification is insignificantly related to excess
 firm value. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Is Information Risk a Determinant of Asset Returns? 
Abstract:
 We investigate the role of information-based trading in affecting asset
 returns. We show in a rational expectation example how private information
 affects equilibrium asset returns. Using a market microstructure model, we
 derive a measure of the probability of information-based trading, and we
 estimate this measure using data for individual NYSE-listed stocks for
 1983 to 1998. We then incorporate our estimates into a Fama and French
 (1992) asset-pricing framework. Our main result is that information does
 affect asset prices. A difference of 10 percentage points in the
 probability of information-based trading between two stocks leads to a
 difference in their expected returns of 2.5 percent per year. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: No Contagion, Only Interdependence: Measuring Stock Market Comovements 
Abstract:
 Heteroskedasticity biases tests for contagion based on correlation
 coefficients. When contagion is defined as a significant increase in
 market comovement after a shock to one country, previous work suggests
 contagion occurred during recent crises. This paper shows that correlation
 coefficients are conditional on market volatility. Under certain
 assumptions, it is possible to adjust for this bias. Using this
 adjustment, there was virtually no increase in unconditional correlation
 coefficients (i.e., no contagion) during the 1997 Asian crisis, 1994
 Mexican devaluation, and 1987 U.S. market crash. There is a high level of
 market comovement in all periods, however, which we call interdependence. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: An Investigation of the Informational Role of Short Interest in the Nasdaq Market 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the relationship between the level of short interest
 and stock returns in the Nasdaq market from June 1988 through December
 1994. We find that heavily shorted firms experience significant negative
 abnormal returns ranging from	- 0.76 to  - 1.13 percent per month after
 controlling for the market, size, book-to-market, and momentum factors.
 These negative returns increase with the level of short interest,
 indicating that a higher level of short interest is a stronger bearish
 signal. We find that heavily shorted firms are more likely to be delisted
 compared to their size, book-to-market, and momentum matched control
 firms. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: The Making of a Dealer Market: From Entry to Equilibrium in the Trading of Nasdaq Stocks 
Abstract:
 This paper provides an analysis of the nature and evolution of a dealer
 market for Nasdaq stocks. Despite size differences in sample stocks, there
 is a surprising consistency to their trading. One dealer tends to dominate
 trading in a stock. Markets are concentrated and spreads are increasing in
 the volume and market share of the dominant dealer. Entry and exit are
 ubiquitous. Exiting dealers are those with very low profits and trading
 volume. Entering market makers fail to capture a meaningful share of
 trading or profits. Thus, free entry does little to improve the
 competitive nature of the market as entering dealers have little impact.
 We find, however, that for small stocks, the Nasdaq dealer market is being
 more competitive than the specialist market. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Book-to-Market Equity, Distress Risk, and Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the relationship between book-to-market equity,
 distress risk, and stock returns. Among firms with the highest distress
 risk as proxied by Ohlson's (1980) O-score, the difference in returns
 between high and low book-to-market securities is more than twice as large
 as that in other firms. This large return differential cannot be explained
 by the three-factor model or by differences in economic fundamentals.
 Consistent with mispricing arguments, firms with high distress risk
 exhibit the largest return reversals around earnings announcements, and
 the book-to-market effect is largest in small firms with low analyst
 coverage. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Empirical Evaluation of Asset-Pricing Models: A Comparison of the SDF and Beta Methods 
Abstract:
 The stochastic discount factor (SDF) method provides a unified general
 framework for econometric analysis of asset-pricing models. There have
 been concerns that, compared to the classical beta method, the generality
 of the SDF method comes at the cost of efficiency in parameter estimation
 and power in specification tests. We establish the correct framework for
 comparing the two methods and show that the SDF method is as efficient as
 the beta method for estimating risk premiums. Also, the specification test
 based on the SDF method is as powerful as the one based on the beta
 method. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.
