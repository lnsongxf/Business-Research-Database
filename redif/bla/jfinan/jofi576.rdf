Title: Effects of Corporate Diversification on Productivity 
Abstract:
 Using plant-level observations from the Longitudinal Research Database I
 show that conglomerates are more productive than stand-alone firms at a
 given point in time. Dynamically, however, firms that diversify experience
 a net reduction in productivity. While the acquired plants increase
 productivity, incumbent plants suffer. Moreover, stock prices track firm
 productivity and this tracking is equally strong for diversified and
 stand-alone firms. Therefore, lower transparency of conglomerates is
 unlikely to explain the discrepancy between productivity and stock prices
 on average. Finally, I offer some evidence that this discrepancy may arise
 because conglomerates dissipate rents in the form of higher wages. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: FX Trading and Exchange Rate Dynamics 
Abstract:
 I examine the sources of exchange rate dynamics by focusing on the
 information structure of FX trading. This structure permits the existence
 of an equilibrium distribution of transaction prices at a point in time. I
 develop and estimate a model of the price distribution using data from the
 Deutsche mark/dollar market that prroduces two striking results:(1) Much
 of the short-term volatility in exchange rates comes from sampling the
 heterogeneous trading decisions of dealers in a distribution that, under
 normal market conditions, changes comparatively slowly; (2) public news is
 rarely the predominant source of exchange rate movements over
 "any"horizon. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Momentum Trading by Institutions 
Abstract:
 We document the equity trading practices of approximately 1,200
 institutions from the third quarter of 1987 through the third quarter of
 1995. We decompose trading by institutions into the initiation of new
 positions (entry), the termination of previous positions (exit), and
 adjustments to ongoing holdings. Institutions act as momentum traders when
 they enter stocks but as contrarian traders when they exit or make
 adjustments to ongoing holdings. We find significant differences in
 trading practices among different types of institutions. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Learning about Internal Capital Markets from Corporate Spin-offs 
Abstract:
 We examine the investment behavior of firms before and after being spun
 off from their parent companies. Their investment after the spin-off is
 significantly more sensitive to measures of investment opportunities
 (e.g., industry Tobin's "Q"or industry investment) than it is before the
 spin-off. Spin-offs tend to cut investment in low "Q"industries and
 increase investment in high "Q"industries. These changes are observed
 primarily in spin-offs of firms in industries unrelated to the parents'
 industries and in spin-offs where the stock market reacts favorably to the
 spin-off announcement. Our findings suggest that spin-offs may improve the
 allocation of capital. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: When Is Bad News Really Bad News? 
Abstract:
 We examine whether the price response to bad and good earnings shocks
 changes as the relative level of the market changes. The study is based on
 a complete sample of annual earnings announcements during the period 1988
 to 1998. The relative level of the market is based on the difference
 between the current market P/E and the average market P/E over the prior
 12 months. We find that the stock price response to negative earnings
 surprises increases as the relative level of the market rises.
 Furthermore, the difference between bad news and good news earnings
 response coefficients rises with the market. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Does Distance Still Matter? The Information Revolution in Small Business Lending 
Abstract:
 The distance between small firms and their lenders is increasing, and they
 are communicating in more impersonal ways. After documenting these
 systematic changes, we demonstrate they do not arise from small firms
 locating differently, consolidation in the banking industry, or biases in
 the sample. Instead, improvements in lender productivity appear to explain
 our findings. We also find distant firms no longer have to be the highest
 quality credits, indicating they have greater access to credit. The
 evidence indicates there has been substantial development of the financial
 sector, even in areas such as small business lending. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Noise Trading, Costly Arbitrage, and Asset Prices: Evidence from Closed-end Funds 
Abstract:
 If arbitrage is costly and noise traders are active, asset prices may
 deviate from fundamental values for long periods of time. We use a sample
 of 158 closed-end funds to show that noise-trader sentiment, as proxied by
 retail-investor flows, leads to fluctuations in the discount.
 Nevertheless, we reject the hypothesis that noise-trader risk is the cause
 of the long-run discount. Instead we find that funds which are more
 difficult to arbitrage have larger discounts, due to: (1) the censoring of
 the discount by the arbitrage bounds, and (2) the freedom of managers to
 increase charges when arbitrage is costly. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Long-Run Performance following Private Placements of Equity 
Abstract:
 Public firms that place equity privately experience positive announcements
 effects, with negative post-announcement stock-price performance. This
 finding is inconsistent with the underreaction hypothesis. Instead, it
 suggests that investors are overoptimistic about the prospects of firms
 issuing equity, regardless of the method of issuance. Further, in contrast
 to public offerings, private issues follow periods of relatively poor
 operating performance. Thus, investor overoptimism at the time of private
 issues is not due to the behavioral tendency to overweight recent
 experience at the expense of long-term averages. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Managerial Turnover and Leverage under a Takeover Threat 
Abstract:
 How do shareholders perceive managers who lever up under a takeover
 threat? Increasing leverage conveys good news if it reflects management's
 ability to enhance value. It conveys bad news, though, if inefficient
 managers are more pressured to lever up than the efficient ones. This
 paper demonstrates that negative updating may prevail. Managers who lever
 up to end a takeover threat may thus commit to enhance value and yet
 increase their chances of being replaced by their shareholders. The model
 provides implications for the dispersion of intraindustry leverage and for
 the stock price reaction to debt-for-equity exchanges. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: The Geography of Equity Listing: Why Do Companies List Abroad? 
Abstract:
 This paper documents aggregate trends in the foreign listings of
 companies, and analyzes their distinctive prelisting characteristics and
 postlisting performance. In 1986-1997, many European companies listed
 abroad, mainly on U.S. exchanges, while the number of U.S. companies
 listed in Europe decreased. European companies that cross-list tend to be
 large and recently privatized firms, and expand their foreign sales after
 listing abroad. They differ sharply depending on where they cross-list:
 The U.S. exchanges attract high-tech and export-oriented companies that
 expand rapidly without significant leveraging. Companies cross-listing
 within Europe do not grow unusually fast, and increase their leverage
 after cross-listing. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Tunneling or Value Added? Evidence from Mergers by Korean Business Groups 
Abstract:
 We examine whether firms belonging to Korean business groups (chaebols)
 benefit from acquisitions they make or whether such acquisitions provide a
 way for controlling shareholders to increase their wealth by increasing
 the value of other group firms (tunneling). We find that when a
 chaebol-affiliated firm makes an acquisition, its stock price on average
 falls. While minority shareholders of a chaebol-affiliated firm making an
 acquisition lose, the controlling shareholder of that firm on average
 benefits because the acquisition enhances the value of other firms in the
 group. This evidence is consistent with the tunneling hypothesis. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Disentangling the Incentive and Entrenchment Effects of Large Shareholdings 
Abstract:
 This article disentangles the incentive and entrenchment effects of large
 ownership. Using data for 1,301 publicly traded corporations in eight East
 Asian economies, we find that firm value increases with the cash-flow
 ownership of the largest shareholder, consistent with a positive incentive
 effect. But firm value falls when the control rights of the largest
 shareholder exceed its cash-flow ownership, consistent with an
 entrenchment effect. Given that concentrated corporate ownership is
 predominant in most countries, these findings have relevance for corporate
 governance across the world. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Internal Capital Markets in Financial Conglomerates: Evidence from Small Bank Responses to Monetary Policy 
Abstract:
 This paper looks at internal capital markets in financial conglomerates by
 comparing the responses of small subsidiary and independent banks to
 monetary policy. I find that internal capital markets in financial
 conglomerates relax the credit constraints faced by smaller bank
 affiliates. Further analysis indicates that those markets lessen the
 impact of Fed policies on bank lending activity. The paper also examines
 the role of internal capital markets in influencing the investment
 allocation process of those conglomerates. My findings suggest that
 frictions between conglomerate headquarters and external capital markets
 are at the root of investment inefficiencies generated by internal capital
 markets. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.

Title: Entrepreneurship and Bank Credit Availability 
Abstract:
 The literature is divided on the expected effects of increased competition
 and consolidation in the financial sector on the supply of credit to
 relationship borrowers. This paper tests whether policy changes fostering
 competition and consolidation in U.S. banking helped or harmed
 entrepreneurs. We find that the rate of new incorporations increases
 following deregulation of branching restrictions, and that deregulation
 reduces the negative effect of concentration on new incorporations. We
 also find the formation of new incorporations increases as the share of
 small banks decreases, suggesting that diversification benefits of size
 outweigh the possible comparative advantage small banks may have in
 forging relationships. Copyright The American Finance Association 2002.
