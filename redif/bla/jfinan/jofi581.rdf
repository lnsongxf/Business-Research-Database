Title: The Quiet Period Goes out with a Bang 
Abstract:
 We examine the expiration of the IPO quiet period, which occurs after the
 25-super-th calendar day following the offering. For IPOs during 1996 to
 2000, we find that analyst coverage is initiated immediately for 76
 percent of these firms, almost always with a favorable rating. Initiated
 firms experience a five-day abnormal return of 4.1 percent versus 0.1
 percent for firms with no coverage. The abnormal returns are concentrated
 in the days just before the quiet period expires. Abnormal returns are
 much larger when coverage is initiated by multiple analysts. It does not
 matter whether a recommendation comes from the lead underwriter or not. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Clearly Irrational Financial Market Behavior: Evidence from the Early Exercise of Exchange Traded Stock Options 
Abstract:
 This paper analyzes the early exercise of exchange-traded options by
 different classes of investors over the 1996 to 1999 period. A large
 number of exercises are identified as clearly irrational without invoking
 any model of market equilibrium. Customers of discount brokers and
 customers of full-service brokers both engage in a significant number of
 irrational exercises while traders at large investment houses exhibit no
 irrational early exercise behavior. Rational and irrational exercise is
 triggered for discount and full-service customers by the underlying stock
 price attaining its highest level over the past year and by high returns
 on the underlying stock. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Why Do Managers Diversify Their Firms? Agency Reconsidered 
Abstract:
 We develop a contracting model between shareholders and managers in which
 managers diversify their firms for two reasons: to reduce idiosyncratic
 risk and to capture private benefits. We test the comparative static
 predictions of our model. In contrast to previous work, we find that
 diversification is positively related to managerial incentives. Further,
 the link between firm performance and managerial incentives is weaker for
 firms that experience changes in diversification than it is for firms that
 do not. Our findings suggest that managers diversify their firms in
 response to changes in private benefits rather than to reduce their
 exposure to risk. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Modeling Sovereign Yield Spreads: A Case Study of Russian Debt 
Abstract:
 We construct a model for pricing sovereign debt that accounts for the
 risks of both default and restructuring, and allows for compensation for
 illiquidity. Using a new and relatively efficient method, we estimate the
 model using Russian dollar-denominated bonds. We consider the determinants
 of the Russian yield spread, the yield differential across different
 Russian bonds, and the implications for market integration, relative
 liquidity, relative expected recovery rates, and implied expectations of
 different default scenarios. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Asset Pricing with Conditioning Information: A New Test 
Abstract:
 This paper presents a new test of conditional versions of the
 Sharpe-Lintner CAPM, the Jagannathan and Wang (1996) extension of the
 CAPM, and the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model. The test is based
 on a general nonparametric methodology that avoids functional form
 misspecification of betas, risk premia, and the stochastic discount
 factor. Our results provide a novel view of empirical performance of these
 models. In particular, we find that a nonparametric version of the Fama
 and French model performs well, even when challenged by momentum
 portfolios. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: New Evidence on the Market for Directors: Board Membership and Pennsylvania Senate Bill 1310 
Abstract:
 We examine the relation between a board's decision to reject antitakeover
 provisions of Pennsylvania Senate Bill 1310 and subsequent labor market
 opportunities of those same board members. Compared to directors retaining
 all provisions, directors rejecting all protective provisions of SB1310
 are three times as likely to gain additional external directorships and
 are 30 percent more likely to retain their internal slot on the board of
 that same Pennsylvania company. For external board seats, the results are
 driven by nonexecutive directors who are not members of the management
 team; for internal board seats, the results are driven by executive
 directors. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Dynamic Asset Allocation with Event Risk 
Abstract:
 Major events often trigger abrupt changes in stock prices and volatility.
 We study the implications of jumps in prices and volatility on investment
 strategies. Using the event-risk framework of Duffie, Pan, and Singleton
 (2000), we provide analytical solutions to the optimal portfolio problem.
 Event risk dramatically affects the optimal strategy. An investor facing
 event risk is less willing to take leveraged or short positions. The
 investor acts as if some portion of his wealth may become illiquid and the
 optimal strategy blends both dynamic and buy-and-hold strategies. Jumps in
 prices and volatility both have important effects. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Dividend Taxes and Share Prices: Evidence from Real Estate Investment Trusts 
Abstract:
 Prior empirical evidence regarding the impact of dividend taxes on firm
 valuation is mixed. This study avoids some of the complications
 encountered in previous empirical work by exploiting institutional
 characteristics of REITs, such as their limited discretion over dividend
 policy and the relative transparency of REIT assets. We regress the market
 value of equity on the market value of assets and tax basis, which creates
 tax deductions that lower future dividend taxes without affecting future
 pretax cash flow. We find that firm value is positively related to tax
 basis, suggesting that future dividend taxes are capitalized into share
 prices. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Delegated Portfolio Management and Rational Prolonged Mispricing 
Abstract:
 This paper examines how information becomes reflected in prices when
 investment decisions are delegated to fund managers whose tenure may be
 shorter than the time it takes for their private information to become
 public. We consider a sequence of managers, where each subsequent manager
 inherits the portfolio of their predecessor. We show that the inherited
 portfolio distorts the subsequent manager's incentive to trade on
 long-term information. This allows erroneous past information to persist,
 causing mispricing similar to a bubble. We investigate the magnitude of
 the mispricing. In addition, we examine endogenous information quality. In
 some cases, information quality increases when the manager's expected
 tenure decreases. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Analyzing the Analysts: Career Concerns and Biased Earnings Forecasts 
Abstract:
 We examine security analysts' career concerns by relating their earnings
 forecasts to job separations. Relatively accurate forecasters are more
 likely to experience favorable career outcomes like moving up to a
 high-status brokerage house. Controlling for accuracy, analysts who are
 optimistic relative to the consensus are more likely to experience
 favorable job separations. For analysts who cover stocks underwritten by
 their houses, job separations depend less on accuracy and more on
 optimism. Job separations were less sensitive to accuracy and more
 sensitive to optimism during the recent stock market mania. Brokerage
 houses apparently reward optimistic analysts who promote stocks. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Trade Credit, Financial Intermediary Development, and Industry Growth 
Abstract:
 Recent work suggests that financial development is important for economic
 growth, since financial markets more effectively allocate capital to firms
 with high value projects. For firms in poorly developed financial markets,
 implicit borrowing in the form of trade credit may provide an alternative
 source of funds. We show that industries with higher dependence on trade
 credit financing exhibit higher rates of growth in countries with weaker
 financial institutions. Furthermore, consistent with barriers to trade
 credit access among young firms, we show that most of the effect that we
 report comes from growth in the size of preexisting firms. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Financial Distress and Bank Lending Relationships 
Abstract:
 We use a unique data set of bank loans to examine the wealth effects on
 lead lending banks when their borrowers suffer financial distress. We find
 a significant negative announcement return for the lead lending bank when
 a major corporate borrower announces default or bankruptcy. Banks with
 higher exposure to the distressed firm have larger negative
 announcement-period returns. The existence of a past lending relationship
 with the distressed firm results in larger wealth declines for the bank
 shareholders. Finally, financial distress also has a significant negative
 effect on borrower's returns. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: A Monte Carlo Method for Optimal Portfolios 
Abstract:
 This paper proposes a new simulation-based approach for optimal portfolio
 allocation in realistic environments with complex dynamics for the state
 variables and large numbers of factors and assets. A first illustration
 involves a choice between equity and cash with nonlinear interest rate and
 market price of risk dynamics. Intertemporal hedging demands significantly
 increase the demand for stocks and exhibit low volatility. We then analyze
 settings where stock returns are also predicted by dividend yields and
 where investors have wealth-dependent relative risk aversion. Large-scale
 problems with many assets, including the Nasdaq, SP500, bonds, and cash,
 are also examined. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Capital Gains, Dividend Yields, and Expected Inflation 
Abstract:
 One explanation for the negative relationship between short-horizon stock
 returns and inflation is that inflation proxies (inversely) for expected
 future real output. In this paper, I examine the possibility that
 inflation also proxies for variation in real price/dividend ratios (excess
 returns). I show that when the covariance between real price/dividend
 ratios and inflation is nonzero, the relationship between returns and
 expected inflation differs for the two components of returns: dividend
 yields and capital gains returns. My empirical evidence demonstrates that
 dividend yields and capital gains are related differently to expected
 inflation in U.S. and foreign markets. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.
