Title: Pseudo Market Timing and the Long-Run Underperformance of IPOs 
Abstract:
 Numerous studies document long-run underperformance by firms following
 equity offerings. This paper shows that underperformance is very likely to
 be observed "ex-post" in an efficient market. The premise is that more
 firms issue equity at higher stock prices even though they cannot predict
 future returns. "Ex-post", issuers seem to time the market because
 offerings cluster at market peaks. Simulations based on 1973 through 1997
 data reveal that when "ex-ante" expected abnormal returns are zero, median
 "ex-post" underperformance for equity issuers will be significantly
 negative in event-time. Using calendar-time returns solves the problem. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Entrenchment and Severance Pay in Optimal Governance Structures 
Abstract:
 This paper explores how motivating an incumbent CEO to undertake actions
 that improve the effectiveness of his management interacts with the firm's
 policy on CEO replacement. Such policy depends on the presence and the
 size of severance pay in the CEO's compensation package and on the CEO's
 influence on the board of directors regarding his own replacement (i.e.,
 entrenchment). We explain when and why the combination of some degree of
 entrenchment and a sizeable severance package is desirable. The analysis
 offers predictions about the correlation between entrenchment, severance
 pay, and incentive compensation. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Cross-Border Listings and Price Discovery: Evidence from U.S.-Listed Canadian Stocks 
Abstract:
 We examine the contribution of cross-listings to price discovery for a
 sample of Canadian stocks listed on both the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE)
 and a U.S. exchange. We find that prices on the TSE and U.S. exchange are
 cointegrated and mutually adjusting. The U.S. share of price discovery
 ranges from 0.2 percent to 98.2 percent, with an average of 38.1 percent.
 The U.S. share is directly related to the U.S. share of trading and to the
 ratio of proportions of informative trades on the U.S. exchange and the
 TSE, and inversely related to the ratio of bid-ask spreads. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Evidence of Information Spillovers in the Production of Investment Banking Services 
Abstract:
 We provide evidence that firms attempting IPOs condition offer terms and
 the decision whether to carry through with an offering on the experience
 of their primary market contemporaries. Moreover, while initial returns
 and IPO volume are positively correlated in the aggregate, the correlation
 is negative among contemporaneous offerings subject to a common valuation
 factor. Our findings are consistent with investment banks implicitly
 bundling offerings subject to a common valuation factor to achieve more
 equitable internalization of information production costs and thereby
 preventing coordination failures in primary equity markets. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: The Value Spread 
Abstract:
 We decompose the cross-sectional variance of firms' book-to-market ratios
 using both a long U.S. panel and a shorter international panel. In
 contrast to typical aggregate time-series results, transitory
 cross-sectional variation in expected 15-year stock returns causes only a
 relatively small fraction (20 to 25 percent) of the total cross-sectional
 variance. The remaining dispersion can be explained by expected 15-year
 profitability and persistence of valuation levels. Furthermore, this
 fraction appears stable across time and across types of stocks. We also
 show that the expected return on value-minus-growth strategies is
 atypically high at times when their spread in book-to-market ratios is
 wide. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: The Level and Persistence of Growth Rates 
Abstract:
 Expectations about long-term earnings growth are crucial to valuation
 models and cost of capital estimates. We analyze historical long-term
 growth rates across a broad cross section of stocks using several
 indicators of operating performance. We test for persistence and
 predictability in growth. While some firms have grown at high rates
 historically, they are relatively rare instances. There is no persistence
 in long-term earnings growth beyond chance, and there is low
 predictability even with a wide variety of predictor variables.
 Specifically, IBES growth forecasts are overly optimistic and add little
 predictive power. Valuation ratios also have limited ability to predict
 future growth. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Role of Speculative Short Sales in Price Formation: The Case of the Weekend Effect 
Abstract:
 We argue that short sellers affect prices in a significant and systematic
 manner. In particular, we contend that speculative short sales contribute
 to the weekend effect: The inability to trade over the weekend is likely
 to cause these short sellers to close their speculative positions on
 Fridays and reestablish new short positions on Mondays causing stock
 prices to rise on Fridays and fall on Mondays. We find evidence in support
 of this hypothesis based on a comparison of high short-interest stocks and
 low short-interest stocks, stocks with and without actively traded
 options, IPOs, zero short-interest stocks, and highly volatile stocks. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: How Sensitive Is Investment to Cash Flow When Financing Is Frictionless? 
Abstract:
 I analyze the sensitivity of a firm's investment to its own cash flow in
 the benchmark case where financing is frictionless. This sensitivity has
 been proposed as a measure of financing constraints in earlier studies. I
 find that the investment-cash flow sensitivities that obtain in the
 frictionless benchmark are very similar, both in magnitude and in patterns
 they exhibit, to those observed in the data. In particular, the
 sensitivity is higher for firms with high growth rates and low dividend
 payout ratios. Tobin's "q" is shown to be a more noisy measure of
 near-term investment plans for these firms. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: IPO Pricing in the Dot-com Bubble 
Abstract:
 IPO underpricing reached astronomical levels during 1999 and 2000. We show
 that the regime shift in initial returns and other elements of pricing
 behavior can be at least partially accounted for by marked changes in
 pre-IPO ownership structure and insider selling behavior over the period,
 which reduced key decision makers' incentives to control underpricing.
 After controlling for these changes, the difference in underpricing
 between 1999 and 2000 and the preceding three years is much reduced. Our
 results suggest that it was firm characteristics that were unique during
 the "dot-com bubble" and that pricing behavior followed from incentives
 created by these characteristics. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: The Finite Moment Log Stable Process and Option Pricing 
Abstract:
 We document a surprising pattern in S&P 500 option prices. When implied
 volatilities are graphed against a standard measure of moneyness, the
 implied volatility smirk does not flatten out as maturity increases up to
 the observable horizon of two years. This behavior contrasts sharply with
 the implications of many pricing models and with the asymptotic behavior
 implied by the central limit theorem (CLT). We develop a parsimonious
 model which deliberately violates the CLT assumptions and thus captures
 the observed behavior of the volatility smirk over the maturity horizon.
 Calibration exercises demonstrate its superior performance against several
 widely used alternatives. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Incentive Fees and Mutual Funds 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the effect of incentive fees on the behavior of mutual
 fund managers. Funds with incentive fees exhibit positive stock selection
 ability, but a beta less than one results in funds not earning positive
 fees. From an investor's perspective, positive alphas plus lower expense
 ratios make incentive-fee funds attractive. However, incentive-fee funds
 take on more risk than non-incentive-fee funds, and they increase risk
 after a period of poor performance. Incentive fees are useful marketing
 tools, since more new cash flows go into incentive-fee funds than into
 non-incentive-fee funds, ceteris paribus. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: A Generalization of the Brennan-Rubinstein Approach for the Pricing of Derivatives 
Abstract:
 This paper derives preference-free option pricing equations in a discrete
 time economy where asset returns have continuous distributions. There is a
 representative agent who has risk preferences with an exponential
 representation. Aggregate wealth and the underlying asset price have
 transformed normal distributions which may or may not belong to the same
 family of distributions. Those pricing results are particularly valuable
 (a) to show new sufficient conditions for existing risk-neutral option
 pricing equations (e.g., the Black-Scholes model), and (b) to obtain new
 analytical solutions for the price of European-style contingent claims
 when the underlying asset has a transformed normal distribution (e.g., a
 negatively skew lognormal distribution). Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Evaluation Periods and Asset Prices in a Market Experiment 
Abstract:
 We test whether the frequency of feedback information about the
 performance of an investment portfolio and the flexibility with which the
 investor can change the portfolio influence her risk attitude in markets.
 In line with the prediction of myopic loss aversion (Benartzi and Thaler
 (1995)), we find that more information and more flexibility result in less
 risk taking. Market prices of risky assets are significantly higher if
 feedback frequency and decision flexibility are reduced. This result
 supports the findings from individual decision making, and shows that
 market interactions do not eliminate such behavior or its consequences for
 prices. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: The Term Structure with Semi-credible Targeting 
Abstract:
 The Federal Reserve sets targets for interest rates which it enforces
 through direct market intervention. These targets are changed
 periodically. In this paper, we develop a term structure model in which
 the short rate is subject to a control which keeps it close to a target
 which changes from time to time. The probability of target changes is not
 constant in the model, but changes as a function of observables. The model
 performs well at explaining the shifts in the yield curve that accompany
 target changes. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Excessive Dollar Debt: Financial Development and Underinsurance 
Abstract:
 We propose that the limited financial development of emerging markets is a
 significant factor behind the large share of dollar-denominated external
 debt present in these markets. We show that when financial constraints
 affect borrowing and lending between domestic agents, agents undervalue
 insuring against an exchange rate depreciation. Since more of this
 insurance is present when external debt is denominated in domestic
 currency rather than in dollars, this result implies that domestic agents
 choose excessive dollar debt. We also show that limited financial
 development reduces the incentives for foreign lenders to enter emerging
 markets. The retarded entry reinforces the underinsurance problem. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: The Wealth Effects of Repurchases on Bondholders 
Abstract:
 Prior research has documented positive abnormal stock returns around the
 announcements of repurchase programs; several explanations of these
 returns have been suggested, including signaling, free cash flow, and
 wealth redistributions. This study analyzes abnormal stock, bond, and firm
 returns around repurchase announcements to examine these hypotheses. We
 find evidence consistent with both signaling and wealth redistribution.
 The loss to bondholders is a function of the size of the repurchase, and
 the risk of the firm's debt. We also find that bond ratings are twice as
 likely to be downgraded as upgraded after the announcement of the
 repurchase program. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Investor Protection and Firm Liquidity 
Abstract:
 The purpose of this study is to investigate the relation between investor
 protection and firm liquidity. We posit that less protective environments
 lead to wider bid-ask spreads and thinner depths because they fail to
 minimize information asymmetries. The Hong Kong equity market provides a
 unique opportunity to compare liquidity costs across distinct investor
 protection environments, but still within a common trading mechanism and
 currency. Our empirical findings verify that firm liquidity is
 significantly affected by investor protection. Regression and
 matched-sample results show that Hong Kong-based equities exhibit narrower
 spreads and thicker depths than their China-based counterparts. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.
