Title: Corporate Financing: An Artificial Agent-based Analysis 
Abstract:
 We examine corporate security choice by simulating an economy populated by
 adaptive agents who learn about the structure of security returns and
 prices through experience. Through a process of evolutionary selection,
 each agent gravitates toward strategies that generate the highest payoffs.
 Despite the fact that markets are perfect and agents maximize value, a
 financing hierarchy emerges in which straight debt dominates other
 financing choices. Equity and convertible debt display significant
 underpricing. In general, the smaller the probability of loss to outside
 investors, the more likely the firm is to issue the security and the
 smaller the security's underpricing. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Idiosyncratic Risk Matters! 
Abstract:
 This paper takes a new look at the predictability of stock market returns
 with risk measures. We find a significant positive relation between
 average stock variance (largely idiosyncratic) and the return on the
 market. In contrast, the variance of the market has no forecasting power
 for the market return. These relations persist after we control for
 macroeconomic variables known to forecast the stock market. The evidence
 is consistent with models of time-varying risk premia based on background
 risk and investor heterogeneity. Alternatively, our findings can be
 justified by the option value of equity in the capital structure of the
 firms. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Good Day Sunshine: Stock Returns and the Weather 
Abstract:
 Psychological evidence and casual intuition predict that sunny weather is
 associated with upbeat mood. This paper examines the relationship between
 morning sunshine in the city of a country's leading stock exchange and
 daily market index returns across 26 countries from 1982 to 1997. Sunshine
 is strongly significantly correlated with stock returns. After controlling
 for sunshine, rain and snow are unrelated to returns. Substantial use of
 weather-based strategies was optimal for a trader with very low
 transactions costs. However, because these strategies involve frequent
 trades, fairly modest costs eliminate the gains. These findings are
 difficult to reconcile with fully rational price setting. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Internal versus External Financing: An Optimal Contracting Approach 
Abstract:
 We study optimal financial contracting for centralized and decentralized
 firms. Under centralized contracting, headquarters raises funds on behalf
 of multiple projects. Under decentralized contracting, each project raises
 funds separately on the external capital market. The benefit of
 centralization is that headquarters can use excess liquidity from high
 cash-flow projects to buy continuation rights for low cash-flow projects.
 The cost is that headquarters may pool cash flows from several projects
 and self-finance follow-up investments without having to return to the
 capital market. Absent any capital market discipline, it is more difficult
 to force headquarters to make repayments, which tightens financing
 constraints ex ante. Cross-sectionally, our model implies that
 conglomerates should have a lower average productivity than stand-alone
 firms. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Long-run Performance after Stock Splits: 1927 to 1996 
Abstract:
 We measure the postsplit performance of 12,747 stock splits from 1927 to
 1996 using two methods to measure abnormal returns: size and
 book-to-market reference portfolios with bootstrapping, and calendar-time
 abnormal returns combined with factor models. Between 1927 and 1996,
 neither method applied to splits 25 percent or larger finds performance
 significantly different from zero. Over selected subperiods, subsamples of
 2-1 splits restricted by book-to-market availability requirements display
 positive abnormal returns using some methods. However, these samples show
 small or negligible abnormal returns using the calendar-time method.
 Overall, the stock split evidence against market efficiency is neither
 pervasive nor compelling. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Too Busy to Mind the Business? Monitoring by Directors with Multiple Board Appointments 
Abstract:
 We examine the number of external appointments held by corporate
 directors. Directors who serve larger firms and sit on larger boards are
 more likely to attract directorships. Consistent with Fama and Jensen
 (1983), we find that firm performance has a positive effect on the number
 of appointments held by a director. We find no evidence that multiple
 directors shirk their responsibilities to serve on board committees. We do
 not find that multiple directors are associated with a greater likelihood
 of securities fraud litigation. We conclude that the evidence does not
 support calls for limits on directorships held by an individual. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: DotCom Mania: The Rise and Fall of Internet Stock Prices 
Abstract:
 This paper explores a model based on agents with heterogenous beliefs
 facing short sales restrictions, and its explanation for the rise,
 persistence, and eventual fall of Internet stock prices. First, we
 document substantial short sale restrictions for Internet stocks. Second,
 using data on Internet holdings and block trades, we show a link between
 heterogeneity and price effects for Internet stocks. Third, arguing that
 lockup expirations are a loosening of the short sale constraint, we
 document average, long-run excess returns as low as  - 33 percent for
 Internet stocks postlockup. We link the Internet bubble burst to the
 unprecedented level of lockup expirations and insider selling. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Convertible Securities and Venture Capital Finance 
Abstract:
 This paper offers a new explanation for the prevalent use of convertible
 securities in venture capital finance. Convertible securities can be used
 to endogenously allocate cash-flow rights as a function of the state of
 the world and the entrepreneur's effort. This property can be used to
 induce the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist to invest efficiently
 into the project. The result is robust to renegotiation and to changes in
 the timing of investments and information flows. The model is consistent
 with the observations that conversion is often automatic and that
 convertible securities are rarely used by outside investors. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Integration of Lending and Underwriting: Implications of Scope Economies 
Abstract:
 Informational scope economies provide a cost advantage to universal banks
 offering "one-stop shopping" for lending and underwriting that enables
 them to "lock in" their clients' subsequent business. This market power
 reduces universal banks' incentive, relative to that of specialized
 investment banks, to apply costly underwriting efforts; consequently,
 universal banks are less successful in selling their clients' securities.
 Our results suggest that an integrated financial services market is less
 innovative than one with specialized intermediaries. Our analysis also
 identifies economy, intermediary, and firm characteristics that motivate
 either the integration or segmentation of bank lending and underwriting. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Managerial Incentives and Internal Capital Markets 
Abstract:
 Capital budgeting in multidivisional firms depends on the external
 assessment of the whole firm, as well as on headquarters' assessment of
 the divisions. While corporate headquarters may create value by directly
 monitoring divisions, the external assessment of the firm is a public good
 for division managers who, consequently, are tempted to free ride. As the
 number of divisions increases, the free-rider problem is aggravated, and
 internal capital markets substitute for external capital markets in the
 provision of managerial incentives. The analysis relates the value of
 diversification to characteristics of the firm, the industry, and the
 capital market. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: What if Trading Location Is Different from Business Location? Evidence from the Jardine Group 
Abstract:
 We examine the price behavior and market activity of the Jardine Group
 companies after they were delisted from Hong Kong in 1994. Although the
 trading activity of the Jardine Group moved to Singapore, the core
 businesses remained in Hong Kong and Mainland China. Evidence indicates
 the Jardine stocks are correlated less (more) with the Hong Kong
 (Singapore) market after the delisting. This result cannot be explained by
 various hypotheses, such as relocation of core business, time-varying
 betas, migration of trading activity, and currency and tax distortions. We
 conclude that price fluctuations are affected by country-specific investor
 sentiment. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Market Maker Quotation Behavior and Pretrade Transparency 
Abstract:
 We examine the impact of differing levels of pretrade transparency on the
 quotation behavior of Nasdaq market makers. We find that market makers are
 more likely to quote on odd ticks, and to actively narrow the spread, when
 they can do so anonymously by posting limit orders on Electronic
 Communication Networks (ECNs). From a public policy perspective, our
 findings suggest that making the level of pretrade transparency on Nasdaq
 more opaque by allowing anonymous quotes could improve price competition
 and narrow spreads further. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: The Impact of Jumps in Volatility and Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper examines continuous-time stochastic volatility models
 incorporating jumps in returns and volatility. We develop a
 likelihood-based estimation strategy and provide estimates of parameters,
 spot volatility, jump times, and jump sizes using S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100
 index returns. Estimates of jump times, jump sizes, and volatility are
 particularly useful for identifying the effects of these factors during
 periods of market stress, such as those in 1987, 1997, and 1998. Using
 formal and informal diagnostics, we find strong evidence for jumps in
 volatility and jumps in returns. Finally, we study how these factors and
 estimation risk impact option pricing. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Founding-Family Ownership and Firm Performance: Evidence from the S&P 500 
Abstract:
 We investigate the relation between founding-family ownership and firm
 performance. We find that family ownership is both prevalent and
 substantial; families are present in one-third of the S&P 500 and account
 for 18 percent of outstanding equity. Contrary to our conjecture, we find
 family firms perform better than nonfamily firms. Additional analysis
 reveals that the relation between family holdings and firm performance is
 nonlinear and that when family members serve as CEO, performance is better
 than with outside CEOs. Overall, our results are "inconsistent" with the
 hypothesis that minority shareholders are adversely affected by family
 ownership, suggesting that family ownership is an effective organizational
 structure. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.
