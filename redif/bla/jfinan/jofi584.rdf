Title: Presidential Address: Liquidity and Price Discovery 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the implications of market microstructure for asset
 pricing. I argue that asset pricing ignores the central fact that asset
 prices evolve in markets. Markets provide liquidity and price discovery,
 and I argue that asset pricing models need to be recast in broader terms
 to incorporate the transactions costs of liquidity and the risks of price
 discovery. I argue that symmetric information-based asset pricing models
 do not work because they assume that the underlying problems of liquidity
 and price discovery have been solved. I develop an asymmetric information
 asset pricing model that incorporates these effects. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: The Really Long-Run Performance of Initial Public Offerings: The Pre-Nasdaq Evidence 
Abstract:
 Financial economists have intensely debated the performance of IPOs using
 data after the formation of Nasdaq. This paper sheds light on this
 controversy by undertaking a large, out-of-sample study: We examine the
 performance for five years after listing of 3,661 U.S. IPOs from 1935 to
 1972. The sample displays some underperformance when event-time
 buy-and-hold abnormal returns are used. The underperformance disappears,
 however, when cumulative abnormal returns are utilized. A calendar-time
 analysis shows that over the entire period, IPOs return as much as the
 market. The intercepts in CAPM and Fama-French regressions are
 insignificantly different from zero, suggesting no abnormal performance. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics? 
Abstract:
 Even though stock returns are not highly autocorrelated, there is a
 spurious regression bias in predictive regressions for stock returns
 related to the classic studies of <link rid="b49">Yule (1926)</link> and
 <link rid="b21">Granger and Newbold (1974)</link>. Data mining for
 predictor variables interacts with spurious regression bias. The two
 effects reinforce each other, because more highly persistent series are
 more likely to be found significant in the search for predictor variables.
 Our simulations suggest that many of the regressions in the literature,
 based on individual predictor variables, may be spurious. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Bookbuilding: How Informative Is the Order Book? 
Abstract:
 We examine the institutional bids submitted under the bookbuilding
 procedure for a sample of international equity issues. We find that
 information in bids which include a limit price, especially those of large
 and frequent bidders, affects the issue price. Oversubscription has a
 smaller but significant effect for IPOs. Public information affects the
 issue price to the extent that it is reflected in the bids.
 Oversubscription and demand elasticity are positively correlated with the
 first-day aftermarket return, and demand elasticity is negatively
 correlated with aftermarket volatility. Our results support the view that
 bookbuilding is designed to extract information from investors. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Ownership Structure, Corporate Governance, and Firm Value: Evidence from the East Asian Financial Crisis 
Abstract:
 We use a sample of 800 firms in eight East Asian countries to study the
 effect of ownership structure on value during the region's financial
 crisis. The crisis negatively impacted firms' investment opportunities,
 raising the incentives of controlling shareholders to expropriate minority
 investors. Crisis period stock returns of firms in which managers have
 high levels of control rights, but have separated their control and cash
 flow ownership, are 10-20 percentage points lower than those of other
 firms. The evidence is consistent with the view that ownership structure
 plays an important role in determining whether insiders expropriate
 minority shareholders. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Does Shareholder Composition Matter? Evidence from the Market Reaction to Corporate Earnings Announcements 
Abstract:
 We examine whether institutional ownership composition is related to
 parameters of the market reaction to negative earnings announcements. When
 firms report earnings below analysts' expectations, the stock price
 response is more negative for firms with higher levels of ownership by
 momentum or aggressive growth investors. There is no evidence, however,
 that these institutions cause an "overreaction" to earnings news.
 Ownership structure is also related to trading volume and to stock price
 volatility on days around earnings announcements. Our findings are
 consistent with the idea that the composition of institutional
 shareholders effects stock price behavior around the release of corporate
 information. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Rumors 
Abstract:
 A Kyle (1985) model with private information diffusion is used to examine
 the motivation to spread stock tips. An informed investor with limited
 investment capacity spreads imprecise rumors to an audience of followers.
 Followers trade on the advice and move the price. Due to the imprecision
 of the rumor, the price overshoots with positive probability. This gives
 the rumormonger the opportunity to trade twice: First when she receives
 information, then when she knows the price to be overshooting. In
 equilibrium, rumors are informative and both rumormongers and followers
 increase their profits at the expense of uninformed liquidity traders. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Momentum and Reversals in Equity-Index Returns During Periods of Abnormal Turnover and Return Dispersion 
Abstract:
 We document new patterns in the dynamics between stock returns and trading
 volume. Specifically, we find substantial momentum (reversals) in
 consecutive weekly returns when the latter week has unexpectedly high
 (low) turnover. This pattern is evident in equity indices, index futures,
 and individual stocks. Similarly, we also find that the autocorrelation in
 equity-index returns is increasing with the unexpected dispersion across
 the latter week's firm-level returns. Weeks with extreme turnover and
 dispersion shocks (both high and low) tend to have more macroeconomic news
 releases. Our findings bear on understanding price formation and the
 economic interpretation of turnover and dispersion shocks. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Incentive Compensation When Executives Can Hedge the Market: Evidence of Relative Performance Evaluation in the Cross Section 
Abstract:
 Little evidence exists that firms index executive compensation to remove
 the influence of marketwide factors. We argue that executives can, in
 principle, replicate such indexation in their private portfolios. In
 support, we find that market risk has little effect on the use of
 stock-based pay for the average executive. But executives' ability to
 "undo" excessive market risk can be hindered by wealth constraints and
 inalienability of human capital. We replicate the standard result that
 there is little relative performance evaluation (RPE) for the average
 executive, but find strong evidence of RPE for younger executives and
 executives with less financial wealth. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Tax-Induced Trading of Equity Securities: Evidence from the ADR Market 
Abstract:
 We examine ex-dividend date trading of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)
 using a sample of 1,043 dividends over the period 1988 to 1995. ADR
 dividends are often subject to foreign withholding taxes, creating
 incentives for certain investors to avoid the distribution. ADRs exhibit
 negative abnormal ex-dividend day returns, and their prices behave
 consistently with their related withholding taxes. Abnormal trading volume
 for taxable issues exceeds 130 percent and 300 percent of normal volume on
 the cum- and ex-dates, respectively. Abnormal volume is an increasing
 function of foreign withholding tax rates and decreasing function of
 transactions costs. This abnormal ex-date trading activity is consistent
 with tax-motivated trading. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Performance Incentives within Firms: The Effect of Managerial Responsibility 
Abstract:
 We show that top management incentives vary by responsibility. For
 oversight executives, pay-performance incentives are $1.22 per thousand
 dollar increase in shareholder wealth higher than for divisional
 executives. For CEOs, incentives are $5.65 higher than for divisional
 executives. Incentives for the median top management team are substantial
 at $32.32. CEOs account for 42 to 58 percent of aggregate team incentives.
 For divisional executives, the pay-"divisional" performance sensitivity is
 positive and increasing in the precision of divisional performance and the
 pay-"firm" performance sensitivity is decreasing in the precision of
 divisional performance. These results support principal-agent models with
 multiple signals of managerial effort. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Risk Reduction in Large Portfolios: Why Imposing the Wrong Constraints Helps 
Abstract:
 Green and Hollifield (1992) argue that the presence of a dominant factor
 would result in extreme negative weights in mean-variance efficient
 portfolios even in the absence of estimation errors. In that case,
 imposing no-short-sale constraints should hurt, whereas empirical evidence
 is often to the contrary. We reconcile this apparent contradiction. We
 explain why constraining portfolio weights to be nonnegative can reduce
 the risk in estimated optimal portfolios even when the constraints are
 wrong. Surprisingly, with no-short-sale constraints in place, the sample
 covariance matrix performs as well as covariance matrix estimates based on
 factor models, shrinkage estimators, and daily data. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: High-Water Marks and Hedge Fund Management Contracts 
Abstract:
 Incentive fees for money managers are frequently accompanied by high-water
 mark provisions that condition the payment of the performance fee upon
 exceeding the previously achieved maximum share value. In this paper, we
 show that hedge fund performance fees are valuable to money managers, and
 conversely, represent a claim on a significant proportion of investor
 wealth. The high-water mark provisions in these contracts limit the value
 of the performance fees. We provide a closed-form solution to the cost of
 the high-water mark contract under certain conditions. Our results provide
 a framework for valuation of a hedge fund management company. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.
