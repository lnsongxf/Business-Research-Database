Title: Stock Valuation and Learning about Profitability 
Abstract:
 We develop a simple approach to valuing stocks in the presence of learning
 about average profitability. The market-to-book ratio (M/B) increases with
 uncertainty about average profitability, especially for firms that pay no
 dividends. M/B is predicted to decline over a firm's lifetime due to
 learning, with steeper decline when the firm is young. These predictions
 are confirmed empirically. Data also support the predictions that younger
 stocks and stocks that pay no dividends have more volatile returns. Firm
 profitability has become more volatile recently, helping explain the
 puzzling increase in average idiosyncratic return volatility observed over
 the past few decades. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Currency Orders and Exchange Rate Dynamics: An Explanation for the Predictive Success of Technical Analysis 
Abstract:
 This paper documents clustering in currency stop-loss and take-profit
 orders, and uses that clustering to provide an explanation for two
 familiar predictions from technical analysis: (1) trends tend to reverse
 course at predictable support and resistance levels, and (2) trends tend
 to be unusually rapid after rates cross such levels. The data are the
 first available on individual currency stop-loss and take-profit orders.
 Take-profit orders cluster particularly strongly at round numbers, which
 could explain the first prediction. Stop-loss orders cluster strongly just
 beyond round numbers, which could explain the second prediction. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: S&P 500 Index Additions and Earnings Expectations 
Abstract:
 Stock price increases associated with addition to the S&P 500 Index have
 been interpreted as evidence that demand curves for stocks slope downward.
 A key premise underlying this interpretation is that Index inclusion
 provides no new information about companies' future prospects. We examine
 this premise by analyzing analysts' earnings per share (eps) forecasts
 around Index inclusion and by comparing postinclusion realized earnings to
 preinclusion forecasts. Relative to benchmark companies, companies newly
 added to the Index experience significant increases in eps forecasts and
 significant improvements in realized earnings. These results indicate that
 S&P Index inclusion is not an information-free event. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: The Presidential Puzzle: Political Cycles and the Stock Market 
Abstract:
 The excess return in the stock market is higher under Democratic than
 Republican presidencies: 9 percent for the value-weighted and 16 percent
 for the equal-weighted portfolio. The difference comes from higher real
 stock returns and lower real interest rates, is statistically significant,
 and is robust in subsamples. The difference in returns is not explained by
 business-cycle variables related to expected returns, and is not
 concentrated around election dates. There is no difference in the
 riskiness of the stock market across presidencies that could justify a
 risk premium. The difference in returns through the political cycle is
 therefore a puzzle. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Risk Management with Derivatives by Dealers and Market Quality in Government Bond Markets 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates how bond dealers manage core business risk with
 interest rate futures and the extent to which market quality is affected
 by their selective risk taking. We observe that dealers use futures to
 take directional bets and hedge changes in their spot exposure. We find
 that, cross-sectionally, a dealer with longer (shorter) risk exposure
 sells (buys) a larger amount of exposure the next day. However, this risk
 control takes place via the futures market and not the spot market.
 Finally, we find strong support for the price effects of capital
 constraints emphasized by <link rid="b14">Froot and Stein (1998)</link>. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Empirical Tests for Stochastic Dominance Efficiency 
Abstract:
 We derive empirical tests for the stochastic dominance efficiency of a
 given portfolio with respect to all possible portfolios constructed from a
 set of assets. The tests can be computed using straightforward linear
 programming. Bootstrapping techniques and asymptotic distribution theory
 can approximate the sampling properties of the test results and allow for
 statistical inference. Our results could provide a stimulus to the further
 proliferation of stochastic dominance for the problem of portfolio
 selection and evaluation. Using our tests, the Fama and French market
 portfolio is significantly inefficient relative to benchmark portfolios
 formed on market capitalization and book-to-market equity ratio. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: An Empirical Analysis of Analysts' Target Prices: Short-term Informativeness and Long-term Dynamics 
Abstract:
 Using a large database of analysts' target prices issued over the period
 1997-1999, we examine short-term market reactions to target price
 revisions and long-term comovement of target and stock prices. We find a
 significant market reaction to the information contained in analysts'
 target prices, both unconditionally and conditional on contemporaneously
 issued stock recommendation and earnings forecast revisions. Using a
 cointegration approach, we analyze the long-term behavior of market and
 target prices. We find that, on average, the one-year-ahead target price
 is 28 percent higher than the current market price. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Value versus Glamour 
Abstract:
 The fragility of the CAPM has led to a resurgence of research that
 frequently uses trading strategies based on sorting procedures to uncover
 relations between firm characteristics (such as "value" or "glamour") and
 equity returns. We examine the propensity of these strategies to generate
 statistically and economically significant profits due to our familiarity
 with the data. Under plausible assumptions, data snooping can account for
 up to 50 percent of the in-sample relations between firm characteristics
 and returns uncovered using single (one-way) sorts. The biases can be much
 larger if we simultaneously condition returns on two (or more)
 characteristics. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Corporate Board Composition, Protocols, and Voting Behavior: Experimental Evidence 
Abstract:
 We examine voting by a board designed to mitigate conflicts of interest
 between privately informed insiders and owners. Our model demonstrates
 that, as argued by researchers and the business press, boards with a
 majority of trustworthy but uninformed "watchdogs" can implement
 institutionally preferred policies. Our laboratory experiments strongly
 support this conclusion. Our model also highlights the necessity of
 penalties on insiders when there is dissension among board members.
 However, penalties for dissent appeared to have little impact on the
 experimental outcomes. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: How Investors Interpret Past Fund Returns 
Abstract:
 The literature documents a convex relation between past returns and fund
 flows of mutual funds. We show this to be consistent with fund incentives,
 because funds discard exactly those strategies which underperform. Past
 returns tell less about the future performance of funds which discard, so
 flows are less sensitive to them when they are poor. Our model predicts
 that strategy changes only occur after bad performance, and that bad
 performers who change strategy have dollar flow and future performance
 that are less sensitive to current performance than those that do not.
 Empirical tests support both predictions. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Financing and Advising: Optimal Financial Contracts with Venture Capitalists 
Abstract:
 This paper analyses the joint provision of effort by an entrepreneur and
 by an advisor to improve the productivity of an investment project.
 Without moral hazard, it is optimal that both exert effort. With moral
 hazard, if the entrepreneur's effort is more efficient (less costly) than
 the advisor's effort, the latter is not hired if she does not provide
 funds. Outside financing arises endogenously. This explains why investors
 like venture capitalists are value enhancing. The level of outside
 financing determines whether common stocks or convertible bonds should be
 issued in response to incentives. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Do Spin-offs Expropriate Wealth from Bondholders? 
Abstract:
 A wealth transfer from bondholders to stockholders is one of several
 hypotheses used to explain stockholder gains on the announcement of a
 spin-off. However, previous empirical research has not found systematic
 evidence supporting the wealth expropriation hypothesis. Using a larger
 sample with comprehensive bond data, we find evidence consistent with
 wealth expropriation. Bondholders, on average, suffer a significant
 negative abnormal return during the month of the spin-off announcement.
 However, even accounting for the loss to the bondholders, the aggregate
 value of the publicly traded debt and equity increases on a spin-off
 announcement, suggesting that the wealth expropriation hypothesis is not a
 complete explanation of the stockholder gains. In explaining the magnitude
 of the losses to bondholders, we find they are a function of the loss in
 collateral in the spun-off subsidiary and the level of financial risk of
 the parent firm. Consistent with a loss to bondholders, firms are more
 likely to have their credit rating downgraded than upgraded after a
 spin-off. Additionally, consistent with the wealth transfer hypothesis,
 losses to bondholders tend to be more severe, the larger the gains to
 shareholders. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Anticompetitive Financial Contracting: The Design of Financial Claims 
Abstract:
 This paper presents the first model where entry deterrence takes place
 through "financial" rather than "product-market" channels. In existing
 models, a firm's choice of financial instruments deters entry by affecting
 product market behavior; here entry deterrence occurs by affecting the
 credit market behavior of investors towards entrant firms. We find that to
 deter entry, the claims held on incumbent firms should be sufficiently
 risky, that is, "equity". This contrasts with the standard <link
 rid="b8">Brander and Lewis (1986)</link> result that "debt" deters entry.
 This effect is more marked the less competitive the credit market is-so
 "more credit market competition spurs more product market competition". Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Investment, Uncertainty, and Liquidity 
Abstract:
 We analyze the dynamic investment decision of a firm subject to an
 endogenous financing constraint. The threat of future funding shortfalls
 lowers the value of the firm's timing options and encourages acceleration
 of investment beyond the first-best optimal level. As well as highlighting
 another way by which capital market frictions can distort investment
 behavior, this result implies that (1) the sensitivity of investment to
 cash flow can be greatest for high-liquidity firms and (2) greater
 uncertainty has an ambiguous effect on investment. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Family Firms 
Abstract:
 We present a model of succession in a firm owned and managed by its
 founder. The founder decides between hiring a professional manager or
 leaving management to his heir, as well as on what fraction of the company
 to float on the stock exchange. We assume that a professional is a better
 manager than the heir, and describe how the founder's decision is shaped
 by the legal environment. This theory of separation of ownership from
 management includes the Anglo-Saxon and the Continental European patterns
 of corporate governance as special cases, and generates additional
 empirical predictions consistent with cross-country evidence. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Asset Trading Volume with Dynamically Complete Markets and Heterogeneous Agents 
Abstract:
 Trading volume of infinitely lived securities, such as equity, is
 generically zero in Lucas asset pricing models with heterogeneous agents.
 More generally, the end-of-period portfolio of all securities is constant
 over time and states in the generic economy. General equilibrium
 restrictions rule out trading of equity after an initial period. This
 result contrasts the prediction of portfolio allocation analyses that
 portfolio rebalancing motives produce nontrivial trade volume. Therefore,
 other causes of trade must be present in asset markets with large trading
 volume. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Hedging in the Possible Presence of Unspanned Stochastic Volatility: Evidence from Swaption Markets 
Abstract:
 This paper examines whether higher order multifactor models, with state
 variables linked "solely" to underlying LIBOR-swap rates, are by
 themselves capable of explaining and hedging interest rate derivatives, or
 whether models explicitly exhibiting features such as unspanned stochastic
 volatility are necessary. Our research shows that swaptions and even
 swaption straddles can be well hedged with LIBOR bonds alone. We examine
 the potential benefits of looking outside the LIBOR market for factors
 that might impact swaption prices without impacting swap rates, and find
 them to be minor, indicating that the swaption market is well integrated
 with the LIBOR-swap market. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: The Determinants of Underpricing for Seasoned Equity Offers 
Abstract:
 Seasoned offers were underpriced by an average of 2.2 percent during the
 1980s and 1990s, with the discount increasing substantially over time. The
 increase appears to be related to Rule 10b-21 and to economic changes
 affecting both IPOs and SEOs. Consistent with temporary price pressure,
 underpricing is positively related to offer size especially for securities
 with relatively inelastic demand. Underpricing is also positively related
 to price uncertainty and, after Rule 10b-21, to the magnitude of preoffer
 returns. Additionally, I find that underpricing is significantly related
 to underwriter pricing conventions such as price rounding and pricing
 relative to the bid quote. Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Finance Association.
