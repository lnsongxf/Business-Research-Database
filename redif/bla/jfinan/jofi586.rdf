Title: The Dynamics of Institutional and Individual Trading 
Abstract:
 We study the daily and intradaily cross-sectional relation between stock
 returns and the trading of institutional and individual investors in
 Nasdaq 100 securities. Based on the previous day's stock return, the top
 performing decile of securities is 23.9% more likely to be bought in net
 by institutions (and sold by individuals) than those in the bottom
 performance decile. Strong contemporaneous daily patterns can largely be
 explained by net institutional (individual) trading positively
 (negatively) following past intradaily excess stock returns (or the news
 associated therein). In comparison, evidence of return predictability and
 price pressure are economically small. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Equity Volatility and Corporate Bond Yields 
Abstract:
 This paper explores the effect of equity volatility on corporate bond
 yields. Panel data for the late 1990s show that idiosyncratic firm-level
 volatility can explain as much cross-sectional variation in yields as can
 credit ratings. This finding, together with the upward trend in
 idiosyncratic equity volatility documented by <link rid="b3">Campbell,
 Lettau, Malkiel, and Xu (2001)</link>, helps to explain recent increases
 in corporate bond yields. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Institutional Investors and Executive Compensation 
Abstract:
 We find that institutional ownership concentration is positively related
 to the pay-for-performance sensitivity of executive compensation and
 negatively related to the level of compensation, even after controlling
 for firm size, industry, investment opportunities, and performance. These
 results suggest that the institutions serve a monitoring role in
 mitigating the agency problem between shareholders and managers.
 Additionally, we find that clientele effects exist among institutions for
 firms with certain compensation structures, suggesting that institutions
 also influence compensation structures through their preferences. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Intraday Price Formation in U.S. Equity Index Markets 
Abstract:
 The market for U.S. equity indexes presently comprises floor-traded index
 futures contracts, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), electronically traded,
 small-denomination futures contracts (E-minis), and sector ETFs that
 decompose the S&P 500 index into component industry portfolios. This paper
 empirically investigates price discovery in this environment. For the S&P
 500 and Nasdaq-100 indexes, most of the price discovery occurs in the
 E-mini market. For the S&P 400 MidCap index, price discovery is shared
 between the regular futures contract and the ETF. The S&P 500 ETF
 contributes markedly to price discovery in the sector ETFs, but there are
 only minor effects in the reverse direction. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Financial Development, Property Rights, and Growth 
Abstract:
 In countries with more secure property rights, firms might allocate
 resources better and consequentially grow faster as the returns on
 different types of assets are more protected against competitors' actions.
 Using data on sectoral value added for a large number of countries, we
 find evidence consistent with better property rights leading to higher
 growth through improved asset allocation. Quantitatively, the growth
 effect is as large as that of improved access to financing due to greater
 financial development. Our results are robust using various samples and
 specifications, including controlling for growth opportunities. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: The Behavior of Bid-Ask Spreads and Volume in Options Markets during the Competition for Listings in 1999 
Abstract:
 In August 1999, U.S. exchanges began to compete directly for order flow in
 many options that had been exclusively listed on another exchange,
 shifting 37% of option volume to multiple-listing status by the end of
 September. Effective and quoted bid-ask spreads decrease significantly
 after multiple listings with spreads generally maintaining their initial
 lower levels 1 year later. These results hold for both time series and
 pooled regressions and are robust. We reject that economies of scale in
 market making cause the decrease in spreads and support the view that
 interexchange competition reduces option transaction costs. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Model Misspecification and Underdiversification 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we study intertemporal portfolio choice when an investor
 accounts explicitly for model misspecification. We develop a framework
 that allows for ambiguity about not just the joint distribution of returns
 for all stocks in the portfolio, but also for different levels of
 ambiguity for the marginal distribution of returns for "any" subset of
 these stocks. We find that when the overall ambiguity about the joint
 distribution of returns is high, then small differences in ambiguity for
 the marginal return distribution will result in a portfolio that is
 significantly underdiversified relative to the standard mean-variance
 portfolio. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Regulation Fair Disclosure and Earnings Information: Market, Analyst, and Corporate Responses 
Abstract:
 With the adoption of Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD), market behavior
 around earnings releases displays no significant change in return
 volatility (after controlling for decimalization of stock trading) but
 significant increases in trading volume due to difference in opinion.
 Analyst forecast dispersion increases, and increases in other measures of
 disagreement and difference of opinion suggest greater difficulty in
 forming forecasts beyond the current quarter. Corporations increase the
 quantity of voluntary disclosures, but only for current quarter earnings.
 Thus, Reg FD seems to increase the quantity of information available to
 the public while imposing greater demands on investment professionals. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Momentum Investing and Business Cycle Risk: Evidence from Pole to Pole 
Abstract:
 We examine whether macroeconomic risk can explain momentum profits
 internationally. Neither an unconditional model based on the Chen, Roll,
 and Ross (1986) factors nor a conditional forecasting model based on
 lagged instruments provides any evidence that macroeconomic risk variables
 can explain momentum. In addition, momentum profits around the world are
 economically large and statistically reliable in both good and bad
 economic states. Further, these momentum profits reverse over 1- to 5-year
 horizons, an action inconsistent with existing risk-based explanations of
 momentum. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Equilibrium "Anomalies" 
Abstract:
 Many empirical "anomalies" are actually consistent with the single beta
 capital asset pricing model if the empiricist utilizes an equity-only
 proxy for the true market portfolio. Equity betas estimated against this
 particular inefficient proxy will be understated, with the error
 increasing with the firm's leverage. Thus, firm-specific variables that
 correlate with leverage (such as book-to-market and size) will appear to
 explain returns after controlling for proxy beta simply because they
 capture the missing beta risk. Loadings on portfolios formed on relative
 leverage and relative distress completely subsume the powers of the <link
 rid="b16">Fama and French (1993)</link> returns to small minus big market
 capitalization (SMB) portfolios and returns to high minus low
 book-to-market (HML) portfolios factors in explaining cross-sectional
 returns. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: What Type of Process Underlies Options? A Simple Robust Test 
Abstract:
 We develop a simple robust method to distinguish the presence of
 continuous and discontinuous components in the price of an asset
 underlying options. Our method examines the prices of at-the-money and
 out-of-the-money options as the option's time-to-maturity approaches zero.
 We show that these prices converge to zero at speeds that depend upon
 whether the underlying asset price process is purely continuous, purely
 discontinuous, or a combination of both. We apply the method to S&P 500
 index options and find the existence of both a continuous component and a
 jump component in the index. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Do Price Discreteness and Transactions Costs Affect Stock Returns? Comparing Ex-Dividend Pricing before and after Decimalization 
Abstract:
 By the end of January 2001, all NYSE stocks had converted their price
 quotations from 1/8s and 1/16s to decimals. This study examines the effect
 of this change in price quotations on ex-dividend day activity. We find
 that abnormal ex-dividend day returns increase in the 1/16 and decimal
 pricing eras, relative to the 1/8 era, which is inconsistent with
 microstructure explanations of ex-day price movements. We also find that
 abnormal returns increase in conjunction with a May 1997 reduction in the
 capital gains tax rate, as they should if relative taxation of dividends
 and capital gains affects ex-day pricing. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Competition among Trading Venues: Information and Trading on Electronic Communications Networks 
Abstract:
 This paper explores the competition between two trading venues, Electronic
 Communication Networks (ECNs) and Nasdaq market makers. ECNs offer the
 advantages of anonymity and speed of execution, which attract informed
 traders. Thus, trades are more likely to occur on ECNs when information
 asymmetry is greater and when trading volume and stock-return volatility
 are high. ECN trades have greater permanent price impacts and more private
 information is revealed through ECN trades than though market-maker
 trades. However, ECN trades have higher ex ante trading costs because
 market makers can preference or internalize the less informed trades and
 offer them better executions. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Capital Structure and Financial Risk: Evidence from Foreign Debt Use in East Asia 
Abstract:
 Using a data set of East Asian nonfinancial companies, we examine a firm's
 choice between local, foreign, and synthetic local currency (hedged
 foreign currency) debt. We find evidence of unique as well as common
 factors that determine each debt type's use, indicating the importance of
 examining debt at a disaggregated level. We exploit the Asian financial
 crisis as a natural experiment to investigate the role of debt type in
 firm performance. Surprisingly, we find that the use of synthetic local
 currency debt is associated with the biggest drop in market value,
 possibly due to currency derivative market illiquidity during the crisis. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Divestitures and Divisional Investment Policies 
Abstract:
 We study a sample of diversified firms that alter their organizational
 structure by divesting a business segment. These firms experience a
 reduction in the diversification discount after the divestiture. We show
 that the efficiency of segment investment increases substantially
 following the divestiture and that this improvement is associated with a
 decrease in the diversification discount. Our results support the
 corporate focus and financing hypotheses for corporate divestitures. We
 demonstrate that inefficient investment is partly responsible for the
 diversification discount and show that asset sales lead to an improvement
 in the efficiency of investment for remaining divisions. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Is the International Convergence of Capital Adequacy Regulation Desirable? 
Abstract:
 The merit of international convergence of bank capital requirements in the
 presence of divergent closure policies of different central banks is
 examined. The lack of a complementary variation between minimum bank
 capital requirements and regulatory forbearance leads to a spillover from
 more forbearing to less forbearing economies and reduces the competitive
 advantage of banks in less forbearing economies. Linking the central
 bank's forbearance to its alignment with domestic bank owners, it is shown
 that in equilibrium, a regression toward the worst closure policy may
 result: The central banks of initially less forbearing economies also
 adopt greater forbearance. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.

Title: Shareholder Taxes in Acquisition Premiums: The Effect of Capital Gains Taxation 
Abstract:
 We exploit cross-temporal differences in capital gains tax rates to test
 whether shareholder-level capital gains taxes are associated with higher
 acquisition premiums for taxable acquisitions. We model acquisition
 premiums as a function of proxies for the capital gains taxes of target
 shareholders, taxability of the acquisition, and tax status of the
 price-setting shareholder as represented by the level of target
 institutional ownership. Consistent with a lock-in effect for acquisition
 premiums, results suggest a unique positive association between
 shareholder capital gains taxes for "individual" investors and acquisition
 premiums for taxable acquisitions, which is mitigated by target
 institutional ownership. Copyright 2003 by the American Finance Association.
