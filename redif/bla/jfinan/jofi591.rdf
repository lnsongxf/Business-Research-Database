Title: Endogenous Liquidity in Asset Markets 
Abstract:
 This paper analyzes a model in which long-term risky assets are illiquid
 due to adverse selection. The degree of adverse selection and hence the
 liquidity of these assets is determined endogenously by the amount of
 trade for reasons other than private information. I find that higher
 productivity leads to increased liquidity. Moreover, liquidity magnifies
 the effects of changes in productivity on investment and volume. High
 productivity implies that investors initiate larger scale risky projects
 which increases the riskiness of their incomes. Riskier incomes induce
 more sales of claims to high-quality projects, causing liquidity to
 increase. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Price Pressure around Mergers 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the trading behavior of professional investors around
 2,130 mergers announced between 1994 and 2000. We find considerable
 support for the existence of price pressure around mergers caused by
 uninformed shifts in excess demand, but that these effects are
 short-lived, consistent with the notion that short-run demand curves for
 stocks are not perfectly elastic. We estimate that nearly half of the
 negative announcement period stock price reaction for acquirers in
 stock-financed mergers reflects downward price pressure caused by merger
 arbitrage short selling, suggesting that previous estimates of merger
 wealth effects are biased downward. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Value-Enhancing Capital Budgeting and Firm-specific Stock Return Variation 
Abstract:
 We document a robust cross-sectional positive association across
 industries between a measure of the economic efficiency of corporate
 investment and the magnitude of firm-specific variation in stock returns.
 This finding is interesting for two reasons, neither of which is a priori
 obvious. First, it adds further support to the view that firm-specific
 return variation gauges the extent to which information about the firm is
 quickly and accurately reflected in share prices. Second, it can be
 interpreted as evidence that more informative stock prices facilitate more
 efficient corporate investment. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Bondholder Wealth Effects in Mergers and Acquisitions: New Evidence from the 1980s and 1990s 
Abstract:
 We examine the wealth effects of mergers and acquisitions on target and
 acquiring firm bondholders in the 1980s and 1990s. Consistent with a
 coinsurance effect, below investment grade target bonds earn significantly
 positive announcement period returns. By contrast, acquiring firm bonds
 earn negative announcement period returns. Additionally, target bonds have
 significantly larger returns when the target's rating is below the
 acquirer's, when the combination is anticipated to decrease target risk or
 leverage, and when the target's maturity is shorter than the acquirer's.
 Finally, we find that target and acquirer announcement period bond returns
 are significantly larger in the 1990s. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Social Interaction and Stock-Market Participation 
Abstract:
 We propose that stock-market participation is influenced by social
 interaction. In our model, any given "social" investor finds the market
 more attractive when more of his peers participate. We test this theory
 using data from the Health and Retirement Study, and find that social
 households-those who interact with their neighbors, or attend church-are
 substantially more likely to invest in the market than non-social
 households, controlling for wealth, race, education, and risk tolerance.
 Moreover, consistent with a peer-effects story, the impact of sociability
 is stronger in states where stock-market participation rates are higher. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Market Imperfections, Investment Flexibility, and Default Spreads 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a structural model that determines default spreads in
 a setting where the debt's collateral is endogenously determined by the
 borrower's investment choice, and a demand variable with permanent and
 temporary components. We also consider the possibility that the borrower
 cannot commit to taking the value-maximizing investment choice, and may,
 in addition, be constrained in its ability to raise external capital.
 Based on a model calibrated to data on office buildings and commercial
 mortgages, we present numerical simulations that quantify the extent to
 which investment flexibility, incentive problems, and credit constraints
 affect default spreads. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Compensation, Incentives, and the Duality of Risk Aversion and Riskiness 
Abstract:
 The common folklore that giving options to agents will make them more
 willing to take risks is false. In fact, no incentive schedule will make
 all expected utility maximizers more or less risk averse. This paper finds
 simple, intuitive, necessary and sufficient conditions under which
 incentive schedules make agents more or less risk averse. The paper uses
 these to examine the incentive effects of some common structures such as
 puts and calls, and it briefly explores the duality between a fee schedule
 that makes an agent more or less risk averse, and gambles that increase or
 decrease risk. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Statistical and Economic Role of Jumps in Continuous-Time Interest Rate Models 
Abstract:
 This paper analyzes the role of jumps in continuous-time short rate
 models. I first develop a test to detect jump-induced misspecification
 and, using Treasury bill rates, find evidence for the presence of jumps.
 Second, I specify and estimate a nonparametric jump-diffusion model.
 Results indicate that jumps play an important statistical role. Estimates
 of jump times and sizes indicate that unexpected news about the
 macroeconomy generates the jumps. Finally, I investigate the pricing
 implications of jumps. Jumps generally have a minor impact on yields, but
 they are important for pricing interest rate options. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Are Investors Rational? Choices among Index Funds 
Abstract:
 S&P 500 index funds represent one of the simplest vehicles for examining
 rational behavior. They hold virtually the same securities, yet their
 returns differ by more than 2 percent per year. Although the relative
 returns of alternative S&P 500 funds are easily predictable, the
 relationship between cash flows and performance is weaker than rational
 behavior would lead us to expect. We show that selecting funds based on
 low expenses or high past returns outperforms the portfolio of index funds
 selected by investors. Our results exemplify the fact that, in a market
 where arbitrage is not possible, dominated products can prosper. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Optimal Consumption and Investment with Transaction Costs and Multiple Risky Assets 
Abstract:
 We consider the optimal intertemporal consumption and investment policy of
 a constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) investor who faces fixed and
 proportional transaction costs when trading multiple risky assets. We show
 that when asset returns are uncorrelated, the optimal investment policy is
 to keep the dollar amount invested in each risky asset between two
 constant levels and upon reaching either of these thresholds, to trade to
 the corresponding optimal targets. An extensive analysis suggests that
 transaction cost is an important factor in affecting trading volume and
 that it can significantly diminish the importance of stock return
 predictability as reported in the literature. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Informed Trading When Information Becomes Stale 
Abstract:
 This paper characterizes informed trade when speculators can acquire
 distinct signals of varying quality about an asset's value at different
 dates. The most reasonable characterization of private information about
 stocks is that while information is long-lived, new information will
 arrive over time, information that may be acquired by others. Hence, while
 a speculator may know more than others at a moment, in the future, his
 information will become stale, but not valueless. In an environment that
 allows for arbitrary correlations among signals, we characterize
 equilibrium outcomes including trading, prices, and profits. We provide
 explicit numerical characterizations for different informational
 environments. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Convertible Bond Design and Capital Investment: The Role of Call Provisions 
Abstract:
 If firms issue convertible securities to facilitate sequential investment,
 the securities should be engineered to give sufficient flexibility to
 accommodate timing of follow-on investment. We examine call provisions in
 convertible bonds and argue that firms with investment options expected to
 expire sooner (later) will offer weaker (stronger) call protection. We
 find that issues with weak or no call protection are offered by firms that
 invest greater amounts soon after issuance than those issuing convertibles
 with strong protection. Moreover, capital expenditure levels during the
 5-year period following issuance are inversely related to the length of
 call-protection periods. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Option-Implied Risk Aversion Estimates 
Abstract:
 Using a utility function to adjust the risk-neutral PDF embedded in cross
 sections of options, we obtain measures of the risk aversion implied in
 option prices. Using FTSE 100 and S&P 500 options, and both power and
 exponential-utility functions, we estimate the representative agent's
 relative risk aversion (RRA) at different horizons. The estimated
 coefficients of RRA are all reasonable. The RRA estimates are remarkably
 consistent across utility functions and across markets for given horizons.
 The degree of RRA declines broadly with the forecast horizon and is lower
 during periods of high market volatility. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: How Do Exchanges Select Stocks for Option Listing? 
Abstract:
 We investigate the factors influencing the selection of stocks for option
 listing. Exchanges tend to list options on stocks with high trading
 volume, volatility, and market capitalization, but the relative effect of
 these factors has changed over time as markets have evolved. We observe a
 shift from volume toward volatility after the moratorium on new listings
 ended in 1980. Using control sample methodology designed to correct for
 the endogeneity of option listing, we find no evidence that volatility
 declines with option introduction, in contrast to previous studies that do
 not use control samples. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.
