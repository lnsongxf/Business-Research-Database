Title: Diversification Discount or Premium? New Evidence from the Business Information Tracking Series 
Abstract:
 I use the Business Information Tracking Series (BITS), a new census
 database that covers the whole U.S. economy at the establishment level, to
 examine whether the finding of a diversification discount is an artifact
 of segment data. BITS data allow me to construct business units that are
 more consistently and objectively defined than segments, and thus more
 comparable across firms. Using these data on a sample that yields a
 discount according to segment data, I find a diversification premium. The
 premium is robust to variations in the sample, business unit definition,
 and measures of excess value and diversification. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Optimal Diversification: Reconciling Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
 In this paper we show that the main empirical findings about firm
 diversification and performance are consistent with the maximization of
 shareholder value. In our model, diversification allows a firm to explore
 better productive opportunities while taking advantage of synergies. By
 explicitly linking the diversification strategies of the firm to
 differences in size and productivity, our model provides a natural
 laboratory to investigate several aspects of the relationship between
 diversification and performance. Specifically, we show that our model can
 rationalize the evidence on the diversification discount (<link
 rid="b18">Lang and Stulz (1994)</link>) and the documented relation
 between diversification and productivity (<link rid="b25">Schoar
 (2002)</link>). Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Private Benefits of Control: An International Comparison 
Abstract:
 We estimate private benefits of control in 39 countries using 393
 controlling blocks sales. On average the value of control is 14 percent,
 but in some countries can be as low as -4 percent, in others as high a
 &plus;65 percent. As predicted by theory, higher private benefits of
 control are associated with less developed capital markets, more
 concentrated ownership, and more privately negotiated privatizations. We
 also analyze what institutions are most important in curbing private
 benefits. We find evidence for both legal and extra-legal mechanisms. In a
 multivariate analysis, however, media pressure and tax enforcement seem to
 be the dominating factors. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Banks versus Venture Capital: Project Evaluation, Screening, and Expropriation 
Abstract:
 Why do some start-up firms raise funds from banks and others from venture
 capitalists? To address this question, I study a model in which the
 venture capitalist can evaluate the entrepreneur's project more accurately
 than the bank but can also threaten to steal it from the entrepreneur.
 Consistent with evidence regarding venture capital finance, the model
 implies that the characteristics of a firm financing through venture
 capitalists are relatively little collateral, high growth, high risk, and
 high profitability. The model also suggests that tighter protection of
 intellectual property rights encourages entrepreneurs to finance through
 venture capitalists. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: An Examination of Long-Term Abnormal Stock Returns and Operating Performance Following R&D Increases 
Abstract:
 We examine a sample of 8,313 cases, between 1951 and 2001, where firms
 unexpectedly increase their research and development (R&D) expenditures by
 a significant amount. We find consistent evidence of a misreaction, as
 manifested in the significantly positive abnormal stock returns that our
 sample firms' shareholders experience following these increases. We also
 find consistent evidence that our sample firms experience significantly
 positive long-term abnormal operating performance following their R&D
 increases. Our findings suggest that R&D increases are beneficial
 investments, and that the market is slow to recognize the extent of this
 benefit (consistent with investor underreaction). Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Information Content of Share Repurchase Programs 
Abstract:
 Contrary to the implications of many payout theories, we find that
 announcements of open-market share repurchase programs are not followed by
 an increase in operating performance. However, we find that repurchasing
 firms experience a significant reduction in systematic risk and cost of
 capital relative to non-repurchasing firms. Further, consistent with the
 free cash-flow hypothesis, we find that the market reaction to share
 repurchase announcements is more positive among those firms that are more
 likely to overinvest. Finally, we find evidence to indicate that investors
 underreact to repurchase announcements because they initially
 underestimate the decline in cost of capital. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Liquidity Externalities and Adverse Selection: Evidence from Trading after Hours 
Abstract:
 This paper examines liquidity externalities by analyzing trading costs
 after hours. There is less than 1/20 as many trades per unit time after
 hours as during the trading day. The reduced trading activity results in
 substantially higher trading costs: quoted and effective spreads are three
 to four times larger than during the trading day. The higher spreads
 reflect greater adverse selection and order persistence, but not higher
 dealer profits. Because liquidity provision remains competitive after
 hours, the greater adverse selection and higher trading costs provide a
 direct measure of the magnitude of the liquidity externalities generated
 during the trading day. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Does Net Buying Pressure Affect the Shape of Implied Volatility Functions? 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the relation between net buying pressure and the shape
 of the implied volatility function (IVF) for index and individual stock
 options. We find that changes in implied volatility are directly related
 to net buying pressure from public order flow. We also find that changes
 in implied volatility of S&P 500 options are most strongly affected by
 buying pressure for index puts, while changes in implied volatility of
 stock options are dominated by call option demand. Simulated delta-neutral
 option-writing trading strategies generate abnormal returns that match the
 deviations of the IVFs above realized historical return volatilities. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: News Arrival, Jump Dynamics, and Volatility Components for Individual Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper models components of the return distribution, which are assumed
 to be directed by a latent news process. The conditional variance of
 returns is a combination of jumps and smoothly changing components. A
 heterogeneous Poisson process with a time-varying conditional intensity
 parameter governs the likelihood of jumps. Unlike typical jump models with
 stochastic volatility, previous realizations of both jump and normal
 innovations can feed back asymmetrically into expected volatility. This
 model improves forecasts of volatility, particularly after large changes
 in stock returns. We provide empirical evidence of the impact and feedback
 effects of jump versus normal return innovations, leverage effects, and
 the time-series dynamics of jump clustering. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Option Pricing on Stocks in Mergers and Acquisitions 
Abstract:
 We develop an arbitrage-free and complete framework to price options on
 the stocks of firms involved in a merger or acquisition deal allowing for
 the possibility that the deal might be called off at an intermediate time,
 creating discontinuous impacts on the stock prices. Our model can be a
 normative tool for market makers to quote prices for options on stocks
 involved in such deals and also for traders to control risks associated
 with such deals using traded options. The results of tests indicate that
 the model performs significantly better than the Black-Scholes model in
 explaining observed option prices. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Default Risk in Equity Returns 
Abstract:
 This is the first study that uses <link rid="b45">Merton's (1974)</link>
 option pricing model to compute default measures for individual firms and
 assess the effect of default risk on equity returns. The size effect is a
 default effect, and this is also largely true for the book-to-market (BM)
 effect. Both exist only in segments of the market with high default risk.
 Default risk is systematic risk. The Fama-French (FF) factors SMB and HML
 contain some default-related information, but this is not the main reason
 that the FF model can explain the cross section of equity returns. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: International Evidence on Institutional Trading Behavior and Price Impact 
Abstract:
 This study characterizes institutional trading in international stocks
 from 37 countries during 1997 to 1998 and 2001. We find that the
 underlying market condition is a major determinant of the price impact
 and, more importantly, of the asymmetry between price impacts of
 institutional buy and sell orders. In bullish markets, institutional
 purchases have a bigger price impact than sells; however, in the bearish
 markets, sells have a higher price impact. This differs from previous
 findings on price impact asymmetry. Our study further suggests that price
 impact varies depending on order characteristics, firm-specific factors,
 and cross-country differences. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Trading Activity and Price Volatility in the Municipal Bond Market 
Abstract:
 Utilizing a comprehensive database of transactions in municipal bonds, we
 investigate the volume-volatility relation in the municipal bond market.
 We find a positive relation between the number of transactions and a
 bond's price volatility. In contrast to previous studies, we find a
 "negative" relation between average deal size and price volatility. These
 results are found to be robust throughout the sample. Our results are
 inconsistent with current theoretical models of the volume-volatility
 relation. These inconsistencies may arise because current models fail to
 account for the effects of overall market liquidity on the costs of large
 transactions. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Toward a National Market System for U.S. Exchange-listed Equity Options 
Abstract:
 In its response to the 1975 Congressional mandate to implement a national
 market system for financial securities, the Securities and Exchange
 Commission (SEC) initially exempted the option market. Recent dramatic
 changes in the structure of the option market prompted the SEC to revisit
 this issue. We examine a sample of actively traded, multiply listed equity
 options to ask whether this market's characteristics appear consistent
 with the goals of producing economically efficient transactions and
 facilitating "best execution." We find marked changes between June 2000,
 when quotes are often ignored, and January 2002, when the market more
 closely resembles a national market. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.
