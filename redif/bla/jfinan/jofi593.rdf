Title: Are Judgment Errors Reflected in Market Prices and Allocations? Experimental Evidence Based on the Monty Hall Problem 
Abstract:
 The question of whether individual judgment errors survive in market
 equilibrium is an issue that naturally lends itself to experimental
 analysis. Here, the Monty Hall problem is used to detect probability
 judgment errors both in a cohort of individuals and in a market setting.
 When all subjects in a cohort made probability judgment errors, market
 prices also reflected the error. However, competition among two bias-free
 subjects was sufficient to drive prices to error-free levels. Thus,
 heterogeneity in behavior can be an important factor in asset pricing, and
 further, it may take few bias-free traders to make asset prices bias-free. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Optimal Asset Location and Allocation with Taxable and Tax-Deferred Investing 
Abstract:
 We investigate optimal intertemporal asset allocation and location
 decisions for investors making taxable and tax-deferred investments. We
 show a strong preference for holding taxable bonds in the tax-deferred
 account and equity in the taxable account, reflecting the higher tax
 burden on taxable bonds relative to equity. For most investors, the
 optimal asset location policy is robust to the introduction of tax-exempt
 bonds and liquidity shocks. Numerical results illustrate optimal portfolio
 decisions as a function of age and tax-deferred wealth. Interestingly, the
 proportion of total wealth allocated to equity is inversely related to the
 fraction of total wealth in tax-deferred accounts. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Are Momentum Profits Robust to Trading Costs? 
Abstract:
 We test whether momentum strategies remain profitable after considering
 market frictions induced by trading. Intraday data are used to estimate
 alternative measures of proportional and non-proportional (price impact)
 trading costs. The price impact models imply that abnormal returns to
 portfolio strategies decline with portfolio size. We calculate break-even
 fund sizes that lead to zero abnormal returns. In addition to equal- and
 value-weighted momentum strategies, we derive a liquidity-weighted
 strategy designed to reduce the cost of trades. Equal-weighted strategies
 perform the best before trading costs and the worst after trading costs.
 Liquidity-weighted and hybrid liquidity/value-weighted strategies have the
 largest break-even fund sizes: $5 billion or more (relative to December
 1999 market capitalization) may be invested in these momentum strategies
 before the apparent profit opportunities vanish. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Analyzing the Analysts: When Do Recommendations Add Value? 
Abstract:
 We show that analysts from sell-side firms generally recommend "glamour"
 (i.e., positive momentum, high growth, high volume, and relatively
 expensive) stocks. Naïve adherence to these recommendations can be costly,
 because the "level" of the consensus recommendation adds value only among
 stocks with favorable quantitative characteristics (i.e., value stocks and
 positive momentum stocks). In fact, among stocks with unfavorable
 quantitative characteristics, higher consensus recommendations are
 associated with worse subsequent returns. In contrast, we find that the
 quarterly "change" in consensus recommendations is a robust return
 predictor that appears to contain information orthogonal to a large range
 of other predictive variables. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: A Catering Theory of Dividends 
Abstract:
 We propose that the decision to pay dividends is driven by prevailing
 investor demand for dividend payers. Managers cater to investors by paying
 dividends when investors put a stock price premium on payers, and by not
 paying when investors prefer nonpayers. To test this prediction, we
 construct four stock price-based measures of investor demand for dividend
 payers. By each measure, nonpayers tend to initiate dividends when demand
 is high. By some measures, payers tend to omit dividends when demand is
 low. Further analysis confirms that these results are better explained by
 catering than other theories of dividends. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Executive Option Repricing, Incentives, and Retention 
Abstract:
 While many firms grant executive stock options that can be repriced, other
 firms systematically restrict or prohibit repricing. This article
 investigates the determinants of firms' repricing policies and the
 consequences of such policies for executive turnover and retention. Firms
 that have better internal governance, that use more powerful stock-based
 incentives, or that face less shareholder scrutiny are more likely to
 maintain repricing flexibility. Firms that restrict repricing are more
 vulnerable to voluntary executive turnover following stock price declines.
 When share price declines are severe, restricting firms appear to award
 unusually large numbers of new options. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Economic News and the Impact of Trading on Bond Prices 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the impact of trading on government bond prices
 surrounding the release of macroeconomic news. The results show a
 significant increase in the informational role of trading following
 economic announcements, which suggests the release of public information
 increases the level of information asymmetry in the government bond
 market. The informational role of trading is greater after announcements
 with a larger initial price impact, and the relation is associated with
 the surprise component of the announcement and the precision of the public
 information. The results provide evidence that government bond order flow
 reveals fundamental information about riskless rates. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Informed Trading in Stock and Option Markets 
Abstract:
 We investigate the contribution of option markets to price discovery,
 using a modification of <link rid="b28">Hasbrouck's
 (1995)</link>"information share" approach. Based on five years of stock
 and options data for 60 firms, we estimate the option market's
 contribution to price discovery to be about 17% on average. Option market
 price discovery is related to trading volume and spreads in both markets,
 and stock volatility. Price discovery across option strike prices is
 related to leverage, trading volume, and spreads. Our results are
 consistent with theoretical arguments that informed investors trade in
 both stock and option markets, suggesting an important informational role
 for options. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Is All That Talk Just Noise? The Information Content of Internet Stock Message Boards 
Abstract:
 Financial press reports claim that Internet stock message boards can move
 markets. We study the effect of more than 1.5 million messages posted on
 Yahoo&excl; Finance and Raging Bull about the 45 companies in the Dow
 Jones Industrial Average and the Dow Jones Internet Index. Bullishness is
 measured using computational linguistics methods. "Wall Street Journal"
 news stories are used as controls. We find that stock messages help
 predict market volatility. Their effect on stock returns is statistically
 significant but economically small. Consistent with <link rid="b21">Harris
 and Raviv (1993)</link>, disagreement among the posted messages is
 associated with increased trading volume. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Risk Sharing and Asset Prices: Evidence from a Natural Experiment 
Abstract:
 When countries liberalize their stock markets, firms that become eligible
 for foreign purchase (investible), experience an average stock price
 revaluation of 15.1%. Since the historical covariance of the average
 investible firm's stock return with the local market is roughly 200 times
 larger than its historical covariance with the world market,
 liberalization reduces the systematic risk associated with holding
 investible securities. Consistent with this fact: (1) the average effect
 of the reduction in systematic risk is 6.8 percentage points, or roughly
 two fifths of the total revaluation; and (2) the firm-specific
 revaluations are directly proportional to the firm-specific changes in
 systematic risk. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Foundations of Freezeout Laws in Takeovers 
Abstract:
 We provide an economic basis for permitting freezeouts of nontendering
 shareholders following successful takeovers. We describe a specific
 freezeout mechanism based on easily verifiable information that induces
 desirable efficiency and welfare properties in models of both corporations
 with widely dispersed shareholdings and corporations with large pivotal
 shareholders. The mechanism dominates previous proposals along some
 important dimensions. We also examine takeover premia that arise in the
 presence of competition among raiders. Our mechanism is closely related to
 the practice of takeover law in the United States; thus, our analysis may
 be thought of as analyzing the economic foundations of current
 regulations. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Market States and Momentum 
Abstract:
 We test overreaction theories of short-run momentum and long-run reversal
 in the cross section of stock returns. Momentum profits depend on the
 state of the market, as predicted. From 1929 to 1995, the mean monthly
 momentum profit following positive market returns is 0.93%, whereas the
 mean profit following negative market returns is  - 0.37%. The up-market
 momentum reverses in the long-run. Our results are robust to the
 conditioning information in macroeconomic factors. Moreover, we find that
 macroeconomic factors are unable to explain momentum profits after simple
 methodological adjustments to take account of microstructure concerns. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Do Stock Prices and Volatility Jump? Reconciling Evidence from Spot and Option Prices 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the empirical performance of jump diffusion models of
 stock price dynamics from joint options and stock markets data. The paper
 introduces a model with discontinuous correlated jumps in stock prices and
 stock price volatility, and with state-dependent arrival intensity. We
 discuss how to perform likelihood-based inference based upon joint
 options/returns data and present estimates of risk premiums for jump and
 volatility risks. The paper finds that while complex jump specifications
 add little explanatory power in fitting options data, these models fare
 better in fitting options and returns data simultaneously. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Specification Analysis of Option Pricing Models Based on Time-Changed Lévy Processes 
Abstract:
 We analyze the specifications of option pricing models based on
 time-changed Lévy processes. We classify option pricing models based on
 the structure of the jump component in the underlying return process, the
 source of stochastic volatility, and the specification of the volatility
 process itself. Our estimation of a variety of model specifications
 indicates that to better capture the behavior of the S&P 500 index
 options, we need to incorporate a high frequency jump component in the
 return process and generate stochastic volatilities from two different
 sources, the jump component and the diffusion component. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.
