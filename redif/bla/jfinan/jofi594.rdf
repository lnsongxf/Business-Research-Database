Title: Presidential Address, Committing to Commit: Short-term Debt When Enforcement Is Costly 
Abstract:
 In legal systems with expensive or ineffective contract enforcement, it is
 difficult to induce lenders to enforce debt contracts. If lenders do not
 enforce, borrowers will have incentives to misbehave. Lenders have
 incentives to enforce given bad news when debt is short-term and subject
 to runs caused by externalities across lenders. Lenders will not undo
 these externalities by negotiation. The required number of lenders
 increases with enforcement costs. A very high enforcement cost can exceed
 the ex ante incentive benefit of enforcement. Removing lenders' right to
 immediately enforce their debt with a "bail-in" can improve the ex ante
 incentives of borrowers. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Risks for the Long Run: A Potential Resolution of Asset Pricing Puzzles 
Abstract:
 We model consumption and dividend growth rates as containing (1) a small
 long-run predictable component, and (2) fluctuating economic uncertainty
 (consumption volatility). These dynamics, for which we provide empirical
 support, in conjunction with <link rid="b27">Epstein and Zin's
 (1989)</link> preferences, can explain key asset markets phenomena. In our
 economy, financial markets dislike economic uncertainty and better
 long-run growth prospects raise equity prices. The model can justify the
 equity premium, the risk-free rate, and the volatility of the market
 return, risk-free rate, and the price-dividend ratio. As in the data,
 dividend yields predict returns and the volatility of returns is
 time-varying. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Nature of Discipline by Corporate Takeovers 
Abstract:
 This paper provides a comprehensive examination of the disciplinary role
 of the corporate takeover market using a sample of U.S. target firms over
 the period 1979 to 1998. The time period spanned allows a broader study
 not only of the disciplinary role of the takeover market in general, but
 also of the interaction between the takeover market and alternative
 governance mechanisms during the 1980s and 1990s. Overall, our evidence is
 consistent with the view of the corporate takeover market as a "court of
 last resort," that is, it is an external source of discipline that
 intercedes when internal control mechanisms are relatively weak or
 ineffective. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Information and the Cost of Capital 
Abstract:
 We investigate the role of information in affecting a firm's cost of
 capital. We show that differences in the composition of information
 between public and private information affect the cost of capital, with
 investors demanding a higher return to hold stocks with greater private
 information. This higher return arises because informed investors are
 better able to shift their portfolio to incorporate new information, and
 uninformed investors are thus disadvantaged. In equilibrium, the quantity
 and quality of information affect asset prices. We show firms can
 influence their cost of capital by choosing features like accounting
 treatments, analyst coverage, and market microstructure. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Employee Stock Options, Corporate Taxes, and Debt Policy 
Abstract:
 We find that employee stock option deductions lead to large aggregate tax
 savings for Nasdaq 100 and S&P 100 firms and also affect corporate
 marginal tax rates. For Nasdaq firms, including the effect of options
 reduces the estimated median marginal tax rate from 31% to 5%. For S&P
 firms, in contrast, option deductions do not affect marginal tax rates to
 a large degree. Our evidence suggests that option deductions are important
 nondebt tax shields and that option deductions substitute for interest
 deductions in corporate capital structure decisions, explaining in part
 why some firms use so little debt. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Why Do Firms Use Incentives That Have No Incentive Effects? 
Abstract:
 This paper illustrates why firms might choose to implement stock option
 plans or other pay instruments that reward "luck." I consider a model
 where adjusting compensation contracts is costly and where employees'
 outside opportunities are correlated with their firms' performance. The
 model may help to explain the use and recent rise of broad-based stock
 option plans, as well as other financial instruments, even when these pay
 plans have no effect on employees' on-the-job behavior. The model suggests
 that agency theory's often-overlooked participation constraint may be an
 important determinant of some common compensation schemes, particularly
 for employees below the highest executive ranks. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Timing of Option Repricing 
Abstract:
 We investigate whether executive stock option repricings are
 systematically timed to coincide with favorable movements in the company's
 stock price. For a sample of 236 repricing events, we observe sharp
 increases in stock price in the 20-day period following the repricing
 date. In addition, repricing dates tend to either precede the release of
 good news or follow the release of bad news in the quarterly earnings
 announcements. Since information about stock option repricing is not
 generally released to the public around the repricing date, these findings
 suggest that CEOs opportunistically manage the timing of the option
 repricing date. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Diversification as a Public Good: Community Effects in Portfolio Choice 
Abstract:
 Within a rational general equilibrium model in which agents care only
 about personal consumption, we consider a setting in which, due to
 borrowing constraints, individuals endowed with local resources
 underparticipate in financial markets. As a result, investors compete for
 local resources through their portfolio choices. Even with complete
 financial markets and no aggregate risk, agents may herd into risky
 portfolios. This yields a Pareto-dominated outcome as agents introduce
 "community" risk unrelated to fundamentals. Moreover, if some agents are
 behaviorally biased, or cannot completely diversify their holdings,
 rational agents may choose more extreme portfolios and amplify the effect. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Tobin's "Q", Debt Overhang, and Investment 
Abstract:
 Incorporating debt in a dynamic real options framework, we show that
 underinvestment stems from truncation of equity's horizon at default. Debt
 overhang distorts both the level and composition of investment, with
 underinvestment being more severe for long-lived assets. An empirical
 proxy for the shadow price of capital to equity is derived. Use of this
 proxy yields a structural test for debt overhang and its mitigation
 through issuance of additional secured debt. Using measurement
 error-consistent GMM estimators, we find a statistically significant debt
 overhang effect regardless of firms' ability to issue additional secured
 debt. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Estimation and Test of a Simple Model of Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing 
Abstract:
 A simple valuation model with time-varying investment opportunities is
 developed and estimated. The model assumes that the investment opportunity
 set is completely described by the real interest rate and the maximum
 Sharpe ratio, which follow correlated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The
 model parameters and time series of the state variables are estimated
 using U.S. Treasury bond yields and expected inflation from January 1952
 to December 2000, and as predicted, the estimated maximum Sharpe ratio is
 related to the equity premium. In cross-sectional asset-pricing tests,
 both state variables have significant risk premia, which is consistent
 with Merton's ICAPM. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Cash Flow Sensitivity of Cash 
Abstract:
 We model a firm's demand for liquidity to develop a new test of the effect
 of financial constraints on corporate policies. The effect of financial
 constraints is captured by the firm's propensity to save cash out of cash
 flows (the "cash flow sensitivity of cash"). We hypothesize that
 constrained firms should have a positive cash flow sensitivity of cash,
 while unconstrained firms' cash savings should not be systematically
 related to cash flows. We empirically estimate the cash flow sensitivity
 of cash using a large sample of manufacturing firms over the 1971 to 2000
 period and find robust support for our theory. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: What Do Entrepreneurs Pay for Venture Capital Affiliation? 
Abstract:
 This study empirically evaluates the certification and value-added roles
 of reputable venture capitalists (VCs). Using a novel sample of
 entrepreneurial start-ups with "multiple" financing offers, I analyze
 financing offers made by competing VCs at the first professional round of
 start-up funding, holding characteristics of the start-up fixed. Offers
 made by VCs with a high reputation are three times more likely to be
 accepted, and high-reputation VCs acquire start-up equity at a 10-14%
 discount. The evidence suggests that VCs' "extra-financial" value may be
 more distinctive than their functionally equivalent financial capital.
 These extra-financial services can have financial consequences. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Short-Selling Prior to Earnings Announcements 
Abstract:
 This paper examines short-sales transactions in the five days prior to
 earnings announcements of 913 Nasdaq-listed firms. The tests provide
 evidence of informed trading in pre-announcement short-selling because
 they reveal that abnormal short-selling is significantly linked to
 post-announcement stock returns. Also, the tests indicate that
 short-sellers typically are more active in stocks with low book-to-market
 valuations or low SUEs. The levels of pre-announcement short-selling,
 however, mostly appear to reflect firm-specific information rather than
 these fundamental financial characteristics. We believe that these results
 should encourage financial market regulators to consider providing more
 extensive and timely disclosures of short-selling to investors. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Electricity Forward Prices: A High-Frequency Empirical Analysis 
Abstract:
 We conduct an empirical analysis of forward prices in the PJM electricity
 market using a high-frequency data set of hourly spot and day-ahead
 forward prices. We find that there are significant risk premia in
 electricity forward prices. These premia vary systematically throughout
 the day and are directly related to economic risk factors, such as the
 volatility of unexpected changes in demand, spot prices, and total
 revenues. These results support the hypothesis that electricity forward
 prices in the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland market are determined
 rationally by risk-averse economic agents. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Price Response to S&P 500 Index Additions and Deletions: Evidence of Asymmetry and a New Explanation 
Abstract:
 We study the price effects of changes to the S&P 500 index and document an
 asymmetric price response: There is a permanent increase in the price of
 added firms but no permanent decline for deleted firms. These results are
 at odds with extant explanations of the effects of index changes that
 imply a symmetric price response to additions and deletions. A possible
 explanation for asymmetric price effects arises from the changes in
 investor awareness. Results from our empirical tests support the thesis
 that changes in investor awareness contribute to the asymmetric price
 effects of S&P 500 index additions and deletions. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.
