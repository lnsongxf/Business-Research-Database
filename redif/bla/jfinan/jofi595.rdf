Title: Forecast Dispersion and the Cross Section of Expected Returns 
Abstract:
 Recent work by <link rid="b7">Diether, Malloy, and Scherbina (2002)</link>
 has established a negative relationship between stock returns and the
 dispersion of analysts' earnings forecasts. I offer a simple explanation
 for this phenomenon based on the interpretation of dispersion as a proxy
 for unpriced information risk arising when asset values are unobservable.
 The relationship then follows from a general options-pricing result: For a
 levered firm, expected returns should always decrease with the level of
 idiosyncratic asset risk. This story is formalized with a straightforward
 model. Reasonable parameter values produce large effects, and the theory's
 main empirical prediction is supported in cross-sectional tests. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Predictable Investment Horizons and Wealth Transfers among Mutual Fund Shareholders 
Abstract:
 This study analyzes the distribution of investment horizons in a large,
 proprietary panel of all shareholders in one no-load mutual fund family. A
 proportional hazards model shows that there are observable shareholder
 characteristics that enable the fund to predict reliably on the day each
 account is opened whether the account will be short term or long term.
 Simulations show that the liquidity costs imposed on the fund by the
 expected short-term shareholders are significantly greater than those
 imposed by the expected long-term shareholders. Combining these results,
 the analysis argues that mutual funds do not provide equitable
 liquidity-risk insurance. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Hedge Funds and the Technology Bubble 
Abstract:
 This paper documents that hedge funds did not exert a correcting force on
 stock prices during the technology bubble. Instead, they were heavily
 invested in technology stocks. This does not seem to be the result of
 unawareness of the bubble: Hedge funds captured the upturn, but, by
 reducing their positions in stocks that were about to decline, avoided
 much of the downturn. Our findings question the efficient markets notion
 that rational speculators always stabilize prices. They are consistent
 with models in which rational investors may prefer to ride bubbles because
 of predictable investor sentiment and limits to arbitrage. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Cash and Corporate Control 
Abstract:
 The takeover market is often suggested as appropriate for containing the
 agency problems of excessive corporate cash holdings. However, recent
 studies report contradictory evidence. I focus on the takeover-deterrence
 effects of corporate liquidity and suggest the proxy contest as an
 effective alternative control mechanism. I find that proxy fight targets
 hold 23% more cash than comparable firms, and that the probability of a
 contest is significantly increasing in excess cash holdings. Proxy fight
 announcement return also is positively related to excess cash. Following a
 contest, executive turnover and special cash distributions to shareholders
 increase, while cash holdings significantly decline. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Investment-Cash Flow Sensitivities: Constrained versus Unconstrained Firms 
Abstract:
 From the existing literature, it is not clear what effect financing
 constraints have on the sensitivities of firms' investment to their cash
 flow. I propose an explanation that reconciles the conflicting empirical
 evidence. I present two models: the unconstrained model, in which firms
 can raise external funds, and the constrained model, in which firms cannot
 do so. Using low dividends to identify financing constraints in my
 generated panel of data produces results consistent with those of Fazzari,
 Hubbard, and Petersen; using the constrained model produces results
 consistent with those of Kaplan and Zingales. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Dividend Changes and the Persistence of Past Earnings Changes 
Abstract:
 We examine whether the market interprets changes in dividends as a signal
 about the persistence of past earnings changes. Prior to observing this
 signal, investors may believe that past earnings changes are not
 necessarily indicative of future earnings levels. We empirically
 investigate whether a change in dividends alters investors' assessments
 about the valuation implications of past earnings. Results confirm the
 hypothesis that changes in dividends cause investors to revise their
 expectations about the persistence of past earnings changes. This effect
 varies predictably with the magnitude of the dividend change and the sign
 of the past earnings change. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Correlated Trading and Location 
Abstract:
 This paper analyzes the trading behavior of stock market investors.
 Purchases and sales are highly correlated when we divide investors
 geographically. Investors who live near a firm's headquarters react in a
 similar manner to releases of public information. We are able to make this
 identification by exploiting a unique feature of individual brokerage
 accounts in the People's Republic of China. The data allow us to pinpoint
 an investor's location at the time he or she places a trade. Our results
 are consistent with a simple, rational expectations model of
 heterogeneously informed investors. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The 52-Week High and Momentum Investing 
Abstract:
 When coupled with a stock's current price, a readily available piece of
 information-the 52-week high price-explains a large portion of the profits
 from momentum investing. Nearness to the 52-week high dominates and
 improves upon the forecasting power of past returns (both individual and
 industry returns) for future returns. Future returns forecast using the
 52-week high do not reverse in the long run. These results indicate that
 short-term momentum and long-term reversals are largely separate
 phenomena, which presents a challenge to current theory that models these
 aspects of security returns as integrated components of the market's
 response to news. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Characteristics, Contracts, and Actions: Evidence from Venture Capitalist Analyses 
Abstract:
 We study the investment analyses of 67 portfolio investments by 11 venture
 capital (VC) firms. VCs describe the strengths and risks of the
 investments as well as expected postinvestment actions. We classify the
 risks into three categories and relate them to the allocation of cash flow
 rights, contingencies, control rights, and liquidation rights between VCs
 and entrepreneurs. The risk results suggest that agency and hold-up
 problems are important to contract design and monitoring, but that risk
 sharing is not. Greater VC control is associated with increased management
 intervention, while greater VC equity incentives are associated with
 increased value-added support. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Idiosyncratic Consumption Risk and the Cross Section of Asset Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the importance of idiosyncratic consumption risk
 for the cross-sectional variation in asset returns. We find that besides
 the rate of aggregate consumption growth, the cross-sectional variance of
 consumption growth is also a priced factor. This suggests that consumers
 are not fully insured against idiosyncratic consumption risk, and that
 asset returns reflect their attempts to reduce their exposure to this
 risk. The resulting two-factor consumption-based asset pricing model
 significantly outperforms the CAPM, and its performance compares favorably
 with that of the Fama-French three-factor model. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Bond Insurance: What Is Special About Munis? 
Abstract:
 Close to 50% of municipal bonds are prepackaged with insurance at the time
 of issue. We offer a tax-based rationale for the emergence of third-party
 insurance of tax-exempt bonds. We argue that insurance adds value as it
 allows a third party to become, in a probabilistic sense, an issuer of
 tax-exempt securities. Insurance however reduces value by eliminating the
 possibility of a capital tax loss. While the net benefit from insurance
 increases with bond maturity, the benefit may not increase monotonically
 with default risk. We also provide empirical evidence supportive of the
 model's predictions. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Remuneration, Retention, and Reputation Incentives for Outside Directors 
Abstract:
 I study incentives received by outside directors in Fortune 500 firms from
 compensation, replacement, and the opportunity to obtain other
 directorships. Previous research has only shown these relations to apply
 under limited circumstances such as financial distress. Together these
 incentive mechanisms provide directors with wealth increases of
 approximately 11 cents per $1,000 rise in firm value. Although smaller
 than the performance sensitivities of CEOs, outside directors' incentives
 imply a change in wealth of about $285,000 for a 1 standard deviation
 ("SD") change in typical firm performance. Cross-sectional patterns of
 director equity awards conform to agency and financial theories. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Bids and Allocations in European IPO Bookbuilding 
Abstract:
 This paper uses evidence from a data set of 27 European IPOs to analyze
 how investors bid and the factors that influence their allocations. We
 also make use of a unique ranking of investor quality, associated with the
 likelihood of flipping the IPO. We find that investors perceived to be
 long-term holders of the stock are consistently favored in allocation and
 in out-turn profits. In contrast to <link rid="b6">Cornelli and Goldreich
 (2001)</link>, we find little evidence that more informative bids receive
 larger allocations or higher profits. Our results cast doubt upon the
 extent of information production during the bookbuilding period. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Development of Secondary Market Liquidity for NYSE-Listed IPOs 
Abstract:
 For NYSE-listed IPOs, limit order submissions and depth relative to volume
 are unusually low on the first trading day. Initial buy-side liquidity is
 higher for IPOs with high-quality underwriters, large syndicates, low
 insider sales, and high premarket demand, while sell-side liquidity is
 higher for IPOs that represent a large fraction of outstanding shares and
 have low premarket demand. Our results suggest that uncertainty and offer
 design affect initial liquidity, though order flow stabilizes quickly. We
 also find that submission strategies are influenced by expected
 underwriter stabilization and preopening order flow contains information
 about both initial prices and subsequent returns. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Risk-Neutral Parameter Shifts and Derivatives Pricing in Discrete Time 
Abstract:
 We obtain a large class of discrete-time risk-neutral valuation
 relationships, or "preference-free" derivatives pricing models, by
 imposing a simple restriction on the state-price density process. The
 risk-neutral stock-return and forward-rate dynamics are obtained by
 changing only a location parameter, which can be determined independent of
 the preference and true location parameters. The Gaussian models of <link
 rid="b20">Rubinstein (1976)</link>, <link rid="b3">Brennan (1979)</link>,
 and <link rid="b5">Câmera (2003)</link>, and the gamma model of <link
 rid="b9">Heston (1993)</link> are all special cases. The model provides
 simple relationships between expected returns and state-price density
 parameters analogous to the diffusion case. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Monitoring as a Motivation for IPO Underpricing 
Abstract:
 <link rid="b7">Brennan and Franks (1997)</link> and <link
 rid="b26">Stoughton and Zechner (1998)</link> provide contrasting
 arguments for why monitoring considerations create incentives for managers
 to underprice their firms' IPOs (initial public offerings). Like <link
 rid="b25">Smart and Zutter (2003)</link>, we examine these arguments using
 a sample of U.S. IPOs. However, we find evidence that the determinants of
 initial returns, institutional shareholdings, and post-IPO likelihood of
 acquisition are not consistent with these arguments. Thus, we conclude
 that monitoring considerations are not important determinants of IPO
 underpricing. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Competition and Coalition among Underwriters: The Decision to Join a Syndicate 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the decision of lead investment banks to organize
 hybrid syndicates (commercial banks participating as co-managers) versus
 pure investment bank syndicates. The findings show that hybrid
 underwriting issues are more challenging to float. Compared to pure
 investment bank syndicates, hybrid syndicates serve clients that are
 smaller, have lower common stock rankings and less prior access to the
 capital markets, rely more on bank loans, and invest less capital but
 issue larger amounts, which indicates that commercial banks' participation
 enhances hybrid services. Moreover, lead investment banks tend to invite
 banks' participation when clients exhibit higher loyalty in reusing their
 services. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association.
