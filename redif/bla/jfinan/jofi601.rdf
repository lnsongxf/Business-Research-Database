Title: Do Behavioral Biases Affect Prices? 
Abstract:
 This paper documents strong evidence for behavioral biases among Chicago
 Board of Trade proprietary traders and investigates the effect these
 biases have on prices. Our traders appear highly loss-averse, regularly
 assuming above-average afternoon risk to recover from morning losses. This
 behavior has important short-term consequences for afternoon prices, as
 losing traders actively purchase contracts at higher prices and sell
 contracts at lower prices than those that prevailed previously. However,
 the market appears to distinguish these risk-seeking trades from informed
 trading. Prices set by loss-averse traders are reversed significantly more
 quickly than those set by unbiased traders. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Insider Trading Restrictions and Analysts' Incentives to Follow Firms 
Abstract:
 Motivated by extant finance theory predicting that insider trading crowds
 out private information acquisition by outsiders, we use data for 100
 countries for the years 1987-2000 to study whether analyst following in a
 country increases following restriction of insider trading activities. We
 document that analyst following increases after initial enforcement of
 insider trading laws. This increase is concentrated in emerging market
 countries, but is smaller if the country has previously liberalized its
 capital market. We also find that analyst following responds less
 intensely to initial enforcement when a country has a preexisting
 portfolio of strong investor protections. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Value Premium 
Abstract:
 The value anomaly arises naturally in the neoclassical framework with
 rational expectations. Costly reversibility and countercyclical price of
 risk cause assets in place to be harder to reduce, and hence are riskier
 than growth options especially in bad times when the price of risk is
 high. By linking risk and expected returns to economic primitives, such as
 tastes and technology, my model generates many empirical regularities in
 the cross-section of returns; it also yields an array of new refutable
 hypotheses providing fresh directions for future empirical research. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Asset Sales, Investment Opportunities, and the Use of Proceeds 
Abstract:
 This study examines the allocation of cash proceeds following 400
 subsidiary sales between 1990 and 1998. Retention probabilities are
 increasing in the divesting firm's contemporaneous growth opportunities
 and expected investment. Retaining firms, however, also systematically
 overinvest relative to an industry benchmark. Shareholder returns to
 retention decisions are positively correlated with growth opportunities
 and benchmarked investment, but negatively correlated with benchmarked
 investment for firms with poor growth opportunities. Shareholder returns
 to debt distributions are increasing in industry-benchmarked leverage.
 Overall, the results of this study cohere with the hypothesized trade-off
 between the investment efficiencies associated with retained proceeds and
 the agency costs of managerial discretion and debt. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Financial and Legal Constraints to Growth: Does Firm Size Matter? 
Abstract:
 Using a unique firm-level survey database covering 54 countries, we
 investigate the effect of financial, legal, and corruption problems on
 firms' growth rates. Whether these factors constrain growth depends on
 firm size. It is consistently the smallest firms that are most
 constrained. Financial and institutional development weakens the
 constraining effects of financial, legal, and corruption obstacles and it
 is again the small firms that benefit the most. There is only a weak
 relation between firms' perception of the quality of the courts in their
 country and firm growth. We also provide evidence that the corruption of
 bank officials constrains firm growth. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Does the Failure of the Expectations Hypothesis Matter for Long-Term Investors? 
Abstract:
 We solve the portfolio problem of a long-run investor when the term
 structure is Gaussian and when the investor has access to nominal bonds
 and stock. We apply our method to a three-factor model that captures the
 failure of the expectations hypothesis. We extend this model to account
 for time-varying expected inflation, and estimate the model with both
 inflation and term structure data. The estimates imply that the bond
 portfolio of a long-run investor looks very different from the portfolio
 of a mean-variance optimizer. In particular, time-varying term premia
 generate large hedging demands for long-term bonds. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Distance, Lending Relationships, and Competition 
Abstract:
 We study the effect on loan conditions of geographical distance between
 firms, the lending bank, and all other banks in the vicinity. For our
 study, we employ detailed contract information from more than 15,000 bank
 loans to small firms comprising the entire loan portfolio of a large
 Belgian bank. We report the first comprehensive evidence on the occurrence
 of spatial price discrimination in bank lending. Loan rates decrease with
 the distance between the firm and the lending bank and increase with the
 distance between the firm and competing banks. Transportation costs cause
 the spatial price discrimination we observe. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Local Does as Local Is: Information Content of the Geography of Individual Investors' Common Stock Investments 
Abstract:
 Using data on the investments a large number of individual investors made
 through a discount broker from 1991 to 1996, we find that households
 exhibit a strong preference for local investments. We test whether this
 locality bias stems from information or from simple familiarity. The
 average household generates an additional annualized return of 3.2% from
 its local holdings relative to its nonlocal holdings, suggesting that
 local investors can exploit local knowledge. Excess returns to investing
 locally are even larger among stocks not in the S&P 500 index (firms for
 which information asymmetries between local and nonlocal investors may be
 largest). Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Financial Analyst Characteristics and Herding Behavior in Forecasting 
Abstract:
 This study classifies analysts' earnings forecasts as "herding" or "bold"
 and finds that (1) boldness likelihood increases with the analyst's prior
 accuracy, brokerage size, and experience and declines with the number of
 industries the analyst follows, consistent with theory linking boldness
 with career concerns and ability; (2) bold forecasts are more accurate
 than herding forecasts; and (3) herding forecast revisions are more
 strongly associated with analysts' earnings forecast errors (actual
 earnings-forecast) than are bold forecast revisions. Thus, bold forecasts
 incorporate analysts' private information more completely and provide more
 relevant information to investors than herding forecasts. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Monitoring and Controlling Bank Risk: Does Risky Debt Help? 
Abstract:
 We examine whether mandating banks to issue subordinated debt would
 enhance market monitoring and control risk taking. To evaluate whether
 subordinated debt enhances risk monitoring, we extract the credit-spread
 curve for each banking firm in our sample and examine whether changes in
 credit spreads reflect changes in bank risk variables, after controlling
 for changes in market and liquidity variables. We do not find strong and
 consistent evidence that they do. To evaluate whether subordinated debt
 controls risk taking, we examine whether the first issue of subordinated
 debt changes the risk-taking behavior of a bank. We find that it does not. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Asymmetric Price Movements and Borrowing Constraints: A Rational Expectations Equilibrium Model of Crises, Contagion, and Confusion 
Abstract:
 This study proposes a rational expectations equilibrium model of crises
 and contagion in an economy with information asymmetry and borrowing
 constraints. Consistent with empirical observations, the model finds: (1)
 Crises can be caused by small shocks to fundamentals; (2) market return
 distributions are asymmetric; and (3) correlations among asset returns
 tend to increase during crashes. The model also predicts: (1) Crises and
 contagion are likely to occur after small shocks in the intermediate price
 region; (2) the skewness of asset price distributions increases with
 information asymmetry and borrowing constraints; and (3) crises can spread
 through investor borrowing constraints. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Trading Volume, Information Asymmetry, and Timing Information 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates trading volume before scheduled and unscheduled
 corporate announcements to explore how traders respond to private
 information. I show that cumulative trading volume decreases inversely to
 information asymmetry prior to scheduled announcements, while the opposite
 relation holds for volume after the announcement. In contrast, trading
 volume before unscheduled announcements increases dramatically and shows
 little relation to proxies for information asymmetry. I investigate the
 behavior of market makers and find that they act appropriately by
 increasing price sensitivity before all announcements, implying that they
 extract timing information from their order books. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Role of IPO Underwriting Syndicates: Pricing, Information Production, and Underwriter Competition 
Abstract:
 We examine syndicates for 1,638 IPOs from January 1997 through June 2002.
 We find strong evidence of information production by syndicate members.
 Offer prices are more likely to be revised in response to information when
 the syndicate has more underwriters and especially more co-managers. More
 co-managers also result in more analyst coverage and additional market
 makers following the IPO. Relationships between underwriters are critical
 in determining the composition of syndicates, perhaps because they
 mitigate free-riding and moral hazard problems. While there appear to be
 benefits to larger syndicates, we discuss several factors that may limit
 syndicate size. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: IPO Pricing in "Hot" Market Conditions: Who Leaves Money on the Table? 
Abstract:
 This paper explores the impact of investor sentiment on IPO pricing. Using
 a model in which the aftermarket price of IPO shares depends on the
 information about the intrinsic value of the company and investor
 sentiment, I show that IPOs can be overpriced and still exhibit positive
 initial return. A sample of recent French offerings with a fraction of the
 shares reserved for individual investors supports the predictions of the
 model. Individual investors' demand is positively related to market
 conditions. Moreover, large individual investors' demand leads to high IPO
 prices, large initial returns, and poor long-run performance. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Do Professional Traders Exhibit Myopic Loss Aversion? An Experimental Analysis 
Abstract:
 Two behavioral concepts, loss aversion and mental accounting, have been
 combined to provide a theoretical explanation of the equity premium
 puzzle. Recent experimental evidence supports the theory, as students'
 behavior has been found to be consistent with myopic loss aversion (MLA).
 Yet, much like certain anomalies in the realm of riskless decision-making,
 these behavioral tendencies may be attenuated among professionals. Using
 traders recruited from the CBOT, we do indeed find behavioral differences
 between professionals and students, but rather than discovering that the
 anomaly is muted, we find that traders exhibit behavior consistent with
 MLA to a "greater" extent than students. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.
