Title: Testing Agency Theory with Entrepreneur Effort and Wealth 
Abstract:
 We develop a principal-agent model in an entrepreneurial setting and test
 the model's predictions using unique data on entrepreneurial effort and
 wealth in privately held firms. Accounting for unobserved firm
 heterogeneity using instrumental-variables techniques, we find that
 entrepreneurial ownership shares increase with outside wealth and decrease
 with firm risk; effort increases with ownership; and effort increases firm
 performance. The magnitude of the effects in the cross-section of firms
 suggests that agency costs may help explain why entrepreneurs concentrate
 large fractions of their wealth in firm equity. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Entrepreneurial Spawning: Public Corporations and the Genesis of New Ventures, 1986 to 1999 
Abstract:
 We examine two views of the creation of venture-backed start-ups, or
 "entrepreneurial spawning." In one, young firms prepare employees for
 entrepreneurship, educating them about the process, and exposing them to
 relevant networks. In the other, individuals become entrepreneurs when
 large bureaucratic employers do not fund their ideas. Controlling for firm
 size, patents, and industry, the most prolific spawners are originally
 venture-backed companies located in Silicon Valley and Massachusetts.
 Undiversified firms spawn more firms. Silicon Valley, Massachusetts, and
 originally venture-backed firms typically spawn firms only peripherally
 related to their core businesses. Overall, entrepreneurial learning and
 networks appear important in creating venture-backed firms. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Liquidity Shortages and Banking Crises 
Abstract:
 We show in this article that bank failures can be contagious. Unlike
 earlier work where contagion stems from depositor panics or contractual
 links between banks, we argue that bank failures can shrink the common
 pool of liquidity, creating, or exacerbating aggregate liquidity
 shortages. This could lead to a contagion of failures and a total meltdown
 of the system. Given the costs of a meltdown, there is a possible role for
 government intervention. Unfortunately, liquidity and solvency problems
 interact and can cause each other, making it hard to determine the cause
 of a crisis. We propose a robust sequence of intervention. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Stock Market's Reaction to Unemployment News: Why Bad News Is Usually Good for Stocks 
Abstract:
 We find that on average, an announcement of rising unemployment is good
 news for stocks during economic expansions and bad news during economic
 contractions. Unemployment news bundles three types of primitive
 information relevant for valuing stocks: information about future interest
 rates, the equity risk premium, and corporate earnings and dividends. The
 nature of the information bundle, and hence the relative importance of the
 three effects, changes over time depending on the state of the economy.
 For stocks as a group, information about interest rates dominates during
 expansions and information about future corporate dividends dominates
 during contractions. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Trade Generation, Reputation, and Sell-Side Analysts 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the trade-generation and reputation-building
 incentives facing sell-side analysts. Using a unique data set I
 demonstrate that optimistic analysts generate more trade for their
 brokerage firms, as do high reputation analysts. I also find that accurate
 analysts generate higher reputations. The analyst therefore faces a
 conflict between telling the truth to build her reputation versus
 misleading investors via optimistic forecasts to generate short-term
 increases in trading commissions. In equilibrium I show forecast optimism
 can exist, even when investment-banking affiliations are removed. The
 conclusions may have important policy implications given recent changes in
 the institutional structure of the brokerage industry. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Geography of Equity Analysis 
Abstract:
 I provide evidence that geographically proximate analysts are more
 accurate than other analysts. Stock returns immediately surrounding
 forecast revisions suggest that local analysts impact prices more than
 other analysts. These effects are strongest for firms located in small
 cities and remote areas. Collectively these results suggest that
 geographically proximate analysts possess an information advantage over
 other analysts, and that this advantage translates into better
 performance. The well-documented underwriter affiliation bias in stock
 recommendations is concentrated among distant affiliated analysts;
 recommendations by local affiliated analysts are unbiased. This finding
 reveals a geographic component to the agency problems in the industry. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Wealth Destruction on a Massive Scale? A Study of Acquiring-Firm Returns in the Recent Merger Wave 
Abstract:
 Acquiring-firm shareholders lost 12 cents around acquisition announcements
 per dollar spent on acquisitions for a total loss of $240 billion from
 1998 through 2001, whereas they lost $7 billion in all of the 1980s, or
 1.6 cents per dollar spent. The 1998 to 2001 aggregate dollar loss of
 acquiring-firm shareholders is so large because of a small number of
 acquisitions with negative synergy gains by firms with extremely high
 valuations. Without these acquisitions, the wealth of acquiring-firm
 shareholders would have increased. Firms that make these acquisitions with
 large dollar losses perform poorly afterward. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Lifting the Veil: An Analysis of Pre-trade Transparency at the NYSE 
Abstract:
 We study pre-trade transparency by looking at the introduction of NYSE's
 OpenBook service that provides limit-order book information to traders off
 the exchange floor. We find that traders attempt to manage limit-order
 exposure: They submit smaller orders and cancel orders faster.
 Specialists' participation rate and the depth they add to the quote
 decline. Liquidity increases in that the price impact of orders declines,
 and we find some improvement in the informational efficiency of prices.
 These results suggest that an increase in pre-trade transparency affects
 investors' trading strategies and can improve certain dimensions of market
 quality. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Do Domestic Investors Have an Information Advantage? Evidence from Indonesia 
Abstract:
 Using transaction data from Indonesia, this paper shows that domestic
 investors have higher profits than foreign investors. In addition, clients
 of global brokerages have higher long-term and smaller medium (intramonth)
 and short (intraday) term profits than clients of local brokerages. This
 suggests that clients of local brokerages have a short-lived information
 advantage, but that clients of global brokerages are better at picking
 long-term winners. Finally, domestic clients of global brokerages have
 higher profits than foreign clients of global brokerages, suggesting that
 the combination of local information and global expertise leads to higher
 profits. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Managers, Workers, and Corporate Control 
Abstract:
 If management has high private benefits and a small equity stake, managers
 and workers are natural allies against takeover threats. Two forces are at
 play. First, managers can transform employees into a "shark repellent"
 through long-term labor contracts and thereby reduce the firm's
 attractiveness to raiders. Second, employees can act as "white squires"
 for the incumbent managers. To protect their high wages, they resist
 hostile takeovers by refusing to sell their shares to the raider or by
 lobbying against the takeover. The model predicts that wages are inversely
 correlated with the managerial equity stake, and decline after takeovers. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Optimal Life-Cycle Asset Allocation: Understanding the Empirical Evidence 
Abstract:
 We show that a life-cycle model with realistically calibrated uninsurable
 labor income risk and moderate risk aversion can simultaneously match
 stock market participation rates and asset allocation decisions
 conditional on participation. The key ingredients of the model are
 Epstein-Zin preferences, a fixed stock market entry cost, and moderate
 heterogeneity in risk aversion. Households with low risk aversion smooth
 earnings shocks with a small buffer stock of assets, and consequently most
 of them (optimally) never invest in equities. Therefore, the marginal
 stockholders are (endogenously) more risk averse, and as a result they do
 not invest their portfolios fully in stocks. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Does Idiosyncratic Risk Really Matter? 
Abstract:
 <link rid="b11">Goyal and Santa-Clara (2003)</link> find a significantly
 positive relation between the equal-weighted average stock volatility and
 the value-weighted portfolio returns on the NYSE/AMEX/Nasdaq stocks for
 the period of 1963:08 to 1999:12. We show that this result is driven by
 small stocks traded on the Nasdaq, and is in part due to a liquidity
 premium. In addition, their result does not hold for the extended sample
 of 1963:08 to 2001:12 and for the NYSE/AMEX and NYSE stocks. More
 importantly, we find no evidence of a significant link between the
 value-weighted portfolio returns and the median and value-weighted average
 stock volatility. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Hedging or Market Timing? Selecting the Interest Rate Exposure of Corporate Debt 
Abstract:
 This paper examines whether firms are hedging or timing the market when
 selecting the interest rate exposure of their new debt issuances. I use a
 more accurate measure of the interest rate exposure chosen by firms by
 combining the initial exposure of newly issued debt securities with their
 use of interest rate swaps. The results indicate that the final interest
 rate exposure is largely driven by the slope of the yield curve at the
 time the debt is issued. These results suggest that interest rate risk
 management practices are primarily driven by speculation or myopia, not
 hedging considerations. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Can Managers Forecast Aggregate Market Returns? 
Abstract:
 Previous studies have found that the proportion of equity in total new
 debt and equity issues is negatively correlated with future equity market
 returns. Researchers have interpreted this finding as evidence that
 corporate managers are able to predict the systematic component of their
 stock returns and to issue equity when the market is overvalued. In this
 article we show that the predictive power of the share of equity in total
 new issues stems from pseudo-market timing and not from any abnormal
 ability of managers to time the equity markets. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Partial Privatization and Firm Performance 
Abstract:
 Most privatization programs begin with a period of partial privatization
 in which only non-controlling shares of firms are sold on the stock
 market. Since management control is not transferred to private owners it
 is widely contended that partial privatization has little impact. This
 perspective ignores the role that the stock market can play in monitoring
 and rewarding managerial performance even when the government remains the
 controlling owner. Using data on Indian state-owned enterprises we find
 that partial privatization has a positive impact on profitability,
 productivity, and investment. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Is Debt Relief Efficient? 
Abstract:
 When developing countries announce debt relief agreements under the Brady
 Plan, their stock markets appreciate by an average of 60% in real dollar
 terms-a $42 billion increase in shareholder value. There is no significant
 stock market increase for a control group of countries that do not sign
 Brady agreements. The stock market appreciations successfully forecast
 higher future resource transfers, investment, and growth. Since the market
 capitalization of U.S. commercial banks with developing country loan
 exposure also rises-by $13 billion-the results suggest that both borrower
 and lenders can benefit from debt relief when the borrower suffers from
 debt overhang. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.
