Title: Equilibrium in a Dynamic Limit Order Market 
Abstract:
 We model a dynamic limit order market as a stochastic sequential game with
 rational traders. Since the model is analytically intractable, we provide
 an algorithm based on <link rid="b43">Pakes and McGuire (2001)</link> to
 find a stationary Markov-perfect equilibrium. We then generate artificial
 time series and perform comparative dynamics. Conditional on a
 transaction, the midpoint of the quoted prices is not a good proxy for the
 true value. Further, transaction costs paid by market order submitters are
 negative on average, and negatively correlated with the effective spread.
 Reducing the tick size is not Pareto improving but increases total
 investor surplus. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Optimal Concentration of Creditors 
Abstract:
 Our model assumes that creditors need to expend resources to collect on
 claims. Consequently, because diffuse creditors suffer from mutual
 free-riding (<link rid="b13">Holmstrom (1982)</link>), they fare worse
 than concentrated creditors (e.g., a house bank). The model predicts that
 measures of debt concentration relate positively to creditors' (aggregate)
 debt collection expenditures and positively to management's chosen
 expenditures to resist paying. However, collection activity is purely
 redistributive, so social waste is larger when creditors are concentrated.
 If borrower quality is not known, the best firms choose the most
 concentrated creditors and pay higher expected yields. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Corporate Yield Spreads: Default Risk or Liquidity? New Evidence from the Credit Default Swap Market 
Abstract:
 We use the information in credit default swaps to obtain direct measures
 of the size of the default and nondefault components in corporate spreads.
 We find that the majority of the corporate spread is due to default risk.
 This result holds for all rating categories and is robust to the
 definition of the riskless curve. We also find that the nondefault
 component is time varying and strongly related to measures of
 bond-specific illiquidity as well as to macroeconomic measures of bond
 market liquidity. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: An Empirical Analysis of the Dynamic Relation between Investment-Grade Bonds and Credit Default Swaps 
Abstract:
 We test the theoretical equivalence of credit default swap (CDS) prices
 and credit spreads derived by <link rid="b13">Duffie (1999)</link>,
 finding support for the parity relation as an equilibrium condition. We
 also find two forms of deviation from parity. First, for three firms, CDS
 prices are substantially higher than credit spreads for long periods of
 time, arising from combinations of imperfections in the contract
 specification of CDSs and measurement errors in computing the credit
 spread. Second, we find short-lived deviations from parity for all other
 companies due to a lead for CDS prices over credit spreads in the price
 discovery process. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Stochastic Convenience Yield Implied from Commodity Futures and Interest Rates 
Abstract:
 We characterize a three-factor model of commodity spot prices, convenience
 yields, and interest rates, which nests many existing specifications. The
 model allows convenience yields to depend on spot prices and interest
 rates. It also allows for time-varying risk premia. Both may induce mean
 reversion in spot prices, albeit with very different economic
 implications. Empirical results show strong evidence for spot-price level
 dependence in convenience yields for crude oil and copper, which implies
 mean reversion in prices under the risk-neutral measure. Silver, gold, and
 copper exhibit time variation in risk premia that implies mean reversion
 of prices under the physical measure. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Managerial Stock Ownership and the Maturity Structure of Corporate Debt 
Abstract:
 This study documents that managerial stock ownership plays an important
 role in determining corporate debt maturity. Controlling for previously
 identified determinants of debt maturity and modeling leverage and debt
 maturity as jointly endogenous, we document a significant and robust
 inverse relation between managerial stock ownership and corporate debt
 maturity. We also show that managerial stock ownership influences the
 relation between credit quality and debt maturity and between growth
 opportunities and debt maturity. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Trends in Corporate Governance 
Abstract:
 The popular press and scholarly studies have noted a number of trends in
 corporate governance. This article addresses, from a theoretical
 perspective, whether these trends are linked. And, if so, how? The article
 finds that a trend toward greater board diligence will lead, sometimes
 through subtle or indirect mechanisms, to trends toward more external
 candidates becoming CEO, shorter tenures for CEOs, more effort/less
 perquisite consumption by CEOs (even though such behavior is "not"
 directly monitored), and greater CEO compensation. An additional
 prediction is that, under plausible conditions, externally hired CEOs
 should have shorter tenures, on average, than internally hired CEOs. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Methods of Payment in Asset Sales: Contracting with Equity versus Cash 
Abstract:
 We analyze intercorporate asset sales where equity is the means of
 payment, and compare the results to cash asset sales. Equity deals are
 value-enhancing for both buyers, 10%, and sellers, 3%, while cash sales
 generate seller returns of 1.9% and buyer returns that are not
 significant. Combined wealth gains are large for equity deals, but modest
 for cash deals. Equity-based asset sales are not a precursor to
 consolidations between buyers and sellers, and do not affect buyer
 openness to the takeover market. We conclude that the use of buyer equity
 conveys favorable information about the value of assets and buyers. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Vested Interest and Biased Price Estimates: Evidence from an Auction Market 
Abstract:
 This study employs a new data set from art auctions to examine the
 relationship between auctioneer presale price estimates and the long-term
 performance of artworks. We find that the price estimates for expensive
 paintings have a consistent upward bias over a long period of 30 years.
 High estimates at the time of purchase are associated with adverse
 subsequent abnormal returns. Moreover, the estimation error for individual
 paintings tends to persist over time. These results are consistent with
 the view that auction house price estimates are affected by agency
 problems and that some investors are credulous. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Wanna Dance? How Firms and Underwriters Choose Each Other 
Abstract:
 We develop and test a theory explaining the equilibrium matching of
 issuers and underwriters. We assume that issuers and underwriters
 associate by mutual choice, and that underwriter ability and issuer
 quality are complementary. Our model implies that matching is positive
 assortative, and that matches are based on firms' and underwriters'
 relative characteristics at the time of issuance. The model predicts that
 the market share of top underwriters and their average issue quality
 varies inversely with issuance volume. Various cross-sectional patterns in
 underwriting spreads are consistent with equilibrium matching. We find
 strong empirical confirmation of our theory. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Arbitraging Arbitrageurs 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a theory of strategic trading in markets with large
 arbitrageurs. If arbitrageurs are not well capitalized, capital
 constraints make their trades predictable. Other market participants can
 exploit this by trading against them. Competitors may find it optimal to
 lend to arbitrageurs that are financially fragile; additional capital
 makes the arbitrageurs more viable, and lenders can reap profits from
 trading against them for a longer time. The strategic behavior of these
 market participants has implications for the functioning of financial
 markets. Strategic trading may produce significant price distortions,
 increase price manipulation, and trigger forced liquidations of large
 traders. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Information and Control in Ventures and Alliances 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a theory of control as a signal of congruence of
 objectives, and applies it to financial contracting between an investor
 and a privately informed entrepreneur. We show that formal investor
 control is (i) increasing in the information asymmetries ex ante, (ii)
 increasing in the uncertainty surrounding the venture ex post, (iii)
 decreasing in the entrepreneur's resources, and (iv) increasing in the
 entrepreneur's incentive conflict. In contrast, real investor control-that
 is, actual investor interference-is decreasing in information asymmetries.
 Control rights are further such that control shifts to the investor in bad
 states of nature. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Market Impact of Trends and Sequences in Performance: New Evidence 
Abstract:
 <link rid="b6">Bloomfield and Hales (2002)</link> find strong evidence
 that experimental market subjects are influenced by trends and patterns in
 a manner supportive of the shifting regimes model of <link
 rid="b3">Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998)</link>. We subject the
 model to further empirical scrutiny using the football wagering market as
 our price laboratory. Sports betting markets have several advantages over
 traditional capital markets as an empirical setting, and commonalities
 with traditional markets allow for useful insights. We find scant evidence
 that investors behave in accordance with the model. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association.
