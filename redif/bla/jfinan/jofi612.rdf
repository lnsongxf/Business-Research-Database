Title: Bank Mergers and Crime: The Real and Social Effects of Credit Market Competition 
Abstract:
 Using a unique sample of commercial loans and mergers between large banks,
 we provide micro-level (within-county) evidence linking credit conditions
 to economic development and find a spillover effect on crime.
 Neighborhoods that experience more bank mergers are subject to higher
 interest rates, diminished local construction, lower prices, an influx of
 poorer households, and higher property crime in subsequent years. The
 elasticity of property crime with respect to merger-induced banking
 concentration is 0.18. We show that these results are not likely due to
 reverse causation, and confirm the central findings using state branching
 deregulation to instrument for bank competition. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: A Consumption-Based Explanation of Expected Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 When utility is nonseparable in nondurable and durable consumption and the
 elasticity of substitution between the two consumption goods is
 sufficiently high, marginal utility rises when durable consumption falls.
 The model explains both the cross-sectional variation in expected stock
 returns and the time variation in the equity premium. Small stocks and
 value stocks deliver relatively low returns during recessions, when
 durable consumption falls, which explains their high average returns
 relative to big stocks and growth stocks. Stock returns are unexpectedly
 low at business cycle troughs, when durable consumption falls sharply,
 which explains the countercyclical variation in the equity premium. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Do the Fama-French Factors Proxy for Innovations in Predictive Variables? 
Abstract:
 The Fama-French factors HML and SMB are correlated with innovations in
 variables that describe investment opportunities. A model that includes
 shocks to the aggregate dividend yield and term spread, default spread,
 and one-month Treasury-bill yield explains the cross section of average
 returns better than the Fama-French model. When loadings on the
 innovations in the predictive variables are present in the model, loadings
 on HML and SMB lose their explanatory power for the cross section of
 returns. The results are consistent with an ICAPM explanation for the
 empirical success of the Fama-French portfolios. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Risk, Reputation, and IPO Price Support 
Abstract:
 Immediately following an initial public offering, underwriters often
 repurchase shares of poorly performing offerings in an apparent attempt to
 stabilize the price. Using proprietary Nasdaq data, I study the price
 effects and determinants of price support. Some of the key findings are
 (1) Stabilization is substantial, inducing price rigidity at and below the
 offer price; (2) I find no evidence that stocks with larger information
 asymmetries are stabilized more strongly; (3) Larger underwriters
 stabilize more, perhaps to protect their reputations with investors; and
 (4) Investment banks with retail brokerage operations stabilize much more
 than other banks, inconsistent with the view that stabilization benefits
 primarily institutional investors. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Does Weak Governance Cause Weak Stock Returns? An Examination of Firm Operating Performance and Investors' Expectations 
Abstract:
 We investigate <link rid="b27">Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick's (2003)</link>
 finding that firms with weak shareholder rights exhibit significant stock
 market underperformance. If the relation between poor governance and poor
 returns is causal, we expect that the market is negatively surprised by
 the poor operating performance of weak governance firms. We find that
 firms with weak shareholder rights exhibit significant operating
 underperformance. However, analysts' forecast errors and earnings
 announcement returns show no evidence that this underperformance surprises
 the market. Our results are robust to controls for takeover activity.
 Overall, our results do not support the hypothesis that weak governance
 causes poor stock returns. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Are Busy Boards Effective Monitors? 
Abstract:
 Firms with busy boards, those in which a majority of outside directors
 hold three or more directorships, are associated with weak corporate
 governance. These firms exhibit lower market-to-book ratios, weaker
 profitability, and lower sensitivity of CEO turnover to firm performance.
 Independent but busy boards display CEO turnover-performance sensitivities
 indistinguishable from those of inside-dominated boards. Departures of
 busy outside directors generate positive abnormal returns (ARs). When
 directors become busy as a result of acquiring an additional directorship,
 other companies in which they hold board seats experience negative ARs.
 Busy outside directors are more likely to depart boards following poor
 performance. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Does Investor Misvaluation Drive the Takeover Market? 
Abstract:
 This paper uses pre-offer market valuations to evaluate the misvaluation
 and "Q" theories of takeovers. Bidder and target valuations
 (price-to-book, or price-to-residual-income-model-value) are related to
 means of payment, mode of acquisition, premia, target hostility, offer
 success, and bidder and target announcement-period returns. The evidence
 is broadly consistent with both hypotheses. The evidence for the "Q"
 hypothesis is stronger in the pre-1990 period than in the 1990-2000
 period, whereas the evidence for the misvaluation hypothesis is stronger
 in the 1990-2000 period than in the pre-1990 period. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Offering versus Choice in 401(k) Plans: Equity Exposure and Number of Funds 
Abstract:
 Records of over half a million participants in more than 600 401(k) plans
 indicate that participants tend to allocate their contributions evenly
 across the funds they use, with the tendency weakening with the number of
 funds used. The number of funds used, typically between three and four, is
 not sensitive to the number of funds offered by the plans, which ranges
 from 4 to 59. A participant's propensity to allocate contributions to
 equity funds is not very sensitive to the fraction of equity funds among
 offered funds. The paper also comments on limitations on inferences from
 experiments and aggregate-level data analysis. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Entrepreneur's Choice between Private and Public Ownership 
Abstract:
 We analyze an entrepreneur/manager's choice between private and public
 ownership. The manager needs decision-making autonomy to optimally manage
 the firm and thus trades off an endogenized control preference against the
 higher cost of capital accompanying greater managerial autonomy. Investors
 need liquid ownership stakes. Public capital markets provide liquidity,
 but stipulate corporate governance that imposes generic exogenous
 controls, so the manager may not attain the desired trade-off between
 autonomy and the cost of capital. In contrast, private ownership provides
 the desired trade-off through precisely calibrated contracting, but
 creates illiquid ownership. Exploring this tension generates new
 predictions. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Market Valuation of Tax-Timing Options: Evidence from Capital Gains Distributions 
Abstract:
 We examine a distribution that is taxed as a capital gain rather than as a
 dividend. Since the distribution induces a realized capital gain while the
 price change is an unrealized gain, ex-day return behavior provides
 evidence of the value of tax-timing capital gains. We show that investors
 are compensated 7&cent; in unrealized gains for each dollar of realized
 capital gains, that is, $1 of realized capital gains is equivalent to
 93&cent; of unrealized gains. An investor with a tax rate on realized
 gains of 15% has an effective tax rate on unrealized capital gains of
 8.6%. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Banks' Advantage in Hedging Liquidity Risk: Theory and Evidence from the Commercial Paper Market 
Abstract:
 Banks have a unique ability to hedge against market-wide liquidity shocks.
 Deposit inflows provide funding for loan demand shocks that follow
 declines in market liquidity. Consequently, banks can insure firms against
 systematic declines in liquidity at lower cost than other institutions. We
 provide evidence that when liquidity dries up and commercial paper spreads
 widen, banks experience funding inflows. These flows allow banks to meet
 loan demand from borrowers drawing funds from commercial paper backup
 lines without running down their holdings of liquid assets. We also
 provide evidence that implicit government support for banks during crises
 explains these funding flows. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Firm Value and Hedging: Evidence from U.S. Oil and Gas Producers 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the hedging activities of 119 U.S. oil and gas
 producers from 1998 to 2001 and evaluates their effect on firm value.
 Theories of hedging based on market imperfections imply that hedging
 should increase the firm's market value (MV). To test this hypothesis, we
 collect detailed information on the extent of hedging and on the valuation
 of oil and gas reserves. We verify that hedging reduces the firm's stock
 price sensitivity to oil and gas prices. Contrary to previous studies,
 however, we find that hedging does not seem to affect MVs for this
 industry. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Pension Plan Funding and Stock Market Efficiency 
Abstract:
 The paper argues that the market significantly overvalues firms with
 severely underfunded pension plans. These companies earn lower stock
 returns than firms with healthier pension plans for at least 5 years after
 the first emergence of the underfunding. The low returns are not explained
 by risk, price momentum, earnings momentum, or accruals. Further, the
 evidence suggests that investors do not anticipate the impact of the
 pension liability on future earnings, and they are surprised when the
 negative implications of underfunding ultimately materialize. Finally,
 underfunded firms have poor operating performance, and they earn low
 returns, although they are value companies. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: How Do Crises Spread? Evidence from Accessible and Inaccessible Stock Indices 
Abstract:
 We provide empirical evidence that stock market crises are spread globally
 through asset holdings of international investors. By separating emerging
 market stocks into two categories, namely, those that are eligible for
 purchase by foreigners (accessible) and those that are not (inaccessible),
 we estimate and compare the degree to which accessible and inaccessible
 stock index returns co-move with crisis country index returns. Our results
 show greater co-movement during high volatility periods, especially for
 accessible stock index returns, suggesting that crises spread through the
 asset holdings of international investors rather than through changes in
 fundamentals. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.
