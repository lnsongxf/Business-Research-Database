Title: Corporate Investment and Asset Price Dynamics: Implications for SEO Event Studies and Long-Run Performance 
Abstract:
 We present a rational theory of SEOs that explains a pre-issuance price
 run-up, a negative announcement effect, and long-run post-issuance
 underperformance. When SEOs finance investment in a real options
 framework, expected returns decrease endogenously because growth options
 are converted into assets in place. Regardless of their risk, the new
 assets are less risky than the options they replace. Although both size
 and book-to-market effects are present, standard matching procedures fail
 to fully capture the dynamics of risk and expected return. We calibrate
 the model and show that it closely matches the primary features of SEO
 return dynamics. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Credit Ratings and Capital Structure 
Abstract:
 This paper examines to what extent credit ratings directly affect capital
 structure decisions. The paper outlines discrete costs (benefits)
 associated with firm credit rating level differences and tests whether
 concerns for these costs (benefits) directly affect debt and equity
 financing decisions. Firms near a credit rating upgrade or downgrade issue
 less debt relative to equity than firms not near a change in rating. This
 behavior is consistent with discrete costs (benefits) of rating changes
 but is not explained by traditional capital structure theories. The
 results persist within previous empirical tests of the pecking order and
 tradeoff capital structure theories. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Asset Float and Speculative Bubbles 
Abstract:
 We model the relationship between asset float (tradeable shares) and
 speculative bubbles. Investors with heterogeneous beliefs and short-sales
 constraints trade a stock with limited float because of insider lockups. A
 bubble arises as price overweighs optimists' beliefs and investors
 anticipate the option to resell to those with even higher valuations. The
 bubble's size depends on float as investors anticipate an increase in
 float with lockup expirations and speculate over the degree of insider
 selling. Consistent with the internet experience, the bubble, turnover,
 and volatility decrease with float and prices drop on the lockup
 expiration date. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Effect of Short Selling on Bubbles and Crashes in Experimental Spot Asset Markets 
Abstract:
 A series of experiments illustrate that relaxing short-selling constraints
 lowers prices in experimental asset markets, but does not induce prices to
 track fundamentals. We argue that prices in experimental asset markets are
 influenced by restrictions on short-selling capacity and limits on the
 cash available for purchases. Restrictions on short sales in the form of
 cash reserve requirements and quantity limits on short positions behave in
 a similar manner. A simulation model, based on <link rid="b7">DeLong et
 al. (1990)</link>, generates average price patterns that are similar to
 the observed data. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Analysts' Selective Coverage and Subsequent Performance of Newly Public Firms 
Abstract:
 This study examines the ability of analysts to forecast future firm
 performance, based on the selective coverage of newly public firms. We
 hypothesize that the decision to provide coverage contains information
 about an analyst's underlying expectation of a firm's future prospects. We
 extract this expectation by obtaining "residual analyst coverage" from a
 model of initial analyst following. We document that in the three
 subsequent years, initial public offerings with high residual coverage
 have significantly better returns and operating performance than those
 with low residual coverage. This evidence indicates analysts have superior
 predictive abilities and selectively provide coverage for firms about
 which their true expectations are favorable. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Investor Sentiment and Pre-IPO Markets 
Abstract:
 We examine whether irrational behavior among small (retail) investors
 drives post-IPO prices. We use prices from the grey market (the
 when-issued market that precedes European IPOs) to proxy for small
 investors' valuations. High grey market prices (indicating overoptimism)
 are a very good predictor of first-day aftermarket prices, while low grey
 market prices (indicating excessive pessimism) are not. Moreover, we find
 long-run price reversal only following high grey market prices. This
 asymmetry occurs because larger (institutional) investors can choose
 between keeping the shares they are allocated in the IPO, and reselling
 them when small investors are overoptimistic. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Corporate Equity Ownership and the Governance of Product Market Relationships 
Abstract:
 We assemble a sample of over 10,000 customer-supplier relationships and
 determine whether the customer owns equity in the supplier. We find that
 factors related to both contractual incompleteness and financial market
 frictions are important in the decision of a customer firm to take an
 equity stake in their supplier. Evidence on the variation in the size of
 observed equity positions suggests that there are limits to the size of
 optimal ownership stakes in many relationships. Finally, we find that
 relationships accompanied by equity ownership last significantly longer
 than other relationships, suggesting that ownership aids in bonding
 trading parties together. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Costs of Bankruptcy: Chapter 7 Liquidation versus Chapter 11 Reorganization 
Abstract:
 Our paper explores a comprehensive sample of small and large corporate
 bankruptcies in Arizona and New York from 1995 to 2001. Bankruptcy costs
 are very heterogeneous and sensitive to the measurement method used. We
 find that Chapter 7 liquidations appear to be no faster or cheaper (in
 terms of direct expense) than Chapter 11 reorganizations. However, Chapter
 11 seems to preserve assets better, thereby allowing creditors to recover
 relatively more. Our paper also provides a large number of further
 empirical regularities. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Do Dividend Clienteles Exist? Evidence on Dividend Preferences of Retail Investors 
Abstract:
 We study stock holdings and trading behavior of more than 60,000
 households and find evidence consistent with dividend clienteles. Retail
 investor stock holdings indicate a preference for dividend yield that
 increases with age and decreases with income, consistent with age and tax
 clienteles, respectively. Trading patterns reinforce this evidence: Older,
 low-income investors disproportionally purchase stocks before the
 ex-dividend day. Furthermore, among small stocks, the ex-day price drop
 decreases with age and increases with income, consistent with clientele
 effects. Finally, consistent with the behavioral "attention" hypothesis,
 we document that older and low-income investors purchase stocks following
 dividend announcements. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Does a Parent-Subsidiary Structure Enhance Financing Flexibility? 
Abstract:
 I examine whether firms exploit a publicly traded parent-subsidiary
 structure to issue equity of the overvalued firm regardless of which firm
 needs funds, and whether this conveys opposite information about firm
 values. Using 90 subsidiary and 37 parent seasoned equity offering (SEO)
 announcements during 1981-2002, I document negative returns to issuers but
 insignificant returns to nonissuers in both samples, and insignificant
 changes in combined firm value and parent's nonsubsidiary equity value in
 subsidiary SEOs. Firms issue equity to meet their own financing needs. My
 evidence contrasts with previous studies and suggests that
 parent-subsidiary structures do not enhance financing flexibility. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Secondary Trading Costs in the Municipal Bond Market 
Abstract:
 Using new econometric methods, we separately estimate average transaction
 costs for over 167,000 bonds from a 1-year sample of all U.S. municipal
 bond trades. Municipal bond transaction costs decrease with trade size and
 do not depend significantly on trade frequency. Also, municipal bond
 trades are substantially more expensive than similar-sized equity trades.
 We attribute these results to the lack of bond market price transparency.
 Additional cross-sectional analyses show that bond trading costs increase
 with credit risk, instrument complexity, time to maturity, and time since
 issuance. Investors, and perhaps ultimately issuers, might benefit if
 issuers issued simpler bonds. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Capital Gains Tax Overhang and Price Pressure 
Abstract:
 I study whether the capital gains tax is an impediment to selling by some
 investors and if so, to what degree associated delayed selling affects
 stock prices. I find that selling decisions by institutions serving
 tax-sensitive clients are sensitive to cumulative capital gains, a pattern
 not observed for institutions with predominantly tax-exempt clients.
 Moreover, tax-related underselling impacts stock prices during large
 earnings surprises for stocks held primarily by tax-sensitive investors.
 The corresponding price reactions are less negative (more positive) with
 higher cumulative capital gains. This price pressure pattern is more
 severe when arbitrage is more costly. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Uncovering the Risk-Return Relation in the Stock Market 
Abstract:
 There is ongoing debate about the apparent weak or negative relation
 between risk (conditional variance) and expected returns in the aggregate
 stock market. We develop and estimate an empirical model based on the
 intertemporal capital asset pricing model (ICAPM) that separately
 identifies the two components of expected returns, namely, the risk
 component and the component due to the desire to hedge changes in
 investment opportunities. The estimated coefficient of relative risk
 aversion is positive, statistically significant, and reasonable in
 magnitude. However, expected returns are driven primarily by the hedge
 component. The omission of this component is partly responsible for the
 existing contradictory results. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Distance Constraints: The Limits of Foreign Lending in Poor Economies 
Abstract:
 How far does mobility of multinational banks solve problems of financial
 development? Using a panel of 80,000 loans over 7 years, I show that
 greater cultural and geographical distance between a foreign bank's
 headquarters and local branches leads it to further avoid lending to
 "informationally difficult" yet fundamentally sound firms requiring
 relational contracting. Greater distance also makes them less likely to
 bilaterally renegotiate, and less successful at recovering defaults.
 Differences in bank size, legal institutions, risk preferences, or
 unobserved borrower heterogeneity cannot explain these results. These
 distance constraints can be large enough to permanently exclude certain
 sectors of the economy from financing by foreign banks. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Which Investors Fear Expropriation? Evidence from Investors' Portfolio Choices 
Abstract:
 Using a data set that provides unprecedented detail on investors'
 stockholdings, we analyze whether investors take the quality of corporate
 governance into account when selecting stocks. We find that all categories
 of investors (domestic and foreign, institutional and small individual)
 who generally enjoy only security benefits are reluctant to invest in
 companies with weak corporate governance. In contrast, individuals
 connected with company insiders are more likely to invest in weak
 corporate governance companies. These findings suggest that it is
 important to distinguish between investors who enjoy private benefits or
 access private information, and investors who enjoy only security
 benefits. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.
