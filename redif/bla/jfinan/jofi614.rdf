Title: Household Finance 
Abstract:
 The study of household finance is challenging because household behavior
 is difficult to measure, and households face constraints not captured by
 textbook models. Evidence on participation, diversification, and mortgage
 refinancing suggests that many households invest effectively, but a
 minority make significant mistakes. This minority appears to be poorer and
 less well educated than the majority of more successful investors. There
 is some evidence that households understand their own limitations and
 avoid financial strategies for which they feel unqualified. Some financial
 products involve a cross-subsidy from naive to sophisticated households,
 and this can inhibit welfare-improving financial innovation. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Market Reactions to Tangible and Intangible Information 
Abstract:
 The book-to-market effect is often interpreted as evidence of high
 expected returns on stocks of "distressed" firms with poor past
 performance. We dispute this interpretation. We find that while a stock's
 future return is unrelated to the firm's past accounting-based
 performance, it is strongly negatively related to the "intangible" return,
 the component of its past return that is orthogonal to the firm's past
 performance. Indeed, the book-to-market ratio forecasts returns because it
 is a good proxy for the intangible return. Also, a composite equity
 issuance measure, which is related to intangible returns, independently
 forecasts returns. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Investor Sentiment and the Cross-Section of Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 We study how investor sentiment affects the cross-section of stock
 returns. We predict that a wave of investor sentiment has larger effects
 on securities whose valuations are highly subjective and difficult to
 arbitrage. Consistent with this prediction, we find that when
 beginning-of-period proxies for sentiment are low, subsequent returns are
 relatively high for small stocks, young stocks, high volatility stocks,
 unprofitable stocks, non-dividend-paying stocks, extreme growth stocks,
 and distressed stocks. When sentiment is high, on the other hand, these
 categories of stock earn relatively low subsequent returns. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: How Persistent Is the Impact of Market Timing on Capital Structure? 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the capital structure implications of market timing. I
 isolate timing attempts in a single major financing event, the initial
 public offering, by identifying market timers as firms that go public in
 hot issue markets. I find that hot-market IPO firms issue substantially
 more equity, and lower their leverage ratios by more, than cold-market
 firms do. However, immediately after going public, hot-market firms
 increase their leverage ratios by issuing more debt and less equity
 relative to cold-market firms. At the end of the second year following the
 IPO, the impact of market timing on leverage completely vanishes. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Predicting Returns with Managerial Decision Variables: Is There a Small-Sample Bias? 
Abstract:
 Many studies find that aggregate managerial decision variables, such as
 aggregate equity issuance, predict stock or bond market returns. Recent
 research argues that these findings may be driven by an aggregate
 time-series version of <link rid="b27">Schultz's</link> (2003, "Journal of
 Finance" 58, 483-517) pseudo market-timing bias. Using standard simulation
 techniques, we find that the bias is much too small to account for the
 observed predictive power of the equity share in new issues, corporate
 investment plans, insider trading, dividend initiations, or the maturity
 of corporate debt issues. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Can Managers Successfully Time the Maturity Structure of Their Debt Issues? 
Abstract:
 This paper provides a rational explanation for the apparent ability of
 managers to successfully time the maturity of their debt issues. We show
 that a structural break in excess bond returns during the early 1980s
 generates a spurious correlation between the fraction of long-term debt in
 total debt issues and future excess bond returns. Contrary to <link
 rid="b5">Baker, Taliaferro, and Wurgler (2006)</link>, we show that the
 presence of structural breaks can lead to nonsense regressions, whether or
 not there is any small sample bias. Tests using firm-level data further
 confirm that managers are unable to time the debt market successfully. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: CEO Turnover after Acquisitions: Are Bad Bidders Fired? 
Abstract:
 We examine the relation between bidder returns and the probability of
 chief executive officer (CEO) turnover in acquiring firms. Using a sample
 of 714 acquisitions during 1990 to 1998, we find that 47% of CEOs of
 acquiring firms are replaced within 5 years, including 27% by internal
 governance, 16% by takeovers, and 4% by bankruptcy. A significant inverse
 relation exists between bidder returns and the likelihood of CEO turnover.
 This relation is not associated with governance structure. It also is not
 significantly different in stock versus cash acquisitions, which appears
 to be inconsistent with Shleifer and Vishny's theory of "stock market
 driven" acquisitions. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: CEOs' Outside Employment Opportunities and the Lack of Relative Performance Evaluation in Compensation Contracts 
Abstract:
 Although agency theory suggests that firms should index executive
 compensation to remove market-wide effects (i.e., RPE), there is little
 evidence to support this theory. Oyer (2004, "Journal of Finance" 59,
 1619-1649) posits that an absence of RPE is optimal if the CEO's
 reservation wages from outside employment opportunities vary with the
 economy's fortunes. We directly test and find support for <link
 rid="b36">Oyer's (2004)</link> theory. We argue that the CEO's outside
 opportunities depend on his talent, as proxied by the CEO's financial
 press visibility and his firm's industry-adjusted ROA. Our results are
 robust to alternate explanations such as managerial skimming, oligopoly,
 and asymmetric benchmarking. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Information Control, Career Concerns, and Corporate Governance 
Abstract:
 We examine corporate governance effectiveness when the CEO generates
 project ideas and the board of directors screens these ideas for approval.
 However, the precision of the board's screening information is controlled
 by the CEO. Moreover, both the CEO and the board have career concerns that
 interact. The board's career concerns cause it to distort its investment
 recommendation procyclically, whereas the CEO's career concerns cause her
 to sometimes reduce the precision of the board's information. Moreover,
 the CEO sometimes prefers a less able board, and this happens only during
 economic upturns, suggesting that corporate governance will be weaker
 during economic upturns. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Do Banks Affect the Level and Composition of Industrial Volatility? 
Abstract:
 In theory, better access to bank credit can reduce or increase output
 volatility depending on whether firms are more financially constrained
 during contractions or expansions. This paper finds that the volatility of
 industrial output is lower in countries with more bank credit. Most of the
 reduction in volatility is idiosyncratic, which follows from the ability
 of banks to pool and diversify shocks. Systematic volatility is reduced
 less strongly. Volatility dampening is achieved via countercyclical
 borrowing: At the firm level, short-term borrowing is less (or more
 negatively) correlated with sales and inventories in countries with high
 levels of bank credit. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Industry Concentration and Average Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 Firms in more concentrated industries earn lower returns, even after
 controlling for size, book-to-market, momentum, and other return
 determinants. Explanations based on chance, measurement error, capital
 structure, and persistent in-sample cash flow shocks do not explain this
 finding. Drawing on work in industrial organization, we posit that either
 barriers to entry in highly concentrated industries insulate firms from
 undiversifiable distress risk, or firms in highly concentrated industries
 are less risky because they engage in less innovation, and thereby command
 lower expected returns. Additional time-series tests support these
 risk-based interpretations. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Corporate Financial Policy and the Value of Cash 
Abstract:
 We examine the cross-sectional variation in the marginal value of
 corporate cash holdings that arises from differences in corporate
 financial policy. We begin by providing semi-quantitative predictions for
 the value of an extra dollar of cash depending upon the likely use of that
 dollar, and derive a set of intuitive hypotheses to test empirically. By
 examining the variation in excess stock returns over the fiscal year, we
 find that the marginal value of cash declines with larger cash holdings,
 higher leverage, better access to capital markets, and as firms choose
 greater cash distribution via dividends rather than repurchases. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Does Corporate Headquarters Location Matter for Stock Returns? 
Abstract:
 We document strong comovement in the stock returns of firms headquartered
 in the same geographic area. Moreover, stocks of companies that change
 their headquarters location experience a decrease in their comovement with
 stocks from the old location and an increase in their comovement with
 stocks from the new location. The local comovement of stock returns is not
 explained by economic fundamentals and is stronger for smaller firms with
 more individual investors and in regions with less financially
 sophisticated residents. We argue that price formation in equity markets
 has a significant geographic component linked to the trading patterns of
 local residents. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Disposition Effect and Underreaction to News 
Abstract:
 This paper tests whether the "disposition effect," that is the tendency of
 investors to ride losses and realize gains, induces "underreaction" to
 news, leading to return predictability. I use data on mutual fund holdings
 to construct a new measure of reference purchasing prices for individual
 stocks, and I show that post-announcement price drift is most severe
 whenever capital gains and the news event have the same sign. The
 magnitude of the drift depends on the capital gains (losses) experienced
 by the stock holders on the event date. An event-driven strategy based on
 this effect yields monthly alphas of over 200 basis points. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.
