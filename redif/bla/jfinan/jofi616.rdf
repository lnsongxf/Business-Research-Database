Title: Political Connections and Corporate Bailouts 
Abstract:
 We analyze the likelihood of government bailouts of 450 politically
 connected firms from 35 countries during 1997-2002. Politically connected
 firms are significantly more likely to be bailed out than similar
 nonconnected firms. Additionally, politically connected firms are
 disproportionately more likely to be bailed out when the International
 Monetary Fund or the World Bank provides financial assistance to the
 firm's home government. Further, among bailed-out firms, those that are
 politically connected exhibit significantly worse financial performance
 than their nonconnected peers at the time of and following the bailout.
 This evidence suggests that, at least in some countries, political
 connections influence the allocation of capital through the mechanism of
 financial assistance when connected companies confront economic distress. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: A Theory of Pyramidal Ownership and Family Business Groups 
Abstract:
 We provide a new rationale for pyramidal ownership in family business
 groups. A pyramid allows a family to access all retained earnings of a
 firm it already controls to set up a new firm, and to share the new firm's
 nondiverted payoff with shareholders of the original firm. Our model is
 consistent with recent evidence of a small separation between ownership
 and control in some pyramids, and can differentiate between pyramids and
 dual-class shares, even when either method can achieve the same deviation
 from one share-one vote. Other predictions of the model are consistent
 with both systematic and anecdotal evidence. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Optimal Security Design and Dynamic Capital Structure in a Continuous-Time Agency Model 
Abstract:
 We derive the optimal dynamic contract in a continuous-time
 principal-agent setting, and implement it with a capital structure (credit
 line, long-term debt, and equity) over which the agent controls the payout
 policy. While the project's volatility and liquidation cost have little
 impact on the firm's total debt capacity, they increase the use of credit
 versus debt. Leverage is nonstationary, and declines with past
 profitability. The firm may hold a compensating cash balance while
 borrowing (at a higher rate) through the credit line. Surprisingly, the
 usual conflicts between debt and equity (asset substitution, strategic
 default) need not arise. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Does the Contribution of Corporate Cash Holdings and Dividends to Firm Value Depend on Governance? A Cross-country Analysis 
Abstract:
 Agency theories predict that the value of corporate cash holdings is less
 in countries with poor investor protection because of the greater ability
 of controlling shareholders to extract private benefits from cash holdings
 in such countries. Using various specifications of the valuation
 regressions of <link rid="b8">Fama and French (1998)</link>, we find that
 the relation between cash holdings and firm value is much weaker in
 countries with poor investor protection than in other countries. In
 further support of the importance of agency theories, the relation between
 dividends and firm value is weaker in countries with stronger investor
 protection. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Estimating the Gains from Trade in Limit-Order Markets 
Abstract:
 We present a method to estimate the gains from trade in limit-order
 markets and provide empirical evidence that the limit-order market is a
 good market design. Using observations on order submissions and execution
 and cancellation histories, we estimate both the distribution of traders'
 unobserved valuations for the stock and latent trader arrival rates. We
 use the resulting estimates to compute the current gains from trade, the
 gains from trade in a perfectly liquid market, and the gains from trade
 with a monopoly liquidity supplier. The current gains are 90% of the
 maximum gains and 150% of the monopolist gains. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Trading Volume: Implications of an Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model 
Abstract:
 We derive an intertemporal asset pricing model and explore its
 implications for trading volume and asset returns. We show that investors
 trade in only two portfolios: the market portfolio, and a hedging
 portfolio that is used to hedge the risk of changing market conditions. We
 empirically identify the hedging portfolio using weekly volume and returns
 data for U.S. stocks, and then test two of its properties implied by the
 theory: Its return should be an additional risk factor in explaining the
 cross section of asset returns, and should also be the best predictor of
 future market returns. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Model Uncertainty and Option Markets with Heterogeneous Beliefs 
Abstract:
 This paper provides option pricing and volume implications for an economy
 with heterogeneous agents who face model uncertainty and have different
 beliefs on expected returns. Market incompleteness makes options
 nonredundant, while heterogeneity creates a link between differences in
 beliefs and option volumes. We solve for both option prices and volumes
 and test the joint empirical implications using S&P500 index option data.
 Specifically, we use survey data to build an Index of Dispersion in
 Beliefs and find that a model that takes information heterogeneity into
 account can explain the dynamics of option volume and the smile better
 than can reduced-form models with stochastic volatility. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Information, Trading, and Volatility: Evidence from Weather-Sensitive Markets 
Abstract:
 We find that trading- versus nontrading-period variance ratios in
 weather-sensitive markets are lower than those in the equity market and
 higher than those in the currency market. The variance ratios are also
 substantially lower during periods of the year when prices are most
 sensitive to the weather. Moreover, the comovement of returns and
 volatilities for related commodities is stronger during the
 weather-sensitive season, largely due to stronger comovement during
 nontrading periods. These results are consistent with a strong link
 between prices and public information flow and cannot be explained by
 pricing errors or changes in trading activity. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Insider Trading, News Releases, and Ownership Concentration 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the market's reaction to U.K. insider transactions
 and analyzes whether the reaction depends on the firm's ownership. We
 present three major findings. First, differences in regulation between the
 U.K. and United States, in particular the speedier reporting of trades in
 the U.K., may explain the observed larger abnormal returns in the U.K.
 Second, ownership by directors and outside shareholders has an impact on
 the abnormal returns. Third, it is important to adjust for news released
 before directors' trades. In particular, trades preceded by news on
 mergers and acquisitions and CEO replacements contain significantly less
 information. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: When Financial Institutions Are Large Shareholders: The Role of Macro Corporate Governance Environments 
Abstract:
 While financial institutions' aggregate investments have grown
 substantially worldwide, the size of their individual shareholdings, and
 ultimately their incentive to monitor, may be limited by the free-rider
 problem, regulations, and a preference for diversification and liquidity.
 We compare institutions' shareholding patterns across countries and find
 vast differences in the extent to which they are large shareholders. These
 variations are largely determined by macro corporate governance factors
 such as shareholder protection, law enforcement, and corporate disclosure
 requirements. This suggests that strong governance environments act to
 strengthen monitoring ability such that more institutions are encouraged
 to hold concentrated equity positions. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Analyst Coverage and Financing Decisions 
Abstract:
 We provide evidence that analyst coverage affects security issuance.
 First, firms covered by fewer analysts are less likely to issue equity as
 opposed to debt. They issue equity less frequently, but when they do so,
 it is in larger amounts. Moreover, these firms depend more on favorable
 market conditions for their equity issuance decisions. Finally, debt
 ratios of less covered firms are more affected by <link rid="b8">Baker and
 Wurgler's (2002)</link>"external finance-weighted" average market-to-book
 ratio. These results are consistent with market timing behavior associated
 with information asymmetry, as well as behavior implied by dynamic adverse
 selection models of equity issuance. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Tax-Loss Selling and the January Effect: Evidence from Municipal Bond Closed-End Funds 
Abstract:
 This paper provides direct evidence supporting the tax-loss selling
 hypothesis as an explanation of the January effect. Examining
 turn-of-the-year return and volume patterns for municipal bond closed-end
 funds, which are held mostly by tax-sensitive individual investors, we
 document a January effect for these funds, but not for their underlying
 assets. We provide evidence that this effect can be largely explained by
 tax-loss selling activities at the previous year-end. Moreover, we find
 that funds associated with brokerage firms display more tax-loss selling
 behavior, suggesting that tax counseling plays a role. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Derivative Pricing 60 Years before Black-Scholes: Evidence from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange 
Abstract:
 We obtain daily data for warrants traded on the Johannesburg Stock
 Exchange between 1909 and 1922, and for a broker's call option quotes on
 stocks from 1908 to 1911. We use this new data set to test how close
 derivative prices are to <link rid="b3">Black-Scholes (1973)</link> prices
 and to compute profits for investors using a simple trading rule for call
 options. We examine whether investors exercised warrants optimally and how
 they reacted to extensions of the warrants' durations. We show that long
 before the development of the formal theory, investors had an intuitive
 grasp of the determinants of derivative pricing. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Can Mutual Fund "Stars" Really Pick Stocks? New Evidence from a Bootstrap Analysis 
Abstract:
 We apply a new bootstrap statistical technique to examine the performance
 of the U.S. open-end, domestic equity mutual fund industry over the 1975
 to 2002 period. A bootstrap approach is necessary because the cross
 section of mutual fund alphas has a complex nonnormal distribution due to
 heterogeneous risk-taking by funds as well as nonnormalities in individual
 fund alpha distributions. Our bootstrap approach uncovers findings that
 differ from many past studies. Specifically, we find that a sizable
 minority of managers pick stocks well enough to more than cover their
 costs. Moreover, the superior alphas of these managers "persist." Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association.
