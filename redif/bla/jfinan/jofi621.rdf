Title: Why Do Firms Issue Equity? 
Abstract:
 We develop and test a new theory of security issuance that is consistent
 with the puzzling stylized fact that firms issue equity when their stock
 prices are high. The theory also generates new predictions. Our theory
 predicts that managers use equity to finance projects when they believe
 that investors' views about project payoffs are likely to be aligned with
 theirs, thus maximizing the likelihood of agreement with investors.
 Otherwise, they use debt. We find strong empirical support for our theory
 and document its incremental explanatory power over other
 security-issuance theories such as market timing and time-varying adverse
 selection. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Why Is Long-Horizon Equity Less Risky? A Duration-Based Explanation of the Value Premium 
Abstract:
 We propose a dynamic risk-based model that captures the value premium.
 Firms are modeled as long-lived assets distinguished by the timing of cash
 flows. The stochastic discount factor is specified so that shocks to
 aggregate dividends are priced, but shocks to the discount rate are not.
 The model implies that growth firms covary more with the discount rate
 than do value firms, which covary more with cash flows. When calibrated to
 explain aggregate stock market behavior, the model accounts for the
 observed value premium, the high Sharpe ratios on value firms, and the
 poor performance of the CAPM. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Common Failings: How Corporate Defaults Are Correlated 
Abstract:
 We test the doubly stochastic assumption under which firms' default times
 are correlated only as implied by the correlation of factors determining
 their default intensities. Using data on U.S. corporations from 1979 to
 2004, this assumption is violated in the presence of contagion or
 "frailty" (unobservable explanatory variables that are correlated across
 firms). Our tests do not depend on the time-series properties of default
 intensities. The data do not support the joint hypothesis of
 well-specified default intensities and the doubly stochastic assumption.
 We find some evidence of default clustering exceeding that implied by the
 doubly stochastic model with the given intensities. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Corporate Yield Spreads and Bond Liquidity 
Abstract:
 We find that liquidity is priced in corporate yield spreads. Using a
 battery of liquidity measures covering over 4,000 corporate bonds and
 spanning both investment grade and speculative categories, we find that
 more illiquid bonds earn higher yield spreads, and an improvement in
 liquidity causes a significant reduction in yield spreads. These results
 hold after controlling for common bond-specific, firm-specific, and
 macroeconomic variables, and are robust to issuers' fixed effect and
 potential endogeneity bias. Our findings justify the concern in the
 default risk literature that neither the level nor the dynamic of yield
 spreads can be fully explained by default risk determinants. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Information Cascades: Evidence from a Field Experiment with Financial Market Professionals 
Abstract:
 Previous empirical studies of information cascades use either naturally
 occurring data or laboratory experiments. We combine attractive elements
 from each of these lines of research by observing market professionals
 from the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) in a controlled environment.
 Analysis of over 1,500 individual decisions suggests that CBOT
 professionals behave differently from our student control group. For
 instance, professionals are better able to discern the quality of public
 signals and their decisions are not affected by the domain of earnings.
 These results have implications for market efficiency and are important in
 both a positive and normative sense. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Learning by Observing: Information Spillovers in the Execution and Valuation of Commercial Bank M&As 
Abstract:
 We offer a new explanation for why academic studies typically fail to find
 value creation in bank mergers. Our conjectures are predicated on the idea
 that, until recently, large bank acquisitions were a new phenomenon, with
 no best practices history to inform bank managers or market investors. We
 hypothesize that merging banks, and investors pricing bank mergers, learn
 by observing information that spills over from previous bank mergers. We
 find evidence consistent with these conjectures for 216 M&As of large,
 publicly traded U.S. commercial banks between 1987 and 1999. Our findings
 are consistent with semistrong stock market efficiency. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: A Theory of Friendly Boards 
Abstract:
 We analyze the consequences of the board's dual role as advisor as well as
 monitor of management. Given this dual role, the CEO faces a trade-off in
 disclosing information to the board: If he reveals his information, he
 receives better advice; however, an informed board will also monitor him
 more intensively. Since an independent board is a tougher monitor, the CEO
 may be reluctant to share information with it. Thus, management-friendly
 boards can be optimal. Using the insights from the model, we analyze the
 differences between sole and dual board systems. We highlight several
 policy implications of our analysis. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Whom You Know Matters: Venture Capital Networks and Investment Performance 
Abstract:
 Many financial markets are characterized by strong relationships and
 networks, rather than arm's-length, spot market transactions. We examine
 the performance consequences of this organizational structure in the
 context of relationships established when VCs syndicate portfolio company
 investments. We find that better-networked VC firms experience
 significantly better fund performance, as measured by the proportion of
 investments that are successfully exited through an IPO or a sale to
 another company. Similarly, the portfolio companies of better-networked
 VCs are significantly more likely to survive to subsequent financing and
 eventual exit. We also provide initial evidence on the evolution of VC
 networks. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Lower Salaries and No Options? On the Optimal Structure of Executive Pay 
Abstract:
 We calibrate the standard principal-agent model with constant relative
 risk aversion and lognormal stock prices to a sample of 598 U.S. CEOs. We
 show that this model predicts that most CEOs should not hold any stock
 options. Instead, CEOs should have lower base salaries and receive
 additional shares in their companies; many would be required to purchase
 additional stock in their companies. These contracts would reduce average
 compensation costs by 20% while providing the same incentives and the same
 utility to CEOs. We conclude that the standard principal-agent model
 typically used in the literature cannot rationalize observed contracts. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Interest Rate Caps "Smile" Too&excl; But Can the LIBOR Market Models Capture the Smile? 
Abstract:
 Using 3 years of interest rate caps price data, we provide a comprehensive
 documentation of volatility smiles in the caps market. To capture the
 volatility smiles, we develop a multifactor term structure model with
 stochastic volatility and jumps that yields a closed-form formula for cap
 prices. We show that although a three-factor stochastic volatility model
 can price at-the-money caps well, significant negative jumps in interest
 rates are needed to capture the smile. The volatility smile contains
 information that is not available using only at-the-money caps, and this
 information is important for understanding term structure models. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Impact of Collateralization on Swap Rates 
Abstract:
 Interest rate swap pricing theory traditionally views swaps as a portfolio
 of forward contracts with net swap payments discounted at LIBOR rates. In
 practice, the use of marking-to-market and collateralization questions
 this view as they introduce intermediate cash flows and alter credit
 characteristics. We provide a swap valuation theory under
 marking-to-market and costly collateral and examine the theory's empirical
 implications. We find evidence consistent with costly collateral using two
 different approaches; the first uses single-factor models and Eurodollar
 futures prices, and the second uses a formal term structure model and
 Treasury/swap data. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Value of Embedded Real Options: Evidence from Consumer Automobile Lease Contracts 
Abstract:
 Under the common assumption of constant interest rates, we show that
 penalties for early termination of a lease are often structured in such a
 way that the cancellation option embedded in consumer automotive leases
 has little value. Furthermore, our estimates drawn from a sample of three
 popular car models over 1990 to 2000 indicate that the stand-alone value
 of the lease-end purchase option is, on average, about 16% of the market
 value of underlying used vehicles, or about $1,462 per contract. Finally,
 we examine the sensitivity of our option value estimates to model
 parameters and default risk. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Initial Public Offerings of Listed Firms 
Abstract:
 A number of firms in the United Kingdom list without issuing equity and
 then issue equity shortly thereafter. We argue that this two-stage
 offering strategy is less costly than an initial public offering (IPO)
 because trading reduces the valuation uncertainty of these firms before
 they issue equity. We find that initial returns are 10% to 30% lower for
 these firms than for comparable IPOs, and we provide evidence that the
 market in the firm's shares lowers financing costs. We also show that
 these firms time the market both when they list and when they issue
 equity. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.
