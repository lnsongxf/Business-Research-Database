Title: Fund Manager Use of Public Information: New Evidence on Managerial Skills 
Abstract:
 We show theoretically that the responsiveness of a fund manager's
 portfolio allocations to changes in public information decreases in the
 manager's skill. We go on to estimate this sensitivity ("RPI") as the
 "R"-super-2 of the regression of changes in a manager's portfolio holdings
 on changes in public information using a panel of U.S. equity funds.
 Consistent with "RPI" containing information related to managerial skills,
 we find a strong inverse relationship between "RPI" and various existing
 measures of performance, and between "RPI" and fund flows. We also
 document that both fund- and manager-specific attributes affect "RPI". Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Managerial Ability, Compensation, and the Closed-End Fund Discount 
Abstract:
 This paper shows that the existence of managerial ability, combined with
 the labor contract prevalent in the industry, implies that the closed-end
 fund discount should exhibit many of the primary features documented in
 the literature. We evaluate the model's ability to match the quantitative
 features of the data, and find that it does well, although there is some
 observed behavior that remains to be explained. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Limits of Arbitrage: Theory and Evidence from the Mortgage-Backed Securities Market 
Abstract:
 "Limits of Arbitrage" theories hypothesize that the marginal investor in a
 particular asset market is a specialized arbitrageur rather than a
 diversified representative investor. We examine the mortgage-backed
 securities (MBS) market in this light. We show that the risk of homeowner
 prepayment, which is a wash in the aggregate, is priced in the MBS market.
 The covariance of prepayment risk with aggregate wealth implies the wrong
 sign to match the observed prices of prepayment risk. The price of risk is
 better explained by a kernel based on MBS market-wide specific risk,
 consistent with the specialized arbitrageur hypothesis. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Banking Deregulation and Industry Structure: Evidence from the French Banking Reforms of 1985 
Abstract:
 We investigate how the deregulation of the French banking industry in the
 1980s affected the real behavior of firms and the structure and dynamics
 of product markets. Following deregulation, banks are less willing to bail
 out poorly performing firms and firms in the more bank-dependent sectors
 are more likely to undertake restructuring activities. At the industry
 level, we observe an increase in asset and job reallocation, an
 improvement in allocative efficiency across firms, and a decline in
 concentration. Overall, these findings support the view that a more
 efficient banking sector helps foster a Schumpeterian process of "creative
 destruction." Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Information Asymmetry and Financing Arrangements: Evidence from Syndicated Loans 
Abstract:
 I empirically explore the syndicated loan market, with an emphasis on how
 information asymmetry between lenders and borrowers influences syndicate
 structure and on which lenders become syndicate members. Consistent with
 moral hazard in monitoring, the lead bank retains a larger share of the
 loan and forms a more concentrated syndicate when the borrower requires
 more intense monitoring and due diligence. When information asymmetry
 between the borrower and lenders is potentially severe, participant
 lenders are closer to the borrower, both geographically and in terms of
 previous lending relationships. Lead bank and borrower reputation
 mitigates, but does not eliminate information asymmetry problems. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Winners or Losers? The Effects of Banking Consolidation on Corporate Borrowers 
Abstract:
 We estimate the impact of bank mergers and acquisitions (M&As) on
 outstanding credit, credit lines, and the sensitivity of investment to
 cash flow using a large sample of Italian corporate borrowers. We
 distinguish between firms that experienced relationship termination as a
 consequence of bank M&As and those that did not. Our findings are
 consistent with bank M&As having an adverse effect on credit, particularly
 when the M&A is followed by relationship termination. The effect persists
 3 years and then is absorbed, suggesting that firms are able to compensate
 for the negative shock. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Growth Opportunities and the Choice of Leverage, Debt Maturity, and Covenants 
Abstract:
 We investigate the effect of growth opportunities in a firm's investment
 opportunity set on its joint choice of leverage, debt maturity, and
 covenants. Using a database that contains detailed debt covenant
 information, we provide large-sample evidence of the incidence of
 covenants in public debt and construct firm-level indices of bondholder
 covenant protection. We find that covenant protection is increasing in
 growth opportunities, debt maturity, and leverage. We also document that
 the negative relation between leverage and growth opportunities is
 significantly attenuated by covenant protection, suggesting that covenants
 can mitigate the agency costs of debt for high growth firms. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Smart Institutions, Foolish Choices: The Limited Partner Performance Puzzle 
Abstract:
 The returns that institutional investors realize from private equity
 differ dramatically across institutions. Using detailed, hitherto
 unexplored records, we document large heterogeneity in the performance of
 investor classes: endowments' annual returns are nearly 21% greater than
 average. Analysis of reinvestment decisions suggests that endowments (and
 to a lesser extent, public pensions) are better than other investors at
 predicting whether follow-on funds will have high returns. The results are
 not primarily due to endowments' greater access to established funds,
 since they also hold for young or undersubscribed funds. Our results
 suggest that investors vary in their sophistication and potentially their
 investment objectives. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Financial Synergies and the Optimal Scope of the Firm: Implications for Mergers, Spinoffs, and Structured Finance 
Abstract:
 Multiple activities may be separated financially, allowing each to
 optimize its financial structure, or combined in a firm with a single
 optimal financial structure. We consider activities with nonsynergistic
 operational cash flows, and examine the purely financial benefits of
 separation versus merger. The magnitude of financial synergies depends
 upon tax rates, default costs, relative size, and the riskiness and
 correlation of cash flows. Contrary to accepted wisdom, financial
 synergies from mergers can be negative if firms have quite different risks
 or default costs. The results provide a rationale for structured finance
 techniques such as asset securitization and project finance. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: A Theory of Takeovers and Disinvestment 
Abstract:
 We present a real-options model of takeovers and disinvestment in
 declining industries. As product demand declines, a first-best closure
 level is reached, where overall value is maximized by closing the firm and
 releasing its capital to investors. Absent takeovers, managers of
 underleveraged firms always close too late, although golden parachutes may
 accelerate closure. We analyze the effects of takeovers of under-leveraged
 firms. Takeovers by raiders enforce first-best closure. Hostile takeovers
 by other firms occur either at the first-best closure point or too
 "early". Closure in management buyouts and mergers of equals happens
 inefficiently "late". Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: How Are Firms Sold? 
Abstract:
 As measured by the number of bidders that publicly attempt to acquire a
 target, the takeover arena in the 1990s appears noncompetitive. However,
 we provide novel data on the pre-public, private takeover process that
 indicates that public takeover activity is only the tip of the iceberg of
 actual takeover competition during the 1990s. We show a highly competitive
 market where half of the targets are auctioned among multiple bidders,
 while the remainder negotiate with a single bidder. In event study
 analysis, we find that the wealth effects for target shareholders are
 comparable in auctions and negotiations. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: On the Importance of Measuring Payout Yield: Implications for Empirical Asset Pricing 
Abstract:
 We investigate the empirical implications of using various measures of
 payout yield rather than dividend yield for asset pricing models. We find
 statistically and economically significant predictability in the time
 series when payout (dividends plus repurchases) and net payout (dividends
 plus repurchases minus issuances) yields are used instead of the dividend
 yield. Similarly, we find that payout (net payout) yields contains
 information about the cross section of expected stock returns exceeding
 that of dividend yields, and that the high minus low payout yield
 portfolio is a priced factor. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Decoupling CEO Wealth and Firm Performance: The Case of Acquiring CEOs 
Abstract:
 We explore how compensation policies following mergers affect a CEO's
 incentives to pursue a merger. We find that even in mergers where bidding
 shareholders are worse off, bidding CEOs are better off three quarters of
 the time. Following a merger, a CEO's pay and overall wealth become
 insensitive to negative stock performance, but a CEO's wealth rises in
 step with positive stock performance. Corporate governance matters;
 bidding firms with stronger boards retain the sensitivity of their CEOs'
 compensation to poor performance following the merger. In comparison, we
 find that CEOs are not rewarded for undertaking major capital
 expenditures. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Corporate Governance, Idiosyncratic Risk, and Information Flow 
Abstract:
 We study the relationship of corporate governance policy and idiosyncratic
 risk. Firms with fewer antitakeover provisions display higher levels of
 idiosyncratic risk, trading activity, private information flow, and
 information about future earnings in stock prices. Trading interest by
 institutions, especially those active in merger arbitrage, strengthens the
 relationship of governance to idiosyncratic risk. Our results indicate
 that openness to the market for corporate control leads to more
 informative stock prices by encouraging collection of and trading on
 private information. Consistent with an information-flow interpretation,
 the component of volatility unrelated to governance is associated with the
 efficiency of corporate investment. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.
