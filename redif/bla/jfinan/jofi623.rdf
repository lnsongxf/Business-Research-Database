Title: Why Do Firms Become Widely Held? An Analysis of the Dynamics of Corporate Ownership 
Abstract:
 We examine the evolution of insider ownership of IPO firms from 1970 to
 2001 to understand how U.S. firms become widely held. A majority of these
 firms has insider ownership below 20% after 10 years. Stock market
 performance and liquidity play an extremely important role in ownership
 dynamics. Firms with stocks that are highly valued, are liquid, and have
 performed well experience large decreases in insider ownership and become
 widely held. Ownership also falls for low cash flow and high capital
 expenditures firms. Surprisingly, variables proxying for agency costs have
 limited success in explaining the evolution of insider ownership. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Efficiency and the Bear: Short Sales and Markets Around the World 
Abstract:
 We analyze cross-sectional and time-series information from 46 equity
 markets around the world to consider whether short sales restrictions
 affect the efficiency of the market and the distributional characteristics
 of returns to individual stocks and market indices. We find some evidence
 that prices incorporate negative information faster in countries where
 short sales are allowed and practiced. A common conjecture by regulators
 is that short sales restrictions can reduce the relative severity of a
 market panic. We find strong evidence that in markets where short selling
 is either prohibited or not practiced, market returns display
 significantly less negative skewness. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Global Growth Opportunities and Market Integration 
Abstract:
 We propose an exogenous measure of a country's growth opportunities by
 interacting the country's local industry mix with global price to earnings
 ("PE") ratios. We find that these exogenous growth opportunities predict
 future changes in real GDP and investment in a large panel of countries.
 This relation is strongest in countries that have liberalized their
 capital accounts, equity markets, and banking systems. We also find that
 financial development, external finance dependence, and investor
 protection measures are much less important in aligning growth
 opportunities with growth than is capital market openness. Finally, we
 formulate new tests of market integration and segmentation by linking
 local and global "PE" ratios to relative economic growth. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Giving Content to Investor Sentiment: The Role of Media in the Stock Market 
Abstract:
 I quantitatively measure the interactions between the media and the stock
 market using daily content from a popular "Wall Street Journal" column. I
 find that high media pessimism predicts downward pressure on market prices
 followed by a reversion to fundamentals, and unusually high or low
 pessimism predicts high market trading volume. These and similar results
 are consistent with theoretical models of noise and liquidity traders, and
 are inconsistent with theories of media content as a proxy for new
 information about fundamental asset values, as a proxy for market
 volatility, or as a sideshow with no relationship to asset markets. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Underwriter Persistence Phenomenon 
Abstract:
 This study presents new evidence that initial IPO returns have persistent
 underwriter-specific components. These components cannot be explained by
 existing measures of underwriter quality, underwriter service, or controls
 for several known predictors of initial IPO returns. Tests that trace the
 roots of persistence most broadly support theories of asymmetric
 information among underwriters. I present such a model, and consistent
 with its predictions, I find that high underpricing underwriters (1) are
 responsible for a majority of the partial adjustment phenomenon, (2) make
 more informed analyst revisions, (3) experience superior market share
 growth, and (4) are more likely to serve an institutional clientele. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Simple Forecasts and Paradigm Shifts 
Abstract:
 We study the asset pricing implications of learning in an environment in
 which the true model of the world is a multivariate one, but agents update
 only over the class of simple univariate models. Thus, if a particular
 simple model does a poor job of forecasting over a period of time, it is
 discarded in favor of an alternative simple model. The theory yields a
 number of distinctive predictions for stock returns, generating
 forecastable variation in the magnitude of the value-glamour return
 differential, in volatility, and in the skewness of returns. We validate
 several of these predictions empirically. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Reputation Effects in Trading on the New York Stock Exchange 
Abstract:
 Theory suggests that reputations allow nonanonymous markets to attenuate
 adverse selection in trading. We identify instances in which New York
 Stock Exchange (NYSE) stocks experience trading floor relocations.
 Although specialists follow the stocks to their new locations, most
 brokers do not. We find a discernable increase in liquidity costs around a
 stock's relocation that is larger for stocks with higher adverse selection
 and greater broker turnover. We also find that floor brokers relocating
 with the stock obtain lower trading costs than brokers not moving and
 brokers beginning trading post-move. Our results suggest that reputation
 plays an important role in the NYSE's liquidity provision process. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Participation Costs and the Sensitivity of Fund Flows to Past Performance 
Abstract:
 We present a simple rational model to highlight the effect of investors'
 participation costs on the response of mutual fund flows to past fund
 performance. By incorporating participation costs into a model in which
 investors learn about managers' ability from past returns, we show that
 mutual funds with lower participation costs have a higher flow sensitivity
 to medium performance and a lower flow sensitivity to high performance
 than their higher-cost peers. Using various fund characteristics as
 proxies for the reduction in participation costs, we provide empirical
 evidence supporting the model's implications for the asymmetric
 flow-performance relationship. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Financial Speculators' Underperformance: Learning, Self-Selection, and Endogenous Liquidity 
Abstract:
 We develop an equilibrium model of learning by rational traders to
 reconcile several empirical regularities: Cross sectionally, most
 individual speculators lose money; large speculators outperform small
 speculators; past performance positively affects subsequent trade
 intensity; most new traders lose money and cease speculation; and
 performance shows persistence. Learning from trading generates substantial
 endogenous liquidity, reducing bid-ask spreads and the impact of exogenous
 liquidity shocks on asset prices, but amplifying the effects of real
 shocks. Introducing slightly overconfident traders increases bid-ask
 spreads, hurting all traders. Finally, behavioral theories cannot
 reconcile all of these empirical regularities. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Value of Corporate Risk Management 
Abstract:
 We model and estimate the value of corporate risk management. We show how
 risk management can add value when revenues and costs are nonlinearly
 related to prices and estimate the model by regressing quarterly firm
 sales and costs on the second and higher moments of output and input
 prices. For a sample of 34 oil refiners, we find that hedging concave
 revenues and leaving concave costs exposed each represent between 2% and
 3% of firm value. We validate our approach by regressing Tobin's "q" on
 the estimated value and level of risk management and find results
 consistent with the model. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Corporate Bond Market Transaction Costs and Transparency 
Abstract:
 Using a complete record of U.S. over-the-counter (OTC) secondary trades in
 corporate bonds, we estimate average transaction costs as a function of
 trade size for each bond that traded more than nine times between January
 2003 and January 2005. We find that transaction costs decrease
 significantly with trade size. Highly rated bonds, recently issued bonds,
 and bonds close to maturity have lower transaction costs than do other
 bonds. Costs are lower for bonds with transparent trade prices, and they
 drop when the TRACE system starts to publicly disseminate their prices.
 The results suggest that public traders benefit significantly from price
 transparency. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Model Specification and Risk Premia: Evidence from Futures Options 
Abstract:
 This paper examines model specification issues and estimates diffusive and
 jump risk premia using S&P futures option prices from 1987 to 2003. We
 first develop a time series test to detect the presence of jumps in
 volatility, and find strong evidence in support of their presence. Next,
 using the cross section of option prices, we find strong evidence for
 jumps in prices and modest evidence for jumps in volatility based on model
 fit. The evidence points toward economically and statistically significant
 jump risk premia, which are important for understanding option returns. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Stochastic Volatilities and Correlations of Bond Yields 
Abstract:
 I develop an interest rate model with separate factors driving innovations
 in bond yields and their covariances. It features a flexible and tractable
 affine structure for bond covariances. Maximum likelihood estimation of
 the model with panel data on swaptions and discount bonds implies pricing
 errors for swaptions that are almost always lower than half of the bid-ask
 spread. Furthermore, market prices of interest rate caps do not deviate
 significantly from their no-arbitrage values implied by the swaptions
 under the model. These findings support the conjectures of <link
