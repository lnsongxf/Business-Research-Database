Title: Presidential Address: Issuers, Underwriter Syndicates, and Aftermarket Transparency 
Abstract:
 I model strategic interaction among issuers, underwriters, retail
 investors, and institutional investors when the secondary market has
 limited price transparency. Search costs for retail investors lead to
 price dispersion in the secondary market, while the price for
 institutional investors is infinitely elastic. Because retail distribution
 capacity is assumed to be limited for each underwriter-dealer, Bertrand
 competition breaks down in the primary market and new issues are
 underpriced in equilibrium. Syndicates emerge in which underwriters bid
 symmetrically, with quantities allocated internally to efficiently utilize
 retail distribution capacity. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Pay Me Later: Inside Debt and Its Role in Managerial Compensation 
Abstract:
 Though widely used in executive compensation, inside debt has been almost
 entirely overlooked by prior work. We initiate this research by studying
 CEO pension arrangements in 237 large capitalization firms. Among our
 findings are that CEO compensation exhibits a balance between debt and
 equity incentives; the balance shifts systematically away from equity and
 toward debt as CEOs grow older; annual increases in pension entitlements
 represent about 10% of overall CEO compensation, and about 13% for CEOs
 aged 61-65; CEOs with high debt incentives manage their firms
 conservatively; and pension compensation influences patterns of CEO
 turnover and cash compensation. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Working Orders in Limit Order Markets and Floor Exchanges 
Abstract:
 We analyze limit order markets and floor exchanges, assuming an informed
 trader and discretionary liquidity traders use market orders and can
 either submit block orders or work their demands as a series of small
 orders. By working their demands, large market order traders pool with
 small traders. We show that every equilibrium on a floor exchange must
 involve at least partial pooling. Moreover, there is always a fully
 pooling (worked order) equilibrium on a floor exchange that is equivalent
 to a block order equilibrium in a limit order market. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Lazy Investors, Discretionary Consumption, and the Cross-Section of Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 When consumption betas of stocks are computed using year-over-year
 consumption growth based upon the fourth quarter, the consumption-based
 asset pricing model (CCAPM) explains the cross-section of stock returns as
 well as the <link rid="b25">Fama and French (1993)</link> three-factor
 model. The CCAPM's performance deteriorates substantially when consumption
 growth is measured based upon other quarters. For the CCAPM to hold at any
 given point in time, investors must make their consumption and investment
 decisions simultaneously at that point in time. We suspect that this is
 more likely to happen during the fourth quarter, given investors' tax year
 ends in December. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Equilibrium Exhaustible Resource Price Dynamics 
Abstract:
 We develop equilibrium models of exhaustible resource markets with
 endogenous extraction choices and prices. Our analysis demonstrates how
 adjustment costs can generate oil and gas forward price dynamics with two
 factors, consistent with the behavior these commodities exhibit in the
 <link rid="b30">Schwartz and Smith (2000)</link> calibration. Our
 two-factor model predicts that stochastic volatility will arise in these
 markets as a natural consequence of production adjustments, however, and
 we provide supporting empirical evidence. Differences between endogenous
 price processes from our general equilibrium model and exogenous processes
 in earlier papers can generate significant differences in both financial
 and real option values. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: How Costly Is External Financing? Evidence from a Structural Estimation 
Abstract:
 We apply simulated method of moments to a dynamic model to infer the
 magnitude of financing costs. The model features endogenous investment,
 distributions, leverage, and default. The corporation faces taxation,
 costly bankruptcy, and linear-quadratic equity flotation costs. For large
 (small) firms, estimated marginal equity flotation costs start at 5.0%
 (10.7%) and bankruptcy costs equal to 8.4% (15.1%) of capital. Estimated
 financing frictions are higher for low-dividend firms and those identified
 as constrained by the Cleary and Whited-Wu indexes. In simulated data,
 many common proxies for financing constraints actually decrease when we
 increase financing cost parameters. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Do Tests of Capital Structure Theory Mean What They Say? 
Abstract:
 In the presence of frictions, firms adjust their capital structure
 infrequently. As a consequence, in a dynamic economy the leverage of most
 firms is likely to differ from the "optimum" leverage at the time of
 readjustment. This paper explores the empirical implications of this
 observation. I use a calibrated dynamic trade-off model to simulate firms'
 capital structure paths. The results of standard cross-sectional tests on
 these data are consistent with those reported in the empirical literature.
 In particular, the standard interpretation of some test results leads to
 the rejection of the underlying model. Taken together, the results suggest
 a rethinking of the way capital structure tests are conducted. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Corporate Governance and Firm Value: The Impact of the 2002 Governance Rules 
Abstract:
 The 2001 to 2002 corporate scandals led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and to
 various amendments to the U.S. stock exchanges' regulations. We find that
 the announcement of these rules has a significant effect on firm value.
 Firms that are less compliant with the provisions of the rules earn
 positive abnormal returns compared to firms that are more compliant. We
 also find variation in the response across firm size. Large firms that are
 less compliant earn positive abnormal returns but small firms that are
 less compliant earn negative abnormal returns, suggesting that some
 provisions are detrimental to small firms. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Takeover Deterrent Effect of Open Market Share Repurchases 
Abstract:
 This paper examines whether open market share repurchases deter takeovers.
 We model pre-repurchase takeover probability as a latent variable and
 examine its impact on the firm's decision to repurchase shares. Given
 specification tests reject the Tobit model, we turn to the censored
 quantile regression method of <link rid="b35">Powell</link> (1986,
 "Journal of Econometrics" 32, 143-155). We find a significantly positive
 relation between open market share repurchases and takeover probability,
 and we reconcile empirical findings in previous studies that contradict
 predictions. Repurchase activity is inversely related to firm size,
 consistent with smaller firms having greater information asymmetry, and is
 related to temporary, but not permanent, cash flows. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Corporate Governance and Acquirer Returns 
Abstract:
 We examine whether corporate governance mechanisms, especially the market
 for corporate control, affect the profitability of firm acquisitions. We
 find that acquirers with more antitakeover provisions experience
 significantly lower announcement-period abnormal stock returns. This
 supports the hypothesis that managers at firms protected by more
 antitakeover provisions are less subject to the disciplinary power of the
 market for corporate control and thus are more likely to indulge in
 empire-building acquisitions that destroy shareholder value. We also find
 that acquirers operating in more competitive industries or separating the
 positions of CEO and chairman of the board experience higher abnormal
 announcement returns. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Incentive Effects of Stock and Option Holdings of Target and Acquirer CEOs 
Abstract:
 Acquisitions enable target chief executive officers (CEOs) to remove
 liquidity restrictions on stock and option holdings and diminish the
 illiquidity discount. Acquisitions also enable acquirer CEOs to improve
 the long-term value of overvalued holdings. Examining all firms during
 1993 to 2001, we show that CEOs with higher holdings (illiquidity
 discount) are more likely to make acquisitions (get acquired). Further, in
 250 completed acquisitions, target CEOs with a higher illiquidity discount
 accept a lower premium, offer less resistance, and more often leave after
 acquisition. Similarly, acquirer CEOs with higher holdings pay a higher
 premium, expedite the process, and make diversifying acquisitions using
 stock payment. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Executive Financial Incentives and Payout Policy: Firm Responses to the 2003 Dividend Tax Cut 
Abstract:
 We test whether executive stock ownership affects firm payouts using the
 2003 dividend tax cut to identify an exogenous change in the after-tax
 value of dividends. We find that executives with higher ownership were
 more likely to increase dividends after the tax cut in 2003, whereas no
 relation is found in periods when the dividend tax rate was higher.
 Relative to previous years, firms that initiated dividends in 2003 were
 more likely to reduce repurchases. The stock price reaction to the tax cut
 suggests that the substitution of dividends for repurchases may have been
 anticipated, consistent with agency conflicts. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Sports Sentiment and Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the stock market reaction to sudden changes in
 investor mood. Motivated by psychological evidence of a strong link
 between soccer outcomes and mood, we use international soccer results as
 our primary mood variable. We find a significant market decline after
 soccer losses. For example, a loss in the World Cup elimination stage
 leads to a next-day abnormal stock return of  - 49 basis points. This loss
 effect is stronger in small stocks and in more important games, and is
 robust to methodological changes. We also document a loss effect after
 international cricket, rugby, and basketball games. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Rational Inattention and Portfolio Selection 
Abstract:
 Costly information acquisition makes it rational for investors to obtain
 important economic news with only limited frequency or limited accuracy.
 We show that this rational inattention to important news may make
 investors over- or underinvest. In addition, the optimal trading strategy
 is "myopic" with respect to future news frequency and accuracy. We find
 that the optimal news frequency is nonmonotonic in news accuracy and
 investment horizon. Furthermore, when both news frequency and news
 accuracy are endogenized, an investor with a higher risk aversion or a
 longer investment horizon chooses less frequent but more accurate periodic
 news updates. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.
