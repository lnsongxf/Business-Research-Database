Title: Supply and Demand Shifts in the Shorting Market 
Abstract:
 Using proprietary data on stock loan fees and quantities from a large
 institutional investor, we examine the link between the shorting market
 and stock prices. Employing a unique identification strategy, we isolate
 shifts in the supply and demand for shorting. We find that shorting demand
 is an important predictor of future stock returns: An increase in shorting
 demand leads to negative abnormal returns of 2.98% in the following month.
 Second, we show that our results are stronger in environments with less
 public information flow, suggesting that the shorting market is an
 important mechanism for private information revelation. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Short-Sales Constraints and Price Discovery: Evidence from the Hong Kong Market 
Abstract:
 Short-sales practices in the Hong Kong stock market are unique in that
 only stocks on a list of designated securities can be sold short. By
 analyzing the price effects following the addition of individual stocks to
 the list, we find that short-sales constraints tend to cause stock
 overvaluation and that the overvaluation effect is more dramatic for
 individual stocks for which wider dispersion of investor opinions exists.
 These findings are consistent with <link rid="b25">Miller's (1977)</link>
 intuition and other optimism models. We also document higher volatility
 and less positive skewness of individual stock returns when short sales
 are allowed. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Portfolio Choice over the Life-Cycle when the Stock and Labor Markets Are Cointegrated 
Abstract:
 We study portfolio choice when labor income and dividends are
 cointegrated. Economically plausible calibrations suggest young investors
 should take substantial short positions in the stock market. Because of
 cointegration the young agent's human capital effectively becomes
 "stock-like." However, for older agents with shorter times-to-retirement,
 cointegration does not have sufficient time to act, and thus their human
 capital becomes more "bond-like." Together, these effects create
 hump-shaped life-cycle portfolio holdings, consistent with empirical
 observation. These results hold even when asset return predictability is
 accounted for. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Multimarket Trading and Liquidity: Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
 We develop a new model of multimarket trading to explain the differences
 in the foreign share of trading volume of internationally cross-listed
 stocks. The model predicts that the trading volume of a cross-listed stock
 is proportionally higher on the exchange in which the cross-listed asset
 returns have greater correlation with returns of other assets traded on
 that market. We find robust empirical support for this prediction using
 stock return and volume data on 251 non-U.S. stocks cross-listed on major
 U.S. exchanges. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Liquidity and the Law of One Price: The Case of the Futures-Cash Basis 
Abstract:
 Deviations from no-arbitrage relations should be related to market
 liquidity, because liquidity facilitates arbitrage. At the same time, a
 wide futures-cash basis may trigger arbitrage trades and, in turn, affect
 liquidity. We test these ideas by studying the dynamic relation between
 stock market liquidity and the index futures basis. There is evidence of
 two-way Granger causality between the short-term absolute basis and
 liquidity, and liquidity Granger-causes longer-term absolute bases. Shocks
 to the absolute basis predict future stock market liquidity. The evidence
 suggests that liquidity enhances the efficiency of the futures-cash
 pricing system. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Episodic Liquidity Crises: Cooperative and Predatory Trading 
Abstract:
 We describe how episodic illiquidity arises from a breakdown in
 cooperation between market participants. We first solve a one-period
 trading game in continuous-time, using an asset pricing equation that
 accounts for the price impact of trading. Then, in a multi-period
 framework, we describe an equilibrium in which traders cooperate most of
 the time through repeated interaction, providing apparent liquidity to one
 another. Cooperation breaks down when the stakes are high, leading to
 predatory trading and episodic illiquidity. Equilibrium strategies that
 involve cooperation across markets lead to less frequent episodic
 illiquidity, but cause contagion when cooperation breaks down. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Liquidity Coinsurance, Moral Hazard, and Financial Contagion 
Abstract:
 We study the propagation of financial crises among regions in which banks
 are protected by limited liability and may take excessive risk. The
 regions are affected by negatively correlated liquidity shocks, so
 liquidity coinsurance is Pareto improving. The moral hazard problem can be
 solved if banks are sufficiently capitalized. Under autarky a limited
 amount of capital is sufficient to prevent risk-taking, but when financial
 markets are open capital becomes insufficient. Thus, bankruptcy occurs
 with positive probability and the crisis spreads to other regions via
 financial linkages. Opening financial markets is nevertheless Pareto
 improving; consumers benefit from liquidity coinsurance, although they pay
 the cost of excessive risk-taking. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Liquidity or Credit Risk? The Determinants of Very Short-Term Corporate Yield Spreads 
Abstract:
 Employing a comprehensive database on transactions of commercial paper
 issued by domestic U.S. nonfinancial corporations, we study the
 determinants of very short-term corporate yield spreads. We find that
 liquidity plays a role in the determination of spreads but, somewhat
 surprisingly, credit quality is the more important determinant of spreads,
 even at horizons of less than 1 month. These results are robust across a
 variety of proxies for liquidity and credit risk, and have important
 implications for the literature on the modeling of corporate bond prices. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Liquidity Premia and Transaction Costs 
Abstract:
 Standard literature concludes that transaction costs only have a
 "second-order" effect on liquidity premia. We show that this conclusion
 depends crucially on the assumption of a constant investment opportunity
 set. In a regime-switching model in which the investment opportunity set
 varies over time, we explicitly characterize the optimal consumption and
 investment strategy. In contrast to the standard literature, we find that
 transaction costs can have a "first-order" effect on liquidity premia.
 However, with reasonably calibrated parameters, the presence of
 transaction costs still cannot fully explain the equity premium puzzle. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Analyst Disagreement, Mispricing, and Liquidity 
Abstract:
 This paper documents a close link between mispricing and liquidity by
 investigating stocks with high analyst disagreement. Previous research
 finds that these stocks tend to be overpriced, but that prices correct
 downwards as uncertainty about earnings is resolved. Our analysis suggests
 that one reason mispricing has persisted through the years is that analyst
 disagreement coincides with high trading costs. We also show that in the
 cross-section, the less liquid stocks tend to be more severely overpriced.
 Additionally, increases in aggregate market liquidity accelerate the
 convergence of prices to fundamentals. As a result, returns of the
 initially overpriced stocks are negatively correlated with the time series
 of innovations in aggregate market liquidity. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Taking a View: Corporate Speculation, Governance, and Compensation 
Abstract:
 Using responses to a well-known confidential survey, we study
 corporations' use of derivatives to "take a view" on interest rate and
 currency movements. Characteristics of speculators suggest that perceived
 information and cost advantages lead them to take positions actively; that
 is, they do not speculate to increase risk by "betting the ranch."
 Speculating firms encourage managers to speculate through
 incentive-aligning compensation arrangements and bonding contracts, and
 they use derivatives-specific internal controls to manage potential abuse.
 Finally, we examine whether investors reading public corporate disclosures
 are able to identify firms that indicate speculating in the confidential
 survey; they are not. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Financial Constraints, Competition, and Hedging in Industry Equilibrium 
Abstract:
 We analyze the hedging decisions of firms, within an equilibrium setting
 that allows us to examine how a firm's hedging choice depends on the
 hedging choices of its competitors. Within this equilibrium some firms
 hedge while others do not, even though all firms are ex ante identical.
 The fraction of firms that hedge depends on industry characteristics, such
 as the number of firms in the industry, the elasticity of demand, and the
 convexity of production costs. Consistent with prior empirical findings,
 the model predicts that there is more heterogeneity in the decision to
 hedge in the most competitive industries. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Exchange Rates and Cash Flows in Differentiated Product Industries: A Simulation Approach 
Abstract:
 How do exchange rate changes impact firms' cash flows? We extend a
 simulation method developed in industrial organization to answer this
 question. We use prices, quantities, and product characteristics for
 differentiated products, coupled with a discrete choice framework and an
 assumption of price competition, to estimate marginal costs for all
 producers. Using a Monte Carlo approach we generate counterfactual prices
 and profits for different levels of exchange rates. We illustrate the
 method using the market for bottled water. Our results stress that even in
 a relatively simple market such as this one, different brands face very
 different exchange rate risks. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Momentum and Credit Rating 
Abstract:
 This paper establishes a robust link between momentum and credit rating.
 Momentum profitability is large and significant among low-grade firms, but
 it is nonexistent among high-grade firms. The momentum payoffs documented
 in the literature are generated by low-grade firms that account for less
 than 4% of the overall market capitalization of rated firms. The momentum
 payoff differential across credit rating groups is unexplained by firm
 size, firm age, analyst forecast dispersion, leverage, return volatility,
 and cash flow volatility. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Price Convexity and Skewness 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a model in which investors who are prohibited from
 short selling agree to disagree on the precision of a publicly observed
 signal. The model implies that the equilibrium price is a convex function
 of the public signal. The model predicts that (1) the stock price reacts
 more to good news than to bad news; (2) the skewness of stock returns is
 positively correlated with contemporaneous returns, but negatively
 correlated with lagged returns; (3) short sale constraints increase rather
 than decrease skewness; and (4) disagreement about information precision
 increases skewness. Empirical tests conducted find supportive evidence for
 all these predictions. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.
