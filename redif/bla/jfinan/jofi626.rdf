Title: The Risk-Adjusted Cost of Financial Distress 
Abstract:
 Financial distress is more likely to happen in bad times. The present
 value of distress costs therefore depends on risk premia. We estimate this
 value using risk-adjusted default probabilities derived from corporate
 bond spreads. For a BBB-rated firm, our benchmark calculations show that
 the NPV of distress is 4.5% of predistress value. In contrast, a valuation
 that ignores risk premia generates an NPV of 1.4%. We show that marginal
 distress costs can be as large as the marginal tax benefits of debt
 derived by <link rid="b23">Graham (2000)</link>. Thus, distress risk
 premia can help explain why firms appear to use debt conservatively. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Security Design with Investor Private Information 
Abstract:
 I study the security design problem of a firm when "investors" rather than
 managers have private information about the firm. I find that it is often
 optimal to issue information-sensitive securities such as equity. The
 "folklore proposition of debt" from traditional signaling models only goes
 through if the firm can vary the face value of debt with investor demand.
 When the firm has several assets, debt backed by a pool of assets is
 optimal when the degree of competition among investors is low, while
 equity backed by individual assets is optimal when competition is high. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Strategic Actions and Credit Spreads: An Empirical Investigation 
Abstract:
 Do strategic actions of borrowers and lenders affect corporate debt
 values? We find higher bond spreads for firms that can renegotiate debt
 contracts relatively easily. Consistent with theories of strategic debt
 service, the threat of strategic default depresses bond values ex ante,
 even though there may be efficiency gains from renegotiation ex post.
 However, the economic significance of the net effect is small, suggesting
 that bondholders have considerable bargaining power. The effect of
 strategic actions is higher when creditors are particularly vulnerable to
 strategic threats, including risky firms with high managerial
 shareholding, simple debt structures, and high liquidation costs. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The U.S. Treasury Buyback Auctions: The Cost of Retiring Illiquid Bonds 
Abstract:
 We study an important recent series of buyback auctions conducted by the
 U.S. Treasury in retiring $67.5 billion of its illiquid off-the-run debt.
 The Treasury was successful in buying back large amounts of illiquid debt
 while suffering only a small market-impact cost. The Treasury included the
 most-illiquid bonds more frequently in the auctions, but tended to buy
 back the least-illiquid of these bonds. Although the Treasury had the
 option to cherry pick from among the bonds offered, we find that the
 Treasury was actually penalized for being spread too thinly in the
 buybacks. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Bidding into the Red: A Model of Post-Auction Bankruptcy 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates auctions where bidders have limited liability.
 First, we analyze bidding behavior under different auction formats,
 showing that the second-price auction induces higher prices, higher
 bankruptcy rates, and lower utilities than the first-price auction.
 Second, we show that the cost of bankruptcy critically affects the
 seller's preference over the choice of auction. If bankruptcy is very
 costly, the seller prefers the first-price auction over the second-price
 auction. Alternatively, if the bankrupt assets are resold among the losers
 of the initial auction, the seller prefers the second-price auction. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: How Smart Is Smart Money? A Two-Sided Matching Model of Venture Capital 
Abstract:
 I find that companies funded by more experienced VCs are more likely to go
 public. This follows both from the direct influence of more experienced
 VCs and from sorting in the market, which leads experienced VCs to invest
 in better companies. Sorting creates an endogeneity problem, but a
 structural model based on a two-sided matching model is able to exploit
 the characteristics of the other agents in the market to separately
 identify and estimate influence and sorting. Both effects are found to be
 significant, with sorting almost twice as important as influence for the
 difference in IPO rates. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: U.S. Banking Deregulation, Small Businesses, and Interstate Insurance of Personal Income 
Abstract:
 We estimate the effects of deregulation of U.S. banking restrictions on
 interstate personal income insurance for the period 1970 to 2001.
 Interstate income insurance occurs when personal income reacts less than
 one-to-one to state-specific output shocks. We find that insurance
 improved after banking deregulation, with a larger effect in states where
 small businesses are more important and on proprietors' income than on
 other components of personal income. Our explanation centers on the role
 of banks as a prime source of small business finance and on the close
 intertwining of the personal and business finances of small business
 owners. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: How Laws and Institutions Shape Financial Contracts: The Case of Bank Loans 
Abstract:
 Legal and institutional differences shape the ownership and terms of bank
 loans across the world. We show that under strong creditor protection,
 loans have more concentrated ownership, longer maturities, and lower
 interest rates. Moreover, the impact of creditor rights on loans depends
 on borrower characteristics such as the size and tangibility of assets.
 Foreign banks appear especially sensitive to the legal and institutional
 environment, with their ownership declining relative to domestic banks as
 creditor protection falls. Our multidimensional empirical model paints a
 more complete picture of how financial contracts respond to the legal and
 institutional environment than existing studies. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Adaptive Traders and the Design of Financial Markets 
Abstract:
 This paper studies a financial market populated by adaptive traders.
 Learning is modeled following <link rid="b13">Camerer and Ho
 (1999)</link>. A call market and a Walrasian tatonnement are compared in
 an environment in which both institutions have the same Nash and
 competitive equilibrium outcomes. When traders learn via a belief-based
 model, equilibrium is discovered in both types of markets. In contrast,
 when traders learn via a reinforcement-based model, convergence to
 equilibrium is achieved in the Walrasian tatonnement but not in the call
 market. This paper suggests that market mechanisms can be designed to
 foster traders' learning of equilibrium strategies. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Long-Term Return Reversals: Overreaction or Taxes? 
Abstract:
 Long-term reversals in U.S. stock returns are better explained as the
 rational reactions of investors to locked-in capital gains than an
 irrational overreaction to news. Predictors of returns based on the
 overreaction hypothesis have no power, while those that measure locked-in
 capital gains do, completely subsuming past returns measures that are
 traditionally used to predict long-term returns. In data from Hong Kong,
 where investment income is not taxed, reversals are nonexistent, and
 returns are not forecastable either by traditional measures or by measures
 based on the capital gains lock-in hypothesis that successfully predict
 U.S. returns. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Vote Trading and Information Aggregation 
Abstract:
 The standard analysis of corporate governance assumes that shareholders
 vote in ratios that firms choose, such as one share-one vote. However, if
 the cost of unbundling and trading votes is sufficiently low, then
 shareholders choose the ratios. We document an active market for votes
 within the U.S. equity loan market, where the average vote sells for zero.
 We hypothesize that asymmetric information motivates the vote trade and
 find support in the cross section. More trading occurs for higher-spread
 and worse-performing firms, especially when voting is close. Vote trading
 corresponds to support for shareholder proposals and opposition to
 management proposals. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Measuring Distress Risk: The Effect of R&D Intensity 
Abstract:
 Because of upward trends in research and development activity, accounting
 measures of financial distress have become less accurate. We document that
 (1) higher research and development spending increases the likelihood of
 misclassifying solvent firms, (2) adjusting for conservative accounting of
 research and development increases the number of correctly identified
 distressed firms, and (3) adjusted measures of distress alleviate
 previously documented anomalously low returns of large, high distress
 risk, low book-to-market firms. The results hold after updating stale
 parameters and under various tax assumptions. Our evidence raises concerns
 about interpretation of extant literature that relies on accounting
 measures of distress. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Is the Corporate Loan Market Globally Integrated? A Pricing Puzzle 
Abstract:
 We offer evidence that interest rate spreads on syndicated loans to
 corporate borrowers are economically significantly smaller in Europe than
 in the United States, other things equal. Differences in borrower, loan,
 and lender characteristics do not appear to explain this phenomenon.
 Borrowers overwhelmingly issue in their natural home market and bank
 portfolios display home bias. This may explain why pricing discrepancies
 are not competed away, though their causes remain a puzzle. Thus,
 important determinants of loan origination market outcomes remain to be
 identified, home bias appears to be material for pricing, and corporate
 financing costs differ across Europe and the United States. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Habit Formation and Macroeconomic Models of the Term Structure of Interest Rates 
Abstract:
 This paper introduces a new class of nonaffine models of the term
 structure of interest rates that is supported by an economy with habit
 formation. Distinguishing features of the model are that the interest rate
 dynamics are nonlinear, interest rates depend on lagged monetary and
 consumption shocks, and the price of risk is not a constant multiple of
 interest rate volatility. We find that habit persistence can help
 reproduce the nonlinearity of the spot rate process, the documented
 deviations from the expectations hypothesis, the persistence of the
 conditional volatility of interest rates, and the lead-lag relationship
 between interest rates and monetary aggregates. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association.
