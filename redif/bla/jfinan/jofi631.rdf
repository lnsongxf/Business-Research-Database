Title: Agency Conflicts, Investment, and Asset Pricing 
Abstract:
 The separation of ownership and control allows controlling shareholders to
 pursue private benefits. We develop an analytically tractable dynamic
 stochastic general equilibrium model to study asset pricing and welfare
 implications of imperfect investor protection. Consistent with empirical
 evidence, the model predicts that countries with weaker investor
 protection have more incentives to overinvest, lower Tobin's "q", higher
 return volatility, larger risk premia, and higher interest rate.
 Calibrating the model to the Korean economy reveals that perfecting
 investor protection increases the stock market's value by 22%, a gain for
 which outside shareholders are willing to pay 11% of their capital stock. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Heterogeneous Beliefs, Speculation, and the Equity Premium 
Abstract:
 Agents with heterogeneous beliefs about fundamental growth do not share
 risks perfectly but instead speculate with each other on the relative
 accuracy of their models' predictions. They face the risk that market
 prices move more in line with the trading models of competing agents than
 with their own. Less risk-averse agents speculate more aggressively and
 demand higher risk premiums. My calibrated model generates countercyclical
 consumption volatility, earnings forecast dispersion, and cross-sectional
 consumption dispersion. With a risk aversion coefficient less than one,
 agents' speculation causes half the observed equity premium and lowers the
 riskless rate by about 1%. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Which Money Is Smart? Mutual Fund Buys and Sells of Individual and Institutional Investors 
Abstract:
 <link rid="b16">Gruber (1996)</link> and <link rid="b35">Zheng
 (1999)</link> report that investors channel money toward mutual funds that
 subsequently perform well. <link rid="b31">Sapp and Tiwari (2004)</link>
 find that this "smart money" effect no longer holds after controlling for
 stock return momentum. While prior work uses quarterly U.S. data, we
 employ a British data set of monthly fund inflows and outflows
 differentiated between individual and institutional investors. We document
 a robust smart money effect in the United Kingdom. The effect is caused by
 buying (but not selling) decisions of both individuals and institutions.
 Using monthly data available post-1991 we show that money is comparably
 smart in the United States. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Competition for Order Flow and Smart Order Routing Systems 
Abstract:
 We study the rivalry between Euronext and the London Stock Exchange (LSE)
 in the Dutch stock market to test hypotheses about the effect of market
 fragmentation. As predicted by our theory, the consolidated limit order
 book is deeper after entry of the LSE. Moreover, cross-sectionally, we
 find that a higher trade-through rate in the entrant market coincides with
 less liquidity supply in this market. These findings imply that (i)
 fragmentation of order flow can enhance liquidity supply and (ii)
 protecting limit orders against trade-throughs is important. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Information Asymmetry and Asset Prices: Evidence from the China Foreign Share Discount 
Abstract:
 We examine the effect of information asymmetry on equity prices in the
 local A- and foreign B-share market in China. We construct measures of
 information asymmetry based on market microstructure models, and find that
 they explain a significant portion of cross-sectional variation in B-share
 discounts, even after controlling for other factors. On a univariate
 basis, the price impact measure and the adverse selection component of the
 bid-ask spread in the A- and B-share markets explains 44% and 46% of the
 variation in B-share discounts. On a multivariate basis, both measures are
 far more statistically significant than any of the control variables. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Ambiguity, Information Quality, and Asset Pricing 
Abstract:
 When ambiguity-averse investors process news of uncertain quality, they
 act as if they take a worst-case assessment of quality. As a result, they
 react more strongly to bad news than to good news. They also dislike
 assets for which information quality is poor, especially when the
 underlying fundamentals are volatile. These effects induce ambiguity
 premia that depend on idiosyncratic risk in fundamentals as well as
 skewness in returns. Moreover, shocks to information quality can have
 persistent negative effects on prices even if fundamentals do not change. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Price Volatility and Investor Behavior in an Overlapping Generations Model with Information Asymmetry 
Abstract:
 This paper studies an overlapping generations model with multiple
 securities and heterogeneously informed agents. The model produces
 multiple equilibria, including highly volatile equilibria that can exhibit
 strong or weak correlations between asset returns-even when asset supplies
 and future dividends are uncorrelated across assets. Less informed agents
 rationally behave like trend-followers, while better informed agents
 follow contrarian strategies. Trading volume has a hump-shaped relation
 with information precision and is positively correlated with absolute
 price changes. Finally, accurate information increases the volatility and
 correlation of stock returns in the highly volatile, strongly correlated
 equilibrium. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Individual Investor Trading and Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the dynamic relation between net individual
 investor trading and short-horizon returns for a large cross-section of
 NYSE stocks. The evidence indicates that individuals tend to buy stocks
 following declines in the previous month and sell following price
 increases. We document positive excess returns in the month following
 intense buying by individuals and negative excess returns after
 individuals sell, which we show is distinct from the previously shown past
 return or volume effects. The patterns we document are consistent with the
 notion that risk-averse individuals provide liquidity to meet
 institutional demand for immediacy. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Demise of Investment Banking Partnerships: Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
 In 1970 the New York Stock Exchange relaxed rules that prohibited the
 public incorporation of member firms. Investment banking concerns went
 public in waves, with Goldman Sachs the last of the bulge bracket banks to
 float. We explain the pattern of investment bank flotations. We argue that
 partnerships foster the formation of human capital and we use
 technological advances that undermine the role of human capital to explain
 the partnership's going-public decision. We support our theory using a new
 data set of investment bank partnership statistics. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Downward-Sloping Demand Curves, the Supply of Shares, and the Collapse of Internet Stock Prices 
Abstract:
 Over March and April 2000, Internet stocks lost 56%, or $700 billion. This
 sudden collapse has been attributed to an increasing supply of shares from
 lockup expirations and equity offerings. I show that Internet stocks
 collapsed in this period regardless of whether their lockups expired.
 Furthermore, daily Internet stock portfolio returns were almost unaffected
 by the number or dollar amount of lockup expirations that day, or by the
 amount of stock offered in IPOs or SEOs. Most of the Internet stock
 decline is explained by poor marketwide returns, particularly for growth
 stocks. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Information, Trading, and Product Market Interactions: Cross-sectional Implications of Informed Trading 
Abstract:
 I present a simple model of informed trading in which asset values are
 derived from imperfectly competitive product markets and private
 information events occur at individual firms. The model predicts that
 informed traders may have incentives to make information-based trades in
 the stocks of competitors, especially when events occur at firms with
 large market shares. In the context of 759 earnings announcements, I use
 intraday transactions data to test the hypothesis that net order flow and
 returns in the stocks of nonannouncing competitors have information
 content for announcing firms. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Long-Lasting Momentum in Weekly Returns 
Abstract:
 Reversal is the current stylized fact of weekly returns. However, we find
 that an opposing and long-lasting continuation in returns follows the
 well-documented brief reversal. These subsequent momentum profits are
 strong enough to offset the initial reversal and to produce a significant
 momentum effect over the full year following portfolio formation. Thus, ex
 post, extreme weekly returns are not too extreme. Our findings extend to
 weekly price movements with and without public news. In addition, there is
 no relation between news uncertainty and the momentum in 1-week returns. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: IPO Pricing and Share Allocation: The Importance of Being Ignorant 
Abstract:
 Since an underwriter sets an IPO's offer price without knowing its market
 value, investors can acquire information about its value and avoid
 overpriced deals ("lemon-dodge"). To mitigate this well-known risk, the
 bank enters into a repeat game with a coalition of investors who do not
 lemon-dodge in exchange for on-average underpriced shares. We (i) derive
 and test a quantitative IPO pricing rule (showing that tech IPOs were not
 excessively underpriced during the boom of the 1990s); and (ii) analyzing
 a unique multibank data set, find strong support for the conjecture that a
 bank preferentially allocates shares to its coalition. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.
