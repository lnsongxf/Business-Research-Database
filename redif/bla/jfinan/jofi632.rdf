Title: Which Shorts Are Informed? 
Abstract:
 We construct a long daily panel of short sales using proprietary NYSE
 order data. From 2000 to 2004, shorting accounts for more than 12.9% of
 NYSE volume, suggesting that shorting constraints are not widespread. As a
 group, these short sellers are well informed. Heavily shorted stocks
 underperform lightly shorted stocks by a risk-adjusted average of 1.16%
 over the following 20 trading days (15.6% annualized). Institutional
 nonprogram short sales are the most informative; stocks heavily shorted by
 institutions underperform by 1.43% the next month (19.6% annualized). The
 results indicate that, on average, short sellers are important
 contributors to efficient stock prices. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Do Bankruptcy Codes Matter? A Study of Defaults in France, Germany, and the U.K. 
Abstract:
 Using a sample of small firms that defaulted on their bank debt in France,
 Germany, and the United Kingdom, we find that large differences in
 creditors' rights across countries lead banks to adjust their lending and
 reorganization practices to mitigate costly aspects of bankruptcy law. In
 particular, French banks respond to a creditor-unfriendly code by
 requiring more collateral than lenders elsewhere, and by relying on
 collateral forms that minimize the statutory dilution of their claims in
 bankruptcy. Despite such adjustments, bank recovery rates in default
 remain sharply different across the three countries, reflecting very
 different levels of creditor protection. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Empirical Evidence of Risk Shifting in Financially Distressed Firms 
Abstract:
 This paper provides evidence of risk-shifting behavior in the investment
 decisions of financially distressed firms. Using a real options framework,
 I show that shareholders' risk-shifting incentives can reverse the
 expected negative relation between volatility and investment. I test two
 hypotheses that are consistent with risk-shifting behavior: (i) volatility
 has a positive effect on distressed firms' investment; (ii) investments of
 distressed firms generate less value during times of high uncertainty.
 Empirical evidence using 40 years of data supports both hypotheses. I
 further evaluate the effect of various firm characteristics on risk
 shifting, and estimate the costs of the investment distortion. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Information Sales and Insider Trading with Long-Lived Information 
Abstract:
 Fundamental information resembles in many respects a durable good. Hence,
 the effects of its incorporation into stock prices depend on who is the
 agent controlling its flow. Like a durable goods monopolist, a
 monopolistic analyst selling information intertemporally competes against
 herself. This forces her to partially relinquish control over the
 information flow to traders. Conversely, an insider solves the
 intertemporal competition problem through vertical integration, thus
 exerting tighter control over the information flow. Comparing market
 patterns I show that a dynamic market where information is provided by an
 analyst is "thicker" and "more informative" than one where an insider
 trades. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Industry Life Cycle, Acquisitions and Investment: Does Firm Organization Matter? 
Abstract:
 We examine the effect of industry life-cycle stages on within-industry
 acquisitions and capital expenditures by conglomerates and single-segment
 firms controlling for endogeneity of organizational form. We find greater
 differences in acquisitions than in capital expenditures, which are
 similar across organizational types. In particular, 36% of the growth
 recorded by conglomerate segments in growth industries comes from
 acquisitions, versus 9% for single-segment firms. In growth industries,
 the effect of financial dependence on acquisitions and plant openings is
 mitigated for conglomerate firms. Plants acquired by conglomerate firms
 increase in productivity. The results suggest that organizational forms'
 comparative advantages differ across industry conditions. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Capital Gains Taxes and Asset Prices: Capitalization or Lock-in? 
Abstract:
 This paper demonstrates that the equilibrium impact of capital gains taxes
 reflects both the capitalization effect (i.e., capital gains taxes
 decrease demand) and the lock-in effect (i.e., capital gains taxes
 decrease supply). Depending on time periods and stock characteristics,
 either effect may dominate. Using the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 as our
 event, we find evidence supporting a dominant capitalization effect in the
 week following news that sharply increased the probability of a reduction
 in the capital gains tax rate and a dominant lock-in effect in the week
 after the rate reduction became effective. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: An Empirical Analysis of the Pricing of Collateralized Debt Obligations 
Abstract:
 We use the information in collateralized debt obligations (CDO) prices to
 study market expectations about how corporate defaults cluster. A
 three-factor portfolio credit model explains virtually all of the
 time-series and cross-sectional variation in an extensive data set of CDX
 index tranche prices. Tranches are priced as if losses of 0.4%, 6%, and
 35% of the portfolio occur with expected frequencies of 1.2, 41.5, and 763
 years, respectively. On average, 65% of the CDX spread is due to
 firm-specific default risk, 27% to clustered industry or sector default
 risk, and 8% to catastrophic or systemic default risk. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Identification of Maximal Affine Term Structure Models 
Abstract:
 Building on <link rid="b20">Duffie and Kan (1996)</link>, we propose a new
 representation of affine models in which the state vector comprises
 infinitesimal maturity yields and their quadratic covariations. Because
 these variables possess unambiguous economic interpretations, they
 generate a representation that is "globally identifiable". Further, this
 representation has more identifiable parameters than the "maximal" model
 of <link rid="b13">Dai and Singleton (2000)</link>. We implement this new
 representation for select three-factor models and find that
 model-independent estimates for the state vector can be estimated directly
 from yield curve data, which present advantages for the estimation and
 interpretation of multifactor models. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Term Structure of Real Rates and Expected Inflation 
Abstract:
 Changes in nominal interest rates must be due to either movements in real
 interest rates, expected inflation, or the inflation risk premium. We
 develop a term structure model with regime switches, time-varying prices
 of risk, and inflation to identify these components of the nominal yield
 curve. We find that the unconditional real rate curve in the United States
 is fairly flat around 1.3%. In one real rate regime, the real term
 structure is steeply downward sloping. An inflation risk premium that
 increases with maturity fully accounts for the generally upward sloping
 nominal term structure. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Competition from Specialized Firms and the Diversification-Performance Linkage 
Abstract:
 In this study, we show that the effect of diversification on performance
 is not homogeneous across industries and explore analytically and
 empirically the implications of this finding for the diversification
 literature. Diversified firms perform better in industries with a small
 number of nondiversified competitors or, equivalently, when specialized
 firms have a small combined market share, but worse as the presence of
 specialized firms increases in the industries in which they compete. The
 results are robust to the use of methods that alleviate the self-selection
 problem and call for a reassessment of the diversification-performance
 relationship. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Correlated Trading and Returns 
Abstract:
 A German broker's clients place similar speculative trades and therefore
 tend to be on the same side of the market in a given stock during a given
 day, week, month, and quarter. Aggregate liquidity effects, short sale
 constraints, the systematic execution of limit orders (coordinated through
 price movements) or the correlated trading of other investors who pick off
 retail limit orders do not fully explain why retail investors trade
 similarly. Correlated market orders lead returns, presumably due to
 persistent speculative price pressure. Correlated limit orders also
 predict subsequent returns, consistent with executed limit orders being
 compensated for accommodating liquidity demands. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Share Issuance and Cross-sectional Returns 
Abstract:
 Post-1970, share issuance exhibits a strong cross-sectional ability to
 predict stock returns. This predictive ability is more statistically
 significant than the individual predictive ability of size,
 book-to-market, or momentum. Our finding is related to research that finds
 that long-run returns are associated with share repurchase announcements,
 seasoned equity offerings, and stock mergers, although our results remain
 strong even after exclusion of the data used in these studies. We estimate
 the issuance relation pre-1970 and find no statistically significant
 predictive ability for most holding periods. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Earnings Management and Firm Performance Following Open-Market Repurchases 
Abstract:
 Both post-repurchase abnormal returns and "reported" improvement in
 operating performance are driven, at least in part, by pre-repurchase
 downward earnings management rather than genuine growth in profitability.
 The downward earnings management increases with both the percentage of the
 company that managers repurchase and CEO ownership. Pre-repurchase
 abnormal accruals are also negatively associated with future performance,
 with the association driven mainly by those firms that report the largest
 income-decreasing abnormal accruals. The study suggests that one reason
 firms experience post-repurchase abnormal returns is that post-repurchase
 realized earnings growth exceeds expectations formed on the basis of
 pre-repurchase deflated earnings numbers. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Underreaction to Dividend Reductions and Omissions? 
Abstract:
 Using a sample of 2,337 cash dividend reduction or omission announcements
 over the 1927 to 1999 period, this study reports significant negative
 post-announcement long-term abnormal returns, which last 1 year only.
 However, this long-term abnormal performance is driven by the
 post-earnings-announcement drift. After controlling for the earnings
 performance and the skewness of buy-and-hold abnormal returns, there is no
 compelling evidence of a post-dividend-reduction or post-dividend-omission
 price drift. Copyright 2008 by The American Finance Association.
