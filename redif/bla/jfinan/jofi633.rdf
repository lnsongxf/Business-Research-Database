Title: Growth versus Margins: Destabilizing Consequences of Giving the Stock Market What It Wants 
Abstract:
 We develop a model in which a firm can devote effort either to increasing
 sales growth, or to improving per-unit profit margins. If the firm's
 manager cares about the current stock price, she will favor the growth
 strategy when the market pays more attention to growth numbers.
 Conversely, it can be rational for the market to weight growth measures
 more heavily when it is known that the firm is following a growth
 strategy. This two-way feedback between firms' strategies and the market's
 pricing rule can lead to excess volatility in real variables, even absent
 any external shocks. Copyright (c) 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Volatility Information Trading in the Option Market 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates informed trading on stock volatility in the option
 market. We construct non-market maker net demand for volatility from the
 trading volume of individual equity options and find that this demand is
 informative about the future realized volatility of underlying stocks. We
 also find that the impact of volatility demand on option prices is
 positive. More importantly, the price impact increases by 40% as
 informational asymmetry about stock volatility intensifies in the days
 leading up to earnings announcements and diminishes to its normal level
 soon after the volatility uncertainty is resolved. Copyright (c) 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Corporate Governance Role of the Media: Evidence from Russia 
Abstract:
 We study the effect of media coverage on corporate governance by focusing
 on Russia in the period 1999 to 2002. We find that an investment fund's
 lobbying increases coverage of corporate governance violations in the
 Anglo-American press. We also find that coverage in the Anglo-American
 press increases the probability that a corporate governance violation is
 reversed. This effect is present even when we instrument coverage with an
 exogenous determinant, the fund's portfolio composition at the beginning
 of the period. The fund's strategy seems to work in part by impacting
 Russian companies' reputation abroad and in part by forcing regulators
 into action. Copyright (c) 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Blurring Firm Boundaries: The Role of Venture Capital in Strategic Alliances 
Abstract:
 This study documents a new value-added role of venture capitalists and
 addresses important questions about how resources are combined to create
 firms. As part of the nexus of contracts surrounding a firm, strategic
 alliances can be viewed as relational contracts that blur firm boundaries.
 This paper provides evidence that alliances are more frequent among
 companies sharing a common venture capitalist. The effect is concentrated
 in alliances in which contracting problems are more pronounced, consistent
 with venture capitalists utilizing informational and other advantages in
 providing resources to firms. Further, these alliances improve the
 probability of exit for venture-backed firms. Copyright (c) 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Market for Mergers and the Boundaries of the Firm 
Abstract:
 We relate the property rights theory of the firm to empirical regularities
 in the market for mergers and acquisitions. We first show that high
 market-to-book acquirers typically do not purchase low market-to-book
 targets. Instead, mergers pair together firms with similar ratios. We then
 build a continuous-time model of investment and merger activity combining
 search, scarcity, and asset complementarity to explain this like buys like
 result. We test the model by relating like-buys-like to search frictions.
 Search frictions and assortative matching vary inversely, supporting the
 model over standard explanations. Copyright (c) 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Stock Returns in Mergers and Acquisitions 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a real options framework to analyze the behavior of
 stock returns in mergers and acquisitions. In this framework, the timing
 and terms of takeovers are endogenous and result from value-maximizing
 decisions. The implications of the model for abnormal announcement returns
 are consistent with the available empirical evidence. In addition, the
 model generates new predictions regarding the dynamics of firm-level betas
 for the period surrounding control transactions. Using a sample of 1,086
 takeovers of publicly traded U.S. firms between 1985 and 2002, we present
 new evidence on the dynamics of firm-level betas, which is strongly
 supportive of the model's predictions. Copyright (c) 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Price of Immediacy 
Abstract:
 This paper models transaction costs as the rents that a monopolistic
 market maker extracts from impatient investors who trade via limit orders.
 We show that limit orders are American options. The limit prices inducing
 immediate execution of the order are functionally equivalent to bid and
 ask prices and can be solved for various transaction sizes to characterize
 the market maker's entire supply curve. We find considerable empirical
 support for the model's predictions in the cross-section of NYSE firms.
 The model produces unbiased, out-of-sample forecasts of abnormal returns
 for firms added to the S&P 500 index. Copyright (c) 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Loan Sales and Relationship Banking 
Abstract:
 Firms raise money from banks and the bond market. Banks sell loans in a
 secondary market to recycle their funds or to trade on private
 information. Liquidity in the loan market depends on the relative
 likelihood of each motive for trade and affects firms' optimal financial
 structure. The endogenous degree of liquidity is not always socially
 optimal: There is excessive trade in highly rated names, and insufficient
 liquidity in riskier bonds. We provide testable implications for prices
 and quantities in primary and secondary loan markets, and bond markets.
 Further, we posit that risk-based capital requirements may be socially
 desirable. Copyright (c) 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Bank Loans, Bonds, and Information Monopolies across the Business Cycle 
Abstract:
 Theory suggests that banks' private information about borrowers lets them
 hold up borrowers for higher interest rates. Since hold-up power increases
 with borrower risk, banks with exploitable information should be able to
 raise their rates in recessions by more than is justified by borrower risk
 alone. We test this hypothesis by comparing the pricing of loans for
 bank-dependent borrowers with the pricing of loans for borrowers with
 access to public debt markets, controlling for risk factors. Loan spreads
 rise in recessions, but firms with public debt market access pay lower
 spreads and their spreads rise significantly less in recessions. Copyright (c) 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: A Search-Based Theory of the On-the-Run Phenomenon 
Abstract:
 We propose a model in which assets with identical cash flows can trade at
 different prices. Infinitely lived agents can establish long positions in
 a search spot market, or short positions by first borrowing an asset in a
 search repo market. We show that short-sellers can endogenously
 concentrate in one asset because of search externalities and the
 constraint that they must deliver the asset they borrowed. That asset
 enjoys greater liquidity, a higher lending fee ("specialness"), and trades
 at a premium consistent with no-arbitrage. We derive closed-form solutions
 for small frictions, and provide a calibration generating realistic
 on-the-run premia. Copyright (c) 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Attracting Attention: Cheap Managerial Talk and Costly Market Monitoring 
Abstract:
 We provide a theory of informal communication-cheap talk-between firms and
 capital markets that incorporates the role of agency conflicts between
 managers and shareholders. The analysis suggests that a policy of
 discretionary disclosure that encourages managers to attract the market's
 attention when the firm is substantially undervalued can create
 shareholder value. The theory also relates the credibility of managerial
 announcements to the use of stock-based compensation, the presence of
 informed trading, and the liquidity of the stock. Our results are
 consistent with the existence of positive announcement effects produced by
 apparently innocuous corporate events (e.g., stock dividends, name
 changes). Copyright (c) 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: More Than Words: Quantifying Language to Measure Firms' Fundamentals 
Abstract:
 We examine whether a simple quantitative measure of language can be used
 to predict individual firms' accounting earnings and stock returns. Our
 three main findings are: (1) the fraction of negative words in
 firm-specific news stories forecasts low firm earnings; (2) firms' stock
 prices briefly underreact to the information embedded in negative words;
 and (3) the earnings and return predictability from negative words is
 largest for the stories that focus on fundamentals. Together these
 findings suggest that linguistic media content captures otherwise
 hard-to-quantify aspects of firms' fundamentals, which investors quickly
 incorporate into stock prices. Copyright (c) 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: The Politics of Financial Development: Evidence from Trade Liberalization 
Abstract:
 Incumbents in various industries have different incentives to promote or
 oppose financial development. Changes in the relative strength of promoter
 and opponent industries thus result in changes in the political
 equilibrium level of financial development. We conduct an event study
 using a sample of 41 countries that liberalized trade during 1970 to 2000,
 and show that the strengthening of promoter relative to opponent
 industries resulting from liberalization is a good predictor of subsequent
 financial development. The benefits of developing the financial system are
 insufficient for financial development, and rents in particular hands
 appear to be necessary to achieve it. Copyright (c) 2008 by The American Finance Association.

Title: Neighbors Matter: Causal Community Effects and Stock Market Participation 
Abstract:
 This paper establishes a causal relation between an individual's decision
 whether to own stocks and average stock market participation of the
 individual's community. We instrument for the average ownership of an
 individual's community with lagged average ownership of the states in
 which one's nonnative neighbors were born. Combining this instrumental
 variables approach with controls for individual and community fixed
 effects, a broad set of time-varying individual and community controls,
 and state-year effects rules out alternative explanations. To further
 establish that word-of-mouth communication drives this causal effect, we
 show that the results are stronger in more sociable communities. Copyright (c) 2008 by The American Finance Association.
