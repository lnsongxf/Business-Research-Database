Title: Presidential Address: The Cost of Active Investing 
Abstract:
 I compare the fees, expenses, and trading costs society pays to invest in
 the U.S. stock market with an estimate of what would be paid if everyone
 invested passively. Averaging over 1980-2006, I find investors spend 0.67%
 of the aggregate value of the market each year searching for superior
 returns. Society's capitalized cost of price discovery is at least 10% of
 the current market cap. Under reasonable assumptions, the typical investor
 would increase his average annual return by 67 basis points over the
 1980-2006 period if he switched to a passive market portfolio. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Back to the Beginning: Persistence and the Cross-Section of Corporate Capital Structure 
Abstract:
 We find that the majority of variation in leverage ratios is driven by an
 unobserved time-invariant effect that generates surprisingly stable
 capital structures: High (low) levered firms tend to remain as such for
 over two decades. This feature of leverage is largely unexplained by
 previously identified determinants, is robust to firm exit, and is present
 prior to the IPO, suggesting that variation in capital structures is
 primarily determined by factors that remain stable for long periods of
 time. We then show that these results have important implications for
 empirical analysis attempting to understand capital structure
 heterogeneity. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Asset Growth and the Cross-Section of Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 We test for firm-level asset investment effects in returns by examining
 the cross-sectional relation between firm asset growth and subsequent
 stock returns. Asset growth rates are strong predictors of future abnormal
 returns. Asset growth retains its forecasting ability even on large
 capitalization stocks. When we compare asset growth rates with the
 previously documented determinants of the cross-section of returns (i.e.,
 book-to-market ratios, firm capitalization, lagged returns, accruals, and
 other growth measures), we find that a firm's annual asset growth rate
 emerges as an economically and statistically significant predictor of the
 cross-section of U.S. stock returns. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Dissecting Anomalies 
Abstract:
 The anomalous returns associated with net stock issues, accruals, and
 momentum are pervasive; they show up in all size groups (micro, small, and
 big) in cross-section regressions, and they are also strong in sorts, at
 least in the extremes. The asset growth and profitability anomalies are
 less robust. There is an asset growth anomaly in average returns on
 microcaps and small stocks, but it is absent for big stocks. Among
 profitable firms, higher profitability tends to be associated with
 abnormally high returns, but there is little evidence that unprofitable
 firms have unusually low returns. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Corporate Governance and Risk-Taking 
Abstract:
 Better investor protection could lead corporations to undertake riskier
 but value-enhancing investments. For example, better investor protection
 mitigates the taking of private benefits leading to excess risk-avoidance.
 Further, in better investor protection environments, stakeholders like
 creditors, labor groups, and the government are less effective in reducing
 corporate risk-taking for their self-interest. However, arguments can also
 be made for a negative relationship between investor protection and
 risk-taking. Using a cross-country panel and a U.S.-only sample, we find
 that corporate risk-taking and firm growth rates are positively related to
 the quality of investor protection. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Hedge Fund Activism, Corporate Governance, and Firm Performance 
Abstract:
 Using a large hand-collected data set from 2001 to 2006, we find that
 activist hedge funds in the United States propose strategic, operational,
 and financial remedies and attain success or partial success in two-thirds
 of the cases. Hedge funds seldom seek control and in most cases are
 nonconfrontational. The abnormal return around the announcement of
 activism is approximately 7%, with no reversal during the subsequent year.
 Target firms experience increases in payout, operating performance, and
 higher CEO turnover after activism. Our analysis provides important new
 evidence on the mechanisms and effects of informed shareholder monitoring. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Hedge Funds: Performance, Risk, and Capital Formation 
Abstract:
 We use a comprehensive data set of funds-of-funds to investigate
 performance, risk, and capital formation in the hedge fund industry from
 1995 to 2004. While the average fund-of-funds delivers alpha only in the
 period between October 1998 and March 2000, a subset of funds-of-funds
 consistently delivers alpha. The alpha-producing funds are not as likely
 to liquidate as those that do not deliver alpha, and experience far
 greater and steadier capital inflows than their less fortunate
 counterparts. These capital inflows attenuate the ability of the alpha
 producers to continue to deliver alpha in the future. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: The Selection and Termination of Investment Management Firms by Plan Sponsors 
Abstract:
 We examine the selection and termination of investment management firms by
 3,400 plan sponsors between 1994 and 2003. Plan sponsors hire investment
 managers after large positive excess returns but this return-chasing
 behavior does not deliver positive excess returns thereafter. Investment
 managers are terminated for a variety of reasons, including but not
 limited to underperformance. Excess returns after terminations are
 typically indistinguishable from zero but in some cases positive. In a
 sample of round-trip firing and hiring decisions, we find that if plan
 sponsors had stayed with fired investment managers, their excess returns
 would be no different from those delivered by newly hired managers. We
 uncover significant variation in pre- and post-hiring and firing returns
 that is related to plan sponsor characteristics. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Optimal Decentralized Investment Management 
Abstract:
 We study an institutional investment problem in which a centralized
 decision maker, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO), for example, employs
 multiple asset managers to implement investment strategies in separate
 asset classes. The CIO allocates capital to the managers who, in turn,
 allocate these funds to the assets in their asset class. This two-step
 investment process causes several misalignments of objectives between the
 CIO and his managers and can lead to large utility costs for the CIO. We
 focus on (1) loss of diversification, (2) unobservable managerial appetite
 for risk, and (3) different investment horizons. We derive an optimal
 unconditional linear performance benchmark and show that this benchmark
 can be used to better align incentives within the firm. We find that the
 CIO's uncertainty about the managers' risk appetites increases both the
 costs of decentralized investment management and the value of an optimally
 designed benchmark. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: International Cross-Listing, Firm Performance, and Top Management Turnover: A Test of the Bonding Hypothesis 
Abstract:
 We examine a primary outcome of corporate governance, namely, the ability
 to identify and terminate poorly performing CEOs, to test the
 effectiveness of U.S. investor protections in improving the corporate
 governance of cross-listed firms. We find that firms from weak investor
 protection regimes that are cross-listed on a major U.S. Exchange are more
 likely to terminate poorly performing CEOs than non-cross-listed firms.
 Cross-listings on exchanges that do not require the adoption of stringent
 investor protections (OTC, private placements, and London listings) are
 not associated with a higher propensity to remove poorly performing CEOs. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Feedback Effects and Asset Prices 
Abstract:
 Feedback effects from asset prices to firm cash flows have been
 empirically documented. This finding raises a question for asset pricing:
 How are asset prices determined if price affects fundamental value, which
 in turn affects price? In this environment, by buying assets that others
 are buying, investors ensure high future cash flows for the firm and
 subsequent high returns for themselves. Hence, investors have an incentive
 to coordinate, which may generate self-fulfilling beliefs and multiple
 equilibria. Using insights from global games, we pin down investors'
 beliefs, analyze equilibrium prices, and show that strong feedback leads
 to higher excess volatility. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Economic Links and Predictable Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper finds evidence of return predictability across economically
 linked firms. We test the hypothesis that in the presence of investors
 subject to attention constraints, stock prices do not promptly incorporate
 news about economically related firms, generating return predictability
 across assets. Using a data set of firms' principal customers to identify
 a set of economically related firms, we show that stock prices do not
 incorporate news involving related firms, generating predictable
 subsequent price moves. A long-short equity strategy based on this effect
 yields monthly alphas of over 150 basis points. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Market Liquidity, Investor Participation, and Managerial Autonomy: Why Do Firms Go Private? 
Abstract:
 We focus on public-market investor participation to analyze the firm's
 decision to stay public or go private. The liquidity of public ownership
 is both a blessing and a curse: It lowers the cost of capital, but also
 introduces volatility in a firm's shareholder base, exposing management to
 uncertainty regarding shareholder intervention in management decisions,
 thereby affecting the manager's perceived decision-making autonomy and
 curtailing managerial inputs. We extract predictions about how investor
 participation affects stock price level and volatility and the public
 firm's incentives to go private, providing a link between "investor
 participation" and "firm participation" in public markets. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.
