Title: How Does Financing Impact Investment? The Role of Debt Covenants 
Abstract:
 We identify a specific channel (debt covenants) and the corresponding
 mechanism (transfer of control rights) through which financing frictions
 impact corporate investment. Using a regression discontinuity design, we
 show that capital investment declines sharply following a financial
 covenant violation, when creditors use the threat of accelerating the loan
 to intervene in management. Further, the reduction in investment is
 concentrated in situations in which agency and information problems are
 relatively more severe, highlighting how the state-contingent allocation
 of control rights can help mitigate investment distortions arising from
 financing frictions. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Foreign Banks in Poor Countries: Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
 We study how foreign bank penetration affects financial sector development
 in poor countries. A theoretical model shows that when domestic banks are
 better than foreign banks at monitoring soft information customers,
 foreign bank entry may hurt these customers and worsen welfare. The model
 also predicts that credit to the private sector should be lower in
 countries with more foreign bank penetration, and that foreign banks
 should have a less risky loan portfolio. In the empirical section, we test
 these predictions for a sample of lower income countries and find support
 for the theoretical model. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Local Bank Financial Constraints and Firm Access to External Finance 
Abstract:
 I exploit the exogenous component of a formula-based allocation of
 government funds across banks in Argentina to test for financial
 constraints and underinvestment by local banks. Banks are found to expand
 lending by $0.66 in response to an additional dollar of external
 financing. Using novel data to measure risk and return on marginal
 lending, I show that the profitability of lending does not decline and
 total borrower debt increases during lending expansions, holding
 investment opportunities constant. Overall, financial shocks to
 constrained banks are found to have a quick, persistent, and amplified
 effect on the aggregate supply of credit. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Collective Risk Management in a Flight to Quality Episode 
Abstract:
 Severe flight to quality episodes involve uncertainty about the
 environment, not only risk about asset payoffs. The uncertainty is
 triggered by unusual events and untested financial innovations that lead
 agents to question their worldview. We present a model of crises and
 central bank policy that incorporates Knightian uncertainty. The model
 explains crisis regularities such as market-wide capital immobility,
 agents' disengagement from risk, and liquidity hoarding. We identify a
 social cost of these behaviors, and a benefit of a lender of last resort
 facility. The benefit is particularly high because public and private
 insurance are complements during uncertainty-driven crises. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: The Real Determinants of Asset Sales 
Abstract:
 I develop a dynamic structural model in which a firm makes rational
 decisions to buy or sell assets in the presence of productivity shocks. By
 identifying equilibrium asset prices, the model also examines the
 aggregate asset sales activity over the business cycle. It shows that
 changes in productivity, rather than productivity levels, affect
 decisions: Firms with rising productivity buy assets and firms with
 falling productivity downsize ("rising buys falling"). As such, industries
 in which firms have less persistent and more volatile productivity
 experience greater asset reallocation. Using plant-level data from
 Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), I find strong support for the
 model's predictions. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: The Value of Financial Flexibility 
Abstract:
 We develop a model that endogenizes dynamic financing, investment, and
 cash retention/payout policies in order to analyze the effect of financial
 flexibility on firm value. We show that the value of financing flexibility
 depends on the costs of external financing, the level of corporate and
 personal tax rates that determine the effective cost of holding cash, the
 firm's growth potential and maturity, and the reversibility of capital.
 Through simulations, we demonstrate that firms facing financing frictions
 should simultaneously borrow and lend, and we examine the nature of
 dynamic debt and liquidity policies and the value associated with
 corporate liquidity. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Marketwide Private Information in Stocks: Forecasting Currency Returns 
Abstract:
 We present a model of equity trading with informed and uninformed
 investors where informed investors trade on firm-specific and marketwide
 private information. The model is used to identify the component of order
 flow due to marketwide private information. Estimated trades driven by
 marketwide private information display little or no correlation with the
 first principal component in order flow. Indeed, we find that co-movement
 in order flow captures variation mostly in liquidity trades. Marketwide
 private information obtained from equity market data forecasts industry
 stock returns, and also currency returns. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Default and Recovery Implicit in the Term Structure of Sovereign "CDS" Spreads 
Abstract:
 This paper explores the nature of default arrival and recovery implicit in
 the term structures of sovereign "CDS" spreads. We argue that term
 structures of spreads reveal not only the arrival rates of credit events
 <formula format="inline"><file name="jofi_1399_mu1.gif" type="gif"
 /></formula>, but also the loss rates given credit events. Applying our
 framework to Mexico, Turkey, and Korea, we show that a single-factor model
 with <formula format="inline"><file name="jofi_1399_mu2.gif" type="gif"
 /></formula> following a lognormal process captures most of the variation
 in the term structures of spreads. The risk premiums associated with
 unpredictable variation in <formula format="inline"><file
 name="jofi_1399_mu3.gif" type="gif" /></formula> are found to be
 economically significant and co-vary importantly with several economic
 measures of global event risk, financial market volatility, and
 macroeconomic policy. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Cross-Asset Speculation in Stock Markets 
Abstract:
 In practice, heterogeneously informed speculators combine private
 information about multiple stocks with information in prices, taking into
 account how their trades influence the inferences of other speculators via
 prices. We show how this speculation causes prices to be more correlated
 than asset fundamentals, raising price volatility. The covariance
 structure of asset fundamentals drives that of prices, while the
 covariance structure of liquidity trade drives that of order flows. We
 characterize how speculator profits vary with the distributions of
 information and liquidity trade across assets and speculators, and relate
 the cross-asset factor structure of order flows to that of returns. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: The Dog That Did Not Bark: Insider Trading and Crashes 
Abstract:
 This paper documents that at the individual stock level, insiders' sales
 peak many months before a large drop in the stock price, while insiders'
 purchases peak only the month before a large jump. We provide a
 theoretical explanation for this phenomenon based on trading constraints
 and asymmetric information. A key feature of our theory is that rational
 uninformed investors may react more strongly to the absence of insider
 sales than to their presence (the "dog that did not bark" effect). We test
 our hypothesis against competing stories, such as insiders timing their
 trades to evade prosecution. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: "You Can Enter but You Cannot Leave&hellip;": U.S. Securities Markets and Foreign Firms 
Abstract:
 Although a number of prior papers have argued the benefits to foreign
 firms of cross-listing their shares in the U.S., the number of foreign
 firms exiting U.S. capital markets has been increasing. This has occurred
 despite the difficulties foreign firms face in deregistering from the
 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This paper examines the reasons
 underlying this trend. One of our main findings is that the passage of the
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act has reduced the net benefits of a U.S. listing and
 registration, particularly for smaller foreign firms with lower trading
 volume and stronger insider control. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Buyer-Supplier Relationships and the Stakeholder Theory of Capital Structure 
Abstract:
 Firms in bilateral relationships are likely to produce or procure unique
 products-especially when they are in durable goods industries. Consistent
 with the arguments of Titman and Titman and Wessels, such firms are likely
 to maintain lower leverage. We compile a database of firms' principal
 customers (those that account for at least 10% of sales or are otherwise
 considered important for business) from the Business Information File of
 Compustat and find results consistent with the predictions of this theory. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.
