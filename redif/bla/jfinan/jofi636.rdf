Title: Market Structure, Internal Capital Markets, and the Boundaries of the Firm 
Abstract:
 We study how the creation of an internal capital market (ICM) can invite
 strategic responses in product markets that, in turn, shape firm
 boundaries. ICMs provide ex post resource flexibility, but come with ex
 ante commitment costs. Alternatively, stand-alones possess commitment
 ability but lack flexibility. By creating flexibility, integration can
 sometimes deter a rival's entry, but commitment problems can also invite
 predatory capital raising. These forces drive different organizational
 equilibria depending on the integrator's relation to the product market.
 Hybrid organizational forms like strategic alliances can sometimes
 dominate integration by offering some of its benefits with fewer strategic
 costs. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Trusting the Stock Market 
Abstract:
 We study the effect that a general lack of trust can have on stock market
 participation. In deciding whether to buy stocks, investors factor in the
 risk of being cheated. The perception of this risk is a function of the
 objective characteristics of the stocks and the subjective characteristics
 of the investor. Less trusting individuals are less likely to buy stock
 and, conditional on buying stock, they will buy less. In Dutch and Italian
 micro data, as well as in cross-country data, we find evidence consistent
 with lack of trust being an important factor in explaining the limited
 participation puzzle. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: The Making of an Investment Banker: Stock Market Shocks, Career Choice, and Lifetime Income 
Abstract:
 I show that stock market shocks have important and lasting effects on the
 careers of MBAs. Stock market conditions while MBA students are in school
 have a large effect on whether they go directly to Wall Street upon
 graduation. Further, starting on Wall Street immediately upon graduation
 causes a person to be more likely to work there later and to earn, on
 average, substantially more money. The empirical results suggest that
 investment bankers are largely "made" by circumstance rather than "born"
 to work on Wall Street. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Directors' Ownership in the U.S. Mutual Fund Industry 
Abstract:
 This paper empirically investigates directors' ownership in the mutual
 fund industry. Our results show that, contrary to anecdotal evidence, a
 significant portion of directors hold shares in the funds they oversee.
 Ownership patterns are broadly consistent with an optimal contracting
 equilibrium. That is, ownership is positively and significantly correlated
 with most variables that are predicted to indicate greater value from
 directors' monitoring. For example, directors' ownership is more prevalent
 in actively managed funds and in funds with lower institutional ownership.
 We also show considerable heterogeneity in ownership across fund families,
 suggesting family-wide policies play an important role. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Do Investors Overweight Personal Experience? Evidence from IPO Subscriptions 
Abstract:
 We find a strong positive link between past IPO returns and future
 subscriptions at the investor level in Finland. Our setting allows us to
 trace this effect to the returns personally experienced by investors; the
 effect is not explained by patterns related to the IPO cycle, or wealth
 effects. This behavior is consistent with reinforcement learning, where
 personally experienced outcomes are overweighted compared to rational
 Bayesian learning. The results provide a microfoundation for the argument
 that investor sentiment drives IPO demand. The paper also contributes to
 understanding how popular investment styles develop, and has implications
 for the marketing of financial products. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Overconfidence, CEO Selection, and Corporate Governance 
Abstract:
 We develop a model that shows that an overconfident manager, who sometimes
 makes value-destroying investments, has a higher likelihood than a
 rational manager of being deliberately promoted to CEO under
 "value-maximizing" corporate governance. Moreover, a risk-averse CEO's
 overconfidence enhances firm value up to a point, but the effect is
 "nonmonotonic" and differs from that of lower risk aversion. Overconfident
 CEOs also underinvest in information production. The board fires both
 excessively diffident and excessively overconfident CEOs. Finally,
 Sarbanes-Oxley is predicted to improve the precision of information
 provided to investors, but to reduce project investment. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Mandatory Disclosure and Operational Risk: Evidence from Hedge Fund Registration 
Abstract:
 Mandatory disclosure is a regulatory tool intended to allow market
 participants to assess operational risk. We examine the value of
 disclosure through the controversial SEC requirement, since overturned,
 which required major hedge funds to register as investment advisors and
 file Form ADV disclosures. Leverage and ownership structures suggest that
 lenders and equity investors were already aware of operational risk.
 However, operational risk does not mediate flow-performance relationships.
 Investors either lack this information or regard it as immaterial. These
 findings suggest that regulators should account for the endogenous
 production of information and the marginal benefit of disclosure to
 different investment clienteles. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: The Geography of Block Acquisitions 
Abstract:
 Using a large sample of partial block acquisitions, we examine the
 importance of geographic proximity in corporate governance and target
 returns. We find that block acquirers have a strong preference for
 geographically proximate targets and acquirers that purchase shares in
 such targets are more likely to engage in post-acquisition target
 governance activities than are remote block acquirers. Moreover, the
 targets of these acquirers realize higher announcement returns and better
 post-acquisition operating performance than do targets of other types of
 acquirers, particularly when they face greater information asymmetries. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Estimating the Intertemporal Risk-Return Tradeoff Using the Implied Cost of Capital 
Abstract:
 We argue that the implied cost of capital (ICC), computed using earnings
 forecasts, is useful in capturing time variation in expected stock
 returns. First, we show theoretically that ICC is perfectly correlated
 with the conditional expected stock return under plausible conditions.
 Second, our simulations show that ICC is helpful in detecting an
 intertemporal risk-return relation, even when earnings forecasts are poor.
 Finally, in empirical analysis, we construct the time series of ICC for
 the G-7 countries. We find a positive relation between the conditional
 mean and variance of stock returns, at both the country level and the
 world market level. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: In Search of Distress Risk 
Abstract:
 This paper explores the determinants of corporate failure and the pricing
 of financially distressed stocks whose failure probability, estimated from
 a dynamic logit model using accounting and market variables, is high.
 Since 1981, financially distressed stocks have delivered anomalously low
 returns. They have lower returns but much higher standard deviations,
 market betas, and loadings on value and small-cap risk factors than stocks
 with low failure risk. These patterns are more pronounced for stocks with
 possible informational or arbitrage-related frictions. They are
 inconsistent with the conjecture that the value and size effects are
 compensation for the risk of financial distress. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: How Does Size Affect Mutual Fund Behavior? 
Abstract:
 If actively managed mutual funds suffer from diminishing returns to scale,
 funds should alter investment behavior as assets under management
 increase. Although asset growth has little effect on the behavior of the
 typical fund, we find that large funds and small-cap funds diversify their
 portfolios in response to growth. Greater diversification, especially for
 small-cap funds, is associated with better performance. Fund family growth
 is related to the introduction of new funds that hold different stocks
 from their existing siblings. Funds with many siblings diversify less
 rapidly as they grow, suggesting that the fund family may influence a
 fund's portfolio strategy. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Average Returns, B/M, and Share Issues 
Abstract:
 The book-to-market ratio (B/M) is a noisy measure of expected stock
 returns because it also varies with expected cashflows. Our hypothesis is
 that the evolution of B/M, in terms of past changes in book equity and
 price, contains independent information about expected cashflows that can
 be used to improve estimates of expected returns. The tests support this
 hypothesis, with results that are largely but not entirely similar for
 Microcap stocks (below the 20-super-th NYSE market capitalization
 percentile) and All but Micro stocks (ABM). Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Stock Returns and Volatility: Pricing the Short-Run and Long-Run Components of Market Risk 
Abstract:
 We explore the cross-sectional pricing of volatility risk by decomposing
 equity market volatility into short- and long-run components. Our finding
 that prices of risk are negative and significant for both volatility
 components implies that investors pay for insurance against increases in
 volatility, even if those increases have little persistence. The short-run
 component captures market skewness risk, which we interpret as a measure
 of the tightness of financial constraints. The long-run component relates
 to business cycle risk. Furthermore, a three-factor pricing model with the
 market return and the two volatility components compares favorably to
 benchmark models. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: Limited Attention and the Allocation of Effort in Securities Trading 
Abstract:
 While limited attention has been analyzed in a variety of economic and
 psychological settings, its impact on financial markets is not well
 understood. In this paper, we examine individual NYSE specialist
 portfolios and test whether liquidity provision is affected as specialists
 allocate their attention across stocks. Our results indicate that
 specialists allocate effort toward their most active stocks during periods
 of increased activity, resulting in less frequent price improvement and
 increased transaction costs for their remaining assigned stocks. Thus, the
 allocation of effort due to limited attention has a significant impact on
 liquidity provision in securities markets. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.

Title: How and When Do Firms Adjust Their Capital Structures toward Targets? 
Abstract:
 If firms adjust their capital structures toward targets, and if there are
 adverse selection costs associated with asymmetric information, how and
 when do firms adjust their capital structures? We suggest a financing
 needs-induced adjustment framework to examine the dynamic process by which
 firms adjust their capital structures. We find that most adjustments occur
 when firms have above-target (below-target) debt with a financial surplus
 (deficit). These results suggest that firms move toward the target capital
 structure when they face a financial deficit/surplus-but not in the manner
 hypothesized by the traditional pecking order theory. Copyright (c) 2008 The American Finance Association.
