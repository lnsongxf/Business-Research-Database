Title: High-Water Marks: High Risk Appetites? Convex Compensation, Long Horizons, and Portfolio Choice 
Abstract:
 We study the portfolio choice of hedge fund managers who are compensated
 by high-water mark contracts. We find that even risk-neutral managers do
 not place unbounded weights on risky assets, despite option-like
 contracts. Instead, they place a constant fraction of funds in a
 mean-variance efficient portfolio and the rest in the riskless asset,
 acting as would constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) investors. This
 result is a direct consequence of the in(de)finite horizon of the
 contract. We show that the risk-seeking incentives of option-like
 contracts rely on combining finite horizons and convex compensation
 schemes rather than on convexity alone. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: It's SHO Time&excl; Short-Sale Price Tests and Market Quality 
Abstract:
 We examine the effects of the Securities and Exchange Commission
 (SEC)-mandated temporary suspension of short-sale price tests for a set of
 Pilot securities. While short-selling activity increases both for NYSE-
 and Nasdaq-listed Pilot stocks, returns and volatility at the daily level
 are unaffected. NYSE-listed Pilot stocks experience more symmetric trading
 patterns and a slight increase in spreads and intraday volatility after
 the suspension while there is a smaller effect on market quality for
 Nasdaq-listed Pilot stocks. The results suggest that the effect of the
 price tests on market quality can largely be attributed to distortions in
 order flow created by the price tests themselves. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Should Investors Bet on the Jockey or the Horse? Evidence from the Evolution of Firms from Early Business Plans to Public Companies 
Abstract:
 We study how firm characteristics evolve from early business plan to
 initial public offering (IPO) to public company for 50 venture capital
 (VC)-financed companies. Firm business lines remain remarkably stable
 while management turnover is substantial. Management turnover is
 positively related to alienable asset formation. We obtain similar results
 using all 2004 IPOs, suggesting that our main results are not specific to
 VC-backed firms or the time period. The results suggest that, at the
 margin, investors in start-ups should place more weight on the business
 ("the horse") than on the management team ("the jockey"). The results also
 inform theories of the firm. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Share Repurchases and Pay-Performance Sensitivity of Employee Compensation Contracts 
Abstract:
 I show that share repurchases increase pay-performance sensitivity of
 employee compensation and lead to greater employee effort and higher stock
 prices. Consistent with the model, I find that after repurchases,
 employees and managers receive fewer stock option and equity grants, and
 that the market reacts favorably to repurchase announcements when
 employees have many unvested stock options. Managers are more likely to
 initiate share repurchases when employees hold a large stake in the firm.
 Moreover, since employees are forced to bear more risk in firms that
 repurchase shares, they exercise their stock options earlier and receive
 higher compensation. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Financing Innovation and Growth: Cash Flow, External Equity, and the 1990s R&D Boom 
Abstract:
 The financing of R&D provides a potentially important channel to link
 finance and economic growth, but there is no direct evidence that
 financial effects are large enough to impact aggregate R&D. U.S. firms
 finance R&D from volatile sources: cash flow and stock issues. We estimate
 dynamic R&D models for high-tech firms and find significant effects of
 cash flow and external equity for young, but not mature, firms. The
 financial coefficients for young firms are large enough that finance
 supply shifts can explain most of the dramatic 1990s R&D boom, which
 implies a significant connection between finance, innovation, and growth. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Entrepreneurial Shareholder Activism: Hedge Funds and Other Private Investors 
Abstract:
 We examine recent confrontational activism campaigns by hedge funds and
 other private investors. The main parallels between the groups are a
 significantly positive market reaction for the target firm around the
 initial Schedule 13D filing date, significantly positive returns over the
 subsequent year, and the activist's high success rate in achieving its
 original objective. Further, both activists frequently gain board
 representation through real or threatened proxy solicitations. Two major
 differences are that hedge funds target more profitable firms than other
 activists, and hedge funds address cash flow agency costs whereas other
 private investors change the target's investment strategies. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: CEO Compensation and Board Structure 
Abstract:
 In response to corporate scandals in 2001 and 2002, major U.S. stock
 exchanges issued new board requirements to enhance board oversight. We
 find a significant decrease in CEO compensation for firms that were more
 affected by these requirements, compared with firms that were less
 affected, taking into account unobservable firm effects, time-varying
 industry effects, size, and performance. The decrease in compensation is
 particularly pronounced in the subset of affected firms with no outside
 blockholder on the board and in affected firms with low concentration of
 institutional investors. Our results suggest that the new board
 requirements affected CEO compensation decisions. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Access to Capital, Capital Structure, and the Funding of the Firm 
Abstract:
 Based upon a large data set of public and private firms in the United
 Kingdom, I find that compared to their public counterparts, private firms
 rely almost exclusively on debt financing, have higher leverage ratios,
 and tend to avoid external capital markets, leading to a greater
 sensitivity of their capital structures to fluctuations in performance. I
 argue that these differences are due to private equity being more costly
 than public equity. I further examine the private firms subsample to show
 that private equity is more costly than its public counterpart due to
 information asymmetry and the desire to maintain control. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Do Entrenched Managers Pay Their Workers More? 
Abstract:
 Analyzing a panel that matches public firms with worker-level data, we
 find that managerial entrenchment affects workers' pay. CEOs with more
 control pay their workers more, but financial incentives through cash flow
 rights ownership mitigate such behavior. Entrenched CEOs pay more to
 employees closer to them in the corporate hierarchy, geographically closer
 to the headquarters, and associated with conflict-inclined unions. The
 evidence is consistent with entrenched CEOs paying more to enjoy private
 benefits such as lower effort wage bargaining and improved social
 relations with employees. Our results show that managerial ownership and
 corporate governance can play an important role for employee compensation. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Labor and Corporate Governance: International Evidence from Restructuring Decisions 
Abstract:
 Our results highlight the importance of interaction among management,
 labor, and investors in shaping corporate governance. We find that strong
 union laws protect not only workers but also underperforming managers.
 Weak investor protection combined with strong union laws are conducive to
 worker-management alliances, wherein poorly performing firms sell assets
 to prevent large-scale layoffs, garnering worker support to retain
 management. Asset sales in weak investor protection countries lead to
 further deteriorating performance, whereas in strong investor protection
 countries they improve performance and lead to more layoffs. Strong union
 laws are less effective in preventing layoffs when financial leverage is
 high. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Market Sidedness: Insights into Motives for Trade Initiation 
Abstract:
 We infer motives for trade initiation from market sidedness. We define
 trading as more two-sided (one-sided) if the correlation between the
 number of buyer- and seller-initiated trades increases (decreases), and
 assess changes in sidedness (relative to a control sample) around events
 that identify trade initiators. Consistent with asymmetric information,
 trading is more one-sided before merger news. Consistent with belief
 heterogeneity, trading is more two-sided before earnings and macro
 announcements with greater dispersion in analyst forecasts, and after news
 with larger announcement surprises. We examine the codeterminacy of
 sidedness, bid-ask spread, volatility, number of trades, and order
 imbalance. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Private Benefits of Control, Ownership, and the Cross-listing Decision 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates how a foreign firm's decision to cross-list on a
 U.S. stock exchange is related to the consumption of private benefits of
 control by its controlling shareholders. Theory has proposed that when
 private benefits are high, controlling shareholders are less likely to
 choose to cross-list in the United States because of constraints on the
 consumption of private benefits resulting from such listings. Using
 several proxies for private benefits related to the control and cash flow
 ownership rights of controlling shareholders, we find support for this
 hypothesis with a sample of more than 4,000 firms from 31 countries. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Are Liquidity and Information Risks Priced in the Treasury Bond Market? 
Abstract:
 We provide a comprehensive empirical analysis of the effects of liquidity
 and information risks on expected returns of Treasury bonds. We focus on
 the systematic liquidity risk of Pastor and Stambaugh as opposed to the
 traditional microstructure-based measures of liquidity. Information risk
 is measured by the probability of information-based trading (PIN). We
 document a strong positive relation between expected Treasury returns and
 liquidity and information risks, controlling for the effects of other
 systematic risk factors and bond characteristics. This relation is robust
 to many empirical specifications and a wide variety of traditional
 liquidity and informed trading proxies. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Public Information, IPO Price Formation, and Long-Run Returns: Japanese Evidence 
Abstract:
 The price formation process of JASDAQ IPOs is more transparent than in the
 United States. The transparency facilitates analysis of important issues
 in the IPO literature-why offer prices only partially adjust to public
 information and adjust more fully to negative information, and why
 adjustments are related to initial returns. The evidence indicates that
 early price information conveys the underwriter's commitment to compensate
 investors for acquiring and/or disclosing information. Offer prices
 reflect pre-IPO market values of public companies and implicit agreements
 between underwriters and issuers that originate well before the offering.
 Underadjustment of offer prices is substantially reversed in the
 aftermarket. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.
