Title: Sensation Seeking, Overconfidence, and Trading Activity 
Abstract:
 This study analyzes the role that two psychological attributes-sensation
 seeking and overconfidence-play in the tendency of investors to trade
 stocks. Equity trading data from Finland are combined with data from
 investor tax filings, driving records, and mandatory psychological
 profiles. We use these data, obtained from a large population, to
 construct measures of overconfidence and sensation seeking tendencies.
 Controlling for a host of variables, including wealth, income, age, number
 of stocks owned, marital status, and occupation, we find that
 overconfident investors and those investors most prone to sensation
 seeking trade more frequently. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Equilibrium Portfolio Strategies in the Presence of Sentiment Risk and Excess Volatility 
Abstract:
 Our objective is to identify the trading strategy that would allow an
 investor to take advantage of "excessive" stock price volatility and
 "sentiment" fluctuations. We construct a general equilibrium
 "difference-of-opinion" model of sentiment in which there are two classes
 of agents, one of which is overconfident about a public signal, while
 still optimizing intertemporally. Overconfident investors overreact to the
 signal and introduce an additional risk factor causing stock prices to be
 excessively volatile. Consequently, rational investors choose a
 conservative portfolio; moreover, this portfolio depends not just on the
 current price divergence but also on their prediction about future
 sentiment and the speed of price convergence. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Risk in Dynamic Arbitrage: The Price Effects of Convergence Trading 
Abstract:
 I develop an equilibrium model of convergence trading and its impact on
 asset prices. Arbitrageurs optimally decide how to allocate their limited
 capital over time. Their activity reduces price discrepancies, but their
 activity also generates losses with positive probability, even if the
 trading opportunity is fundamentally riskless. Moreover, prices of
 identical assets can diverge even if the constraints faced by arbitrageurs
 are not binding. Occasionally, total losses are large, making
 arbitrageurs' returns negatively skewed, consistent with the empirical
 evidence. The model also predicts comovement of arbitrageurs' expected
 returns and market liquidity. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Catastrophic Risk and Credit Markets 
Abstract:
 We provide a model of the effects of catastrophic risk on real estate
 financing and prices and demonstrate that insurance market imperfections
 can restrict the supply of credit for catastrophe-susceptible properties.
 Using unique micro-level data, we find that earthquake risk decreased
 commercial real estate bank loan provision by 22% in California properties
 in the 1990s, with more severe effects in African-American neighborhoods.
 We show that the 1994 Northridge earthquake had only a short-term
 disruptive effect. Our basic findings are confirmed for hurricane risk,
 and our model and empirical work have implications for terrorism and
 political perils. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Investor Inattention and Friday Earnings Announcements 
Abstract:
 Does limited attention among investors affect stock returns? We compare
 the response to earnings announcements on Friday, when investor
 inattention is more likely, to the response on other weekdays. If
 inattention influences stock prices, we should observe less immediate
 response and more drift for Friday announcements. Indeed, Friday
 announcements have a 15% lower immediate response and a 70% higher delayed
 response. A portfolio investing in differential Friday drift earns
 substantial abnormal returns. In addition, trading volume is 8% lower
 around Friday announcements. These findings support explanations of
 post-earnings announcement drift based on underreaction to information
 caused by limited attention. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: What Drives the Disposition Effect? An Analysis of a Long-Standing Preference-Based Explanation 
Abstract:
 We investigate whether prospect theory preferences can predict a
 disposition effect. We consider two implementations of prospect theory: in
 one case, preferences are defined over "annual" gains and losses; in the
 other, they are defined over "realized" gains and losses. Surprisingly,
 the annual gain/loss model often fails to predict a disposition effect.
 The realized gain/loss model, however, predicts a disposition effect more
 reliably. Utility from realized gains and losses may therefore be a useful
 way of thinking about certain aspects of individual investor trading. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Work Ethic, Employment Contracts, and Firm Value 
Abstract:
 We analyze how the work ethic of managers impacts a firm's employment
 contracts, riskiness, growth potential, and organizational structure. Flat
 contracts are optimal for diligent managers because they reduce
 risk-sharing costs, but they attract egoistic agents who shirk and
 unskilled agents who add no value. Stable, bureaucratic firms with low
 growth potential are more likely to gain value from managerial diligence.
 Firms that hire from a virtuous pool of agents are more conservative in
 their investments and have a horizontal corporate structure. Our theory
 also yields several testable implications that distinguish it from
 standard agency models. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Creditor Rights, Enforcement, and Bank Loans 
Abstract:
 We examine whether differences in legal protection affect the size,
 maturity, and interest rate spread on loans to borrowers in 48 countries.
 Results show that banks respond to poor enforceability of contracts by
 reducing loan amounts, shortening loan maturities, and increasing loan
 spreads. These effects are both statistically significant and economically
 large. While stronger creditor rights reduce spreads, they do not seem to
 matter for loan size and maturity. Overall, we show that variation in
 enforceability of contracts matters a great deal more to how loans are
 structured and how they are priced. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Securitization and the Declining Impact of Bank Finance on Loan Supply: Evidence from Mortgage Originations 
Abstract:
 Low-cost deposits and increased balance sheet liquidity raise banks'
 supply of illiquid loans more than loans easily sold or securitized. We
 exploit the inability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase jumbo
 mortgages to identify an exogenous change in liquidity. The volume of
 jumbo mortgage originations relative to nonjumbo originations increases
 with bank holdings of liquid assets and decreases with bank deposit costs.
 This result suggests that the increasing depth of the mortgage secondary
 market fostered by securitization has reduced the effect of lender's
 financial condition on credit supply. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Financial Constraints, Debt Capacity, and the Cross-section of Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 Building on a model of corporate investment under collateral constraints,
 we develop and test a hypothesis on the differential effect of debt
 capacity on stock returns across financially constrained and unconstrained
 firms. Consistent with the hypothesis, we find that debt capacity is a
 significant determinant of stock returns only in the cross-section of
 financially constrained firms, after controlling for beta, size,
 book-to-market, leverage, and momentum. The findings suggest that
 cross-sectional differences in corporate investment behavior arising from
 financial constraints, predicted by theories of imperfect capital markets
 and supported by empirical evidence, are reflected in the stock returns of
 manufacturing firms. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Cash Flow, Consumption Risk, and the Cross-section of Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 I link an asset's risk premium to two characteristics of its underlying
 cash flow: covariance and duration. Using empirically novel estimates of
 both cash flow characteristics based exclusively on accounting earnings
 and aggregate consumption data, I examine their dynamic interaction in a
 two-factor cash flow model and find that they are able to explain up to
 82% of the cross-sectional variation in the average returns on size,
 book-to-market, and long-term reversal-sorted portfolios for the period
 1964 to 2002. This finding highlights the importance of fundamental cash
 flow characteristics in determining the risk exposure of an asset. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Real Options, Product Market Competition, and Asset Returns 
Abstract:
 We study how competition in the product market affects the link between
 firms' real investment decisions and their asset return dynamics. In our
 model, assets in place and growth options have different sensitivities to
 market wide uncertainty. The strategic behavior of market participants
 influences the relative importance of these components of firm value. We
 show that the relationship between the degree of competition and assets'
 expected rates of return varies with product market demand. When demand is
 low, firms in more competitive industries earn higher returns, whereas
 when demand is high firms in more concentrated industries earn higher
 returns. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Hedge Fund Risk Dynamics: Implications for Performance Appraisal 
Abstract:
 Accurate appraisal of hedge fund performance must recognize the freedom
 with which managers shift asset classes, strategies, and leverage in
 response to changing market conditions and arbitrage opportunities. The
 standard measure of performance is the abnormal return defined by a hedge
 fund's exposure to risk factors. If exposures are assumed constant when,
 in fact, they vary through time, estimated abnormal returns may be
 incorrect. We employ an optimal changepoint regression that allows risk
 exposures to shift, and illustrate the impact on performance appraisal
 using a sample of live and dead funds during the period January 1994
 through December 2005. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Income Risk and Portfolio Choice: An Empirical Study 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the relationship between portfolio choice and
 labor income risk in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979
 Cohort. Permanent income risk (variability of shocks to income that have
 permanent effect) significantly reduces the share of risky assets in the
 household's portfolio, while transitory income risk (variability of shocks
 with no lasting effect) does not. This result provides strong evidence
 that households' portfolio choices respond to labor income risks in a
 manner consistent with economic theory. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.
