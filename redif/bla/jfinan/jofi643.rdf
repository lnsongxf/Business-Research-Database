Title: Do Stock Mergers Create Value for Acquirers? 
Abstract:
 This paper finds support for the hypothesis that overvalued firms create
 value for long-term shareholders by using their equity as currency. Any
 approach centered on abnormal returns is complicated by the fact that the
 most overvalued firms have the greatest incentive to engage in stock
 acquisitions. We solve this endogeneity problem by creating a sample of
 mergers that fail for exogenous reasons. We find that unsuccessful stock
 bidders significantly underperform successful ones. Failure to consummate
 is costlier for richly priced firms, and the unrealized acquirer-target
 combination would have earned higher returns. None of these results hold
 for cash bids. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Level Playing Fields in International Financial Regulation 
Abstract:
 We analyze the desirability of level playing fields in international
 financial regulation. In general, level playing fields impose the
 standards of the weakest regulator upon the best-regulated economies.
 However, they may be desirable when capital is mobile because they counter
 a "cherry-picking" effect that lowers the size and efficiency of banks in
 weaker economies. Hence, while a "laissez faire" policy favors the
 better-regulated economy, level playing fields are good for weaker
 regulators. We show that multinational banking mitigates the
 cherry-picking effect, and reduces the damage that a level playing field
 causes in the better-regulated economy. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Bank Loan Supply, Lender Choice, and Corporate Capital Structure 
Abstract:
 This paper explores the relevance of capital market supply frictions for
 corporate capital structure decisions. To identify this relationship, I
 study the effect on firms' financial structures of two changes in bank
 funding constraints: the 1961 emergence of the market for certificates of
 deposit, and the 1966 Credit Crunch. Following an expansion (contraction)
 in the availability of bank loans, leverage ratios of bank-dependent firms
 significantly increase (decrease) relative to firms with bond market
 access. Concurrent changes in the composition of financing sources lend
 further support to the role of credit supply and debt market segmentation
 in capital structure choice. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Information Immobility and the Home Bias Puzzle 
Abstract:
 Many argue that home bias arises because home investors can predict home
 asset payoffs more accurately than foreigners can. But why does global
 information access not eliminate this asymmetry? We model investors,
 endowed with a small home information advantage, who choose what
 information to learn before they invest. Surprisingly, even when home
 investors can learn what foreigners know, they choose not to: Investors
 profit more from knowing information others do not know. Learning
 amplifies information asymmetry. The model matches patterns of local and
 industry bias, foreign investments, portfolio outperformance, and asset
 prices. Finally, we propose new avenues for empirical research. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: International Taxation and the Direction and Volume of Cross-Border M&As 
Abstract:
 We show that the parent-subsidiary structure of multinational firms
 created by cross-border mergers and acquisitions is affected by the
 prospect of international double taxation. Specifically, the likelihood of
 parent firm location in a country following a cross-border takeover is
 reduced by high international double taxation of foreign-source income. At
 the same time, countries with high international double taxation attract
 smaller numbers of parent firms. A unilateral elimination of worldwide
 taxation by the United States is simulated to increase the proportion of
 parent firms locating in the United States following cross-border mergers
 and acquisitions from 53% to 58%. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Determinants of Vertical Integration: Financial Development and Contracting Costs 
Abstract:
 We study the determinants of vertical integration in a new data set of
 over 750,000 firms from 93 countries. We present a number of theoretical
 predictions on the interactions between financial development, contracting
 costs, and the extent of vertical integration. Consistent with these
 predictions, contracting costs and financial development by themselves
 appear to have no effect on vertical integration. However, we find greater
 vertical integration in countries that have both greater contracting costs
 "and" greater financial development. We also show that countries with
 greater contracting costs are more vertically integrated in more
 capital-intensive industries. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Eat or Be Eaten: A Theory of Mergers and Firm Size 
Abstract:
 We propose a theory of mergers that combines managerial merger motives
 with an industry-level regime shift that may lead to value-increasing
 merger opportunities. Anticipation of these merger opportunities can lead
 to defensive acquisitions, where managers acquire other firms to avoid
 losing private benefits if their firms are acquired, or "positioning"
 acquisitions, where firms position themselves as more attractive takeover
 targets to earn takeover premia. The identity of acquirers and targets and
 the profitability of acquisitions depend on the distribution of firm sizes
 within an industry, among other factors. We find empirical support for
 some unique predictions of our theory. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Oil Futures Prices in a Production Economy with Investment Constraints 
Abstract:
 We document a new stylized fact, that the relationship between the
 volatility of oil futures prices and the slope of the forward curve is
 nonmonotone and has a V-shape. This pattern cannot be generated by
 standard models that emphasize storage. We develop an equilibrium model of
 oil production in which investment is irreversible and capacity
 constrained. Investment constraints affect firms' investment decisions and
 imply that the supply elasticity changes over time. Since demand shocks
 must be absorbed by changes in prices or changes in supply, time-varying
 supply elasticity results in time-varying volatility of futures prices.
 Estimating this model, we show it is quantitatively consistent with the
 V-shape relationship between the volatility of futures prices and the
 slope of the forward curve. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: The Price of Correlation Risk: Evidence from Equity Options 
Abstract:
 We study whether exposure to marketwide correlation shocks affects
 expected option returns, using data on S&P100 index options, options on
 all components, and stock returns. We find evidence of priced correlation
 risk based on prices of index and individual variance risk. A trading
 strategy exploiting priced correlation risk generates a high alpha and is
 attractive for CRRA investors without frictions. Correlation risk exposure
 explains the cross-section of index and individual option returns well.
 The correlation risk premium cannot be exploited with realistic trading
 frictions, providing a limits-to-arbitrage interpretation of our finding
 of a high price of correlation risk. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: IPO Underpricing over the Very Long Run 
Abstract:
 A central measure of the efficiency of the Initial Public Offering (IPO)
 market is the extent to which issues are underpriced. We present new and
 comprehensive evidence covering British IPOs since World War I. During the
 period from 1917 to 1945, public offers were underpriced by an average of
 only 3.80%, as compared to 9.15% in the period from 1946 to 1986, and even
 more after the U.K. stock market was deregulated in 1986. The post-WWII
 rise in underpricing cannot be attributed to changes in firm composition,
 and occurred in spite of improvements in regulation, disclosure, and the
 prestige of IPO underwriters. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Trading Costs and Returns for U.S. Equities: Estimating Effective Costs from Daily Data 
Abstract:
 The effective cost of trading is usually estimated from transaction-level
 data. This study proposes a Gibbs estimate that is based on daily closing
 prices. In a validation sample, the daily Gibbs estimate achieves a
 correlation of 0.965 with the transaction-level estimate. When the Gibbs
 estimates are incorporated into asset pricing specifications over a long
 historical sample (1926 to 2006), the results suggest that effective cost
 (as a characteristic) is positively related to stock returns. The relation
 is strongest in January, but it appears to be distinct from size effects. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.

Title: Rank-Order Tournaments and Incentive Alignment: The Effect on Firm Performance 
Abstract:
 We investigate simultaneously the impact of promotion-based tournament
 incentives for VPs and equity-based (alignment) incentives for VPs and the
 chief executive officer (CEO) on firm performance. We find that tournament
 incentives, as measured by the pay differential between the CEO and VPs,
 relate positively to firm performance. The relation is more positive when
 the CEO nears retirement and less positive when the firm has a new CEO,
 and weakens further when the new CEO is an outsider. Our analysis is
 robust to corrections for endogeneity of all our incentive measures and to
 several alternative measures of tournament incentives and firm
 performance. Copyright (c) 2009 The American Finance Association.
