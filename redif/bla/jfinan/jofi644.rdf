Title: Presidential Address: Sophisticated Investors and Market Efficiency 
Abstract:
 Stock-market trading is increasingly dominated by sophisticated
 professionals, as opposed to individual investors. Will this trend
 ultimately lead to greater market efficiency? I consider two complicating
 factors. The first is crowding-the fact that, for a wide range of
 "unanchored" strategies, an arbitrageur cannot know how many of his peers
 are simultaneously entering the same trade. The second is leverage-when an
 arbitrageur chooses a privately optimal leverage ratio, he may create a
 fire-sale externality that raises the likelihood of a severe crash. In
 some cases, capital regulation may be helpful in dealing with the latter
 problem. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Why Are Buyouts Levered? The Financial Structure of Private Equity Funds 
Abstract:
 Private equity funds are important to the economy, yet there is little
 analysis explaining their financial structure. In our model the financial
 structure minimizes agency conflicts between fund managers and investors.
 Relative to financing each deal separately, raising a fund where the
 manager receives a fraction of aggregate excess returns reduces incentives
 to make bad investments. Efficiency is further improved by requiring funds
 to also use deal-by-deal debt financing, which becomes unavailable in
 states where internal discipline fails. Private equity investment becomes
 highly sensitive to aggregate credit conditions and investments in bad
 states outperform investments in good states. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Predictive Systems: Living with Imperfect Predictors 
Abstract:
 We develop a framework for estimating expected returns-a&ensp;"predictive
 system"-that allows predictors to be imperfectly correlated with the
 conditional expected return. When predictors are imperfect, the estimated
 expected return depends on past returns in a manner that hinges on the
 correlation between unexpected returns and innovations in expected
 returns. We find empirically that prior beliefs about this correlation,
 which is most likely negative, substantially affect estimates of expected
 returns as well as various inferences about predictability, including
 assessments of a predictor's usefulness. Compared to standard predictive
 regressions, predictive systems deliver different expected returns with
 higher estimated precision. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Explicit versus Implicit Contracts: Evidence from CEO Employment Agreements 
Abstract:
 We report evidence on the determinants of whether the relationship between
 a firm and its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is governed by an explicit
 (written) or an implicit agreement. We find that fewer than half of the
 CEOs of S&P 500 firms have comprehensive explicit employment agreements.
 Consistent with contracting theory, explicit agreements are more likely to
 be observed and are likely to have a longer duration in situations in
 which the sustainability of the relationship is less certain and where the
 expected loss to the CEO is greater if the firm fails to honor the
 agreement. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Control Rights and Capital Structure: An Empirical Investigation 
Abstract:
 We show that incentive conflicts between firms and their creditors have a
 large impact on corporate debt policy. Net debt issuing activity
 experiences a sharp and persistent decline following debt covenant
 violations, when creditors use their acceleration and termination rights
 to increase interest rates and reduce the availability of credit. The
 effect of creditor actions on debt policy is strongest when the borrower's
 alternative sources of finance are costly. In addition, despite the less
 favorable terms offered by existing creditors, borrowers rarely switch
 lenders following a violation. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Agency Problems at Dual-Class Companies 
Abstract:
 Using a sample of U.S. dual-class companies, we examine how divergence
 between insider voting and cash flow rights affects managerial extraction
 of private benefits of control. We find that as this divergence widens,
 corporate cash holdings are worth less to outside shareholders, CEOs
 receive higher compensation, managers make shareholder value-destroying
 acquisitions more often, and capital expenditures contribute less to
 shareholder value. These findings support the agency hypothesis that
 managers with greater excess control rights over cash flow rights are more
 prone to pursue private benefits at shareholders' expense, and help
 explain why firm value is decreasing in insider excess control rights. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: The Corporate Propensity to Save 
Abstract:
 Why do corporations accumulate liquid assets? We show theoretically that
 intertemporal trade-offs between interest income taxation and the cost of
 external finance determine optimal savings. Intriguingly, we find that,
 controlling for Tobin's&ensp;"q", saving and cash flow are negatively
 related because firms lower cash reserves to invest after receiving
 positive cash-flow shocks, and vice versa. Consistent with theory, we
 estimate negative propensities to save out of cash flow. We also find that
 income uncertainty affects saving more than do external finance
 constraints. Therefore, contrary to previous evidence, saving propensities
 reflect too many forces to be used to measure external finance
 constraints. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Target Behavior and Financing: How Conclusive Is the Evidence? 
Abstract:
 The notion that firms have a debt ratio target that is a primary
 determinant of financing behavior is influential in finance. Yet, how
 definitive is the evidence? We address this issue by generating samples
 where financing is unrelated to a firm's current debt ratio or a target.
 We find that much of the available evidence in favor of target behavior
 based on leverage ratio changes can be reproduced for these samples. Taken
 together, our findings suggest that a number of existing tests of target
 behavior have no power to reject alternatives. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Analyzing the Tax Benefits from Employee Stock Options 
Abstract:
 Employees tend to exercise stock options when corporate taxable income is
 high, shifting corporate tax deductions to years with higher tax rates. If
 firms paid employees the same dollar value in wages instead of stock
 options, the average annual tax bill for large U.S. companies would
 increase by $12.6 million, or 9.8%. These direct tax benefits of options
 increase in the convexity of the tax function. In addition, profitable
 firms can realize indirect tax benefits because stock options increase
 debt capacity. Although tax minimization is probably not the main motive
 for option grants, firms with larger potential tax benefits grant more
 options. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Financially Constrained Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 We study the effect of financial constraints on risk and expected returns
 by extending the investment-based asset pricing framework to incorporate
 retained earnings, debt, costly equity, and collateral constraints on debt
 capacity. Quantitative results show that more financially constrained
 firms are riskier and earn higher expected stock returns than less
 financially constrained firms. Intuitively, by preventing firms from
 financing all desired investments, collateral constraints restrict the
 flexibility of firms in smoothing dividend streams in the face of
 aggregate shocks. The inflexibility mechanism also gives rise to a convex
 relation between market leverage and expected stock returns. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: First-Order Risk Aversion, Heterogeneity, and Asset Market Outcomes 
Abstract:
 We examine a wide range of two-date economies populated by heterogeneous
 agents with the most common forms of nonexpected utility preferences used
 in finance and macroeconomics. We demonstrate that the risk premium and
 the risk-free rate in these models are sensitive to ignoring
 heterogeneity. This follows because of endogenous withdrawal by
 nonexpected utility agents from the market for the risky asset. This
 finding is important precisely because these alternative preferences have
 frequently been proposed as possible resolutions to various asset pricing
 puzzles,&ensp;"and"&ensp;they have all been examined exclusively in a
 representative agent framework. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Who Gambles in the Stock Market? 
Abstract:
 This study shows that the propensity to gamble and investment decisions
 are correlated. At the aggregate level, individual investors prefer stocks
 with lottery features, and like lottery demand, the demand for
 lottery-type stocks increases during economic downturns. In the
 cross-section, socioeconomic factors that induce greater expenditure in
 lotteries are associated with greater investment in lottery-type stocks.
 Further, lottery investment levels are higher in regions with favorable
 lottery environments. Because lottery-type stocks underperform,
 gambling-related underperformance is greater among low-income investors
 who excessively overweight lottery-type stocks. These results indicate
 that state lotteries and lottery-type stocks attract very similar
 socioeconomic clienteles. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Rewriting History 
Abstract:
 We document widespread changes to the historical I/B/E/S analyst stock
 recommendations database. Across seven I/B/E/S downloads, obtained between
 2000 and 2007, we find that between 6,580 (1.6%) and 97,582 (21.7%) of
 matched observations are different from one download to the next. The
 changes include alterations of recommendations, additions and deletions of
 records, and removal of analyst names. These changes are nonrandom,
 clustering by analyst reputation, broker size and status, and
 recommendation boldness, and affect trading signal classifications and
 back-tests of three stylized facts: profitability of trading signals,
 profitability of consensus recommendation changes, and persistence in
 individual analyst stock-picking ability. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.
