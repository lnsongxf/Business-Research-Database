Title: Why Do U.S. Firms Hold So Much More Cash than They Used To? 
Abstract:
 The average cash-to-assets ratio for U.S. industrial firms more than
 doubles from 1980 to 2006. A measure of the economic importance of this
 increase is that at the end of the sample period, the average firm can
 retire all debt obligations with its cash holdings. Cash ratios increase
 because firms' cash flows become riskier. In addition, firms change: They
 hold fewer inventories and receivables and are increasingly R&D intensive.
 While the precautionary motive for cash holdings plays an important role
 in explaining the increase in cash ratios, we find no consistent evidence
 that agency conflicts contribute to the increase. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Media Coverage and the Cross-section of Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 By reaching a broad population of investors, mass media can alleviate
 informational frictions and affect security pricing even if it does not
 supply genuine news. We investigate this hypothesis by studying the
 cross-sectional relation between media coverage and expected stock
 returns. We find that stocks with no media coverage earn higher returns
 than stocks with high media coverage even after controlling for well-known
 risk factors. These results are more pronounced among small stocks and
 stocks with high individual ownership, low analyst following, and high
 idiosyncratic volatility. Our findings suggest that the breadth of
 information dissemination affects stock returns. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Credit Contagion from Counterparty Risk 
Abstract:
 Standard credit risk models cannot explain the observed clustering of
 default, sometimes described as "credit contagion." This paper provides
 the first empirical analysis of credit contagion via direct counterparty
 effects. We find that bankruptcy announcements cause negative abnormal
 equity returns and increases in CDS spreads for creditors. In addition,
 creditors with large exposures are more likely to suffer from financial
 distress later. This suggests that counterparty risk is a potential
 additional channel of credit contagion. Indeed, the fear of counterparty
 defaults among financial institutions explains the sudden worsening of the
 credit crisis after the Lehman bankruptcy in September 2008. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Frailty Correlated Default 
Abstract:
 The probability of extreme default losses on portfolios of U.S. corporate
 debt is much greater than would be estimated under the standard assumption
 that default correlation arises only from exposure to observable risk
 factors. At the high confidence levels at which bank loan portfolio and
 collateralized debt obligation (CDO) default losses are typically measured
 for economic capital and rating purposes, conventionally based loss
 estimates are downward biased by a full order of magnitude on test
 portfolios. Our estimates are based on U.S. public nonfinancial firms
 between 1979 and 2004. We find strong evidence for the presence of common
 latent factors, even when controlling for observable factors that provide
 the most accurate available model of firm-by-firm default probabilities. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Attracting Flows by Attracting Big Clients 
Abstract:
 We explore a new channel for attracting inflows using a unique data set of
 corporate 401(k) retirement plans and their mutual fund family trustees.
 Families secure substantial inflows by being named trustee. We find that
 family trustees significantly overweight, and are reluctant to sell, their
 401(k) client firm's stock. Trustee overweighting is more pronounced when
 the relationship is more valuable to the trustee family, and is
 concentrated in those funds receiving the greatest benefit from the
 inflows. We quantify this flow benefit and find that inclusion in the
 401(k) plan has an economically and statistically large, positive effect
 on inflows. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: The Relation between Price and Performance in the Mutual Fund Industry 
Abstract:
 Gruber (1996) drew attention to the puzzle that
 investors buy actively managed equity mutual funds, even though on average
 such funds underperform index funds. We uncover another puzzling fact
 about the market for equity mutual funds: Funds with worse before-fee
 performance charge higher fees. This negative relation between fees and
 performance is robust and can be explained as the outcome of strategic
 fee-setting by mutual funds in the presence of investors with different
 degrees of sensitivity to performance. We also find some evidence that
 better fund governance may bring fees more in line with performance. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Business Networks, Corporate Governance, and Contracting in the Mutual Fund Industry 
Abstract:
 Business connections can mitigate agency conflicts by facilitating
 efficient information transfers, but can also be channels for inefficient
 favoritism. I analyze these two effects in the mutual fund industry and
 find that fund directors and advisory firms that manage the funds hire
 each other preferentially based on the intensity of their past
 interactions. I do not find evidence that stronger board-advisor ties
 correspond to better or worse outcomes for fund shareholders. These
 results suggest that the two effects of board-management connections on
 investor welfare-improved monitoring and increased potential for
 collusion-balance out in this setting. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Role of Managerial Incentives and Discretion in Hedge Fund Performance 
Abstract:
 Using a comprehensive hedge fund database, we examine the role of
 managerial incentives and discretion in hedge fund performance. Hedge
 funds with greater managerial incentives, proxied by the delta of the
 option-like incentive fee contracts, higher levels of managerial
 ownership, and the inclusion of high-water mark provisions in the
 incentive contracts, are associated with superior performance. The
 incentive fee percentage rate by itself does not explain performance. We
 also find that funds with a higher degree of managerial discretion,
 proxied by longer lockup, notice, and redemption periods, deliver superior
 performance. These results are robust to using alternative performance
 measures and controlling for different data-related biases. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Do Hedge Fund Managers Misreport Returns? Evidence from the Pooled Distribution 
Abstract:
 We find a significant discontinuity in the pooled distribution of monthly
 hedge fund returns: The number of small gains far exceeds the number of
 small losses. The discontinuity is present in live and defunct funds, and
 funds of all ages, suggesting that it is not caused by database biases.
 The discontinuity is absent in the 3 months culminating in an audit,
 suggesting it is not attributable to skillful loss avoidance. The
 discontinuity disappears when using bimonthly returns, indicating a
 reversal in fund performance following small gains. This result suggests
 that the discontinuity is caused at least in part by temporarily
 overstated returns. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Driven to Distraction: Extraneous Events and Underreaction to Earnings News 
Abstract:
 Recent studies propose that limited investor attention causes market
 underreactions. This paper directly tests this explanation by measuring
 the information load faced by investors. The  "investor distraction
 hypothesis"  holds that extraneous news inhibits market reactions to
 relevant news. We find that the immediate price and volume reaction to a
 firm's earnings surprise is much weaker, and post-announcement drift much
 stronger, when a greater number of same-day earnings announcements are
 made by other firms. We evaluate the economic importance of distraction
 effects through a trading strategy, which yields substantial alphas.
 Industry-unrelated news and large earnings surprises have a stronger
 distracting effect. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Getting Out Early: An Analysis of Market Making Activity at the Recommending Analyst's Firm 
Abstract:
 This paper examines trading volume for Nasdaq market makers around analyst
 recommendation changes issued by an analyst at the same firm. Using Nasdaq
 PostData, we find a disproportionate increase in market making volume
 associated with the firm's recommendation changes and evidence of elevated
 sell volume at the recommending analyst's firm in the 2 days preceding a
 downgrade. The implications are that the information source matters in
 determining the placement of trades and that the issuing analyst's firm
 appears to be rewarded for prereleasing information through increased
 volume. These findings constitute new evidence of compensation for
 research production through the market making channel. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Making Sense of Cents: An Examination of Firms That Marginally Miss or Beat Analyst Forecasts 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the performance consequences of cutting discretionary
 expenditures and managing accruals to exceed analyst forecasts. We show
 that firms that just beat analyst forecasts with low quality earnings
 exhibit a short-term stock price benefit relative to firms that miss
 forecasts with high quality earnings. This trend, however, reverses over a
 3-year horizon. Additionally, firms reducing discretionary expenditures to
 beat forecasts have significantly greater equity issuances and insider
 selling in the following year, consistent with managers understanding the
 myopic nature of their actions. Our results confirm survey evidence
 suggesting managers engage in myopic behavior to beat benchmarks. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Electing Directors 
Abstract:
 Using a large sample of director elections, we document that shareholder
 votes are significantly related to firm performance, governance, director
 performance, and voting mechanisms. However, most variables, except
 meeting attendance and ISS recommendations, have little economic impact on
 shareholder votes-even poorly performing directors and firms typically
 receive over 90% of votes cast. Nevertheless, fewer votes lead to lower
 "abnormal" CEO compensation and a higher probability of removing poison
 pills, classified boards, and CEOs. Meanwhile, director votes have little
 impact on election outcomes, firm performance, or director reputation.
 These results provide important benchmarks for the current debate on
 election reforms. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.
