Title: Product Market Competition, Insider Trading, and Stock Market Efficiency 
Abstract:
 How does competition in firms' product markets influence their behavior in
 equity markets? Do product market imperfections spread to equity markets?
 We examine these questions in a noisy rational expectations model in which
 firms operate under monopolistic competition while their shares trade in
 perfectly competitive markets. Firms use their monopoly power to pass on
 shocks to customers, thereby insulating their profits. This encourages
 stock trading, expedites the capitalization of private information into
 stock prices and improves the allocation of capital. Several implications
 are derived and tested. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Real and Financial Industry Booms and Busts 
Abstract:
 We examine how product market competition affects firm cash flows and
 stock returns in industry booms and busts. Our results show how real and
 financial factors interact in industry business cycles. In competitive
 industries, we find that high industry-level stock market valuation,
 investment, and financing are followed by sharply lower operating cash
 flows and abnormal stock returns. Analyst estimates are positively biased
 and returns comove more. In concentrated industries these relations are
 weak and generally insignificant. Our results are consistent with
 participants in competitive industries not fully internalizing the
 negative externality of industry competition on cash flows and stock
 returns. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Global Currency Hedging 
Abstract:
 Over the period 1975 to 2005, the U.S. dollar (particularly in relation to
 the Canadian dollar), the euro, and the Swiss franc (particularly in the
 second half of the period) moved against world equity markets. Thus, these
 currencies should be attractive to risk-minimizing global equity investors
 despite their low average returns. The risk-minimizing currency strategy
 for a global bond investor is close to a full currency hedge, with a
 modest long position in the U.S. dollar. There is little evidence that
 risk-minimizing investors should adjust their currency positions in
 response to movements in interest differentials. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: A Habit-Based Explanation of the Exchange Rate Risk Premium 
Abstract:
 This paper presents a model that reproduces the uncovered interest rate
 parity puzzle. Investors have preferences with external habits.
 Countercyclical risk premia and procyclical real interest rates arise
 endogenously. During bad times at home, when domestic consumption is close
 to the habit level, the representative investor is very risk averse. When
 the domestic investor is more risk averse than her foreign counterpart,
 the exchange rate is closely tied to domestic consumption growth shocks.
 The domestic investor therefore expects a positive currency excess return.
 Because interest rates are low in bad times, expected currency excess
 returns increase with interest rate differentials. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Collateral Spread and Financial Development 
Abstract:
 We show that institutions that promote financial development ease
 borrowing constraints by lowering the collateral spread and shifting the
 composition of acceptable collateral towards firm-specific assets.
 Collateral spread is defined as the difference in collateralization rates
 between high- and low-risk borrowers. The average collateral spread is
 large but declines rapidly with improvements in financial development
 driven by stronger institutions. We also show that the composition of
 collateralizable assets shifts towards non-specific assets (e.g., land)
 with borrower risk. However, the shift is considerably smaller in
 developed financial markets, enabling risky borrowers to use a larger
 variety of assets as collateral. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: False Discoveries in Mutual Fund Performance: Measuring Luck in Estimated Alphas 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a simple technique that controls for "false
 discoveries," or mutual funds that exhibit significant alphas by luck
 alone. Our approach precisely separates funds into (1) unskilled, (2)
 zero-alpha, and (3) skilled funds, even with dependencies in cross-fund
 estimated alphas. We find that 75% of funds exhibit zero alpha (net of
 expenses), consistent with the Berk and Green equilibrium. Further, we
 find a significant proportion of skilled (positive alpha) funds prior to
 1996, but almost none by 2006. We also show that controlling for false
 discoveries substantially improves the ability to find the few funds with
 persistent performance. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Do Hot Hands Exist among Hedge Fund Managers? An Empirical Evaluation 
Abstract:
 In measuring performance persistence, we use hedge fund style benchmarks.
 This allows us to identify managers with valuable skills, and also to
 control for option-like features inherent in returns from hedge fund
 strategies. We take into account the possibility that reported asset
 values may be based on stale prices. We develop a statistical model that
 relates a hedge fund's performance to its decision to liquidate or close
 in order to infer the performance of a hedge fund that left the database.
 Although we find significant performance persistence among superior funds,
 we find little evidence of persistence among inferior funds. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Stock Market Declines and Liquidity 
Abstract:
 Consistent with recent theoretical models where binding capital
 constraints lead to sudden liquidity dry-ups, we find that negative market
 returns decrease stock liquidity, especially during times of tightness in
 the funding market. The asymmetric effect of changes in aggregate asset
 values on liquidity and commonality in liquidity cannot be fully explained
 by changes in demand for liquidity or volatility effects. We document
 interindustry spillover effects in liquidity, which are likely to arise
 from capital constraints in the market making sector. We also find
 economically significant returns to supplying liquidity following periods
 of large drops in market valuations. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Time Variation in Liquidity: The Role of Market-Maker Inventories and Revenues 
Abstract:
 We show that market-maker balance sheet and income statement variables
 explain time variation in liquidity, suggesting liquidity-supplier
 financing constraints matter. Using 11 years of NYSE specialist inventory
 positions and trading revenues, we find that aggregate market-level and
 specialist firm-level spreads widen when specialists have large positions
 or lose money. The effects are nonlinear and most prominent when
 inventories are big or trading results have been particularly poor. These
 sensitivities are smaller after specialist firm mergers, consistent with
 deep pockets easing financing constraints. Finally, compared to low
 volatility stocks, the liquidity of high volatility stocks is more
 sensitive to inventories and losses. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: The Impact of Deregulation and Financial Innovation on Consumers: The Case of the Mortgage Market 
Abstract:
 We develop a technique to assess the impact of changes in mortgage markets
 on households, exploiting an implication of the permanent income
 hypothesis: The higher a household's expected future income, the higher
 its desired consumption, ceteris paribus. With perfect credit markets,
 desired consumption matches actual consumption and current spending
 forecasts future income. Because credit market imperfections mute this
 effect, the extent to which house spending predicts future income measures
 the "imperfectness" of mortgage markets. Using micro-data, we find that
 since the early 1980s, mortgage markets have become less imperfect in this
 sense, and securitization has played an important role. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Individualism and Momentum around the World 
Abstract:
 This paper examines how cultural differences influence the returns of
 momentum strategies. Cross-country cultural differences are measured with
 an individualism index developed by <link rid="b32">Hofstede
 (2001)</link>, which is related to overconfidence and self-attribution
 bias. We find that individualism is positively associated with trading
 volume and volatility, as well as to the magnitude of momentum profits.
 Momentum profits are also positively related to analyst forecast
 dispersion, transaction costs, and the familiarity of the market to
 foreigners, and negatively related to firm size and volatility. However,
 the addition of these and other variables does not dampen the relation
 between individualism and momentum profits. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.

Title: Correlation Risk and Optimal Portfolio Choice 
Abstract:
 We develop a new framework for multivariate intertemporal portfolio choice
 that allows us to derive optimal portfolio implications for economies in
 which the degree of correlation across industries, countries, or asset
 classes is stochastic. Optimal portfolios include distinct hedging
 components against both stochastic volatility and correlation risk. We
 find that the hedging demand is typically larger than in univariate
 models, and it includes an economically significant covariance hedging
 component, which tends to increase with the persistence of
 variance-covariance shocks, the strength of leverage effects, the
 dimension of the investment opportunity set, and the presence of portfolio
 constraints. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association.
