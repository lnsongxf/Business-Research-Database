Title: The Variability of IPO Initial Returns 
Abstract:
 The monthly volatility of IPO initial returns is substantial, fluctuates
 dramatically over time, and is considerably larger during "hot" IPO
 markets. Consistent with IPO theory, the volatility of initial returns is
 higher for firms that are more difficult to value because of higher
 information asymmetry. Our findings highlight underwriters' difficulty in
 valuing companies characterized by high uncertainty, and raise serious
 questions about the efficacy of the traditional firm-commitment IPO
 process. One implication of our results is that alternate mechanisms, such
 as auctions, could be beneficial for firms that value price discovery over
 the auxiliary services provided by underwriters. Copyright (c) 2010 The American Finance Association.

Title: Levered Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper revisits the theoretical relation between financial leverage
 and stock returns in a dynamic world where both corporate investment and
 financing decisions are endogenous. We find that the link between leverage
 and stock returns is more complex than static textbook examples suggest,
 and depends on the investment opportunities available to the firm. In the
 presence of financial market imperfections, leverage and investment are
 generally correlated so that highly levered firms are also mature firms
 with relatively more (safe) book assets and fewer (risky) growth
 opportunities. A quantitative version of our model matches several
 stylized facts about leverage and returns. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: The New Game in Town: Competitive Effects of IPOs 
Abstract:
 We analyze the effect of initial public offerings (IPOs) on industry
 competitors and provide evidence that companies experience negative stock
 price reactions to completed IPOs in their industry and positive stock
 price reactions to their withdrawal. Following a successful IPO in their
 industry, they show significant deterioration in their operating
 performance. These results are consistent with the existence of
 IPO-related competitive advantages through the loosening of financial
 constraints, financial intermediary certification, and the presence of
 knowledge capital. These aspects of competitiveness are significant in
 explaining the cross-section of underperformance as well as survival
 probabilities for competing firms. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Financial Structure, Acquisition Opportunities, and Firm Locations 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the relation between firms' locations and their
 corporate finance decisions. We develop a model where being located within
 an industry cluster increases opportunities to make acquisitions, and to
 facilitate those acquisitions, firms within clusters maintain more
 financial slack. Consistent with our model we find that firms located
 within industry clusters make more acquisitions, and have lower debt
 ratios and larger cash balances than their industry peers located outside
 clusters. We also document that firms in high-tech cities and growing
 cities maintain more financial slack. Overall, the evidence suggests that
 growth opportunities influence firms' financial decisions. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Taxes on Tax-Exempt Bonds 
Abstract:
 Implicit tax rates priced in the cross section of municipal bonds are
 approximately two to three times as high as statutory income tax rates,
 with implicit tax rates close to 100% using retail trades and above 70%
 for interdealer trades. These implied tax rates can be identified because
 a portion of secondary market municipal bond trades involves income taxes.
 After valuing the tax payments, market discount bonds, which carry income
 tax liabilities, trade at yields around 25 basis points higher than
 comparable municipal bonds not subject to any taxes. The high
 sensitivities of municipal bond prices to tax rates can be traced to
 individual retail traders dominating dealers and other institutions. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Do Bonds Span Volatility Risk in the U.S. Treasury Market? A Specification Test for Affine Term Structure Models 
Abstract:
 We propose using model-free yield quadratic variation measures computed
 from intraday data as a tool for specification testing and selection of
 dynamic term structure models. We find that the yield curve fails to span
 realized yield volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, as the systematic
 volatility factors are largely unrelated to the cross-section of yields.
 We conclude that a broad class of affine diffusive, quadratic Gaussian,
 and affine jump-diffusive models cannot accommodate the observed yield
 volatility dynamics. Hence, the Treasury market per se is incomplete, as
 yield volatility risk cannot be hedged solely through Treasury securities. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Personal Bankruptcy and Credit Market Competition 
Abstract:
 We document a link between U.S. credit supply and rising personal
 bankruptcy rates. We exploit the exogenous variation in market
 contestability brought on by banking deregulation-the relaxation of entry
 restrictions in the 1980s and 1990s-at the state level. We find
 deregulation explains at least 10% of the rise in bankruptcy rates. We
 also find that deregulation leads to increased lending, lower loss rates
 on loans, and higher lending productivity. Our findings indicate that
 increased competition prompted banks to adopt sophisticated credit rating
 technology, allowing for new credit extension to existing and previously
 excluded households. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Corporate Political Contributions and Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 We develop a new and comprehensive database of firm-level contributions to
 U.S. political campaigns from 1979 to 2004. We construct variables that
 measure the extent of firm support for candidates. We find that these
 measures are positively and significantly correlated with the
 cross-section of future returns. The effect is strongest for firms that
 support a greater number of candidates that hold office in the same state
 that the firm is based. In addition, there are stronger effects for firms
 whose contributions are slanted toward House candidates and Democrats. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: The Interdependent and Intertemporal Nature of Financial Decisions: An Application to Cash Flow Sensitivities 
Abstract:
 We develop a dynamic multiequation model where firms make financing and
 investment decisions jointly subject to the constraint that sources must
 equal uses of cash. We argue that static models of financial decisions
 produce inconsistent coefficient estimates, and that models that do not
 acknowledge the interdependence among decision variables produce
 inefficient estimates and provide an incomplete and potentially misleading
 view of financial behavior. We use our model to examine whether firms are
 constrained from accessing capital markets. Unlike static single-equation
 studies that find firms underinvest given cash flow shortfalls, we
 conclude that firms maintain investment by borrowing. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Performance and Persistence in Institutional Investment Management 
Abstract:
 Using new, survivorship bias-free data, we examine the performance and
 persistence in performance of 4,617 active domestic equity institutional
 products managed by 1,448 investment management firms between 1991 and
 2008. Controlling for the <link rid="b18">Fama-French (1993)</link> three
 factors and momentum, aggregate and average estimates of alphas are
 statistically indistinguishable from zero. Even though there is
 considerable heterogeneity in performance, there is only modest evidence
 of persistence in three-factor models and little to none in four-factor
 models. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.
