Title: Information and Incentives Inside the Firm: Evidence from Loan Officer Rotation 
Abstract:
 We present evidence that reassigning tasks among agents can alleviate
 moral hazard in communication. A rotation policy that routinely reassigns
 loan officers to borrowers of a commercial bank affects the officers'
 reporting behavior. When an officer anticipates rotation, reports are more
 accurate and contain more bad news about the borrower's repayment
 prospects. As a result, the rotation policy makes bank lending decisions
 more sensitive to officer reports. The threat of rotation improves
 communication because self-reporting bad news has a smaller negative
 effect on an officer's career prospects than bad news exposed by a
 successor. Copyright (c) 2010 The American Finance Association.

Title: Networking as a Barrier to Entry and the Competitive Supply of Venture Capital 
Abstract:
 We examine whether strong networks among incumbent venture capitalists
 (VCs) in local markets help restrict entry by outside VCs, thus improving
 incumbents' bargaining power over entrepreneurs. More densely networked
 markets experience less entry, with a one-standard deviation increase in
 network ties among incumbents reducing entry by approximately one-third.
 Entrants with established ties to target-market incumbents appear able to
 overcome this barrier to entry; in turn, incumbents react strategically to
 an increased threat of entry by freezing out any incumbents who facilitate
 entry into their market. Incumbents appear to benefit from reduced entry
 by paying lower prices for their deals. Copyright (c) 2010 The American Finance Association.

Title: Does Credit Competition Affect Small-Firm Finance? 
Abstract:
 While relaxation of geographical restrictions on bank expansion permitted
 banking organizations to expand across state lines, it allowed states to
 erect barriers to branch expansion. These differences in states' branching
 restrictions affect credit supply. In states more open to branching, small
 firms borrow at interest rates 80 to 100 basis points lower than firms
 operating in less open states. Firms in open states also are more likely
 to borrow from banks. Despite this evidence that interstate branch
 openness expands credit supply, we find "no effect" of variation
 in state restrictions on branching on the amount that small firms borrow. Copyright (c) 2010 The American Finance Association.

Title: Human Capital, Bankruptcy, and Capital Structure 
Abstract:
 We derive the optimal labor contract for a levered firm in an economy with
 perfectly competitive capital and labor markets. Employees become
 entrenched under this contract and so face large human costs of
 bankruptcy. The firm's optimal capital structure therefore depends on the
 trade-off between these human costs and the tax benefits of debt. Optimal
 debt levels consistent with those observed in practice emerge without
 relying on frictions such as moral hazard or asymmetric information.
 Consistent with empirical evidence, persistent idiosyncratic differences
 in leverage across firms also result. In addition, wages should have
 explanatory power for firm leverage. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Stapled Finance 
Abstract:
 "Stapled finance" is a loan commitment arranged by a seller in an M&A
 setting. Whoever wins the bidding contest has the option (not the
 obligation) to accept this loan commitment. We show that stapled finance
 increases bidding competition by subsidizing weak bidders, who raise their
 bids and thereby the price that strong bidders (who are more likely to
 win) must pay. The lender expects not to break even and must be
 compensated for offering the loan. This reduces but does not eliminate the
 seller's benefit. It also implies that stapled finance loans will show
 poorer performance than other buyout loans. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Cash Holdings and Corporate Diversification 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the relation between corporate liquidity and
 diversification. The key finding is that multidivision firms hold
 significantly less cash than stand-alone firms because they are
 diversified in their investment opportunities. Lower cross-divisional
 correlations in investment opportunity and higher correlations between
 investment opportunity and cash flow correspond to lower cash holdings,
 even after controlling for cash flow volatility. The effects are strongest
 in financially constrained firms and in well-governed firms, and
 correspond to efficient fund transfers from low- to high-productivity
 divisions. Taken together, these results bring forth an efficient link
 between diversification and corporate liquidity. Copyright (c) 2010 The American Finance Association.

Title: A Gap-Filling Theory of Corporate Debt Maturity Choice 
Abstract:
 We argue that time variation in the maturity of corporate debt arises
 because firms behave as macro liquidity providers, absorbing the supply
 shocks associated with changes in the maturity structure of government
 debt. We document that when the government funds itself with more
 short-term debt, firms fill the resulting gap by issuing more long-term
 debt, and vice versa. This type of liquidity provision is undertaken more
 aggressively: (1) when the ratio of government debt to total debt is
 higher and (2) by firms with stronger balance sheets. Our theory sheds new
 light on market timing phenomena in corporate finance more generally. Copyright (c) 2010 The American Finance Association.

Title: The Political Economy of Financial Regulation: Evidence from U.S. State Usury Laws in the 19th Century 
Abstract:
 Financial regulation was as hotly debated a political issue in the 19th
 century as it is today. We study the political economy of state usury laws
 in 19th century America. Exploiting the wide variation in regulation,
 enforcement, and economic conditions across states and time, we find that
 usury laws when binding reduce credit and economic activity, especially
 for smaller firms. We examine the motives of regulation and find that
 usury laws coincide with other economic and political policies favoring
 wealthy political incumbents, particularly when they have more voting
 power. The evidence suggests financial regulation is driven by private
 interests capturing rents from others rather than public interests
 protecting the underserved. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Risk and the Corporate Structure of Banks 
Abstract:
 We identify different sources of risk as important determinants of banks'
 corporate structures when expanding into new markets. Subsidiary-based
 corporate structures benefit from greater protection against economic risk
 because of affiliate-level limited liability, but are more exposed to the
 risk of capital expropriation than are branches. Thus, branch-based
 structures are preferred to subsidiary-based structures when expropriation
 risk is high relative to economic risk, and vice versa. Greater
 cross-country risk correlation and more accurate pricing of risk by
 investors reduce the differences between the two structures. Furthermore,
 a bank's corporate structure affects its risk taking and affiliate size. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Financial Strength and Product Market Behavior: The Real Effects of Corporate Cash Holdings 
Abstract:
 This paper shows that large cash reserves lead to systematic future market
 share gains at the expense of industry rivals. Using shifts in import
 tariffs to identify exogenous intensification of competition,
 difference-in-difference estimations support the&ensp;"causal"&ensp;impact
 of cash on product market performance. Moreover, the analysis reveals that
 the "competitive" effect of cash is markedly distinct from the strategic
 effect of debt on product market outcomes. This effect is stronger when
 rivals face tighter financing constraints and when the number of
 interactions between competitors is large. Overall, the results suggest
 that cash policy encompasses a substantial strategic dimension. Copyright (c) 2010 The American Finance Association.

Title: Executive Compensation and the Maturity Structure of Corporate Debt 
Abstract:
 Executive compensation influences managerial risk preferences through
 executives' portfolio sensitivities to changes in stock prices (delta) and
 stock return volatility (vega). Large deltas discourage managerial
 risk-taking, while large vegas encourage risk-taking. Theory suggests that
 short-maturity debt mitigates agency costs of debt by constraining
 managerial risk preferences. We posit and find evidence of a negative
 (positive) relation between CEO portfolio deltas (vegas) and
 short-maturity debt. We also find that short-maturity debt mitigates the
 influence of vega- and delta-related incentives on bond yields. Overall,
 our empirical evidence shows that short-term debt mitigates agency costs
 of debt arising from compensation risk. Copyright (c) 2010 The American Finance Association.

Title: The Effect of SOX Section 404: Costs, Earnings Quality, and Stock Prices 
Abstract:
 This paper exploits a natural quasi-experiment to isolate the effects that
 were uniquely due to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX): U.S. firms with a
 public float under $75 million could delay Section 404 compliance, and
 foreign firms under $700 million could delay the auditor's attestation
 requirement. As designed, Section 404 led to conservative reported
 earnings, but also imposed real costs. On net, SOX compliance reduced the
 market value of small firms. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Capital Structure as a Strategic Variable: Evidence from Collective Bargaining 
Abstract:
 I analyze the strategic use of debt financing to improve a firm's
 bargaining position with an important supplier-organized labor. Because
 maintaining high levels of corporate liquidity can encourage workers to
 raise their wage demands, a firm with external finance constraints has an
 incentive to use the cash flow demands of debt service to improve its
 bargaining position with workers. Using both firm-level collective
 bargaining coverage and state changes in labor laws to identify changes in
 union bargaining power, I show that strategic incentives from union
 bargaining appear to have a substantial impact on corporate financing
 decisions. Copyright (c) 2010 The American Finance Association.
