Title: Presidential Address: Asset Price Dynamics with Slow-Moving Capital 
Abstract:
 I describe asset price dynamics caused by the slow movement of investment
 capital to trading opportunities. The pattern of price responses to supply
 or demand shocks typically involves a sharp reaction to the shock and a
 subsequent and more extended reversal. The amplitude of the immediate
 price impact and the pattern of the subsequent recovery can reflect
 institutional impediments to immediate trade, such as search costs for
 trading counterparties or time to raise capital by intermediaries. I
 discuss special impediments to capital formation during the recent
 financial crisis that caused asset price distortions, which subsided
 afterward. After presenting examples of price reactions to supply shocks
 in normal market settings, I offer a simple illustrative model of price
 dynamics associated with slow-moving capital due to the presence of
 inattentive investors. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Disagreement and Learning: Dynamic Patterns of Trade 
Abstract:
 The empirical evidence on investor disagreement and trading volume is
 difficult to reconcile in standard rational expectations models. We
 develop a dynamic model in which investors disagree about the
 interpretation of public information. We obtain a closed-form linear
 equilibrium that allows us to study which restrictions on the disagreement
 process yield empirically observed volume and return dynamics. We show
 that when investors have infrequent but major disagreements, there is
 positive autocorrelation in volume and positive correlation between volume
 and volatility. We also derive novel empirical predictions that relate the
 degree and frequency of disagreement to volume and volatility dynamics. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Generalized Disappointment Aversion and Asset Prices 
Abstract:
 We characterize generalized disappointment aversion (GDA) risk preferences
 that can overweight lower-tail outcomes relative to expected utility. We
 show in an endowment economy that recursive utility with GDA risk
 preferences generates effective risk aversion that is countercyclical.
 This feature comes from endogenous variation in the probability of
 disappointment in the representative agent's intertemporal
 consumption-saving problem that underlies the asset pricing model. The
 variation in effective risk aversion produces a large equity premium and a
 risk-free rate that is procyclical and has low volatility in an economy
 with a simple autoregressive endowment-growth process. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Information Quality and Long-Run Risk: Asset Pricing Implications 
Abstract:
 I study the asset pricing implications of the quality of public
 information about persistent productivity shocks in a general equilibrium
 model with Kreps-Porteus preferences. Low information quality is
 associated with a high equity premium, a low volatility of consumption
 growth, and a low volatility of the risk-free interest rate. The
 relationship between information quality and the equity premium differs
 from that in endowment economies. My calibration improves substantially
 upon the Bansal-Yaron model in terms of the moments of the
 wealth-consumption ratio and the return on aggregate wealth. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Intraday Patterns in the Cross-section of Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 Motivated by the literature on investment flows and optimal trading, we
 examine intraday predictability in the cross-section of stock returns. We
 find a striking pattern of return continuation at half-hour intervals that
 are exact multiples of a trading day, and this effect lasts for at least
 40 trading days. Volume, order imbalance, volatility, and bid-ask spreads
 exhibit similar patterns, but do not explain the return patterns. We also
 show that short-term return reversal is driven by temporary liquidity
 imbalances lasting less than an hour and bid-ask bounce. Timing trades can
 reduce execution costs by the equivalent of the effective spread. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Sell-Side School Ties 
Abstract:
 We study the impact of social networks on agents' ability to gather
 superior information about firms. Exploiting novel data on the educational
 background of sell-side analysts and senior corporate officers, we find
 that analysts outperform by up to 6.60% per year on their stock
 recommendations when they have an educational link to the company. Pre-Reg
 FD, this school-tie return premium is 9.36% per year, while post-Reg FD it
 is nearly zero. In contrast, in an environment that did not change
 selective disclosure regulation (the U.K.), the school-tie premium is
 large and significant over the entire sample period. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Predictive Regressions: A Present-Value Approach 
Abstract:
 We propose a latent variables approach within a present-value model to
 estimate the expected returns and expected dividend growth rates of the
 aggregate stock market. This approach aggregates information contained in
 the history of price-dividend ratios and dividend growth rates to predict
 future returns and dividend growth rates. We find that returns and
 dividend growth rates are predictable with&ensp;<formula
 format="inline"><file name="jofi_1575_mu1.gif" type="gif"
 /></formula>&ensp;values ranging from 8.2% to 8.9% for returns and 13.9%
 to 31.6% for dividend growth rates. Both expected returns and expected
 dividend growth rates have a persistent component, but expected returns
 are more persistent than expected dividend growth rates. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Do Limit Orders Alter Inferences about Investor Performance and Behavior? 
Abstract:
 Individual investors lose money around earnings announcements, experience
 poor posttrade returns, exhibit the disposition effect, and make
 contrarian trades. Using simulations and trading records of all individual
 investors in Finland, I find that these trading patterns can be explained
 in large part by investors' use of limit orders. These patterns arise
 mechanically because limit orders are price-contingent and suffer from
 adverse selection. Reverse causality from behavioral biases to order
 choices does not appear to explain my findings. I propose a simple method
 for measuring a data set's susceptibility to this limit order effect. Copyright (c) 2010 The American Finance Association.

Title: Why Do Foreign Firms Leave U.S. Equity Markets? 
Abstract:
 Foreign firms terminate their Securities and Exchange Commission
 registration in the aftermath of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) because they
 no longer require outside funds to finance growth opportunities.
 Deregistering firms' insiders benefit from greater discretion to consume
 private benefits without having to raise higher cost funds. Foreign firms
 with more agency problems have worse stock-price reactions to the adoption
 of Rule 12h-6 in 2007, which made deregistration easier, than those firms
 more adversely affected by the compliance costs of SOX. Stock-price
 reactions to deregistration announcements are negative, but less so under
 Rule 12h-6, and more so for firms that raise fewer funds externally. Copyright (c) 2010 The American Finance Association.

Title: Market Segmentation and Cross-predictability of Returns 
Abstract:
 We present evidence supporting the hypothesis that due to investor
 specialization and market segmentation, value-relevant information
 diffuses gradually in financial markets. Using the stock market as our
 setting, we find that (i) stocks that are in economically related supplier
 and customer industries cross-predict each other's returns, (ii) the
 magnitude of return cross-predictability declines with the number of
 informed investors in the market as proxied by the level of analyst
 coverage and institutional ownership, and (iii) changes in the stock
 holdings of institutional investors mirror the model trading behavior of
 informed investors. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Mutual Fund Incubation 
Abstract:
 Incubation is a strategy for initiating new funds, where multiple funds
 are started privately, and, at the end of an evaluation period, some are
 opened to the public. Consistent with incubation being used by fund
 families to increase performance and attract flows, funds in incubation
 outperform nonincubated funds by 3.5% risk-adjusted, and when they are
 opened to the public they attract higher flows. Postincubation, however,
 this outperformance disappears. This performance reversal imparts an
 upward bias to returns that is not removed by a fund size filter. Fund age
 and ticker creation date filters, however, eliminate the bias. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.
