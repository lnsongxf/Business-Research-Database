Title: Big Bad Banks? The Winners and Losers from Bank Deregulation in the United States 
Abstract:
 We assess the impact of bank deregulation on the distribution of income in
 the United States. From the 1970s through the 1990s, most states removed
 restrictions on intrastate branching, which intensified bank competition
 and improved bank performance. Exploiting the cross-state, cross-time
 variation in the timing of branch deregulation, we find that deregulation
 materially tightened the distribution of income by boosting incomes in the
 lower part of the income distribution while having little impact on
 incomes above the median. Bank deregulation tightened the distribution of
 income by increasing the relative wage rates and working hours of
 unskilled workers. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Price Discovery in Illiquid Markets: Do Financial Asset Prices Rise Faster Than They Fall? 
Abstract:
 We study price discovery in municipal bonds, an important OTC market. As
 in markets for consumer goods, prices "rise faster than they fall."
 Round-trip profits to dealers on retail trades increase in rising markets
 but do not decrease in falling markets. Further, effective half-spreads
 increase or decrease more when movements in fundamentals favor dealers.
 Yield spreads relative to Treasuries also adjust with asymmetric speed in
 rising and falling markets. Finally, intraday price dispersion is
 asymmetric in rising and falling markets, as consumer search theory would
 predict. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Exploring the Nature of "Trader Intuition" 
Abstract:
 Experimental evidence has consistently confirmed the ability of uninformed
 traders, even novices, to infer information from the trading process.
 After contrasting brain activation in subjects watching markets with and
 without insiders, we hypothesize that Theory of Mind (ToM) helps explain
 this pattern, where ToM refers to the human capacity to discern malicious
 or benevolent intent. We find that skill in predicting price changes in
 markets with insiders correlates with scores on two ToM tests. We document
 GARCH-like persistence in transaction price changes that may help
 investors read markets when there are insiders. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Genetic Variation in Financial Decision-Making 
Abstract:
 Individuals differ in how they construct their investment portfolios, yet
 empirical models of portfolio risk typically account only for a small
 portion of the cross-sectional variance. This paper asks whether genetic
 variation can explain some of these individual differences. Following a
 major pension reform Swedish adults had to form a portfolio from a large
 menu of funds. We match data on these investment decisions with the
 Swedish Twin Registry and find that approximately 25% of individual
 variation in portfolio risk is due to genetic variation. We also find that
 these results extend to several other aspects of financial
 decision-making. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Diversification and Its Discontents: Idiosyncratic and Entrepreneurial Risk in the Quest for Social Status 
Abstract:
 Social status concerns influence investors' decisions by driving a wedge
 in attitudes toward aggregate and idiosyncratic risks. I model such
 concerns by emphasizing the desire to "get ahead of the Joneses," which
 implies that aversion to idiosyncratic risk is lower than aversion to
 aggregate risk. The model predicts that investors hold concentrated
 portfolios in equilibrium, which helps rationalize the small premium for
 undiversified entrepreneurial risk. In the model, status concerns are more
 important for wealthier households. Consequently, these households own a
 disproportionate share of risky assets, particularly private equity, and
 experience greater volatility of consumption, consistent with empirical
 evidence. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Hedge Fund Contagion and Liquidity Shocks 
Abstract:
 Defining contagion as correlation over and above that expected from
 economic fundamentals, we find strong evidence of worst return contagion
 across hedge fund styles for 1990 to 2008. Large adverse shocks to asset
 and hedge fund liquidity strongly increase the probability of contagion.
 Specifically, large adverse shocks to credit spreads, the TED spread,
 prime broker and bank stock prices, stock market liquidity, and hedge fund
 flows are associated with a significant increase in the probability of
 hedge fund contagion. While shocks to liquidity are important determinants
 of performance, these shocks are not captured by commonly used models of
 hedge fund returns. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Microstructure and Ambiguity 
Abstract:
 A goal for stock exchanges is to increase participation by firms and
 investors. We show how specific features of the microstructure can reduce
 perceived ambiguity, and induce participation by both investors and
 issuers. We develop a model with sophisticated traders, who we view as
 expected utility maximizers with rational expectations, and
 unsophisticated traders, who we view as rational traders facing ambiguity
 about the payoffs to participating in the market. We show how designing
 markets to reduce ambiguity can benefit investors through greater
 liquidity, exchanges through greater volume, and issuing firms through a
 lower cost of capital. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: "Time for a Change": Loan Conditions and Bank Behavior when Firms Switch Banks 
Abstract:
 This paper studies loan conditions when firms switch banks. Recent
 theoretical work on bank-firm relationships motivates our matching models.
 The dynamic cycle of the loan rate that we uncover is as follows: a loan
 granted by a new (outside) bank carries a loan rate that is significantly
 lower than the rates on comparable new loans from the firm's current
 (inside) banks. The new bank initially decreases the loan rate further but
 eventually ratchets it up sharply. Other loan conditions follow a similar
 economically relevant pattern. This bank strategy is consistent with the
 existence of hold-up costs in bank-firm relationships. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Short Sellers and Financial Misconduct 
Abstract:
 We examine whether short sellers detect firms that misrepresent their
 financial statements, and whether their trading conveys external costs or
 benefits to other investors. Abnormal short interest increases steadily in
 the 19 months before the misrepresentation is publicly revealed,
 particularly when the misconduct is severe. Short selling is associated
 with a faster time-to-discovery, and it dampens the share price inflation
 that occurs when firms misstate their earnings. These results indicate
 that short sellers anticipate the eventual discovery and severity of
 financial misconduct. They also convey external benefits, helping to
 uncover misconduct and keeping prices closer to fundamental values. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Luck versus Skill in the Cross-Section of Mutual Fund Returns 
Abstract:
 The aggregate portfolio of actively managed U.S. equity mutual funds is
 close to the market portfolio, but the high costs of active management
 show up intact as lower returns to investors. Bootstrap simulations
 suggest that few funds produce benchmark-adjusted expected returns
 sufficient to cover their costs. If we add back the costs in fund expense
 ratios, there is evidence of inferior and superior performance (nonzero
 true &alpha;) in the extreme tails of the cross-section of mutual fund
 &alpha; estimates. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: A Bayesian Approach to Real Options: The Case of Distinguishing between Temporary and Permanent Shocks 
Abstract:
 Traditional real options models demonstrate the importance of the "option
 to wait" due to uncertainty over future shocks to project cash flows.
 However, there is often another important source of uncertainty:
 uncertainty over the permanence of past shocks. Adding Bayesian
 uncertainty over the permanence of past shocks augments the traditional
 option to wait with an additional "option to learn." The implied
 investment behavior differs significantly from that in standard models.
 For example, investment may occur at a time of stable or decreasing cash
 flows, respond sluggishly to cash flow shocks, and depend on the timing of
 project cash flows. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Individual Investors and Local Bias 
Abstract:
 The paper tests whether individuals have value-relevant information about
 local stocks (where "local" is defined as being headquartered near where
 an investor lives). Our methodology uses two types of calendar-time
 portfolios-one based on holdings and one based on transactions. Portfolios
 of local holdings do not generate abnormal performance (alphas are zero).
 When studying transactions, purchases of local stocks
 significantly&ensp;"underperform"&ensp;sales of local stocks. The
 underperformance remains when focusing on stocks with potentially high
 levels of information asymmetries. We conclude that individuals do not
 help incorporate information into stock prices. Our conclusions directly
 contradict existing studies. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.
