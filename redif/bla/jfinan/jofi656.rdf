Title: Sticks or Carrots? Optimal CEO Compensation when Managers Are Loss Averse 
Abstract:
 This paper analyzes optimal executive compensation contracts when managers
 are loss averse. We calibrate a stylized principal-agent model to the
 observed contracts of 595 CEOs and show that this model can explain
 observed option holdings and high base salaries remarkably well for a
 range of parameterizations. We also derive and calibrate the general shape
 of the optimal contract that is increasing and convex for medium and high
 outcomes and that drops discontinuously to the lowest possible payout for
 low outcomes. Finally, we identify the critical features of the
 loss-aversion model that render optimal contracts convex. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Why Are CEOs Rarely Fired? Evidence from Structural Estimation 
Abstract:
 I evaluate the forced CEO turnover rate and quantify effects on
 shareholder value by estimating a dynamic model. The model features
 learning about CEO ability and costly turnover. To fit the observed forced
 turnover rate, the model needs the average board of directors to behave as
 if replacing the CEO costs shareholders at least $200 million. This cost
 mainly reflects CEO entrenchment rather than a real cost to shareholders.
 The model predicts that shareholder value would rise 3% if we eliminated
 this perceived turnover cost, all else equal. The model also helps explain
 the relation between CEO firings, tenure, and profitability. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: The Cost of Debt 
Abstract:
 We use exogenous variation in tax benefit functions to estimate
 firm-specific cost of debt functions that are conditional on company
 characteristics such as collateral, size, and book-to-market. By
 integrating the area between the benefit and cost functions, we estimate
 that the equilibrium net benefit of debt is 3.5% of asset value, resulting
 from an estimated gross benefit (cost) of debt equal to 10.4% (6.9%) of
 asset value. We find that the cost of being overlevered is asymmetrically
 higher than the cost of being underlevered and that expected default costs
 constitute only half of the total ex ante costs of debt. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: The Net Benefits to Leverage 
Abstract:
 I estimate the market's valuation of the net benefits to leverage using
 panel data from 1994 to 2004, identified from market values and betas of a
 company's debt and equity. The median firm captures net benefits of up to
 5.5% of firm value. Small and profitable firms have high optimal leverage
 ratios, as predicted by theory, but in contrast to existing empirical
 evidence. Companies are on average slightly underlevered relative to the
 optimal leverage ratio at refinancing. This result is mainly due to zero
 leverage firms. I also look at implications for financial policy. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Macroeconomic Conditions and the Puzzles of Credit Spreads and Capital Structure 
Abstract:
 I build a dynamic capital structure model that demonstrates how business
 cycle variation in expected growth rates, economic uncertainty, and risk
 premia influences firms' financing policies. Countercyclical fluctuations
 in risk prices, default probabilities, and default losses arise
 endogenously through firms' responses to macroeconomic conditions. These
 comovements generate large credit risk premia for investment grade firms,
 which helps address the credit spread puzzle and the under-leverage puzzle
 in a unified framework. The model generates interesting dynamics for
 financing and defaults, including market timing in debt issuance and
 credit contagion. It also provides a novel procedure to estimate
 state-dependent default losses. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Who Blows the Whistle on Corporate Fraud? 
Abstract:
 To identify the most effective mechanisms for detecting corporate fraud,
 we study all reported fraud cases in large U.S. companies between 1996 and
 2004. We find that fraud detection does not rely on standard corporate
 governance actors (investors, SEC, and auditors), but rather takes a
 village, including several nontraditional players (employees, media, and
 industry regulators). Differences in access to information, as well as
 monetary and reputational incentives, help to explain this pattern.
 In-depth analyses suggest that reputational incentives in general are
 weak, except for journalists in large cases. By contrast, monetary
 incentives help explain employee whistleblowing. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Corporate Fraud and Business Conditions: Evidence from IPOs 
Abstract:
 We examine how a firm's incentive to commit fraud when going public varies
 with investor beliefs about industry business conditions. Fraud propensity
 increases with the level of investor beliefs about industry prospects but
 decreases when beliefs are extremely high. We find that two mechanisms are
 at work: monitoring by investors and short-term executive compensation,
 both of which vary with investor beliefs about industry prospects. We also
 find that monitoring incentives of investors and underwriters differ. Our
 results are consistent with models of investor beliefs and corporate
 fraud, and suggest that regulators and auditors should be vigilant for
 fraud during booms. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Collateral, Risk Management, and the Distribution of Debt Capacity 
Abstract:
 Collateral constraints imply that financing and risk management are
 fundamentally linked. The opportunity cost of engaging in risk management
 and conserving debt capacity to hedge future financing needs is forgone
 current investment, and is higher for more productive and less
 well-capitalized firms. More constrained firms engage in less risk
 management and may exhaust their debt capacity and abstain from risk
 management, consistent with empirical evidence and in contrast to received
 theory. When cash flows are low, such firms may be unable to seize
 investment opportunities and be forced to downsize. Consequently, capital
 may be less productively deployed in downturns. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Leverage Choice and Credit Spreads when Managers Risk Shift 
Abstract:
 We model the debt and asset risk choice of a manager with
 performance-insensitive pay (cash) and performance-sensitive pay (stock)
 to theoretically link compensation structure, leverage, and credit
 spreads. The model predicts that optimal leverage trades off the tax
 benefit of debt against the utility cost of ex-post asset substitution and
 that credit spreads are increasing in the ratio of cash-to-stock. Using a
 large cross-section of U.S.-based corporate credit default swaps (CDS)
 covering 2001 to 2006, we find a positive association between
 cash-to-stock and CDS rates, and between cash-to-stock and leverage
 ratios. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Lucky CEOs and Lucky Directors 
Abstract:
 We study the relation between opportunistic timing of option grants and
 corporate governance failures, focusing on "lucky" grants awarded at the
 lowest price of the grant month. Option grant practices were designed to
 provide lucky grants not only to executives but also to independent
 directors. Lucky grants to both CEOs and directors were the product of
 deliberate choices, not of firms' routines, and were timed to make them
 more profitable. Lucky grants are associated with higher CEO compensation
 from other sources, no majority of independent directors, no outside
 blockholder on the compensation committee, and a long-serving CEO. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.

Title: Managerial Legacies, Entrenchment, and Strategic Inertia 
Abstract:
 This paper argues that the legacy potential of a firm's strategy is an
 important determinant of CEO compensation, turnover, and strategy change.
 A legacy makes CEO replacement expensive, because firm performance can
 only partially be attributed to a newly employed manager. Boards may
 therefore optimally allow an incumbent to be entrenched. Moreover, when a
 firm changes strategy it is optimal to change the CEO, because the
 incumbent has a vested interest in seeing the new strategy fail. Even
 though CEOs have no specific skills in our model, legacy issues can
 explain the empirical association between CEO and strategy change. Copyright (c) 2010 the American Finance Association.
