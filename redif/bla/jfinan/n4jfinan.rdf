 Order Arrival, Quote Behavior, and the Return-Generating Process.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1035-48
Issue: 4
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper establishes three empirical results. The authors find positive
 autocorrelation in actual intraday stock returns, in intraday returns
 computed from quot e-midpoints, and in the arrival of buy and sell orders.
 They present a model of return generation which incorporates these
 features via la gged adjustment of the limit-order price and positive
 dependence in b id and ask transactions. The return model is
 observationally equivale nt to an ARMA process which is consistent with
 the observed return be havior.

 Maturity Intermediation and Intertemporal Lending Policies of Financial Intermediaries.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1023-34
Issue: 4
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The maturity mismatch problem faced by a risk-averse financial
 intermediary is modeled by dynamic programming with both fixed-rate,
 short-term, and variable-rate, long-term lending when the major source of
 risk in volves uncertain interest rates. The strategy of matching the
 maturit y of assets and liabilities is not generally optimum or even risk
 min imizing. This is due to the "built-in" hedge which the intermediary
 may have as a result of rolling over short-term loans while continui ng to
 finance long-term loans. Intertemporal dependencies in loan dem and or
 funding costs affect the optimal degree of maturity mismatchin g.

 Optimal Hedging in Futures Markets with Multiple Delivery Specifications.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1007-21
Issue: 4
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Nearly all futures contracts allow delivery of any of several qualities
 of the underlyi ng asset. Consequently, the price of the futures contract
 is associat ed more with the price of the expected cheapest deliverable
 variety t han with the price of the par-delivery variety. The delivery
 specific ations introduce a delivery risk for every hedger in the market.
 The authors derive the optimal hedging strategies in these markets. Their
 hedging effectiveness is evaluated for wheat futures contracts in Ch
 icago. Hedging optimally would have significantly reduced the varianc e of
 the rates of return on hedges, while yielding similar mean retur ns.

Title: 
 Lease Valuation When Taxable Earnings Are a Scarce Resource.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 987-1005
Issue: 4
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors examine leasing as a tax-arbitrage instrument. The
 theoretical model explains these positive NPVs in terms of a ma rket price
 for a scarce resource that they identify as scarce taxable earnings. Using
 these prices, the model permits a lessor to determin e whether the
 profitability of a proposed set of lease contracts can be improved by
 writing a different set of contracts that makes better use of the lessor's
 taxable earnings. Subsequently, the authors disc uss why the leasing
 market may be characterized by clientele, and, us ing two different
 samples of leases, they test whether the leasing ma rket is segmented and
 efficient.

 The Pricing Effects of Interfirm Cash Tender Offers.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 965-86
Issue: 4
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The tools provided by option pricing theory of tender offer analysis
 provides evidence consistent with the "synergy" theory of corporate
 takeovers and has implications conce rning the economic effects of
 regulations of cash tender offers. The analysis further suggests that the
 market prices information uncertai nty in a manner not captured by the
 standard Capital Asset Pricing Mo del. The study introduces a technique
 for unbundling the prices of a primary asset and a contingent claim when
 only the prices of the comb ination are observed.

 Corporate Takeover Bids, Methods of Payment, and Bidding Firms' Stock Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 943-63
Issue: 4
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This study explores the role of the method of payment in explaining
 common stock returns of bidding firms at the announcement of takeover
 bids. The results reveal significant differences in the abnormal returns
 between common stock exchanges a nd cash offers. The results are
 independent of the type of takeover b id, i.e., merger or tender offer,
 and of bid outcomes. These findings supported by analysis of
 nonconvertible bonds, are attributed mainl y to signaling effects and
 imply that the inconclusive evidence of ea rlier studies on takeovers may
 be due to their failure to control for the method of payment.

 The Effect of Long-term Performance Plans on Corporate Sell-Off-Induced Abnormal Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 933-42
Issue: 4
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This study examines the association between long-term performance plans
 and wealth effects accruing to stockholders of divesting firms at
 announcements of sell-off propos als. The results indicate that divesting
 companies with long-term per formance plans experience a more favorable
 stock-market reaction at t he announcement of sell-off proposals relative
 to firms without long- term performance plans. The findings imply that
 longterm performance plans serve as an effective mechanism to motivate
 managers to make better decisions.

Title: 
 Stock Splits and Stock Dividends: Why, Who, and When.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 913-32
Issue: 4
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This study investigates empirically why firms split their stock or
 distribute stock dividends and why the market reacts favorably to these
 distributions. The findings suggest that stock splits are mainly aimed at
 restoring stock prices to a "normal range." Some support can also be found
 for the oft-mentioned signaling motive of stock splits. Stock dividends
 are altogether different from stock splits and they appear to be a
 decreasing phenomenon. The clue to stock dividend distributions may lie in
 their perceived substitution for relatively low cash dividends.

Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper documents a relationship between announcements of unexpected
 changes in financial policy and unexpec ted changes in performance of the
 firm. Using a new methodology that combines analysis of stock price
 movements and earnings forecast data the authors provide evidence that
 analysts revise their earnings fo recasts rationally following the
 announcement of an unexpected divide nd change by an amount positively
 related to the size of both the une xpected dividend change and the change
 in equity value surrounding th e announcement. The results provide direct
 evidence consistent with t he hypothesis that unexpected dividend changes
 signal information abo ut firm performance to market participants.

Abstract:

 The authors propose a likelihood- ratio test of the hypothesis that the

 of this set and another s et of N assets. They study the relation between
 this hypothesis, exac t arbitrage pricing, and mutual-fund separation. The

 the hypothesi s that the frontier spanned by three size-sorted stock
 portfolios is the same as the frontier spanned by thirty-three size-sorted
 stock po rtfolios.

 Trade Credit and Informational Asymmetry.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 863-72
Issue: 4
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Commonly used trade credit terms implicitly define a high interest rate
 that operates as an efficient screening device where information about
 buyer default risk is asymmetrically held. By offering trade credit, a
 seller can identify prospective defaults more quickl y than if financial
 institutions were the sole providers of short-ter m financing. The
 information is valuable in cases where a seller has made nonsalvageable
 investments in buyers since it enables the seller to take actions to
 protect such investments.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 4
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 If firm performance affects managers' wealth or reputation, preferences
 of managers dominate firms' financing decisions. When information about
 real a sset investment is symmetric, managers finance exclusively with
 equit y. If managers know more about investment quality than do investors,
 and if managers are sufficiently risk averse, they signal high qualit y
 projects with debt. Increases in collateral value decrease debt use
 Increases in interest rates, that do not change productive opportun ities,
 increase debt use. The explanation for these and further resul ts is based
 on underpricing of equity and overpricing of debt at the margin.

 Costless Signalling in Financial Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 809-22
Issue: 4
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 A costless, fully-revealing, signaling equilibrium is derived from two
 easily understandable conditions. The outsider-rationality condition
 states that the outsiders relate the price that they offer to pay for a
 security inversely to the supply of this security that they interpret as a
 quality signal. The no-arbitrage condition requires that the marginal
 exchange rate for two securities be the same in both primary and secondary
 markets. The se conditions restrict the firm's financing policy and have
 strong im plications for the valuation of securities and of the total
 firm. A c ostless signaling equilibrium is obtained.

 The Market Reaction to Stock Splits.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1347-70
Issue: 5
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 In this paper, a model of market reaction to stock splits is presented
 and tested. The auth ors argue that the announcement of a split sets off
 the following cha in of events: the market recognizes that subsequent to
 the (reverse) split ex-day, the daily number of transactions along with
 the raw vol ume of shares traded will increase (decrease); this increase
 in volum e results in an increase in the noisiness of the security's
 return pr ocess; the increase in noise raises the tax-option value of the
 stock -and it is this value that generates the announcement effect of
 stock splits.

 Off-Board Trading of NYSE-Listed Stocks: The Effects of Degregulation and the National Market System.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1331-45
Issue: 5
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 An econometric time-series model of off-board trading of NYSE-listed
 stocks shows that high NYSE commis sion rates were an incentive for
 third-market trading, but that tradi ng on the regional exchanges, which
 is most of off-board trading, has been affected very little by commissions
 or their deregulation. The effects of some changes in the trading
 organization and rules are est imated, including several that are part of
 the emerging National Mark et System (NMS). The estimates imply that the
 NMS has increased compe tition for the NYSE, as Congress intended, and has
 prompted the NYSE to improve its performance to retain market share.

Title: 
 Components of the Bid-Ask Spread and the Statistical Properties of Transaction Prices.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1293-1307
Issue: 5
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The bid-ask spread can be decomposed into two parts-one part due to
 asymmetric informat ion and the other part due to other factors such as
 monopoly power. T he part due to asymmetric information attenuates
 statistical biases i n mean return, variance, and serial covariance. Thus,
 using spread da ta to adjust for biases in return moments requires knowing
 not only t he spread but the composition of the spread. Furthermore, any
 spread estimation procedure using transaction prices must estimate two
 sprea d components.

 Acquisition of Divested Assets and Shareholders' Wealth.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1261-73
Issue: 5
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The divesting of corporate assets has become quite popular. Previous
 studies of divestitures have found conflicting impacts upon shareholders'
 wealth of the buying firm. This study measures the impacts of product-line
 relatedn ess between the acquiring firm and the divested unit and the
 financia l weakness of the selling firm upon the abnormal returns to the
 acqui ring firm. Although the study finds that the impact of financial
 stre ngth of the seller is ambiguous, the purchase of related assets produ
 ces more wealth than does the purchase of unrelated divested units. F
 urther, firms which purchase related divested units have larger propo
 rtions of insider ownership.

Title: 
 Efficient Financing under Asymmetric Information.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1225-43
Issue: 5
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper characterizes the conditions under which the adverse-selection
 problem, which may prevent a firm from issuing securities to finance an
 otherwise profitable investment, may be costlessly overcome by an
 appropriate choice of financing strategy. The conditions are specialized
 when the information asymmetry may be characterized by either a
 first-degree stochastic dominance or a mean-preserving spread ordering
 across possible distributions of firm earnings. Possible financing
 strategies which resolve the information asymmetry are discussed and the
 results are related to recent empirical findings concerning security
 issues.

 The Seasonal Stability of the Factor Structure of Stock Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1195-1211
Issue: 5
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper investigates the month-by-month stability of (1) daily returns
 and correlation coe fficients of stock returns; (2) correlation and
 covariance matrices; (3) the number of return-generating factors; and (4)
 the APT pricing relationships. The results show that there is a January
 effect and a small-firm effect in stock returns. Correlation and
 covariance matric es are not stable across months and across the sample
 groups. The num ber of return-generating factors is rather stable with
 occasional ins tabilities that are related to the average correlation
 coefficients a mong stocks. The APT pricing relationship does not seem to
 be support ed by the two-stage process using the maximum likelihood factor
 analy sis.

 An Empirical Investigation of the Market for Comex Gold Futures Options.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1187-94
Issue: 5
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Asset-pricing models which assume a constant interest rate may misprice
 contingent claims if the interest rate fluctuates significantly or if the
 price of the underlying asset is cor-related with the interest rate. A
 model per-m itting a stochastic interest rate and correlation of the
 underlying a sset's price with the interest rate is tested with daily
 closing pric es for Comex gold futures options. The stochastic
 interest-rate model is superior to a constant interest-rate model in
 predicting market p rices. The results suggest that interest-rate
 volatility is an import ant element in contingent-claims valuation.

 Tax Arbitrage and the Existence of Equilibrium Prices for Financial Assets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1143-66
Issue: 5
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 In a model where both investors and securities are subject to different
 ial taxation, there may be no set of prices that rule out infinite ga ins
 to trade, or "tax arbitrage." This paper characterizes the join t
 restrictions on financial-asset returns and investors' tax schedule s that
 preclude tax arbitrage in the absence of short-sale constraint s. The
 authors show that if there exists any configuration of margina l tax rates
 on investors' tax schedules that rule out infinite gains to trade, then
 "no-tax-arbitrage" prices will exist. They also show that the existence of
 "no-tax-arbitrage" prices ensures the existe nce of equilibrium prices.

 Arbitrage, Continuous Trading, and Margin Requirements.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1129-42
Issue: 5
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper studies the impact that margin requirements have on both the
 existence of arbitrage opportunities and the valuation of ca ll options.
 In the context of the Black-Scholes economy, margin restr ictions are
 shown to exclude continuous-trading arbitrage opportuniti es, and with two
 additional hypotheses, to still allow the Black-Scho les call model to
 apply. The Black-Scholes economy consists of a cont inuously-traded stock
 whose price process follows a geometric Brownia n motion and a
 continuously-traded bond whose price process is determ inistic.

 Time-Dependent Variance and the Pricing of Bond Options.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1113-28
Issue: 5
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 In this paper, the authors develop a model for valuing debt options which
 takes into account the changing characteristics of the underlying bond by
 assuming that the standard deviation of return is proportional to the
 bond's duration. The resulting model uses the bond price as the single
 state variable and thus preserves much of the simplicity and robustness of
 the Black-Scholes approach. The paper provides comparisons between option
 prices computed using this model and those using the Black-Scholes and
 Brennan-Schwartz models.

Title: 
 Nonsynchronous Security Trading and Market Index Autocorrelation.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 111-18
Issue: 1
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper investiga tes the extent to which nonsynchronous security
 trading explains observed autocorrelations in daily returns on stock
 market indices. The theoretical portfolio autocorrelation due solely to
 nonsynchronous trading is estimated from a derived model. This estimated
 level is found to be substantially less than that observed empirically.
 The theoretical and empirical relationship between portfolio size and
 autocorrelation is also investigated. The results of this study suggest
 that other price-adjustment delay factors, in addition to nonsynchronous
 trading, cause the high autocorrelations present in daily returns on stock
 index portfolios.

Abstract:

 This paper analyzes a new security, the yield curve note, which pays
 interest at a rate that varies inversely with short-term interest rates. A
 valuation model is presented, the parameters of the model are estimated
 empirically, and the estimated model is used to explore the price behavior
 and risk characteristics of yield curve notes in comparison with fixed
 rate notes. The risk of a yield curve note is approximately twice as great
 as a fixed rate note with the same maturity. The unique risk
 characteristics of yield curve notes make them useful in immunization
 strategies for financial institutions.

Title: 
 The Default Premium and Corporate Bond Experience.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 81-97
Issue: 1
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 By incorporating previous work on the default experience of low-rated
 corporate debt, this paper presents an introduction to risk-neutral models
 of risky bond pricing and uses these to examine the relationship between
 the default premium embodied in bond yields and actual default rates. The
 contribution of macroeconomic information to the default premium is also
 examined. The authors find that holders of low-grade bonds have, on
 average, been compensated for losses due to default.

Title: 
 Expectations of Exchange Rates and Differential Inflation Rates:.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 69-79
Issue: 1
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The paper tests the null hypothesis of ex ante purchasing power parity.
 The empirical evidence obtained is inconsistent with the null for major
 industrialized countries over the current floating exchange-rate regime.
 Expected nominal exchange rate changes appear to deviate systematically
 from expected inflation-rate differentials over the same holding period
 even though real exchange-rate changes appear to be serially uncorrelated.
 This supports the presence of time-varying risk premium in foreign
 exchange markets and real determinants of exchange-rate movements as
 suggested by equilibrium theories of international asset markets.

Title: 
 Seasonality in the Risk-Return Relationship: Some International Evidence.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 49-68
Issue: 1
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors report evidence of monthly seasonality in the estimate of the
 CAPM-based equity risk premium on the NYSE and the London, Paris, and
 Brussels exchanges. In Belgium and France, the risk premium is positive in
 January and negative the rest of the year. In the United Kingdom, it is
 positive in April and negative the rest of the year. In the United States,
 the pattern of risk-premium seasonality coincides with the pattern of
 stock-return seasonality. Both are positive and significant only in
 January. This is not the case in the European markets. An interpretation
 of this phenomenon is suggested.

Title: 
 Perquisites, Risk, and Capital Structure.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 29-48
Issue: 1
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 In a corporate agency problem, perquisites and risk interact to produce
 novel, complex comparative statics. For example, even if additional debt
 induces risk-neutral insiders to increase risk, they never seek to
 increase the market value of their stock; instead, insiders decrease the
 present value of their subsequent, conditionally optimal perquisites.
 Also, the firm's optimal capital structure includes a risky bond with an
 agreement to remove insiders whenever the bond defaults. However, the
 optimal sharing rule between corporate claimants cannot be supported
 solely by standard securities like bonds, stock, options, and their
 hybrids.

Title: 
 Autoregressive Modeling of Earnings-Investment Causality.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 11-28
Issue: 1
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The purpose of this paper is to empirically test the relationships
 between corporate earnings and investment. In particular, the study
 investigates whether knowledge of past investments improves the prediction
 of future earnings beyond predictions that are based on past earnings
 alone. Similarly, it investigates whether knowledge of past earnings
 improve the prediction of future investments beyond knowledge of past
 investments alone. This is the empirical definition of Granger causality.
 The empirical results show that the bivariate past series of earnings and
 investments is superior to the univariate series in predicting future
 investment, but not in predicting future earnings.

 Mimicking Portfolios and Exact Arbitrage Pricing.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1-9
Issue: 1
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors characterize the sets of mimicking positions whose returns
 can serve in place of factors in an exact K-factor arbitrage pricing
 relation for a set of N assets. All of the sets are K-dimensional
 nonsingular linear transformations of each other. The authors interpret
 three examples of such transformations and discuss empirical
 considerations. They also provide conditions under which the mimicking
 positions can be expressed as portfolios and characterize the relation
 between mimicking portfolios and the minimum-variance frontier.

Title: 
 A Multiproduct Cost Study of Savings and Loans.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 423-45
Issue: 2
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper investigates the cost structure of savings and loans. Most
 studies of financial institutions failed to take into account their
 multiproduct nature. Using the multiproduct approach, the existence of
 subadditivity, multi-product global and product- specific economies of
 scale and scope, and substitutability between inputs is investigated. A
 translogarithmic cost function is estimated using 1982 data on California
 savings and loans. Restrictive func- tional forms also estimated are
 rejected. Standard errors for the statistics calculated are estimated and
 various statistical tests are conducted. Previous authors have not
 calculated standard errors for these statistics. No evidence of
 subadditivity in the industry is found.

Title: 
 Reserves Announcements and Interest Rates: Does Monetary Policy Matter?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 407-22
Issue: 2
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The author provides evidence on the perceived existence of a strong
 liquidity effect. The analysis is based on the response of the term
 structure of interest rates to the weekly Federal Reserve announcements of
 bank reserves during the post-October 1979 time period. It is shown that
 unanticipated changes in the mix between borrowed and non-borrowed
 reserves cause expected real interest rates to change after the
 announcement because they provide information about a future change in the
 supply of money. A precise model is developed and tested during subperiods
 of non-borrowed and borrowed reserve targeting by the Fed.

 Forward Foreign Exchange Rates, Expected Spot Rates, and Premia: A Signal-Extraction Approach.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 395-406
Issue: 2
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The author implements a methodology to identify and measure premia in the
 pricing of forward foreign exchange that involves application of
 signal-extraction techniques from the engineering literature. Diagnostic
 tests indicate that these methods are successful in capturing the essence
 of the time-series properties of premia. The estimated premium models
 indicate that premia show a certain degree of persistance over time and
 that more than one-half of the variance in the forecast error that results
 from the use of current forward rates as predicators of future spot rates,
 is accounted for by variation in premium terms.

 A Theory of Stock Price Responses to Alternative Corporate Cash Disbursement Methods: Stock Repurchases and Dividends.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 365-94
Issue: 2
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper develops a model in which managers can signal their firms'
 true values by using either a dividend or a stock repurchase or both. The
 authors explain a number of stylized facts about these cash disbursement
 mechanisms, particularly those concerning the relative magnitudes of stock
 price responses to dividends and repurchases. Most importantly, they
 explain why a stock repurchase elicits a significantly higher price
 response, on average, than a dividend announcement.

 Collateral and Competitive Equilibria with Moral Hazard and Private Information.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 345-63
Issue: 2
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors examine equilibrium credit contracts and allocations under
 different competivity specifications, and explain the economic roles of
 collateral under these specifications. Both moral hazard and adverse
 selection are considered. The principal message is that how a competitive
 equilibrium is conceptualized significantly affects the characterization
 of equilibrium credit contracts. Specifically, some well known results in
 the rationing literature are shown to rest delicately on the adopted
 equilibrium concept. Two somewhat surprising results emerge. First,
 high-quality borrowers with unlimited collateral may be priced out of the
 market despite the bank having idle deposits. Second, high-quality
 borrowers may put up more collateral.

Title: 
 Efficient Signalling with Dividends and Investments.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 321-43
Issue: 2
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 An efficient signaling equilibrium with dividends and investment, or
 equivalently, dividends and either sales or repurchases of stock, is
 constructed and its properties are identified. Because corporate insiders
 can exploit two signals, the efficient mix minimizes dissipative costs. In
 equilibrium, many firms both distribute dividends and deviate from
 first-best investment. Also, the impact of dividends on stock prices is
 positive. By contrast, the announcement effect of new stock is negative
 for firms with private information primarily about assets in place and
 positive for firms with inside information mainly about opportunities to
 invest.

Title: 
 The Pricing of Options on Assets with Stochastic Volatilities.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 281-300
Issue: 2
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 One option-pricing problem which has hitherto been unsolved is the
 pricing of European call on an asset which has a stochastic volatility.
 This paper examines this problem. The option price is determined in series
 form for the case in which the stochastic volatility is independent of the
 stock price. Numerical solutions are also produced for the case in which
 the volatility is correlated with the stock price. It is found that the
 Black-Scholes price frequently overprices options and that the degree of
 overpricing increases with the time to maturity.

 Mutual Fund Performance Evaluation: A Comparison of Benchmarks and Benchmark Comparisons.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 233-65
Issue: 2
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The main goal in this paper is to gauge the sensitivity of conventional
 measures of abnormal mutual-fund performance to the benchmark chosen to
 measure normal performance. The authors employed standard CAPM benchmarks
 and a variety of APT benchmarks to investigate this question and found
 little similarity between the absolute and relative rankings implied by
 them. Hence, both the model for risk and return and the method used to
 construct the APT benchmark are important choices in this context.
 Finally, the authors found statistically significant measured abnormal
 performance using all benchmarks. The economic interpretation of this

Title: 
 Tests of Asset Pricing with Time-Varying Expected Risk Premiums and Market Betas.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 201-20
Issue: 2
Volume: 42
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Tests of asset-pricing models are developed that allow expected risk
 premiums and market betas to vary over time. These tests exploit the
 relation between expected excess returns and current market values. Using
 weekly data for 1963-82 on ten common stock portfolios formed according to
 equity capitalization, a single risk-premium model is not rejected if the
 expected premium is time varying and is not constrained to correspond to a
 market factor. Conditional mean-variance efficiency of a value-weighted
 stock index is rejected, and the rejection is insensitive to how much
 variability of expected risk premiums is assumed.
