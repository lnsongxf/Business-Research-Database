Title: 
 Initial Public Offering Underpricing: The Issuer's View--A Comment.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1099-1103
Issue: 4
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The author considers the underpricing of initial public offerings and the
 wealth transfers implicit in that underpricing. He finds that initial
 returns properly measure the "issue cost" effect of underpricing as a
 fraction of offer size, as in J. R. Ritter (1987). The author presents a
 measure of the wealth effect of underpricing per share retained. In
 general, the wealth effects on existing shareholders depend on the extent
 to which they participate in the offering. From the perspective of
 issuer's wealth, the author finds that S. M.  Dawson's (1987) measure is
 appropriate only in the special case in which all of the prior owners'
 shares are sold in the initial public offerings.

Title: 
 The Resiliency of the High-Yield Bond Market: The LTV Default.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1085-97
Issue: 4
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper investigates the resiliency of the new-issue high-yield bond
 market by examining the changes in implied default rates of such bonds
 before and after the largest high-yield bond default, i.e., the LTV
 bankruptcy. Specifically, the paper compares implied default probabilities
 of high-yield bonds during the post-LTB period calculated from actual
 new-issue yields with instrumental default probabilities calculated on the
 assumption that the default had not occurred. A comparison of these
 probabilities reveals that the market's perception of default on the
 high-risk segment of the bond market increased significantly after the LTV
 bankruptcy. However, the effect was transitory, lasting only six months.
 Thus, the market was resilient to a major default.

 A Re-examination of the Market Reaction to Failed Mergers.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1077-83
Issue: 4
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This study examines the revaluation of shares surrounding the
 cancellation of mergers over the years 1976-85. The results are first
 categorized according to the party canceling the merger and then by
 subsequent merger activity. The results are as expected: target firms that
 become involved in merger activity, subsequent to the cancellation,
 experience positive cumulative prediction errors. Targets that do not
 become involved in subsequent merger activity have cumulative prediction
 errors that return to premerger announcement levels. These results do not
 vary when bidders or targets cancel the merger.

Title: 
 Corporate Bankruptcy and Managers' Self-Serving Behavior.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1059-75
Issue: 4
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors investigate whether insiders of bankrupt firms hold less
 stock or reduce their stockholdings compared to what they observed for
 insiders of similar firms that do not go bankrupt. They find little
 evidence of such time-series and cross-sectional differences in spite of
 the fact that the stock value of bankrupt firms falls by more than 90
 percent in the five years preceding bankruptcy. One implication of the
 results is that the amount of stock owned and the magnitude of the trades
 undertaken by corporate insiders of both bankrupt and nonbankrupt firms
 appear to provide no information about firm value.

Title: 
 The Impact of In-substance Defeasance on Bondholder and Shareholder Wealth.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1049-57
Issue: 4
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper hypothesizes and tests the argument that a defeasance
 transaction initiates a wealth transfer from stockholders to bondholders.
 The authors empirical tests provide compelling evidence of bondholder
 gains, but no support for shareholder losses when a firm defeases debt.
 They speculate that the insignificance of the loss to shareholders is
 primarily due to the size disparity between the value of defeased debt and
 the market value of outstanding equity, since the suggested economic
 merits of defeasance appear unfounded. Although they cannot prove an
 agency motivation for defeasance, they find a very high correlation
 between compensation tied to earnings and defeasing debt at book gain.

Title: 
 A Re-examination of the Wealth Expropriation Hypothesis: The Case of Captive Finance Subsidiaries.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1039-47
Issue: 4
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper reexamines E. Han Kim, John J. McConnell, and P. Greenwood's
 (1977) study of captive finance subsidiaries. The author suggests that, as
 long as firms are concerned with reputation, shareholders will find it
 costly to engage in deliberate wealth expropriation and, thus, have no
 incentives to do so. Using a sample for fourteen firms with
 publicly-traded debt, she computes and tests the statistical significance
 of abnormal returns to shareholders, bondholders, and the firm when
 captives are incorporated. She finds that shareholders gain 14.9 percent,
 bondholders lose 2.3 percent, and firm value increases a significant 10.4
 percent. The results are inconsistent with wealth expropriations and lend
 support to the importance of reputation to firms.

 Capital Flow Controls, International Asset Pricing, and Investors' Welfare: A Multi-country Framework.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1025-37
Issue: 4
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper investigates the impact of capital flow restrictions on the
 pricing of securities, on the optimal portfolio compositions of investors
 of different nationalities, and on their welfare. Under capital flow
 controls, the equilibrium price of a security is determined jointly by its
 international and national risk premiums, and investors acquire
 nationality-specific portfolios along with a market-wide proxy for the
 world market portfolio. Removal of investment barriers generally leads to
 an increase in the aggregate market value of the affected securities, and
 all investors favor a move toward market integration. Introduction of
 different types of index funds in the world market generally increases
 world market integration and investor welfare.

Title: 
 Overreactions in the Options Market.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1011-23
Issue: 4
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the "term structure" of options' implied
 volatilities, using data on S&P 100 index options. Because implied
 volatility is strongly mean reverting, the implied volatility on a longer
 maturity option should move by less than one percent in response to a one
 percent move in the implied volatility of a shorter maturity option.
 Empirically, this elasticity turns out to be larger than suggested by
 rational expectations theory--long-maturity options tend to "overreact" to
 changes in the implied volatility of short-maturity options.

Volume: 44

Abstract:

 This paper finds that the generally favorable assessment of corporate
 sell-off decisions is most apparent for closely-held firms where insider
 net-buy activity is prevalent during the prior six-month period. This
 suggests that insider-trader activity and ownership-structure information
 are used by the market in the characterization of sell-off decisions as
 favorable or unfavorable for investors.

Title: 
 Management Buyouts of Divisions and Shareholder Wealth.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 953-70
Issue: 4
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the wealth effects to parent company shareholders
 around the announcement of divisional management buyouts. Despite the
 relative absence of "arms-length" bargaining between buyer and seller,
 there is no evidence that divisional management buyouts result in
 reductions in parent company share prices. Instead, small, but
 statistically significant, wealth gains are found during the two-day
 period surrounding the buyout announcement. This evidence suggests that
 divisional buyouts reallocate ownership of corporate assets to
 higher-valued uses and that parent company stockholders share in the
 expected benefits of this change in ownership structure.

 Measuring Corporate Bond Mortality and Performance.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 909-22
Issue: 4
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This study develops an alternative way to measure default risk and
 suggests an appropriate method to assess the performance of fixed-income
 investors over the entire spectrum of credit-quality classes. The approach
 seeks to measure the expected mortality of bonds and the consequent loss
 rates in a manner similar to the way actuaries assess mortality of human
 beings. The results show that all bond ratings outperform riskless
 Treasuries over a ten-year horizon and that, despite relatively high
 mortality rates, B-rated and CCC-rated securities outperform all other
 rating categories of the first four years after issuance, with BB-rated
 securities outperforming all others thereafter.

 Nonnormalities and Tests of Asset Pricing Theories.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 889-908
Issue: 4
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The robustness of the multivariate tests of Michael R. Gibbons, Stephen
 A. Ross, and Jay Shanken (1986) to nonnormalities in the residual
 covariance matrix is examined. After considering the relative performance
 of various tests of normality, simulation techniques are used to determine
 the effects of nonnormalities on the multivariate tests. It is found that,
 where the sample nonnormalities are severe, the size and/or power of the
 test can be seriously misstated. However, it is also shown that these
 extreme sample values may overestimate the population parameters. Hence,
 they conclude that the multivariate test is reasonably robust with respect
 to typical levels of nonnormality.

Title: 
 Temporal Aggregation and the Continuous-Time Capital Asset Pricing Model.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 871-87
Issue: 4
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The author examines how the empirical implications of the capital asset
 pricing model (CAPM) are affected by the length of the period over which
 returns are measured. He shows that the continuous-time CAPM becomes a
 multifactor model when the asset pricing relation is aggregated
 temporally. He uses L. P. Hansen's generalized method of moments approach
 to test the continuous-time CAPM at an unconditional level using size
 portfolio returns. The results indicate that the continuous-time CAPM
 cannot be rejected. In contrast, the discrete-time CAPM is easily rejected
 by the tests. These results have a number of important implications for
 the interpretations of tests of the CAPM that have appeared in the
 literature.

 Capital Controls and International Capital Market Segmentation: The Evidence from the Japanese and American Stock Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 849-69
Issue: 4
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper focuses on two countries, Japan and the United States, to test
 the integration of capital markets. In Japan, the enactment of the Foreign
 Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law in December of 1980 amounted to a
 true regime switch that virtually eliminated capital controls. Using
 multifactor asset pricing models, the authors show that the price of risk
 in the U.S. and Japanese stock markets was different before, but not
 after, the liberalization. This evidence supports the view that
 governments are the source of international capital market segmentation.

Abstract:

 On October 19, 1987, NYSE stocks in the S&P index declined seven
 percentage points more than NYSE stocks not in this index. In the first
 hour of trading on October 20, the S&P stocks virtually recovered to the
 level of the non-S&P stocks. There is a strong relation between order
 imbalances and stock price movements, both in analyses of time series and
 cross sections. Thus, in addition to the breakdown in the linkage between
 future prices and the spot index on these two days, there were also
 breakdowns in the linkage among NYSE stocks.

 A Portfolio Approach to Estimating the Average Correlation Coefficient for the Constant Correlation Model.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1435-38
Issue: 5
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper presents a portfolio approach to estimating the average
 correlation coefficient of a group of stocks that are considered for
 portfolio analysis. The average correlation coefficient has been shown to
 produce a better estimate of the future correlation matrix than individual
 pairwise correlations. The advantage of the approach described here is
 that it does not require the estimation of pairwise correlations for
 estimating their average.

 Corrections for Trading Frictions in Multivariate Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1421-34
Issue: 5
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 When observed stock returns are obtained from trades subject to friction,
 it is known that an individual stock's beta and covariance are measured
 with error. Univariate models of additive error adjustment are available
 and are often applied simultaneously to more than one stock.
 Unfortunately, these multivariate adjustments produce nonpositive definite
 covariance and correlation matrices, unless the return sample sizes are
 very large. To prevent this, restriction on the adjustment matrix are
 developed and a correction is proposed, which dominates the corrected
 estimator. The estimators are illustrated with asset opportunity set
 estimates where daily returns have trading frictions.

 The Effect of Temporal Risk Aversion on Optimal Consumption, the Equity Premium, and the Equilibrium Interest Rate.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1411-20
Issue: 5
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper demonstrates that temporal risk aversion makes smoothing
 consumption over time less attractive, while the usual risk aversion makes
 it more attractive. As temporal risk aversion increases, the equilibrium
 interest rate decreases and the equity premium increases. This paper also
 shows a striking and novel result that an increase in time impatience can
 lead to either a decrease or an increase in the interest rate depending on
 the nature of the nonseparability.

Title: 
 A Re-examination of Shareholder Wealth Effects of Calls of Convertible Preferred Stock.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1401-10
Issue: 5
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Common stock price reactions to announcements of sixty-seven calls of the
 in-the-money convertible preferred stocks are examined, and a significant
 average abnormal return of -1.6 percent is documented. The finding is
 robust to the choice of estimation period and the assumed
 return-generating process. Annual dividend obligations for the called
 preferred issues in the sample typically are greater than the dividends
 for the common shares into which they are converted, and
 announcement-period abnormal returns are negatively correlated with
 changes in dividends. Moreover, calls that result in dilution of voting
 rights appear to have greater adverse valuation effects than calls that do
 not alter voting rights concentration.

Title: 
 Does the Stock Market Overreact to Corporate Earnings Information?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1385-99
Issue: 5
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper tests whether the stock market overreacts to extreme earnings,
 by examining firms' stock returns over the thirty-six months subsequent to
 extreme earnings years. While the poorest earners do outperform the best
 earners, the poorest earners are also significantly smaller than the best
 earners. When poor earners are matched with good earners of equal size,
 there is little evidence of differential performance. This suggests that
 size, and not investor overreaction to earnings, is responsible for the
 "overreaction" phenomenon, the tendency for prior period losers to
 outperform prior period winners in the subsequent period.

Title: 
 The Equilibrium Valuation of Risky Discrete Cash Flows in Continuous Time.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1357-83
Issue: 5
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper values a contingent claim to discrete stochastic cash flows
 generated by a Poisson arrival process with a randomly varying intensity
 parameter. In the most general case, both the size and the arrival
 intensity of cash flows may correlate with state variables in a continuous
 time economy. Assuming the conditions of an intertemporal capital asset
 pricing model, solutions for the value of the contingent claim can be
 found using various techniques. The paper suggests immediate applications
 to the valuation of insurance contracts, the decision to build a firm with
 unknown future investment opportunities, and the pricing of
 mortgaged-backed securities.

Title: 
 Stock Splits, Volatility Increases, and Implied Volatilities.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1361-72
Issue: 5
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 A test of the efficiency of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, relative
 to postsplit increases in the volatility of common stocks, is presented.
 The Black-Scholes and Roll option pricing formulas are used to examine the
 behavior of implied standard deviations around split announcement and
 ex-dates. Comparisons with a control group of stocks find no relative
 increase in the implied standard deviations of stocks announcing splits.
 However, a relative increase is detected at the ex-date. Therefore, the
 joint hypothesis that (1) the Black-Scholes and Roll formulas are true and
 (2) the Chicago Board Options Exchange is efficient can be rejected.

 Some Empirical Estimates of the Risk Structure of Interest Rates.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1351-60
Issue: 5
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper investigates the risk structure of interest rates using pure
 discount bonds. The most striking feature of the authors' estimates of
 default-risk premia is the resemblance of their time profile to the
 theoretical time profile obtained by R. C. Merton (1974).

 LDC Debt: Forgiveness, Indexation, and Investment Incentives.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1335-50
Issue: 5
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors compare different indexation schemes in terms of their
 ability to facilitate forgiveness and reduce the investment disincentives
 associated with the large LDC debt overhang. Indexing to an endogenous
 variable (e.g., a country's output) has a negative moral hazard effect on
 investment. This problem does not arise when payments are linked to an
 exogenous variable such as commodity prices. Nonetheless, indexing
 payments to output may be useful when debtors know more about their
 willingness to invest than lenders. They also reach new conclusions about
 the desirability of default penalties under asymmetric information.

 Optimal Bank Reorganization Policies and the Pricing of Federal Deposit Insurance.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1313-33
Issue: 5
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Optimal dynamic regulatory policies for closing ailing banks and for
 deposit insurance premia are derived as functions of the rate of flow of
 bank deposits and interest paid on deposits, the economy's risk-free
 interest rate, and the regulators' bank audit/administration costs. Under
 competitive conditions, the threshold assets-to-deposits ratio below which
 a bank should be optimally closed is shown to be greater than or equal to
 one. Optimal deposit insurance premia and probabilities of bank closure
 are shown to be nondecreasing in the bank's risk on investment and
 nonincreasing in the bank's current assets-to-deposits ratio.

Title: 
 Options Arbitrage in Imperfect Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1289-1311
Issue: 5
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Option valuation models are based on an arbitrage strategy--hedging the
 option against the underlying asset and rebalancing continuously until
 expiration--that is only possible in a frictionless market. This paper
 simulates the impact of market imperfections and other problems with the
 "standard" arbitrage trade, including uncertain volatility, transaction
 costs, indivisibilities, and rebalancing only at discrete intervals. The
 author finds that, in an actual market such as that for stock index
 options, the standard arbitrage is exposed to such large risk and
 transactions costs that it can only establish very wide bounds on
 equilibrium options prices. This has important implications for price
 determination in options markets, as well as for testing of valuation
 models.

 Primes and Scores: An Essay on Market Imperfections.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1263-87
Issue: 5
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper investigates the reported relative mispricing of primes and
 scores to the underlying stock. Given transaction costs, the authors
 establish arbitrage-based bounds on prime and score prices. They then
 develop a new nonparametric statistical technique to test whether prime
 and score prices violate these bounds. They find that prime and score
 prices do exceed stock prices, and often by a considerable amount. They
 demonstrate that this increased value is most likely due to the score's
 ability to save on the costs of dynamic hedging. They also show how short
 sale and trust size constraints impede the ability to arbitrage price
 disparities.

 The Number of Factors in Security Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1247-62
Issue: 5
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Both factor analysis of security returns and the analysis of eigenvalues
 seem to indicate that a market factor explains the major part of security
 returns. The author finds that such evidence is consistent with an economy
 where there are, in fact, k "equally important" priced factors; eigenvalue
 analysis in the context of such an economy will lead an investigator to
 the false inference that the one important "factor" is the retun on an
 equally weighted market index.

 Firm Size and Turn-of-the-Year Effects in the OTC/NASDAQ Market.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1219-45
Issue: 5
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the turn-of-the-year effect, the firm size effect,
 and the relation between these two effects for a sample of
 over-the-counter stocks traded via the NASDAQ reporting system over the
 period 1973-85. The authors find results similar to those based solely on
 listed stocks. The importance of these findings stems from the existence
 of nontrivial differences between the characteristics of the
 over-the-counter/NASDAQ sample and the samples of listed firms examined
 previously in the literature. They also find that NASDAQ quoted bid-ask
 spreads are highly negatively correlated with firm size, are not highly
 seasonal, and are large enough to preclude trading profits based upon a
 knowledge of the seasonality of small firms' returns.

 Changes in Expected Security Returns, Risk, and the Level of Interest Rates.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1191-1217
Issue: 5
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Regression of security returns on treasury bill rates provide insight
 about the behavior of risk in rational asset pricing models. The
 information in one-month bill rates implies time variation in the
 conditional covariances of portfolios of stocks and fixed-income
 securities with benchmark pricing variables over extended samples and
 within five-year subperiods. There is evidence of changes in conditional
 "betas" associated with interest rates. Consumption and stock market data
 are examined as proxies for marginal utility in a general framework for
 asset pricing with time-varying conditional covariances.

 Economic Significance of Predictable Variations in Stock Index Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1177-89
Issue: 5
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Knowledge of the one-month interest rate is useful in forecasting the
 sign, as well as the variance, of the excess return on stocks. The
 services of a portfolio manager who makes use of the forecasting model to
 shift funds between bills and stocks would be worth an annual management
 fee of 2 percent of the value of the assets managed. During 1954:4 to
 1986:12, the variance of monthly retuns on the managed portfolio was about
 60 percent of the variance of the returns on the value weighted index,
 whereas the average return was two basis points higher.

 S&P 500 Cash Stock Price Volatilities.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1155-75
Issue: 5
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 S$50P 500 stock return volatilities are compared to the volatilities of a
 matched set of stocks, after controlling for cross-sectional differences
 in firm attributes known to affect volatility. No significant difference
 in volatility is observed between 1975 and 1983--before the start of trade
 in index futures and index options. Since then, S$50P 500 stocks have been
 relatively more volatile. The difference is statistically, but not
 economically, significant. The relative increase occurs primarily in daily
 returns and only to a lesser extent in longer interval returns. Other
 factors besides the start of derivative trade could be responsible for the
 small increase in volatility.

 Why Does Stock Market Volatility Change over Time?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1115-53
Issue: 5
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper analyzes the relation of stock volatility with real and
 nominal macroeconomic volatility, economic activity, financial leverage,
 and stock trading activity using monthly data from 1857 to 1987. An
 important fact, previously noted by Robert R. Officer (1973), is that
 stock return variability was unusually high during the 1929-39 Great
 Depression. While aggregate leverage is significantly correlated with
 volatility, it explains a relatively small part of the movements in stock
 volatility. The amplitude of the fluctuations in aggregate stock
 volatility is difficult to explain using simple models of stock valuation,
 especially during the Great Depression.

Title: 
 Capital Structure Theory and REIT Security Offerings.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 983-93
Issue: 4
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 In this paper, the authors examine the stock price reactions to
 announcements of new security offerings b y real estate investment trusts.
 Real estate investment trusts offer a unique setting in which to study
 these events because they do not p ay taxes at the firm level. Theory
 suggests that the net tax gain to corporate borrowing is unambiguously
 negative for a real estate inves tment trust. Contrary to some recent
 studies, however, the authors fi nd a positive stock price reaction to
 debt offerings, while the negat ive equity issuance effect is preserved.
 Further, empirical evidence lends support to signaling as the explanation
 for the positive signif icant debt issuance effect.

Title: 
 Firm Characteristics, Unanticipated Inflation, and Stock Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 965-81
Issue: 4
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper reexamines the effects of nominal contracts on the
 relationship between unantici pated inflation and an individual stock's
 rate of return. This study differs in three main ways from previous
 research. First, announced i nflation data are used to examine the effects
 of unanticipated inflat ion. Second, a different specification is used to
 obtain more efficie nt estimates. Third, additional nominal contracts are
 considered. The empirical results indicate that time-varying firm
 characteristics re lated to inflation predominately determine the effect
 of unanticipate d inflation on a stock's return. A firm's debt-equity
 ratio appears t o be particularly important in determining the response.

Abstract:

 This research empirically investigates the relation between common stock
 and call option trading volumes. The p aper hypothesizes and tests a
 sequential flow of information between the stock and option markets. If
 information trading for Chicago Boar d Option Exchange listed firms is
 predominantly accomplished through option trading, then existing research
 methodologies may be biased ag ainst finding any significant economic
 consequences in those instance s where option listing is an impor-tant
 variable. Results indicate th at trading in call options leads trading in
 the underlying shares, wi th a one day lag.

 Was It Real? The Exchange Rate-Interest Differential Relation over the Modern Floating-Rate Period.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 933-48
Issue: 4
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper explores the relation between real exchange rates and real
 interest rate differentials for the United States, West Germany, Japan,
 and the United Kingdom. Contrary to theories based on the joint hypothesis
 that domestic prices are sticky and monetary dis turbances are
 predominant, the authors find little evidence of a stab le relationship
 between real interest rates and real exchange rates. They consider both
 in-sample and out-of-sample tests. One hypothesis which is consistent with
 their findings is that real disturbances may be a major source of exchange
 rate volatility.

Title: 
 Was the Tax-Exempt Bond Market Inefficient or Were Future Expected Tax Rates Negative?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 913-31
Issue: 4
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper shows that the sharp narrowing with maturity of the spread
 between taxable and tax exempt yields leaves room for tax arbitrage. At
 times, tax exempt forward rates have exceeded taxable forward rat es. At
 such times, only expectations of higher taxes on Treasury than on
 municipal bonds would eliminate profit opportunities. The authors develop
 the idea of forward tax rates and compute forward tax rates for 1955-84.
 They outline tax arbitrage mechanisms involving private forward sale of
 long municipal bonds or the use of the municipal bond futures contract and
 show the potential profits.

Title: 
 Term Structure Multiplicity and Clientele in Markets with Transactions Costs and Taxes.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 893-911
Issue: 4
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors investigate term structure with realistic transactions costs
 and taxes. Its properties are derived from a certain no- arbitrage
 condition via duality theory in convex programming. Transac tions costs
 imply an infinite multiplicity of term structures. A simp le example with
 realistic transactions costs shows that this multipli city can induce a
 valuation range of over 277 basis points. Transacti ons costs also allow
 equilibrium without short-sale restrictions. The authors find the minimum
 transactions costs that prevent arbitrage. Each investor is shown to have
 a new type of clientele effect, called a weak long or a weak short
 clientele effect, for each bond.

 An Asset-Pricing Theory Unifying the CAPM and APT.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 881-92
Issue: 4
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This study shows that the competitive equilibrium version of the
 arbitrage pricing theory may be extended to develop an exact mode l if
 idiosyncratic risks obey the Ross separating distribution. The r esults
 indicate that one only need add the market portfolio as an ext ra factor
 to the factor model in order to obtain an exact asset prici ng relation.
 The "empirical" arbitrage pricing theory is also general ized to allow for
 some factors to be omitted from the econometric m odel employed to test
 the theory. The importance of the market portfo lio is shown to be a
 monotonic increasing function of the number of o mitted factors.

 The Implications of Nonmarketable Income for Consumption-Based Models of Asset Pricing.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 867-80
Issue: 4
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 A new representation of nonmarketable income is introduced. Using this
 representation and continuous trading, there exists a set of individuals
 who do not participate in the asset market and who consume at the rate of
 nonmarketable income derived from human capital. Because these individuals
 remain nonparticipants for a range of stochastic processes governing the
 nonmarketable income, consumption betas are not generally unique in value
 and the consumption capital asset pricing model does not obtain. The
 intertemporal capital asset pricing model remains valid, however, and
 asset market participants hold portfolios hedging changes in future
 nonmarketable income.

 Estimation Bias Induced by Discrete Security Prices.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 841-65
Issue: 4
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Commonly, equilibrium security prices are modeled by continuous state
 stochastic processes while observed prices are rounded i nto discrete
 units. This paper models the rounding mechanism and exam ines the
 probabilistic structure of the resultant rounded process. Th e author
 provides accurate and simple estimates of the inflation in e stimated
 variance and kurtosis induced by ignoring rounding. In parti cular, the
 maximum likelihood estimate of security price volatility, using rounded
 prices, is developed and a simulation analysis is perfo rmed to examine
 the small sample properties of this estimator. For ma ny practical
 applications, a simple correction for rounding becomes a vailable.

 Risk-Based Premiums for Insurance Guaranty Funds.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 823-39
Issue: 4
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Insurance guaranty funds have been adopted in all states to compensate
 policyholders for losses resulting from insurance company insolvencies.
 The guaranty funds charge flat premium rates, usually a percentage of
 premiums. Flat premiums can induce insurers to adopt h igh-risk
 strategies, a problem that could be avoided through the use of risk-based
 premiums. This article develops risk-based premium form ulae for three
 cases: (1) an ongoing insurer with stochastic assets a nd liabilities; (2)
 an ongoing insurer also subject to jumps in liabi lities (catastrophes);
 and (3) a policy cohort, where claims eventual ly run off to zero. Premium
 estimates are provided and compared with actual guaranty fund assessment
 rates.

Title: 
 Anatomy of Initial Public Offerings of Common Stock.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 789-822
Issue: 4
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Initial public offerings of common stocks are typically underpriced . In
 this paper, the author develops and tests the hypothesis that underpricing
 serves as a form of insurance against legal liabili ty and the associated
 damages to the reputations of investment banker s. The empirical results,
 based on samples of initial public offering s of common stocks that were
 brought to the market before and after t he Securities Act of 1933,
 provide considerable support for the impli cit insurance hypothesis.
 Specifically, gross underpricing and market segmentation between
 prestigious and fringe investment bankers in or iginating unseasoned new
 issues appear to be peculiar to the post-193 3 era.

Abstract:

 Sequential exchange opportunities are valued using the techniques o f
 modern option pricing theory. The vehicle for analysis is the concept of a
 compound exchange option. This security is shown to exist implicitly in
 several contractual settings. A valuation formula for this option is
 derived. The formula is shown to generalize much previous work in option
 pricing. Several applications of the formula are presented.

Title: 
 Risk in Banking and Capital Regulation.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1219-33
Issue: 5
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper investigates the role of bank capital regulation in risk
 control. It is known that banks choose portfolios of higher risk because
 of inefficiently priced deposit insurance. Bank capital regulation is a
 way to redress this bias toward risk. Utilizing the mean-variance model,
 the following results are shown: (1) the use of simple capital ratios in
 regulation is an ineffective means to bound the insolvency risk of banks;
 (2) as a solution to problems of the capital ratio regulation, the
 "theoretically correct" risk weights under the risk-b ased capital plan
 are explicitly derived; and (3) the "theoretically correct" risk weights
 are restrictions on asset composition, which alters the optimal portfolio
 choice of banking firms.

 The Domino Effect and the Supervision of the Banking System.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1207-18
Issue: 5
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper models the domino effect and defines a measurement for t he
 necessity of banking supervision. The effect of several factors, such as
 the desired stability of the banking system, its size, the amount of
 negative externalities that are considered by banks, and supervisory
 costs, on the necessity of supervision are studied. For instance, it was
 found that under certain circumstances supervision becomes less essential
 if the number of banks increases. The paper emphasizes that objective
 difficulties in the supervision of banks, by simply imposing restrictions
 on their activities, are intrinsic to the operation of the banks
 themselves.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1193-1206
Issue: 5
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors examine the investment characteristics of firms electin g to
 enter bankruptcy between 1973 and 1982. Comparisons are made before and
 after the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. The results indicate that the
 1978 Act had no significant impact on bankruptcy decisions or resolutions
 for actively traded firms. Trading in bankru pt firms' securities is
 becoming more common, but no abnormal returns appear to be available.
 Systematic risk does not change significantl y with the filing of
 bankruptcy, but there is a significant increase in return variance. The
 financial markets also react to various announcements of stages in the
 reorganization process.

 Underpricing of Newly Issued Bonds: Evidence from the Swiss Capital Market.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Abstract:

 The pricing of newly issued bonds on the Swiss capital market is
 investigated over the years 1980-82. The results reveal a slight
 underpricing of new bonds at the issue date that is roughly equal to the
 difference in transactions costs between the markets for new and seasoned
 bonds. Underpricing is no longer observed when the new bonds start to be
 traded on the stock exchange, that is, after about two days. Tests of
 several hypothesis show that unexpected changes in interest rates over the
 offering period explain part of the underpricing.

Title: 
 The Effect of Corporate Multinationalism on Shareholders' Wealth: Evidence from International Acquisitions.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1161-75
Issue: 5
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This study presents direct evidence on the effect of international
 acquisitions on stock prices of U.S. bidding firms. Shareholders of
 multinational corporations not operating in the target firm's country
 experience significant positive abnormal returns at the announcement of
 international acquisitions. Shareholders of U.S. firms expanding
 internationally for the first time experience insigni ficant positive
 abnormal returns, while shareholders of multinational corporations
 operating already in the target firm's country experience insignificant
 negative abnormal returns. The abnormal returns are larger when firms
 expand into new industry and geographic markets-especially those less
 developed than the U.S. economy.

Title: 
 Canada's Dual Class Shares: Further Evidence on the Market Value of Cash Dividends.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1143-60
Issue: 5
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The Canada Income Tax Act of 1971 permitted Canadian corporations t o
 create two classes of equity: one paying ordinary cash income and the
 other paying capital gains income. Cash-paying shares have often sol d at
 a premium. Empirical results indicate that the premium is largely
 explained by the relative value of the dividends paid and by costs imposed
 on investors by stock dividend payment and share conversion procedures.
 Premiums for a few firms also reflect the relative liquidity of the two
 classes of shares. No evidence exists that investors prefer cash income to
 equal amounts of capital gains.

Title: 
 Vendor Financing.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1127-41
Issue: 5
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper shows that, even in the presence of a perfectly competit ive
 banking industry, it is optimal for firms with market power to en gage in
 vendor financing if credit customers have lower reservation prices than
 cash customers, or if adverse selection makes it infeasible to write
 credit contracts which separate customers according to their credit risk.
 The authors analyze how the advantage of vendor financing depends on the
 relative size of the cash and credit markets, the heterogeneity of credit
 customers, and in the number of firms in the industry.

 Is the Real Interest Rate Stable?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1095-1112
Issue: 5
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Univariate time series models for consumption, nominal interest rat es,
 and prices each appear to have a single unit-root before 1979. If nominal
 interest rates have a unit-root , but inflation and forecast errors do
 not, then ex ante real interest rates have a unit-root and are therefore
 nonstationary. The unit-root characteristic of real interest rates is
 puzzling: man y models imply that the growth rate of consumption and the
 real interest rate should have similar time-series characteristics; also,
 nominal returns for other assets appear to have very different time-series
 properties.

Abstract:

 This paper expresses the constant elasticity of variance option pricing
 formula in terms of the noncentral chi-square distribution. This allows
 the application of well-known approximation formulas and the derivation of
 a whole class of closed-form solutions. In addition, a simple and

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 195-204
Issue: 1
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The introduction of shelf registration in 1982 is used to examine the
 extent of price taking behavior among investment banks. Changes in
 underwriting syndicates are compared with the concomitant adjustment in
 underwriting spreads and management fees. The evidence is consistent with
 higher organizing cost and/or market power in the underwriting syndicate.
 Evidence on the components of the spreads and syndicate composition during
 the introduction of shelf registration is also presented.

 Common Stochastic Trends in a System of Exchange Rates.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 167-81
Issue: 1
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Univariate tests reveal strong evidence for the presence of a unit root
 in the univariate time series representation for seven daily spot and
 forward exchange rate series. Furthermore, all seven spot and forward
 rates appear to be cointegrated, that is, the forward premiums are
 stationary and one common unit root, or stochastic trend, is detectable in
 the multivariate time series models for the seven spot and forward rates,
 respectively. This is consistent with the hypothesis of the seven exchange
 rates possessing one long-run relationship, and the disequilibrium error
 around that relationship, partly accounting for subsequent movements in
 the exchange rates.

 Portfolio Rebalancing and the Turn-of-the-Year Effect.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 149-66
Issue: 1
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper finds that, for the 1935-86 period, the market's risk-return
 relation does not have a January seasonal. The findings differ from those
 of other studies due to the use of value-weighted, rather than
 equally-weighted, portfolios. Inferences are sensitive to the weighting
 procedure because of the small-firm return patterns in January. In
 particular, even in those Januaries for which the market return is
 negative, small-firm returns are positive, and they are more positive the
 higher is beta. This is consistent with the portfolio rebalancing
 explanation of the turn-of-the-year effect.

 Inferring the Components of the Bid-Ask Spread: Theory and Empirical Tests.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 115-34
Issue: 1
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The relation between the square of the quoted bid-ask spread and two
 serial covariances--the serial covariance of transaction returns and the
 serial covariance of quoted returns--is modeled as a function of the
 probability of a price reversal, pi, and the magnitude of a price change,
 delta, where delta is stated as a function of the quoted spread. Different
 models of the spread are contrasted in term of the parameters, pi and
 delta. Using data on transaction prices and price quotations for
 NASDAQ/NMS stocks, pi and delta are estimated and the relative importance
 of the components of the quoted spread--adverse information costs, order
 processing costs, and inventory holding costs--is determined.

Month:  March 
Abstract:

 A method is developed for pricing the quality option in futures contracts
 where there are several deliverable assets. The interaction of the timing
 option and the quality option is examined. Numerical estimates are
 provided to illustrate the dependence of the quality option on the number
 of underlying assets. The magnitude of the timing option is examined in
 the case of two deliverable assets.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 1
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Five-minute changes in the S&P 500 Index and futures contract are
 examined over a ten-day period surrounding the October 1987 stock-market
 crash. Since nonsynchronous trading problems are severe in these data, new
 Index estimators are derived and used. The estimators use the complete
 transaction history of all five hundred stocks. Nonsynchronous trading
 explains part of the large absolute futures-cash basis observed during the
 crash. The remainder may be due to disintegration of the two markets. Even
 after adjustment for nonsynchronous trading, the Index displays more
 autocorrelation than does the futures and the futures leads the Index.

 The Winner's Curse and Bidder Competition in Acquisitions: Evidence from Failed Bank Auctions.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 59-75
Issue: 1
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Auction theory predictions are used to test if winning bidders overpay
 (the "winner's curse") in FDIC sealed-bid auctions of failed banks. The
 authors find that winning bids tend to increase as the number of
 competitors increases, as predicted by theory. Further, bid levels of all
 bidders increase with increased competition, which is consistent with
 bidders' failing to adjust for the winner's curse in a common value
 auction setting. However, additional tests, using only winning bids, only
 are consistent with both a common value and a private values model, so
 this result should be interpreted with caution.

 Preemptive Bidding and the Role of the Medium of Exchange in Acquisitions.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 41-57
Issue: 1
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The medium of exchange in acquisitions is studied in a model where (1)
 bidders' offers bring forth potential competition and (2) targets and
 bidders are asymmetrically informed. In equilibrium, both securities and
 cash offers are observed. Securities have the advantage of inducing target
 management to make an efficient accept/reject decision. Cash has the
 advantage that, in equilibrium, it serves to "preempt" competition by
 signaling a high valuation for the target. Implications concerning the
 medium of exchange of an offer, the probability of acceptance, the
 probability of competing bids, expected profits, and the costs of bidders
 are derived.

 Dynamic Capital Structure Choice: Theory and Tests.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 19-40
Issue: 1
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper develops a model of dynamic capital structure choice in the
 presence of recapitalization costs. The theory provides the optimal
 dynamic recapitalization policy as a function of firm-specific
 characteristics. The authors find that even small recapitalization costs
 lead to wide swings in a firm's debt ratio over time. Rather than static
 leverage measures, they use the observed debt ratio range of a firm as an
 empirical measure of capital structure relevance. The results of empirical
 tests relating firms' debt ratio range to firm-specific features strongly
 support the theoretical model of relevant capital structure choice in a
 dynamic setting.

 Information and Volatility: The No-Arbitrage Martingale Approach to Timing and Resolution Irrelevancy.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1-17
Issue: 1
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 No-arbitrage martingale analysis is used to study the effect of changes
 in the rate of information flow on asset prices. The analysis is first
 used to develop some simple tools for asset pricing in a continuous time
 setting. These tools are then applied to determine the effect of
 information on prices and price volatility, to extend Samuelson's theorem
 on prices fluctuating randomly, and to study the impact of the resolution
 of uncertainty on prices. The conditions under which uncertainty
 resolution is irrelevant for asset pricing are shown to be similar to
 those that support the Modigliani and Miller irrelevance theorems.

Title: 
 The Expected Utility of the Doubling Strategy.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 515-24
Issue: 2
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 It has been noted that a certain continuous-time trading strategy, termed
 the "doubling strategy," generates a positive net return on borrowed
 funds, with probability one and within a finite period of time. Since the
 doubling strategy seems to represent a "free lunch" or arbitrage
 opportunity, a variety of constraints to render it infeasible have been
 proposed. In this paper, the author shows that the doubling strategy
 generates infinite disutility for a large class of utility functions, and
 he can think of no utility function for a risk-averse agent that is a
 counter-example.

 Institutional Ownership and Changes in the S&P 500.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 509-13
Issue: 2
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Several recent articles have provided new evidence for the existence of
 price pressures by examining the price and volume effects associated with
 changes in the S&P 500. The present study extends this work by examining
 actual changes in institutional holdings following both additions to, and
 deletions from, the S&P 500. The results show that changes in
 institutional holdings in response to additions to, or deletions from, the
 S&P 500 are positively correlated. In addition to providing further
 evidence for the existence of price pressure effects, the results also
 provide evidence of the very large institutional elasticities of demand
 for stock.

Title: 
 The Price Effect of Option Introduction.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 487-98
Issue: 2
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the price effect of option introduction from 1974 to
 1980. The introduction of individual options causes a permanent price
 increase in the underlying security, beginning approximately three days
 before introduction. The price effect appears to be associated with
 introduction, and not announcement, throughout the sample period. Excess
 returns volatility declines with option introduction. Systematic risk is
 unchanged, there is a positive relation between the price increase and a
 measure of activity in the options market.

 The Effects of Beta, Bid-Ask Spread, Residual Risk, and Size on Stock Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 479-86
Issue: 2
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Merton's recent extension of the capital asset pricing model proposed
 that asset returns are an increasing function of their beta risk, residual
 risk, and size, and a decreasing function of the public availability of
 information about them. Associating the latter with asset liquidity and
 following Yokov Amihud and Haim Mendelson's proposition that asset returns
 increase with their illiquidity (measured by the bid-ask spread), the
 authors jointly estimate the effects of these four factors on stock
 returns.

 The Informational Content of Initial Public Offerings.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 2
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The ability of capital markets to distinguish firms of different value by
 the size of their initial equity offerings is attenuated when insiders can
 sell equity more than once. A model is developed in which there is price
 risk from holding equity between periods. When the uncertainty is small,
 there must be pooling in the first period. When uncertainty is large, the
 pooling equilibria dominate the separating equilibria.

 Information Effects Associated with Debt-for-Equity and Equity-for-Debt Exchange Offers.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 451-68
Issue: 2
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This study investigates the information effect caused by a firm's change
 in capital structure via debt-for-equity and equity-for-debt exchange
 offers. The evidence suggests that the former transactions lead to
 abnormal stock price increases, while the latter lead to abnormal stock
 price decreases. In addition, findings based on analysis of bond returns
 and cross-sectional regressions do not lend support to the wealth transfer
 and tax effect hypotheses, but they are consistent with the information
 effect hypothesis.

Title: 
 Seasoned Offerings, Imitation Costs, and the Underpricing of Initial Public Offerings.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 421-49
Issue: 2
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The author presents a signaling model in which high-quality firms
 underprice at the initial public offering in order to obtain a higher
 price at a seasoned offering. The main assumption is that low-quality
 firms must invest in imitation expenses to appear to be high-quality
 firms, and that with some probability this imitation is discovered between
 offerings. Underpricing by high-quality firms at the initial public
 offering then adds sufficient signaling costs to these imitation expenses
 to induce low-quality firms to reveal their quality voluntarily. In
 addition, the paper provides empirical evidence that many firms raise
 substantial amounts of additional equity capital after their initial
 public offering.

Title: 
 Signalling and the Pricing of New Issues.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 393-420
Issue: 2
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper develops a signaling model with two signals, two attributes,
 and a continuum of signal levels and attribute-types to explain new issue
 underpricing. Both the fraction of the new issue retained by the issuer
 and its offering price convey to investors the unobservable "intrinsic"
 value of the firm and the variance of its cash flows. Many of the model's
 comparative statics results are novel, empirically testable, and
 consistent with the existing empirical evidence on new issues. In
 particular, the degree of underpricing, which can be inferred from
 observable variables, is positively related to the firm's postissue share
 price.

 Prepayment and the Valuation of Mortgage-Backed Securities.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 375-92
Issue: 2
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper puts forward a valuation framework for mortgage-backed
 securities. Rather than imposing an optimal, value minimizing call
 condition, the authors assume that at each point in time there exists a
 probability of prepaying, this conditional probability depending upon the
 prevailing state of the economy. To implement their valuation procedure,
 the authors use maximum likelihood techniques to estimate a prepayment
 function in light of recent aggregate GNMA prepayment experience. By
 integrating this empirical prepayment function into their valuation
 framework, they provide a complete model to value mortgage-backed
 securities.

Title: 
 Valuing Commercial Mortgages: An Empirical Investigation of the Contingent-Claims Approach to Pricing Risky Debt.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 345-73
Issue: 2
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper empirically investigates a contingent-claims model of
 commercial mortgage pricing. The authors find that the magnitude of the
 observed default premia for a sample of nonprepayable fixed rate bullet
 mortgages can be explained by the contingent-claims model. In addition,
 the model explains a significant proportion of the period to period
 changes in the default premia. However, given an assumed negative
 correlation between building value changes and interest rate changes, the
 model's risk structure tends to increase less steeply with increasing
 maturity than the observed risk structure.

Title: 
 Tax-Induced Trading: The Effect of the 1986 Tax Reform Act on Stock Market Activity.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 327-44
Issue: 2
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The end of favorable tax treatment for long-term capital gains caused
 investors to reassess traditional tax-induced trading strategies. This
 study compares trading behavior in December 1986 and January 1987 with
 previous years. The authors results indicate that these tax code changes
 had a powerful effect on trading behavior. Relative trading volume was
 considerably higher in December 1986 for long-term winners, but not
 significantly lower for long-term losers. Results also indicate altered
 trading patterns based on short-term gains in December 1986 and for
 long-term winners in January 1987.

Title: 
 The Time Variation of Risk and Return in the Foreign Exchange and Stock Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 307-25
Issue: 2
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper attempts to determine whether the fluctuations of conditional
 first and second moments--which are observed for many assets--are
 consistent with the Sharpe-Lintner-Mossin capital asset pricing model. The
 authors test the mean-variance model under several different assumptions
 about the time variation of conditional second moments of returns, using
 weekly data from July 1974 to December 1986, that include returns on a
 portfolio composed of dollar, Deutsche mark, sterling, and Swiss franc
 assets, together with the U.S. stock market. The results indicate that
 estimated conditional variances cannot explain the observed time variation
 of risk premia.

Title: 
 New Hope for the Expectations Hypothesis of the Term Structure of Interest Rates.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 283-305
Issue: 2
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Survey data on interest-rate expectations permit separate testing of the
 two alternative hypotheses in traditional term structure tests: that the
 expectations hypothesis fails, and that expected future interest rates are
 ex post inefficient forecasts. The author finds that the source of the
 spread's poor predictions of future interest rates varies with maturity.
 At short maturities, the expectations hypothesis fails. At long
 maturities, however, changes in the yield curve reflect changes in
 expected future rates one-for-one, an implication of the expectations
 hypothesis. This result confirms earlier findings that long rates
 underreact to short-rates, but now it cannot be attributed to term premia.

Title: 
 The Arbitrage Pricing Theory and Supershares.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 263-81
Issue: 2
Volume: 44
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 In a single-period model with options on the market portfolio, linear
 factor pricing holds if, and only if, the variance of the market
 conditional on the factors is zero. There is no need for factors other
 than nonlinear functions of the market. For accurate linear pricing of all
 payoff patterns, the factors must be rotationally equivalent to Nils
 Hakansson's "supershares." In a multiperiod model, a similar set of
 results holds, but with consumption replacing the market payoff. The
 methodology of the empirical arbitrage pricing theory literature is not
 consistent with either the single-period or the multiperiod model.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 217-39
Issue: 1
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Using Canadian data, the authors show that anticipated quarterly changes
 in long-term rates associated with the rat ional-expectations model have
 remained small during the post-shift pe riod. They examine three sets of
 recorded forecasts of long-term inte rest rates in Canada, and note their
 failure to improve upon the no-c hange prediction. The excess returns on
 long-term bonds implicit in t he recorded forecasts of the level of
 interest rates vary sharply, ye t there is little evidence that
 forecasters have identified a predict able component of time-varying term
 premia.

 Optimal Futures Positions for Large Banking Firms.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 1
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Earlier work on hedging is extended to incorporate uncertainty about
 deposit supp ly and loan demand as well as random returns on loans and
 CDs. The op timal forward position is the sum of three ratios which should
 be est imated simultaneously. The bank-specific data show that studies of
 ba nks have overstated (1) the optimum volume of short futures for banks ,
 (2) the homogeneity of optimal hedge ratios across the banking syst em,
 and (3) the effect of deregulation on interest-rate risk. The evi dence is
 inconsistent with the hypothesis that deregulation increased the
 interest-rate risk borne by banks.

 Jump-Diffusion Processes and the Term Structure of Interest Rates.

Year: 1988
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The term structure is investigated using an extension of the Cox,
 Ingersoll, and Ross model when state variables and production technologies
 follow jump-diffusion processes. In the presence of jump diffusions, the
 authors find: (1) R. Merton's multi-beta CAPM does not hold in general;
 (2) D. Breeden's single consumption beta does not hold; (3) traditional
 expectations theory of the term structure is not consistent with
 equilbrium; and (4) investors with logarithmic utility will hedge
 movements in the investment opportunities set. ,

Abstract:

 This study investigates the seasonal pattern of aggregate insider trading
 to help disti nguish between two competing explanations for the seasonal
 pattern of security returns. The first potential explanation examined is
 that t he January effect arises from predictable changes in
 turn-of-the-year demand for securities. The second potential explanation
 examined is that the January effect represents compensation for the higher
 risk of trading against informed traders at the turn of the year.

 Total costs vary only slightly acro ss brokers and vary greatly across
 money managers. There is no trade- off between commission costs and market
 impact costs.

 A Theory of Noise Trading in Securities Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 83-95
Issue: 1
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 In a recent article, F. Black introduces the concept of noise trading,
 defin ed as trading on noise as if it were information. He asserts that
 suc h trading must be a significant factor in securities markets, but doe
 s not explain why investors would rationally trade on noise. The goal of
 this paper is to provide such an explanation for one type of inve stor,
 managers of investment funds. As shown here, the incentive to e ngage in
 noise trading arises because of the positive signal that the manager's
 trading level provides about his or her ability to collect private
 information about security investments.

 The author presents a rapidly convergent algorithm to solve the general

 example, taken from the theory of state contingent claims, is worked out
 in detail. For tech nical convergence results the reader is referred to
 the appropriate m athematical-programming literature.

Abstract:

 A model of asset prices is developed that is in principle testable even
 when agg regate consumption of goods and their market prices are only
 partiall y observable. The author shows that if there are m consumption
 goods, expected returns on securities can be expressed in terms of
 covarian ces of their returns with market prices of k consumption goods (k
 bei ng less than m) and aggregate consumption of the remaining goods. Thi
 s model provides researchers with some flexibility in choosing the se t of
 variables that measure riskiness of securities, which should lea d to more
 powerful tests of consumption CAPM.

 Private versus Public Ownership: Investment, Ownership Distribution, and Optimality.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 41-59
Issue: 1
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors examine the choice between private and public incorporation
 of an asset for an entrep reneur who hires a manager with superior
 information about the asset' s return. Public incorporation is shown to be
 preferred when (1) capi tal market issue costs are low, or (2) the asset's
 idiosyncratic risk is high and the owner is either sufficiently risk
 averse or sufficie ntly "optimistic" about the asset's expected return.
 Thus, those as sets deemed most valuable by their owners will be be
 publicly incorpo rated. The authors also explore the impact of
 incorporation mode-priv ate versus public-and information structure on the
 firm's investment policy and ownership distribution.

 The Determinants of Capital Structure Choice.

Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper analyzes the explanatory power of some recent theories of
 optimal capital structure. The study extends empirical work on
 capital-structure theory in three ways. First, it examines a broader set
 of capital-structure theories, many of which have not previously been
 analyzed empirically. Second, since the theories have different empirical
 implications in regards to different types of debt instruments, the
 authors analyze measures of short-term, long-term, and convertible debt
 rather than an aggregate measure of total debt. And third, the study uses
 a factor-analytic technique that mitigates the measurement problems
 encountered when working with proxy variables.

 Debt/Equity Ratio and Expected Common Stock Returns: Empirical Evidence.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 507-28
Issue: 2
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The expected common stock returns are positively related to the ratio of
 debt (noncommon equity liabil ities) to equity, controlling for the beta
 and firm size and includin g as well as excluding January, though the
 relation is much larger in January. This relationship is not sensitive to
 variations in the mar ket proxy, estimation technique, etc. The evidence
 suggests that the "premium" associated with the debt/equity ratio is not
 likely to be just some kind of "risk premium."

 Warrant Exercise, Dividends, and Reinvestment Policy.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 493-506
Issue: 2
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper examines sequential exercise strategies by warrant holders and
 the gain from hoarding w arrants. Several obstacles to acquiring large
 blocks to exploit seque ntial strategies are analyzed. First, several
 reinvestment policies a re identified for which sequential exercise is not
 advantageous, ther eby eliminating the gain from hoarding. However,
 sequential exercise strategies may be advantageous for monopoly or
 oligopoly warrant hold ers, even absent dividends, because using exercise
 proceeds to repurc hase stock or to expand the firm's scale increases the
 riskiness of e quity. Second, oligopoly warrant holders can receive a
 smaller warran t value than perfectly competitive warrant holders,
 suggesting a pote ntial cost to unsuccessful hoarding.

 Intradaily Price-Volume Adjustments of NYSE Stocks to Unexpected Earnings.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 467-91
Issue: 2
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The speed and path of adjustment in stocks to the degree of earnings
 surprise in their quarterly announcements is studied using price-volume
 transactions data. A differential price adjustment process was observed,
 with stocks having large, positive earnings surprises experiencing a
 faster adjustment compared to those stocks with negative earnings
 surprises. Volume, transaction frequency, and size were found to be
 directly related to the absolute degree of surprise, but very favorable
 earnings surprise stocks experienced initially a large number of smaller
 trades while stocks with large unfavorable earnings surprises had
 relatively fewer transactions but higher volume per trade.

Title: 
 Estimating the Volatility of Discrete Stock Prices.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 451-66
Issue: 2
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper introduces an estimator of stock price volatility which
 eliminates, at least asymptotically , the biases that are caused by the
 discreteness of observed stock pr ices. Assuming that the observed stock
 prices are continuously monito red, an estimator is constructed using the
 notion of how quickly the price changes rather than how much the price
 changes. It is shown tha t this estimator has desirable asymptotic
 properties, including consi stency and normality. Also, through a
 simulation study, the authors s how that it outperforms natural estimators
 for low and middle priced stocks. Further, the simulation study
 demonstrates that the proposed estimator is robust to certain
 misspecifications in measuring the tim e between price changes.

 From T-Bills to Common Stocks: Investigating the Generality of Intra-Week Return Seasonality.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 431-50
Issue: 2
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors investigate the extent to which intraweek seasonality still
 exists, and whether its pattern is uniform across thr ee stock indices and
 Treasury bonds with seven different maturities. They find that intraweek
 seasonality continues to be significant, and that its pattern is not
 uniform, either between the stock indices an d the Treasury bonds or even
 only among the bonds. A pattern shared b y stocks and bonds is that Monday
 returns become increasingly negativ e with maturity. These findings
 suggest that neither institutional no r general equilibrium explanations
 by themselves can explain the patt ern of intraweek seasonality.

Title: 
 A Generalized Econometric Model and Tests of a Signalling Hypothesis with Two Discrete Signals.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 413-29
Issue: 2
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 To test the major prediction of a signalling hypothesis-that the market
 price is m onotonic in the signal-the price response to the signal must be
 measu red. Since a signal is an outcome of a rational decision rule of the
 signaller, the market can infer the true type of the signaller from t he
 signal. This necessitates estimation of the price response to the signal,
 conditional on the rational decision rule. Thus, the empirica l models
 (e.g., event studies in corporate finance) that estimate the market price
 responses to signals without conditioning on the ration al decision rules
 are misspecified if viewed as tests of the predicti on of a signalling
 hypothesis. This paper builds a generalized econom etric model with two
 possible discrete signals, derives the rational decision rules, presents a
 simple estimator of the price response to a signal, and illustrates its
 use in testing a recently expounded hyp othesis that firms signal their
 true value by forcing or not forcing an outstanding convertible bond.

 Bond Covenants and Delegated Monitoring.

Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper examines alternative contracting arrangements available to a
 firm seeking to finance an investment project. The authors consider the
 choice between loan contracts with covenants bas ed on noisy indicators of
 the firm's financial health and loan contra cts enforced by a monitoring
 specialist. In one interpretation, the s pecialist is a financial
 intermediary. The firm's choice is shown to depend upon the firm's credit
 rating, the accuracy of financial indic ators of the firm's condition, the
 loss from premature liquidation of the firm's project, and the cost of
 monitoring.

Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper considers a model where banks may improve the returns on loans
 by monitoring borrowers. Bank regulation, together with compe titive
 deposit and equity financing, can give banks an incentive to s ell loans,
 but the extent of their loan selling is limited by a moral hazard problem.
 A solution is given for the optimal design of the ba nk-loan buyer
 contract which alleviates this moral hazard problem. An explanation is
 also given to why some banks might buy loans and why loan sales volume has
 recently increased.

 The Effect of Taxes and Depreciation on Corporate Investment and Financial Leverage.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 357-73
Issue: 2
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the effect of corporate an
 d personal taxes on the firm's optimal investment and financing decis ions
 under uncertainty. The results indicate that, when investment is allowed
 to adjust optimally, increases in investment-related tax shi elds due to
 changes in the corporate tax code are not necessarily ass ociated with
 reductions in leverage at the individual firm level, con trary to existing
 capital structure theory. Cross sectionally, firms with higher
 investment-related tax shields need not have lower debt-r elated tax
 shields unless all firms have perfectly correlated pretax cash flows. The
 implications of the results for empirical analysis ar e also discussed.

 twenty-six weeks to examine the information in forward rates during the
 1970s and 1980s. Forward rat es contain better information about future
 changes in spot rates than the information captured by autoregressive and
 vector autoregressive models. Forward rates also have considerable
 predictive power, which increased after October 1979 and remained strong
 after October 1982. The results show no necessary connection between
 interest rate predi ctability and the degree to which the Fed adheres to
 interest rate ta rgeting.

Title: 
 Exact Arbitrage Pricing and the Minimum-Variance Frontier.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 327-38
Issue: 2
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the relationship between the Arbitrage Pricing Theory
 and mean-variance analysis. It derives conditi ons on the factor risk
 premia vector equivalent to the existence of a frontier portfolio with all
 positive portfolio weights. The paper al so gives a sufficient condition
 under which the existence of a positi ve minimum-variance portfolio of all
 assets in an economy implies the existence of such a portfolio on a
 subset. If this condition holds, rejection of the hypothesis of the
 existence of a positive minimum-va riance portfolio on the subset implies
 rejection on the whole set.

Title: 
 Option Bounds with Finite Revision Opportunities.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 301-08
Issue: 2
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article generalizes the single-period linear programming option
 bound prices by allowing for a finite nu mber of revision opportunities.
 It is shown that, in an incomplete ma rket, the bounds on option prices
 can be derived using a modified bin omial option pricing model. Tighter
 bounds are developed under more r estrictive assumptions on probabilities
 and risk aversion. For this c ase, the upper bounds are shown to coincide
 with the upper bounds der ived by S. Perrakis, while the lower bounds are
 shown to be tighter.

Title: 
 Time-Invariant Portfolio Insurance Strategies.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 283-99
Issue: 2
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper characterizes the complete class of time-invariant portfolio
 insurance strategies and derives the corresponding value functions that
 relate the wealth accumulated under the strategy to the value of the
 underlying insured portfolio. Time-invariant strategies are shown to
 correspond to the long-run po licies for a broad class of portfolio
 insurance payoff functions.

Title: 
 An Empirical Test of the Impact of Managerial Self-interest on Corporate Capital Structure.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 271-81
Issue: 2
Volume: 43
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper provides a test of whether capital structure decisions are at
 least in part motivated by managerial self-interest. It is show n that the
 debt ratio is negatively related to management's sharehold ing, reflecting
 the greater nondiversifiable risk of debt to manageme nt than to public
 investors for maintaining a low debt ratio. Unless there is a
 nonmanagerial principal stockholder, no substantial increase of debt can
 be realized. It may be suggestive that the existence of large nonmangerial
 stockholders might make the interests of Finance.
