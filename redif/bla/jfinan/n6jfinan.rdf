Title: 
 S&P 100 Index Option Volatility.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1251-61
Issue: 4
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Using transaction data on the S&P 100 index options, the authors study
 the effect of valuation simplifications that are commonplace in previous
 research on the time-series properties of implied market volatility. Using
 an American-style algorithm that accounts for the discrete nature of the
 dividends on the S&P 100 index, they find that spurious negative serial
 correlation in implied volatility changes is induced by nonsimultaneously
 observing the option price and the index level. Negative serial
 correlation is also induced by a bid/ask price effect if a single option
 is used to estimate implied volatility. In addition, the authors find that
 these same effects induce spurious (and unreasonable) negative
 cross-correlations between the changes in call and put implied volatility.

Title: 
 The Intra-industry Effects of Going-Private Transactions.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1537-50
Issue: 4
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors demonstrate that bids to take firms private generate
 significantly positive valuation effects for industry rivals of target
 firms. These valuation effects cannot reflect either synergy or monopoly
 since no consolidation of operating firms is involved in such
 transactions. Participation by buyout specialists in the bid does not
 significantly affect these gains. Bids by outsiders and bids by incumbent
 managers generate similar valuation effects for industry rivals. The
 effect on share prices of industry rivals is inversely related to the
 capitalized values of rival firms relative to the target firm. The authors
 also report valuation effects for target firms.

Title: 
 An Investigation of Market Microstructure Impacts on Event Study Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1523-36
Issue: 4
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors investigate the importance of bid-ask spread-induced biases
 on event date returns as exemplified by seasoned equity offerings by NYSE
 listed firms. They document significant negative return biases on the
 offering day, which explain a large portion of the negative event date
 returns documented in the literature. Buy-sell order flow imbalance is
 prominent around the offering and induces a relatively large spread bias.
 If order imbalances are suspected, the researcher can use returns
 calculated from the midpoint of the closing bid and ask quotes instead of
 returns calculated from closing transaction prices to avoid this return
 bias.

Title: 
 Tests of the CAPM with Time-Varying Covariances: A Multivariate GARCH Approach.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1507-21
Issue: 4
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper examines an asset pricing model in which the Sharpe-Lintner
 capital asset pricing model and the zero-beta capital asset pricing model
 are special cases.  The model allows the ratio of expected market risk
 premium to market variance, the conditional expected excess returns, and
 the risks to change over time. The results are found to be sensitive to
 the choice of the portfolio formation techniques. Significant time
 variability is shown in the conditional expected excess asset returns and
 risks and also in the reward-to-risk ratio.

Title: 
 Testing the CAPM with Time-Varying Risks and Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1485-1505
Issue: 4
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper draws on Robert F. Engle's autoregressive conditionally
 heteroskedastic modeling strategy to formulate a conditional capital asset
 pricing model with time-varying risk and expected returns. The model is
 estimated by generalized method of moments. A capital asset pricing model
 that allows mean excess returns to shift in January survives generalized
 method of moments specification tests for a number of omitted variables.
 However, a residual dividend yield component is found to remain in the
 excess returns of smaller firms. The authors find significant monthly and
 quarterly components in the risk premia and beta estimates.

Title: 
 Structural and Return Characteristics of Small and Large Firms.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1467-84
Issue: 4
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors examine differences in structural characteristics that lead
 firms of different sizes to react differently to the same economic news.
 They find that a small firm portfolio contains a large proportion of
 marginal firms--firms with low production efficiency and high financial
 leverage. The authors construct two size-matched indices designed to mimic
 the return behavior of marginal firms and find that these return indices
 are important in explaining the time-series return difference between
 small and large firms. Furthermore, risk exposures to these indices are as
 powerful as log(size) in explaining average returns of size-ranked
 portfolios.

Title: 
 Stock Markets, Growth, and Tax Policy.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1445-65
Issue: 4
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 An extensive literature documents the role of financial markets in
 economic development. To help explain this relationship, this paper
 constructs an endogenous growth model in which a stock market emerges to
 allocate risk and explores how the stock market alters investment
 incentives in ways that change steady state growth rates. The paper
 demonstrates that stock markets accelerate growth by (1) facilitating the
 ability to trade ownership of firms without disrupting the productive
 processes occurring within firms and (2) allowing agents to diversify
 portfolios. Tax policy affects growth directly by altering investment
 incentives and indirectly by changing the incentives underlying financial
 contracts.

 Seasonality in Stock Price Mean Reversion: Evidence from the U.S. and the U.K.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1427-44
Issue: 4
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The evidence of slowly mean-reverting components in stock prices has been
 controversial. The hypothesis of stock price mean-reversion is tested
 using a regression model that yields the highest asymptotic power among a
 class of regression tests. Although the evidence that the equally weighted
 index of stocks exhibits mean-reversion is significant in the period
 1926-88, this phenomenon is entirely concentrated in January. In the
 postwar period, both the equally weighted and the value-weighted indices
 exhibit seasonal mean-reversion in January. A similar phenomenon is also
 observed for the equally weighted index of stocks traded on the London
 Stock Exchange.

 Liquidity, Maturity, and the Yields on U.S. Treasury Securities.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 4
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The effects of asset liquidity on expected returns for assets with
 infinite maturities (stocks) are examined for bonds (Treasury notes and
 bills with matched maturities of less than six months). The yield to
 maturity is higher on notes, which have lower liquidity. The yield
 differential between notes and bills is a decreasing and convex function
 of the time to maturity. The results provide a robust confirmation of the
 liquidity effect in asset pricing.

 Capital Structure and the Market for Corporate Control: The Defensive Role of Debt Financing.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1391-1409
Issue: 4
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 A capital structure theory based on corporate control considerations is
 presented. The optimal debt level balances a decrease in the probability
 of acquisition against a higher share of the synergy for the target's
 shareholders. This leads to the following implications: (1) the
 probability of firms becoming acquisition targets decreases with their
 leverage; (2) acquirers' share of the total equity gain increases with
 targets' leverage; (3) when acquisitions are initiated, targets' stock
 price, targets' debt value, and acquirers' firm value increase; and (4)
 during the acquisition, target firms' stock price changes further; the
 expected change is zero and the variance decreases with targets' debt
 level.

Title: 
 Insider Trading around Dividend Announcements: Theory and Evidence.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1361-89
Issue: 4
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The informational role of strategic insider trading around corporate
 dividend announcements is studied based on the efficient equilibrium in a
 signaling model with endogenous insider trading. Insider trading
 immediately prior to the announcement of dividend initiations has
 significant explanatory power. For firms with insider selling prior to the
 dividend initiation announcement, the excess returns are negative and
 significantly lower than for the remaining firms (with no insider trading
 or just insider buying) as implied by the authors' model. Another
 implication is that dividend increases may elicit a positive or negative
 stock price response depending on the firm's investment opportunities.

Title: 
 Disclosure, Liquidity, and the Cost of Capital.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1325-59
Issue: 4
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper shows that revealing public information to reduce information
 asymmetry can reduce a firm's cost of capital by attracting increased
 demand from large investors due to increased liquidity of its securities.
 Large firms will disclose more information since they benefit most.
 Disclosure also reduces the risk-bearing capacity available through market
 makers. If initial information asymmetry is large, reducing it will
 increase the current price of the security. However, the maximum current
 price occurs with some asymmetry of information: further reduction of
 information asymmetry accentuates the undesirable effects of exit from
 market making.

Title: 
 Tax Shields, Sample-Selection Bias, and the Information Content of Conversion-Forcing Bond Calls.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1291-1324
Issue: 4
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The information content of conversion-forcing bond calls depends on the
 after-tax cash flow to bondholders. If the dividend after conversion
 exceeds the after-tax coupon but is less than the before-tax coupon, the
 call reveals unanticipated decreases in dividends and/or earnings that
 reduce the tax shield from interest payments. In contrast, a call when the
 dividend is less than the after-tax coupon reveals the timing of an
 anticipated shift from exceptional firm-specific positive growth to the
 industry norm. Efforts to document properties of convertible calls are
 subject to sample-selection bias because calls are disproportionately
 associated with positive pre-call firm-specific growth.

Title: 
 Convertible Debt: Corporate Call Policy and Voluntary Conversion.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1273-89
Issue: 4
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper examines why, in contrast to the predictions of finance
 theory, firms do not call convertible debt when the conversion price
 exceeds the call price. The empirical results suggest that the principal
 reason is because some firms enjoy an advantage of paying less in
 after-tax interest than they would pay in dividends were the bond
 converted. This cash flow incentive is the inverse of an investor's
 incentive to convert voluntarily if the converted dividends are greater
 than the bond's coupon. Because of taxation, however, the decisions by
 investors and firms are not symmetric, and there exist bonds which the
 firm may not call and an investor will not convert. The results also find
 that voluntary conversion is significantly related to both the conversion
 price and the differential between the coupon and the dividends on the
 converted stock.

 The Relative Signalling Power of Dutch-Auction and Fixed-Price Self-Tender Offers and Open-Market Share Repurchases.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1243-71
Issue: 4
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors compare three forms of common stock repurchases.
 Dutch-auction self-tender offers and open-market share repurchase programs
 are weaker signals of stock undervaluation than fixed-price self-tender
 offers. The price increase from buyback announcements is greater when
 insider wealth is at risk, greater following negative net-of-market stock
 returns, and unrelated to prior market returns. Buyback announcement
 returns are also increasing in the fraction of shares sought, which is
 consistent with both signaling and an upward-sloping supply curve for
 stock.

 The Losses Realized in Bank Failures.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1223-42
Issue: 4
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the losses realized in bank failures. Losses are
 measured as the difference between the book value of assets and the
 recovery value net of the direct expenses associated with the failure. The
 author finds the loss on assets is substantial, averaging 30 percent of
 the failed bank's assets. Direct expenses associated with bank closures
 average 10 percent of assets. An empirical analysis of the determinants of
 these losses reveals a significant difference in the value of assets
 retained by the FDIC and similar assets assumed by acquiring banks.

 A Theory of Workouts and the Effects of Reorganization Law.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1189-1222
Issue: 4
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors present a model of a financially distressed firm with
 outstanding bank debt and public debt. Coordination problems among public
 debtholders introduce investment inefficiencies in the workout process. In
 most cases, these inefficiencies are not mitigated by the ability of firms
 to buy back their public debt with cash and other securities--the only
 feasible way that firms can restructure their public debt. The authors
 show that Chapter 11 reorganization law increases investment and they
 characterize the types of corporate financial structures for which this
 increased investment enhances efficiency.

Month:  July 
Abstract:

 The authors model the effect on nonperformance risk on forward and
 futures pricing and look for evidence of nonperformance risk in precious
 metals futures prices from the "Hunt Brothers" episode. Changes in default
 premiums are measured and related to the sequence of events in the metals
 markets during this period. Results suggest that ex ante costs of
 nonperformance can be a significant, priced factor in commodity markets
 and that the arrival of new information is often associated with changes
 in these costs. The evidence has implications for both theoretical and
 empirical research on commodity markets.

 Option Prices and the Underlying Asset's Return Distribution.

Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This work examines the relation between option prices and the true, as
 opposed to risk-neutral, distribution of the underlying asset. If the
 underlying asset follows a diffusion with an instantaneous expected return
 at least as large as the instantaneous risk-free rate, observed option
 prices can be used to place bounds on the moments of the true
 distribution. An illustration of the paper's results is provided by the
 analysis of the information concerning the mean and standard deviation of
 market returns contained in the prices of S&P 100 Index Options.

Title: 
 The Crash of '87: Was It Expected? The Evidence from Options Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1009-44
Issue: 3
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 Transactions prices of S&P 500 futures options over 1985-87 are examined
 for evidence of expectations prior to October 1987 of an impending stock
 market crash. First, it is shown that out-of-the-money puts became
 unusually expensive during the year preceding the crash. Second, a model
 is derived for pricing American options on jump-diffusion processes with
 systematic jump risk. The jump-diffusion parameters implicit in options
 prices indicate that a crash was expected and that implicit distributions
 were negatively skewed during October 1986 to August 1987. Both approaches
 indicate no strong crash fears during the 2 months immediately preceding
 the crash.

Title: 
 The Effect of Volatility Changes on the Level of Stock Prices and Subsequent Expected Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 985-1007
Issue: 3
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This paper estimates volatility changes in daily returns to the Dow Jones
 Industrial Average over the sample period 1897 through 1988. This allow a
 direct investigation of the reaction of the level of stock prices and
 subsequent expected returns to these estimated changes in volatility. The
 authors provide empirical evidence consistent with relatively large and
 systematic revisions in stock prices and subsequent expected returns to
 volatility changes. However, there appears to be an asymmetry in the
 market's reaction to volatility increases as opposed to volatility
 decreases. A majority of their volatility changes cannot be associated
 with the release of significant economic information.

Title: 
 Information Asymmetries and Security Market Design: An Empirical Study of the Secondary Market for U.S. Government Securities.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 929-53
Issue: 3
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the empirical implications of an information
 asymmetry between primary and secondary dealers in the U.S. government
 securities market. This asymmetry arises because primary dealers are
 permitted to trade through all brokers operating in the market place while
 secondary dealers are restricted to trade through only a subset of
 brokers. Brokers distribute valuable information over video screens to
 their trading clients including dealers' up-to-date bid-ask spreads and
 recent transaction prices. As such, all brokers' video screen information
 is available to primary dealers, while only a subset of brokers'
 information is available to secondary dealers. Empirical analyses detect
 the resulting information asymmetry.

 Order Form and Information in Securities Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 905-27
Issue: 3
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the effects of price-contingent orders on security
 prices. The authors show that a market maker who knows the type and
 composition of trades will set larger spreads and adjust prices faster
 than if price-contingent orders were not allowed. Because traders have
 rational expectations over the book, the authors demonstrate that
 uncertainty over order type reduces the variance of prices but with a
 corresponding loss in price informativeness. They also show that the
 sequence property of price-contingent orders increases the probability of
 large price movements. This distinction between variance and episodic
 price volatility has important policy implications.

Title: 
 Venture Capitalist Certification in Initial Public Offerings.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 879-903
Issue: 3
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This paper provides support for the certification role of venture
 capitalists in initial public offerings (IPOs). Consistent with the
 certification hypothesis, a comparison of venture capital backed IPOs with
 a control sample of nonventure capital backed IPOs from the 1983 through
 1987 matched as closely as possible by industry and offering size
 indicates that venture capital backing results in significantly lower
 initial returns and gross spreads. In effect, the presence of venture
 capitalist in the issuing firms serves to lower the total costs of going
 public and to maximize the net proceeds to the offering firm. In addition,
 the authors document that venture capitalists retain a significant portion
 of their holdings in the firm after the IPOs.

Title: 
 Negotiated Block Trades and Corporate Control.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 861-78
Issue: 3
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 The authors identify negotiated trades of large-percentage blocks of
 stock as corporate control transactions. When a block trades and the firm
 is not fully acquired, cumulative abnormal returns average 5.6 percent and
 33 percent of the chief executives are replaced within a year. Stock-price
 increases are larger when control passes to the new blockholder, when
 management does not resist the blockholder's effort to influence corporate
 policy, and when the block purchaser eventually fully acquires the firm.
 These findings suggest that the specific skills and expertise of
 blockholders, and not just the concentration of ownership, are important
 determinants of firm value.

Title: 
 Ex-dividend Day Stock Price Behavior: The Case of the 1986 Tax Reform Act.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 845-59
Issue: 3
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This paper analyzes the behavior of stock prices around ex-dividend days
 after the implementation of the 1986 Tax Reform Act that dramatically
 reduced the difference between the tax treatment of realized long-term
 capital gains and dividend income in 1987 and completely eliminated the
 differential in 1988. The author shows that this tax change had no effect
 on the ex-dividend stock price behavior, which is consistent with the
 hypothesis that long-term individual investors have no significant effect
 on ex-day stock prices during this time period. The results indicate that
 the activity of short-term traders and corporate traders dominates the
 price determination on the ex-day.

Title: 
 Stock and Compensation.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 803-23
Issue: 3
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 Compensation planning within firms creates important corporate financial
 problems. Theoretical models and empirical tests of hypotheses in this
 area should play a much larger role than currently in the modern theory of
 corporate finance. Employees fund a large proportion of their firm's
 activities through deferred compensation arrangements tied to the
 performance of their company. These arrangements are generally put in
 place for incentive reasons, to align the interests of employees more
 closely with those of shareholders. Moreover, tax rules encourage or
 discourage these arrangements at various times. Currently, both tax rules
 and incentive considerations encourage stock buyback programs to fund
 deferred compensation arrangements. Prior to the 1980s, however, tax rules
 favored funding in other than company stock, implying that employees
 likely held company stock for incentive and not for tax reasons during
 this time period.

 The Valuation Effects of Private Placements of Convertible Debt.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 5
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Share price reactions to announcements of sixty-one private placements of
 convertible debt securities are investigated and a significant positive
 average abnormal return of 1.80 percent is documented. This unique result
 contrasts with the negative average abnormal return associated with public
 sales of convertible debt securities. The positive effect on common
 shareholders' wealth appears to be related to the relative size of the
 private issue and unrelated to the degree to which the convertible bond is
 "out-of-the-money" at issuance.

 New Evidence on the January Effect before Personal Income Taxes.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1909-24
Issue: 5
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors examine the returns of stocks in the Cowles Industrial Index
 before and after the introduction of personal income taxes in 1917. This
 is distinct from earlier studies because they cross-sectionally analyze
 the relationship between the returns of the individual stocks and measures
 of tax-loss selling potential and size. The authors find that excess
 returns at the turn-of-the-year and for the month of January were not
 significant until after 1917. These results provide strong support for the
 tax-loss selling hypothesis as an explanation for the January seasonal in
 the returns of small firms.

Abstract:

 This paper focuses on the valuation of caps, floors, and collars in a
 contingent claim framework under continuous time. These instruments are
 interpreted as options on traded zero coupon bonds. The bond prices
 themselves are used as the underlying stochastic variables. This has the
 advantage that the authors end up with closed-form solutions that are easy
 to compute. Special attention is devoted to the choice of the stochastic
 process appropriate for the price dynamics of the underlying zero coupon
 bonds.

 Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics: Application to Financial Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1839-77
Issue: 5
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 After the stock market crash of October 19, 1987, interest in nonlinear
 dynamics, especially deterministic chaotic dynamics, has increased in both
 the financial press and the academic literature. This has come about
 because the frequency of large moves in stock markets is greater than
 would be expected under a normal distribution. There are a number of
 possible explanations. A popular one is that the stock market is governed
 by chaotic dynamics. What exactly is chaos and how is it related to
 nonlinear dynamics? How does one detect chaos? Is there chaos in financial
 markets? Are there other explanations of the movements of financial prices
 other than chaos? The purpose of this paper is to explore these issues.

 Dynamic Stock Markets with Multiple Assets: An Experimental Analysis.

Volume: 46

Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors study the performance of the rational expectations hypothesis
 in multiperiod experimental markets with multiple assets. They find that
 the markets are generally inefficient from the point of view of full
 information aggregation. However, arbitrage relationships hold and it is
 not possible to detect the informational inefficiency by using some
 standard tests of market efficiency. These findings suggest that the lack
 of arbitrage opportunities and the failure of common tests to reject
 inefficiency are not sufficient to conclude that a market is
 informationally efficient.

Abstract:

 This paper investigates the efficiency of the market for stock index
 futures and the profitability of index arbitrage for the Chicago Board of
 Trade's Major Market Index contracts. The spot value of the index is
 computed with transactions prices for the component shares of the index
 obtained from the Fitch database. The tests account for transaction costs,
 execution lags, and the uptick rule for short sales of stocks. Results
 indicate that the size and frequency of boundary violations are
 substantially smaller than those reported by earlier studies and have
 declined sharply with time.

Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors study the joint effect of the trading mechanism and the time
 at which transactions take place on the behavior of stock returns using
 data from Japan. The Tokyo Stock Exchange employs a periodic clearing
 procedure twice a day, at the opening of both the morning and the
 afternoon sessions. This enables them to discern the effect of the
 clearing mechanism from the effect of the overnight trading halt. While
 the periodic clearing at the beginning of the trading day is noisy and
 inefficient, the midday clearing transaction appears to be no worse than
 the two closing transactions.

 Fundamentals and Stock Returns in Japan.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 5
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper relates cross-sectional differences in returns on Japanese
 stocks to the underlying behavior of four variables: earnings yield, size,
 book to market ratio, and cash flow yield. Alternative statistical
 specifications and various estimation methods are applied to a
 comprehensive, high-quality data set that extends from 1971 to 1988. The
 sample includes both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms, companies
 from both sections of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and also delisted
 securities. The authors' findings reveal a significant relationship
 between these variables and expected returns in the Japanese market. Of
 the four variables considered, the book to market ratio and cash flow
 yield have the most significant positive impact on expected returns.

 On the Good News in Equity Carve-Outs.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1717-37
Issue: 5
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The announcement of the sale of equity in a wholly owned subsidiary of a
 corporation is received by the market as good news about the value of the
 existing equity in the parent corporation. This is in stark contrast to
 announcements of other forms of public equity financing . The authors show
 that the apparent inconsistency between the market response to equity
 carve-out announcements and other forms of equity financing can be easily
 understood in the Myers and Majluf (1984) framework. It is shown that
 firms that resort to an equity carve-out will be firms that, on average,

Title: 
 The Effect of Business Risk on Corporate Capital Structure: Theory and Evidence.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1693-715
Issue: 5
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Under corporate and personal taxation, the authors demonstrate that the
 relation between optimal debt level and business risk is roughly U-shaped.
 This result follows from the fact that the tax liability is an option
 portfolio that is long in the corporate tax option and short in the
 personal tax option. Therefore, the net effect of a change in business
 risk on the optimal debt level depends upon the relative magnitudes of the
 resultant marginal changes in the values of these two options. Results of
 empirical tests offer support for the predicted U-shaped relationship.

Title: 
 Stock Prices and the Supply of Information.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1665-91
Issue: 5
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors develop a model in which the dependence of the brokerage
 commission rate on share price provides an incentive for brokers to
 produce research reports on firms with low share prices. Stock splits,
 therefore, affect the attention paid to a firm by investment analysts.
 Managers with favorable private information about their firms have an
 incentive to split their firm's shares in order to reveal the information
 to investors. The authors find empirical evidence that is consistent with
 the major new prediction of the model that the number of analysts
 following a firm is inversely related to its share price.

Title: 
 Optimal Financial Instruments.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1645-63
Issue: 5
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Debt and equity are developed as optimal financial instruments in a model
 where cash flows and control rights are allocated to investors
 endogenously. When investment decisions must be made by a single party,
 the debtholder's cash flows are fixed in order to provide the equityholder
 with efficient incentives for investment. Ownership of control may be
 transferred to the debtholder to attenuate the impact of asymmetric
 information, concerning the investment opportunity, on the efficiency of
 the decision-making.

Title: 
 Debt, Agency Costs, and Industry Equilibrium.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1619-43
Issue: 5
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors show that risk characteristics of projects' cash flows are
 endogenously determined by the investment decisions of all firms in an
 industry. As a result, in reasonable settings, financial structures which
 create incentives to expropriate debtholders by increasing risk are shown
 not to reduce value in an industry equilibrium. Without taxes, capital
 structure is irrelevant for individual firms despite its effect on the
 equityholders' incentives, but the maximum total amount of debt in the
 industry is determinate. Allowing for a corporate tax advantage of debt,
 capital structure becomes relevant but firms are indifferent between
 distinct alternative debt levels.

 Corporate Capital Structure, Agency Costs, and Ownership Control: The Case of All-Equity Firms.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1325-31
Issue: 4
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper provides evidence that all-equity firms exhibit greater levels
 of managerial stockholdings, more extensive family relationships among top
 management, and higher liquidity positions than a matched sample of
 levered firms. Further, top managers of all-equity firms with family
 involvement in corporate operations have greater control of corporate
 voting rights than managers of all-equity firms without family
 involvement. These findings are consistent with the interpretation that
 managerial control of voting rights and family relationships among senior
 managers are important factors in the decision to eliminate leverage.

Title: 
 Optimal Hedging under Intertemporally Dependent Preferences.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1315-24
Issue: 4
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper examines optimal hedging behavior in a market where
 preferences for current consumption are partly determined by the
 consumer's past consumption history. The model considers an individual
 exposed to price risk, who allocates wealth between consumption and
 futures contracts over a (continuous-time) finite planning horizon. The
 speculative component of the hedge ratio is shown to be smaller and the
 consumption path smoother than in models where preferences are separable
 over time. Some comparative-static properties of the hedge ratio are also
 examined.

 Time Varying Term Premia and Traditional Hypotheses about the Term Structure.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1307-14
Issue: 4
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Empirical evidence of time varying term premia in bond returns is
 frequently interpreted as evidence against the expectations hypothesis.
 This paper shows that the expectations hypothesis can actually imply time
 varying term premia if the time frame for which the expectations
 hypothesis holds differs from the return measurement period. Furthermore,
 many of the properties of these term premia are consistent with those of
 observed term premia. These results are important because they imply that
 the case against the expectations hypothesis is weaker than claimed in the
 empirical literature.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1297-1306

Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper finds a high correlation between the open to close returns for
 U.S. stocks in the previous trading day and the Japanese equity market
 performance in the current period. In contrast, the Japanese market has
 only a small impact on the U.S. return in the current period. High
 correlations among open to close returns are a violation of the efficient
 market hypothesis; however, in trading simulation, the excess profits in
 Japan vanish when transactions costs and transfer taxes are included.

 The Effects of Stock Splits on Bid-Ask Spreads.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1285-95
Issue: 4
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the effects of stock splits on bid-ask spreads for
 NYSE-listed companies. Percentage spreads increase after splits,
 representing a liquidity cost to investors. These spread increases are
 directly related to decreases in share prices following splits and can
 explain part, but not all, of the observed increase in return variability
 after splits. The evidence, thus, suggests a liquidity cost of stock
 splits that must be weighed against any other perceived benefits of
 splits. Such a liquidity cost may validate that stock splits are a signal
 of favorable information about the firm.

Title: 
 Insider Trading in the OTC Market.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1273-84
Issue: 4
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 In this paper, the authors examine the profitability of insider trading
 in firms whose securities trade in the OTC/NASDAQ market. Although the
 evidence suggests timing and forecasting ability on the part of insiders,
 high transaction costs (especially bid-ask spreads) appear to eliminate
 the potential for positive abnormal returns from active trading. By
 implication, outside investors who mimic the trading of insiders are also
 precluded from earning abnormal profits. In addition, the authors provide
 evidence on the determinants of insiders' profits. The data suggest that
 insiders closer to the firm trade on more valuable information than
 insiders removed from the firm.

 Turn-of-Month Evaluations of Liquid Profits and Stock Returns: A Common Explanation for the Monthly and January Effects.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1259-72
Issue: 4
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper presents and tests a hypothesis that the standardization of
 payments in the United States at the turn of each calendar month generally
 induces a surge in stock returns at the turn of each calendar month. The
 hypothesis also asserts that returns generally will be greater following
 the month of December and will vary inversely with the stringency of
 monetary policy. Empirical results using stock index returns for 1969-86
 support the hypothesis. This analysis provides an explanation for the
 previously documented monthly effect in stock returns and a partial
 explanation for the January effect.

 Stock Returns and Real Activity: A Century of Evidence.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1237-57
Issue: 4
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper analyzes the relation between real stock returns and real
 activity from 1889 to 1988. It replicates Eugene F. Fama's (1990) results
 for the 1953-87 period using an additional sixty-five years of data. It
 also compares two measures of industrial production in the tests: (1) the
 series produced by Babson for 1889-1918, spliced with the Federal Reserve
 Board index of industrial production for 1919-88, and (2) the new Miron
 and Romer (1989) index spliced with the Federal Reserve Board index in
 1941. Fama's findings are robust for a much longer period--future
 production growth rates explain a large fraction of the variation in stock
 returns. The new Miron-Romer measure of industrial production is less
 closely related to stock price movements than the older Babson and Federal
 Reserve Board measures.

 The Behavior of Eurocurrency Returns across Different Holding Periods and Monetary Regimes.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1211-36
Issue: 4
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Recent empirical studies of the risk premium across foreign exchange and
 other asset markets, such as equity and longer term bonds, have found
 conflicting evidence about the latent variable model restrictions of the
 consumption-based intertemporal capital asset pricing model. While studies
 using data for holding periods of one month or less generally reject the
 model, evidence using three-month holding periods indicates that the model
 cannot be rejected when including the returns on long relative to short
 deposit rates. This paper investigates the sources of differences in
 results using returns on foreign exchange and Eurocurrency deposits at
 three different maturities.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1181-209
Issue: 4
Volume: 45
Year: 1990

Abstract:

 This paper uses a sample of over 25,000 daily warrant prices to
 empirically investigate potential problems with the commonly used warrant
 pricing model proposed by F. Black and M. Scholes as an extension of their
 call option model. One problem seems to be especially important: the
 constant variance assumption of the dilution adjusted Black-Scholes model
 appears to cause biases in model prices for almost all warrants and over
 the entire sample period. The authors show that more accurate price
 forecasts are obtained with a specific form of the constant elasticity of
 variance model.

 Liquidity of the CBOE Equity Options.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1157-79
Issue: 4
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The author examines the CBOE option market depth and bid-ask spreads.
 Absence of price effects surrounding large option trades suggests
 excellent market depth. However, bid-ask spreads for the CBOE options and
 the NYSE stocks are nearly equal, even though an average option is
 equivalent to less than half a stock plus borrowing. The author explains
 this trade-off between market depth and bid-ask spreads on the CBOE and
 the NYSE by differences in market mechanisms. The author also shows that
 the adverse-selection component of the option spread, which measures the
 extent of information-related trading on the CBOE, is very small.

Title: 
 Heteroskedasticity in Stock Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1129-55
Issue: 4
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors use predictions of aggregate stock return variances from
 daily data to estimate time-varying monthly variances for size-ranked
 portfolios. The authors propose and estimate a single factor model of
 heteroskedasticity for portfolio returns. This model implies time-varying
 betas. Implications of heteroskedasticity and time-varying betas for tests
 of the capital asset pricing model are then documented. Accounting for
 heteroskedasticity increases the evidence that risk-adjusted returns are
 related to firm size. The authors also estimate a constant correlation
 model. Portfolio volatilities predicted by this model are similar to those
 predicated by more complex multivariate generalized autoregressive
 conditional heteroskedasticity procedures.

Title: 
 Predicting Stock Returns in an Efficient Market.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1109-28
Issue: 4
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 An intertemporal general equilibrium model relates financial asset
 returns to movements in aggregate output. The model is a standard
 neoclassical growth model with serial correlation in aggregate output.
 Changes in aggregate output lead to attempts by agents to smooth
 consumption, which affects the required rate of return on financial
 assets. Since aggregate output is serially correlated and, hence,
 predictable, the theory suggests that stock returns can be predicted based
 on rational forecasts of output. The empirical results confirm that stock
 returns are a predictable function of aggregate output and also support
 the accompanying implications of the model.

Title: 
 Stock Returns, Expected Returns, and Real Activity.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1089-1108
Issue: 4
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Measuring the total return variation explained by shocks to expected cash
 flows, time-varying expected returns, and shocks to expected returns is
 one way to judge the rationality of stock prices. Variables that proxy for
 expected returns and expected-return shocks capture 30 percent of the
 variance of annual NYSE value-weighted returns. Growth rates of
 production, used to proxy for shocks to expected cash flows, explain 43
 percent of the return variance. Whether the combined explanatory power of
 the variables--about 58 percent of the variance of annual returns--is good
 or bad news about market efficiency is left for the reader to judge.

Title: 
 Asymmetric Information, Bank Lending, and Implicit Contracts: A Stylized Model of Customer Relationships.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1069-87
Issue: 4
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Customer relationships arise between banks and firms because, in the
 process of lending, a bank learns more than others about its own
 customers. This information asymmetry allows lenders to capture some of
 the rents generated by their older customers; competition, thus, drives
 banks to lend to new firms at interest rates that initially generate
 expected losses. As a result, the allocation of capital is shifted toward
 lower quality and inexperienced firms. This inefficiency is eliminated if
 complete contingent contracts are written or, when this is costly, if
 banks can make nonbinding commitments that, in equilibrium, are backed by
 reputation.

Title: 
 Initial Public Offerings and Underwriter Reputation.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1045-67
Issue: 4
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the returns earned by subscribing to initial public
 offerings of equity. K. Rock (1986) suggests that initial public offerings
 of equity returns are required by uninformed investors as compensation for
 the risk of trading against superior information. The authors show that
 initial public offerings of equity with more informed investor capital
 require higher returns. The marketing underwriter's reputation reveals the
 expected level of "informed" activity. Prestigious underwriters are
 associated with lower risk offerings. With less risk there is less
 incentive to acquire information and fewer informed investors.
 Consequently, prestigious underwriters are associated with initial public
 offerings of equity that have lower returns.

Title: 
 Equity Issues and Stock Price Dynamics.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1019-43
Issue: 4
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper presents an information-theoretic, infinite-horizon model of
 the equity issue decision. The model predicts that equity issues on
 average are preceded by an abnormal positive return on the stock, although
 for some firms the issue is preceded by a loss; equity issues on average
 are preceded by an abnormal rise in the market; and the stock price drops
 at the announcement of an issue. The model provides a measure of the
 welfare cost of asymmetric information; the welfare loss may be small even
 if the price drop at issue announcement is large.

 Shareholder Preferences and Dividend Policy.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 4
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper develops a theory of choice among alternative procedures for
 distributing cash from corporations to shareholders. Despite the
 preferential tax treatment of capital gains for individual investors, it
 is shown that a majority of a firm's shareholders may support a dividend
 payment for small distributions. For larger distributions, an open-market
 stock repurchase is likely to be preferred by a majority of shareholders
 and, for the largest distributions, tender offer repurchases dominate.

Title: 
 Stochastic Convenience Yield and the Pricing of Oil Contingent Claims.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 959-76
Issue: 3
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This paper develops and empirically tests a two-factor model for pricing
 financial and real assets contingent on the price of oil. The factors are
 the spot price of oil and the instantaneous convenience yield. The
 parameters of the model are estimated using weekly oil futures contract
 prices from January 1984 to November 1988, and the model's performance is
 assessed out of sample by valuing futures contracts over the period
 November 1988 to May 1989. Finally, the model is applied to determine the
 present values of one barrel of oil deliverable in one to ten years time.

 Pricing Options with Extendible Maturities: Analysis and Applications.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 935-57
Issue: 3
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 Many common types of financial contracts incorporates options with
 extendible maturities. This paper derives closed-form expressions for
 options that can be extended by the optionholder and presents a number of
 applications including the valuation of American options with stochastic
 dividends, junk bonds, and shared-equity mortgages. We also derive
 closed-form expressions for writer-extendible options and discuss the
 writer's economic incentives for extending an out-of-the-money option. We
 apply these results to show that corporate debtholders have a strong
 incentive to extend the maturity of defaulting debt if there are
 liquidation costs. We model and solve the debtholders' optimal extension
 problem and show that the possibility of an extension can induce
 shareholders in highly levered firms to accept negative NPV projects.

Abstract:

 This paper presents new empirical evidence of predictability of
 individual stock returns. The negative first-order serial correlation in
 monthly stock returns is highly significant. Furthermore, significant
 positive serial correlation is found at longer lags, and the twelve-month
 serial correlation is particularly strong. Using the observed systematic
 behavior of stock return, one-step-ahead return forecasts are made and ten
 portfolios are formed from the forecasts. The difference between the
 abnormal returns on the extreme decile portfolios over the period 1934-87
 is 2.49 percent per month.

Title: 
 Stock Dividends, Stock Splits, and Signaling.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 857-79
Issue: 3
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This paper provides evidence that firms signal their private information
 about future earnings by their choice of split factor. Split factors are
 increasing in earnings forecast errors, after controlling for differences
 in pre-split price and firm size. Further more, price changes at stock
 dividend and split announcements are significantly correlated with split
 factors, holding other factors constant, and with earnings forecast
 errors. These correlations suggest that management's choice of split
 factor signals private information about future earnings and that
 investors revise their beliefs about firm value accordingly. The analysis
 also suggests, however, that announcement returns are significantly
 correlated with split factors after controlling for earnings forecast
 errors. This suggests that earnings forecast errors measure management's
 private information about future earnings with error, that split factors
 signal other valuation-relevant attributes, or that a signaling
 explanation is incomplete.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 817-33

Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This paper presents evidence that the distribution of target ownership is
 related to the division of the takeover gain between the target and the
 bidder for a sample of successful tender offers. In the whole sample, the
 target's gain is negatively related to bidder and institutional ownership.
 In the sample of multiple-bidder contests, the target's gain increases
 with managerial ownership and falls with institutional ownership.

Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 The authors investigate a class of agency costs of debt that arise
 because debt financing affects the firm's incentives to use inputs
 efficiently. A methodology for estimating this class of costs is presented
 and applied to a major industry--air transport. The authors' results are
 consistent with agency models that predict a decrease in efficiency as the
 debt increases. A part of the loss of efficiency that they identify is
 attributable to the greater use by levered firms of inputs that can be
 monitored and are collateralizable.

 Principal-Agent Problems in S&L Salvage.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 755-64
Issue: 3
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 New legislation and traditional FDIC insolvency-resolution procedures
 transform and intensify the principal-agent problems most responsible for
 the FSLIC mess. These problems explain counterproductive constraints on
 the governance and operating policies of the agency responsible for
 rescuing and salvaging assets in insolvent thrifts: the Resolution Trust
 Corporation (RTC). The constraints slow insolvency resolution, increase
 interim financing costs, and undermine RTC recovery of asset value.
 Operationalizing its task as preserving evanescent and economically
 misconceived "franchise values," the RTC allows insolvents to seek
 financing on an unconsolidated basis, initiates bidding for one
 institution at a time, holds back seriously troubled assets, and recruits
 an overly narrow range of bidders.

Title: 
 Determinants of Thrift Institution Resolution Costs.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 731-54
Issue: 3
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This paper provides a detailed examination of the cost imposed by thrift
 institutions resolved during the period 1980-88. A simple model is
 presented to explain the cost of resolution. This model is tested
 empirically with a comprehensive data set that permits us to avoid some of
 the econometric problems present in earlier studies. The empirical
 evidence suggests that the model that explains resolution costs in the
 late 1980s is significantly different from the model for either the middle
 or early 1980s. This evidence is consistent with the changing nature of
 the thrift crisis and changes in the regulator's closure rule. Our
 econometric evidence, moreover, is consistent with the hypothesis that,
 for troubled institutions, tangible net worth systematically understates
 market-value net worth. In addition, the importance of including time
 effects as well as institution effects as determinants of the cost of
 resolution is revealed.

Abstract:

 This study reexamines the earlier finding of Michael J. Alderson and K.
 C. Chen (1986) that financial markets do not consider excess pension
 assets in determining share prices and that significant increases in
 shareholder wealth occur when an overfunded pension plan is terminated.
 The results document that specific event-time contamination (corporate
 restructuring announcements) provides the driving force for all the
 earlier findings.

 The Relative Termination Experience of Adjustable to Fixed-Rate Mortgages.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1687-1703
Issue: 5
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors' study uses a multinomial logit model to analyze the
 concurrent termination experience of adjustable-rate and fixed-rate
 mortgages. A new set of adjustable-rate-mortgage-specific interactive
 determinants expands the conventional fixed-rate-mortgage specification to
 isolate the unique termination behavior of adjustable-rate mortgages. The
 authors find that expected rate adjustments and large lifetime caps are
 positively related to adjustable-rate-mortgage termination probabilities,
 while long adjustment frequencies are inversely related. Caps, both
 periodic and lifetime, have a secondary, inverse effect on termination
 probabilities when interest-rate movements exceed cap limits. The model
 also shows that interest-rate expectations affect fixed-rate-mortgage
 terminations more strongly than adjustable-rate-mortgage terminations.

 This paper demonstrates how the incentive of manager-equityholders to
 substitute toward riskier assets, commonly referred to as the "asset
 substitution problem," is related to the level of observable risk in the
 firm. When observable and unobservable risks are sufficiently positively
 correlated, increases (decreases) in observable risk generate the
 incentive for manager-equityholders to increase (decrease) unobservable
 risk. Thus, credible commitments to hedge observable risk can benefit the
 firm's manager-equityholders by reducing the incentive to shift risk and
 the associated agency cost of debt. This provides a positive rationale for
 hedging diversifiable risk at the firm level.

Title: 
 Changes in Interstate Banking Laws: The Impact of Shareholder Wealth.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1663-71
Issue: 5
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This study examines the impact on shareholder wealth of changes in
 interstate banking laws. The research demonstrates that changes in state
 statutes that allow interstate banking have a positive impact on the stock
 prices of regional banking organizations and a negative impact on the
 stock prices of money center banks. Interstate banking statutes initially
 exclude those states in which the money center banks are headquartered.
 The findings provide evidence that, by excluding money center banks from
 expansion across state lines, the competition from the regional banks may
 have an adverse competitive effect on the money center banks.

Title: 
 Performance Measurement under Asymmetric Information and Investment Constraints.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1655-61
Issue: 5
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The fact that investment policies are often restricted appears to have
 been neglected in the performance measurement literature. This paper,
 using a standard information model, shows how the introduction of
 constraints on the proportion of assets to be invested in the market
 affect the expected portfolio returns and the value of a portfolio
 manager's performance. The results are related to the classical Treynor
 and Mazuy (1966) conjectures about characteristic lines.

Title: 
 Product Market Imperfections and Loan Commitments.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1641-53
Issue: 5
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The author shows, in a model of competitive banks, that the
 characteristics of loan contracts are affected by product market
 imperfections in the borrower's industry. A bank loan commitment increases
 the value of a borrower firm operating in an imperfectly competitive
 industry and, thus, dominates a simple loan even in the absence of risk
 sharing considerations and informational asymmetries between the borrower
 and the bank. While it is individually rational for a firm to obtain a
 loan commitment, all the firms in that industry taken together are made
 worse off by the existence of loan commitments.

 Managerial Share Ownership and the Stock Price Effects of Antitakeover Amendment Proposals.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1627-40
Issue: 5
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Studies that test for an average stock price effect of antitakeover
 amendments present different results, disagreeing with respect to both the
 significance and the direction of the effect. This study determines
 whether effects can be identified when managerial share ownership and
 amendment type are considered. Results suggest a negative relation between
 managerial share ownership and the stock price reaction to all but fair
 price amendment proposals.

 High Stock Returns before Holidays: Existence and Evidence on Possible Causes.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1611-26
Issue: 5
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 On the trading day prior to holidays, stocks advance with
 disproportionate frequency and show high mean returns averaging nine to
 fourteen times the mean return for the remaining days of the year. Over
 one third of the total return accruing to the market portfolio over the
 1963-82 period was earned on the eight trading days that fall before
 holiday market closings each year. Examination of hourly preholiday stock
 returns reveals high returns throughout the day. Preholiday stock returns
 in the posttest 1983-86 period are also examined.

Title: 
 The Distribution of Daily Stock Returns and Settlement Procedures: The Paris Bourse.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1601-09
Issue: 5
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 In many countries, settlements take place a fixed number of business days
 after the transaction (United States, Japan). In other countries,
 settlements take place periodically on a fixed date when all transactions
 performed before this date are settled (United Kingdom, France, Italy). In
 both cases, settlement procedures should cause returns not to be
 identically distributed over all days. The effect is likely to be the
 largest on markets where all trades are settled only once a month. An
 empirical investigation of the largest of those markets, the Paris Bourse,
 demonstrates the importance of the settlement procedure on the
 distribution of daily returns.

 Deposit Insurance and Wealth Effects: The Value of Being "Too Big to Fail."

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1587-1600
Issue: 5
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper investigates the effect on bank equity values of the
 Comptroller of the Currency's announcement that some banks were "too big
 to fail" and that for those banks total deposit insurance would be
 provided. Using an event study methodology, the authors find positive
 wealth effects accruing to too-big-to-fail banks, with corresponding
 negative effects accruing to nonincluded banks. They demonstrate that the
 magnitude of these effects differed with bank solvency and size. The
 authors also show that the policy to which the market reacted was that
 suggested by the Wall Street Journal and not that actually intended by the
 Comptroller.

Title: 
 The Quality Delivery Option in Treasury Bond Futures Contracts.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1565-86
Issue: 5
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper uses three methods to estimate quality option values for
 Chicago Board of Trade Treasury bond futures contracts. It presents
 evidence regarding payoffs from exercising this option at delivery,
 estimates from a T-bond futures pricing model that incorporates this
 option, and estimates obtained from an exchange option pricing formula.
 The results indicate that this option is worth considerably less than
 reported by A. Kane and A.  Marcus (1986). For example, payoffs obtained
 by switching from the bond cheapest to deliver three months prior to
 delivery to the one cheapest at time of delivery average less than 0.30
 percentage points of par.

 Sequential Tests of the Arbitrage Pricing Theory: A Comparison of Principal Components and Maximum Likelihood Factors.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1541-64
Issue: 5
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors examine the cross-sectional pricing equation of the arbitrage
 pricing theory using the elements of eigenvectors and the maximum
 likelihood factor loadings of the covariance matrix of returns as measures
 of risk. The results indicate that, for data assumed stationary over
 twenty years, the first vector is a surprisingly good measure of risk when
 compared with either a one-factor or a five-factor model or a five-vector
 model. The authors conclude that principal components analysis may be
 preferred to factor analysis in some circumstances.

Title: 
 Determinants of Secondary Market Prices for Developing Country Syndicated Loans.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1517-40
Issue: 5
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper presents the authors' investigation of the factors that
 determine secondary market prices of developing country syndicated loans.
 Trading volume in this market has almost doubled yearly from 1985 to 1988,
 while average market prices declined from 73 percent to 41 percent of par
 value during the same period. The authors find that loan values depend on
 a country's solvency rather than its liquidity and show that a country's
 adoption of a debt-conversion program significantly decreases its loans'
 market prices. Furthermore, the debt moratoria by Brazil and Peru, as well
 as the developing-country-specific provisions made by U.S. banks, impact
 loan prices negatively.

 International Capital Structure Equilibrium.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1495-1516
Issue: 5
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper develops a theory of capital structure in an international
 setting with corporate and personal taxes. The authors generalize the
 analysis of M. M. Miller (1987) to an international equilibrium
 characterized by differential international taxation and inflation in
 otherwise perfect international capital markets. The authors' analysis
 highlights the key role that corporate tax arbitrage plays in generating
 an international capital structure equilibrium, and they set forth a
 number of mechanisms for tax arbitrage transactions. They close the paper
 by outlining some implications of their analysis for national differences
 in capital structure, the international Fisher effect, and international
 tax effects on yield differentials.

Title: 
 Do Taxes Affect Corporate Financing Decisions?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1471-93
Issue: 5
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper provides clear evidence of substantial tax effects on the
 choice between issuing debt or equity; most studies fail to find
 significant effects. The relationship between tax shields and debt policy
 is clarified. Other papers miss the fact that most tax shields have a
 negligible effect on the marginal tax rate for most firms. New predictions
 are strongly supported by an empirical analysis; the method is to study
 incremental financing decisions using discrete choice analysis. Previous
 researchers examined debt/equity ratios, but tests based on incremental
 decisions should have greater power.

 Security Pricing and Deviations from the Absolute Priority Rule in Bankruptcy Proceedings.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1457-69
Issue: 5
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Claims ultimately awarded to shareholders of firms in reorganization were
 examined for a sample of thirty filings under the 1978 Bankruptcy Reform
 Act. The authors measured the amount paid to shareholders in excess of
 that which they would have received under the absolute priority rule and
 found that this amount represents, on average, 7.6 percent of the total
 awarded to all claimants. Evidence is also reported that common share
 values reflect a significant proportion of value ultimately received in
 violation of absolute priority, suggesting that deviations from the rule
 were expected by the equity markets.

 Defensive Changes in Corporate Payout Policy: Share Repurchases and Special Dividends.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1433-56
Issue: 5
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper examines defensive payouts announced in response to hostile
 corporate control activity. The evidence indicates that the announcement
 of defensive share repurchases is associated with an average negative
 impact on the share price of the target firm. In contrast, special
 dividend payments generally increase the wealth of target-firm
 shareholders. Regardless of payout type, those firms remaining independent
 after the outcome of the corporate control contest experience an abnormal
 share price increase over the duration of the contest. Among these firms
 there are substantial postcontest changes in capital, asset, and ownership
 structure and abnormally high rates of top management turnover.

 Dividend Policy and Financial Distress: An Empirical Investigation of Troubled NYSE Firms.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1415-31
Issue: 5
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper studies the dividend policy adjustments of eighty NYSE firms
 to protracted financial distress as evidenced by multiple losses during
 1980-85. Almost all sample firms reduced dividends, and more than half
 apparently faced binding debt covenants in years they did so. Absent
 binding debt covenants, dividends are cut more often than omitted,
 suggesting that managerial reluctance is to the omission and not simply
 the reduction of dividends. Moreover, managers of firms with long dividend
 histories appear particularly reluctant to omit dividends. Finally, some
 dividend reductions seem strategically motivated, e.g., designed to
 enhance the firm's bargaining positions with organized labor.

 Efficiency and Organizational Structure: A Study of Reverse LBOs.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1389-1413
Issue: 5
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper is a report on seventy-two firms that went public since 1983,
 but previously underwent a full or divisional levereged buy-out. 
 Accounting measures of performance reveal significant improvements in
 profitability, which resulted mainly from these firms' ability to reduce
 costs. Firms experience dramatic increases in leverage at the levereged
 buyout, but the leverage ratios are gradually reduced. The evidence is
 consistent with the hypothesis that the change in the governance structure
 of these firms towards more concentrated residual claims created a new
 organizational structure that is more efficient than its predecessor.

 Overreaction or Fundamentals: Some Lessons from Insiders' Response to the Market Crash of 1987.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1363-88
Issue: 5
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper shows that the 1987 crash was a surprise to corporate
 insiders; insiders became buyers of stock in record numbers immediately
 following the crash; stocks that declined more during the crash were also
 purchased more by insiders; and stocks that were purchased more
 extensively by insiders during October 1987 showed larger positive returns
 in 1988. The overall evidence suggests that overreaction was an important
 part of the crash.

 Arbitrage Asset Pricing under Exchange Risk.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 447-55
Issue: 1
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper extends the arbitrage pricing theory to an international
 setting. Specifying a linear factor return-generating model in local
 currency terms, the author shows that the usual risk-diversification rule
 in the arbitrage pricing theory does not yield a riskless portfolio unless
 currency fluctuations obey the same factor model as asset returns. The
 author then considers an arbitrage portfolio whose exchange risk is hedged
 by foreign riskless bonds. Under the resulting no-arbitrage conditions,
 the expected returns are not on the same hyperplane, unlike the
 closed-economy arbitrage pricing theory, unless they are adjusted by the
 cost of exchange risk hedging.

 Consistency between Predicted and Actual Bid-Ask Quote-Revisions.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 433-46
Issue: 1
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper employs a "transaction" database to study whether observed
 quote revisions are consistent with those predicted by the adverse
 selection and inventory cost theories of the bid-ask spread. The authors
 find that actual quote revisions are consistent with the theoretical
 prediction in only 25 percent of the cases. Furthermore, quote-revision
 patterns are found to be strongly dependent on the level of the
 outstanding spread and, to a lesser extent, on the transaction size. These
 systematic patterns, unrelated to the inventory cost and adverse selection
 theories, are consistent with the effect on quote revisions of the limit
 order book and the minimum 1/8 price-change rule.

Title: 
 Volatility Increases Subsequent to NYSE and AMEX Stock Splits.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 421-31
Issue: 1
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The post-split increase in daily returns volatility is less for AMEX
 stocks than for NYSE stocks. The exchange trading location is a
 significant factor in explaining the volatility shift even after stock
 price and firm size are considered. Furthermore, when measured on a weekly
 basis, there is no increase in AMEX stocks' returns volatility. These
 results suggest that measurement errors created by bid-ask spreads and the
 1/8 effect, and also one or more of the elements that make the NYSE
 different from the AMEX, explain why the estimated volatility of daily
 stock returns increases after the ex split date.

Title: 
 Tobin's Q and the Gains from Takeovers.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 409-19
Issue: 1
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper analyzes the relation between takeover gains and the q rations
 of targets and bidders for a sample of 704 mergers and tender offers over
 the period 1972-87. Target, bidder, and total returns are larger when
 targets have low q ratios and bidders have high q ratios. The relation is
 strengthened after controlling for the characteristics of the offer and
 the contest. This evidence confirms the results of the work by L.  Lang,
 R. Stulz, and R. A. Walkling (1989) and shows that their findings also
 hold for mergers and after controlling for other determinants of takeover
 gains.

Title: 
 Taxes and the Capital Structure of Partnerships, REIT's, and Related Entities.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 401-07
Issue: 1
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Academic finance has explored the effect of taxes on corporate capital
 structure in great detail. By contrast, the effect of taxes on the capital
 structure of partnerships, real estate investment trusts, and related
 entities has received little attention. The present paper shows that,
 under general conditions, the values of partnerships and real estate
 investment trusts are invariant to leverage, contradicting the sparse
 literature in the area. A proof similar to that of Modigliani-Miller is
 employed. The effect of real world imperfections is also examined.

Title: 
 The Effect of Taxes on the Relative Valuation of Dividends and Capital Gains: Evidence from Dual-Class British Investment Trusts.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 383-99
Issue: 1
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors provide evidence that taxes affect equity valuation by
 studying British investment trusts having otherwise identical classes of
 cash- and stock-dividend-paying shares outstanding. The authors study
 1969-82, a period in which there were two dramatic changes in tax policy.
 They find that stock-dividend shares, which are convertible into
 cash-dividend shares, sell at premiums when the tax system favors capital
 gains and at discounts when the tax advantage of capital gains is reduced.
 After the 1975 elimination of the tax advantage to stock-dividend shares,
 the authors observe that investors convert virtually all stock-dividend
 shares into cash-dividend shares.

 Evidence on Tax-Motivated Securities Trading Behavior.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 369-82
Issue: 1
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Tax-loss selling by investors in common stocks near the end of calendar
 years has been proposed as an explanation for the turn-of-the-year effect
 in stock returns. Past analyses of this hypothesis have relied on
 inferential data. The authors provide here some direct data from a
 compilation of over 80,000 actual common stock investment round trips by a
 sample of 3,000 individual investors. The authors find strong evidence of
 a concentration of loss-taking trades late in the year and milder evidence
 of a concentration just prior to the dates when investments become
 eligible for long-term tax treatment.

Title: 
 Payout Policy and Tax Deferral.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 357-68
Issue: 1
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Equilibrium in the standard finance model implies that value-maximizing
 firms make taxable equity payouts, even when deferral effectively allows
 complete tax escape. Since tax deferral and consumption deferral are
 inherently jointly supplied goods, an excess aggregate supply of future
 consumption would result if firms followed conventional wisdom and adopted
 low or zero payout policies to capture tax deferral benefits. The market
 provides incentives for firms to supply both taxable payouts and capital
 gains by overriding any tax deferral advantage, just as it provided
 incentives for equity financing by overriding the corporate tax advantage
 of debt in "Debt and Taxes."

Abstract:

 This paper surveys capital structure theories based on agency costs,
 asymmetric information, product/input market interactions, and corporate
 control considerations (but excluding tax-based theories). For each type
 of model, a brief overview of the papers surveyed and their relation to
 each other is provided. The central papers are described in some detail,
 and their results are summarized and followed by a discussion of related
 extensions. Each section concludes with a summary of the main implications
 of the models surveyed in the section. Finally, these results are
 collected and compared to the available evidence. Suggestions for future
 research are provided.

 Partial Revelation of Information in Experimental Asset Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 265-95
Issue: 1
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors develop a model of market efficiency assuming private
 information is partially revealed to uninformed traders via the behavior
 of those who are informed. This partial revelation of information model is
 tested in fourteen computerized double auction laboratory markets. It
 explains the market value and allocation of purchased information, and
 asset allocations, better than either a fully revealing information model
 (FRE strong-form efficiency) or a nonrevealing expectations model; but it
 takes second place to FRE in explaining asset prices. The authors
 conjecture that refined versions of partial revelation of information may
 provide insight into "technical analysis" and minibubbles in securities
 markets.

Title: 
 Are Stock Returns Predictable? A Test Using Markov Chains.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 239-63
Issue: 1
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper uses a Markov chain model to test the random walk hypothesis
 of stock prices. Given a time series of returns, a Markov chain is defined
 by letting one state represent high returns and the other represent low
 returns. The random walk hypothesis restricts the transition probabilities
 of the Markov change to be equal irrespective of the prior years. Annual
 real returns are shown to exhibit significant nonrandom walk behavior in
 the sense that low (high) returns tend to follow runs of high (low)
 returns in the postwar period.

 Production-Based Asset Pricing and the Link between Stock Returns and Economic Fluctuations.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 209-37
Issue: 1
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper describes a production-based asset pricing model. It is
 analogous to the standard consumption-based model, but it uses producers
 and production functions in the place of consumers and utility functions.
 The model ties stock returns to investment returns (marginal rates of
 transformation), which are inferred from investment data via a production
 function. The production-based model is used to examine forecasts of stock
 returns by business-cycle related variables and the association of stock
 returns with subsequent economic activity.

 Measuring the Information Content of Stock Trades.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 179-207
Issue: 1
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper suggests that the interactions of security trades and quote
 revisions be modeled as a vector autoregressive system. Within this
 framework, a trade's information effect may be meaningfully measured as
 the ultimate price impact of the trade innovation. Estimates for a sample
 of NYSE issues suggest a trade's full price impact arrives only with a
 protracted lag; the impact is a positive and concave function of the trade
 size; large trades cause the spread to widen; trades occurring in the face
 of wide spreads have larger price impacts; and information asymmetries are
 more significant for smaller firms.

Title: 
 After-Hours Stock Prices and Post-Crash Hangovers.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 159-78
Issue: 1
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 After-hours pricing in foreign equity markets of multiple-listed U.S.
 securities appeared to be efficient in predicting New York prices in the
 weeks immediately following the October 1987 crash, but relatively
 uninformative in succeeding months. By contrast, daily changes in New York
 prices appear to be efficiently incorporated in after-hours trading on
 both the Tokyo and London exchanges throughout the sample period. This
 paper suggests that the asymmetry and temporal variations in cross-market
 correlations are consistent with rational investor behavior in equity
 markets with nonzero transaction costs and time-varying share price
 volatility.

 The World Price of Covariance Risk.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 111-57
Issue: 1
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 In a financially integrated global market, the conditionally expected
 return on a portfolio of securities from a particular country is
 determined by the country's world risk exposure. This paper measures the
 conditional risk of seventeen countries. The reward per unit of risk is
 the world price of covariance risk. Although the tests provide evidence on
 the conditional mean variance efficiency of the benchmark portfolio, the
 results show that countries' risk exposures help explain differences in
 performance. Evidence is also presented which indicates that these risk
 exposures change through time and that the world price of covariance risk
 is not constant.

 Investor Sentiment and the Closed-End Fund Puzzle.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 75-109
Issue: 1
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the proposition that fluctuations in discounts of
 closed-end funds are driven by changes in individual investor sentiment.
 The theory implies that discounts on various funds move together, that new
 funds get started when seasoned funds sell at a premium or a small
 discount, and that discounts are correlated with prices of other
 securities affected by the same investor sentiment. The evidence supports
 these predictions. In particular, the authors find that both closed-end
 funds and small stocks tend to be held by individual investors, and that
 the discounts on closed-end funds narrow when small stocks do well.

 Returns and Volatility of Low-Grade Bonds: 1977-1989.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 49-74
Issue: 1
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the risks and returns of long-term low-grade bonds
 for the period 1977-89. The authors find (1) low-grade bonds realized
 higher returns than higher-grade bonds and lower returns than common
 stocks, and low-grade bonds exhibited less volatility than higher-grade
 bonds due to their call features and high coupons; (2) there is no
 relation between the age of low-grade bonds and their relaxed returns;
 cyclical factors explain much of the observed reaction between default
 rates and bond age; and (3) low-grade bonds behave like both bonds and
 stocks. Despite this complexity there is no evidence that low-grade bonds
 are systematically over- or under-priced.

Title: 
 The Investment Performance of Low-Grade Bond Funds.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 29-48
Issue: 1
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This study extends the literature on the pricing of low-grade bonds by
 examining the performance of low-grade bond funds. The findings reveal
 that over the long run low-grade bond fund returns are approximately equal
 to the returns provided by an index of high-grade bonds. The relative
 risks of high and low-grade bonds are more difficult to assess. Because of
 their shorter durations, low-grade bonds are less sensitive to movements
 in interest rates than high-grade bonds. On the other hand, low-grade
 bonds are much more sensitive to changes in stock prices than high-grade
 bonds. When adjusted for risk using a simple two-factor model, the returns
 on low-grade bond funds are not statistically different from the returns
 on high-grade bonds.

Title: 
 The Long-run Performance of Initial Public Offerings.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 3-27
Issue: 1
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The underpricing of initial public offerings that has been widely
 documented appears to be a short-run phenomenon. Issuing firms during
 1975-84 substantially underperformed a sample of matching firms from the
 closing price on the first day of public trading to their three-year
 anniversaries. There is substantial variation in the under performance
 year-to-year and across industries, with companies that went public in
 high-volume years fairing the worst. The patterns are consistent with an
 initial public offering market in which (1) investors are periodically
 overoptimistic about the earnings potential of young growth companies, and
 (2) firms take advantage of these "windows of opportunity."

 A Variance-Ratio Test of Random Walks in Foreign Exchange Rates.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 773-85
Issue: 2
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The separate variance-ratio tests under homoscedasticity and
 heteroscedasticity both provide evidence rejecting the random walk
 hypothesis using five pairs of weekly nominal exchange rate series over
 the period from August 7, 1974, to March 29, 1989. The rejections cast
 doubt on the random walk hypothesis in exchange rates, which has received
 support in the existing literature. Furthermore, since the rejections are
 robust to heteroscedasticity, they suggest autocorrelations of weekly
 increments in the nominal exchange rate series, which may be consistent
 with the exchange rate overshooting or undershooting phenomenon.

Title: 
 An Examination of Ex-dividend Day Stock Price Movements: The Case of Nontaxable Master Limited Partnership Distributions.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 755-71
Issue: 2
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This study examines the unit (stock) price and volume behavior of master
 limited partnerships around the ex-dividend day. Since the dividends of
 master limited partnerships are not taxable to the unitholder, tax-based
 hypotheses predict no abnormal unit movements around the ex-day.
 Significant positive excess returns and volume are found before the
 ex-dividend day, and significant negative excess returns are found on the
 ex-dividend day. The findings, which are not significantly impacted by the
 Tax Reform Act of 1986, suggest ex-day stock movements are not solely a
 function of investor marginal tax rates or corporate trading behavior.

Title: 
 The Reversal of Large Stock-Price Decreases.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 747-54
Issue: 2
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Extremely large negative ten-day rates of return are followed on average
 by larger-than-expected positive rates of return over following days. This
 price adjustment lasts approximately two days and is observed in a sample
 of firms that is largely devoid of methodological problems that might
 explain the reversal phenomenon. While perhaps not representing abnormal
 profit opportunities, these reversals present a puzzle as to the length of
 the price adjustment period. Such a slow recovery is inconsistent with the
 notion that market prices quickly reflect relevant information.

Title: 
 Inferring Trade Direction from Intraday Data.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 733-46
Issue: 2
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper evaluates alternative methods for classifying individual
 trades as market buy or market sell orders using intraday trade and quote
 data. The authors document two potential problems with quote-based methods
 of trade classification: quotes may be recorded ahead of trades that
 triggered them, and trades inside the spread are not readily classifiable.
 These problems are analyzed in the context of the interaction between
 exchange floor agents. The authors then propose and test relatively simple
 procedures for improving trade classifications.

Title: 
 Animal Spirits, Margin Requirements, and Stock Price Volatility.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 717-31
Issue: 2
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 A simple overlapping generations model is used to characterize the
 effects of initial margin requirements in the volatility of risky asset
 prices. Investors are assumed to exhibit heterogenous preferences for
 risk-bearing, the distribution of which evolves stochastically across
 generations. This framework is used to show that imposing a binding
 initial marginal requirement may either increase or decrease stock price
 volatility, depending upon the microeconomic structure behind fluctuations
 in economywide average risk-bearing propensity. The ambiguous effect on
 volatility similarly arises when the source of heterogeneity is noise
 trader beliefs.

Title: 
 The Effects of Stock Repurchases on Rival Firms.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 707-16
Issue: 2
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper investigates the stock price behavior of rival firms in the
 same industry as firms announcing stock repurchase tender offers. Using a
 sample of 134 repurchase announcements, the author finds that rival firms
 on average realize insignificant announcement-period abnormal returns.
 Negative rival stock price performance is detected over longer intervals
 surrounding the announcement period and for a subset of announcements
 which ex ante were identified as most likely to affect rivals. This
 evidence, however, is statistically weak and does little to alter the
 overall conclusion that the information in repurchase announcements is
 primarily firm-specific.

 Event Risk: An Analysis of Losses to Bondholders and "Super Poison Put" Bond Covenants.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 689-706
Issue: 2
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Ten percent of the investment-grade industrial bonds that were associated
 with major capital restructurings between 1983 and 1988 had already been
 downgraded to speculative grade as of August 1989. In response to these
 downgrades and the corresponding wealth losses for bondholders, over 40
 percent of recently issued investment-grade industrial bonds are protected
 from this type of "event risk" by virtue of specialized covenants. These
 event-risk covenants may have initially reduced interest costs for
 borrowers by roughly 20 to 30 basis points. However, the magnitude of the
 effect appears to have declined along with the general decline in
 corporate restructurings.

Title: 
 Corporate Performance, Corporate Takeovers, and Management Turnover.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 671-87
Issue: 2
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the hypothesis that an important role of corporate
 takeovers is to discipline the top managers of poorly performing target
 firms. The authors document that the turnover rate for the top manager of
 target firms in tender offer-takeovers significantly increases following
 completion of the takeover and that prior to the takeover these firms were
 significantly under-performing other firms in their industry as well as
 other target firms which had no post-takeover change in the top executive.
 We interpret the results to indicate that the takeover market plays an
 important role in controlling the nonvalue maximizing behavior of top
 corporate managers.

 The Mode of Acquisition in Takeovers: Taxes and Asymmetric Information.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 653-69
Issue: 2
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors develop a model in which the mode of acquisition conveys
 information concerning the value of the bidder. The model incorporates the
 possibility that offers containing both cash and stock can be made in a
 setting consistent with the U.S. tax code. The authors demonstrate that
 bidders with unfavorable private information about their equity value
 choose offers containing some stock to avoid the capital gains tax on
 sequences of cash offers. The model yields a number of unique predictions
 about the construction of acquisition offers. The authors present evidence
 consistent with the model.

Title: 
 The Price Elasticity of Demand for Common Stock.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 621-51
Issue: 2
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors study the price elasticity of demand for the common stock of
 an individual corporation. Despite the prevalance of assumptions that
 demand is perfectly elastic, there is little, if any, direct evidence in
 the literature to either support or reject that contention. Consistent
 with the notion of finite price elasticities, the authors find that the
 announcement of primary stock offerings by regulated firms depresses their
 stock prices and little, if any, evidence that this decline is the result
 of adverse information about future cash flows. Attempts to relate offer
 announcement effects directly to possible determinants of price
 elasticities, however, are inconclusive.

Title: 
 The Default Risk of Swaps.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 597-620
Issue: 2
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors characterize the exchange of financial claims from risky
 swaps. These transfers are among three groups: shareholders, debtholders,
 and the swap counterparty. From this analysis, the authors derive
 equilibrium swap rates and relate them to debt market spreads. They then
 show that equilibrium swaps in perfect markets transfer wealth from
 shareholders to debtholders. In a simplified case, the authors obtain
 closed-form solutions for the value of the default risk in the swap. For
 interest-rate swaps, they obtain numerical solutions for the equilibrium
 swap rate, including default risk. The authors compare these with
 equilibrium debt market default risk spreads.

 An Exact Solution to a Dynamic Portfolio Choice Problem under Transactions Costs.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 577-95
Issue: 2
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The presence of any friction in financial markets qualitatively changes
 the nature of the optimization problem faced by an investor. It requires
 one to either act or do nothing, an issue which, of course, does not arise
 in frictionless situations. The investor considered here accumulates
 wealth without consuming until some terminal point in time when he
 consumes all. His objective is to maximize the expected utility derived
 from that terminal consumption. We postpone the terminal point far into
 the future to obtain a stationary portfolio rule. The portfolio policy is
 in the form of two control barriers between which portfolio proportions
 are allowed to fluctuate. We show how to calculate them.

 The Term Structure as a Predictor of Real Economic Activity.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 555-76
Issue: 2
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 A positive slope of the yield curve is associated with a future increase
 in real economic activity: consumption (nondurables plus services),
 consumer durables, and investment. It has extra predictive power over the
 index of leading indicators, real short-term interest rates, lagged growth
 in economic activity, and lagged rates of inflation. It outperforms survey
 forecasts, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Historically, the information
 in the slope reflected, inter alia, factors that were independent of
 monetary policy and, thus, the slope could have provided useful
 information both to private investors and to policymakers.

Abstract:

 This paper studies the relation between changes in financial investment
 opportunities and changes in the macroeconomy. States variables, such as
 the lagged production growth rate, the default premium, the term premium,
 the short-term interest rate, and the market dividend-price ratio, are
 shown to be indicators of recent and future economic growth and positively
 correlated with expected future economic growth. These results offer
 straightforward interpretations of recent evidence on the forecasts of the
 market excess return by state variable via their forecasts on the
 macroeconomy.

 Using Generalized Method of Moments to Test Mean-Variance Efficiency.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 511-27
Issue: 2
Volume: 46
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper develops tests of unconditional mean-variance efficiency under
 weak distributional assumptions using a generalized method of moments
 framework. These tests are potentially more robust than commonly employed
 tests which rely on the assumption that asset returns are normally
 distributed and temporarily i.i.d. Using returns for size-based portfolios
 from 1926 to 1988, the authors show that the conclusion concerning the
 mean-variance efficiency of market indexes can be sensitive to the test
 considered.

 Patterns of Productivity in the Finance Literature: A Study of the Bibliometric Distributions.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 301-09
Issue: 1
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This study finds a bibliometric regularity in the finance literature that
 the number of authors publishing n papers is about 1/n(superscript "c") of
 those publishing one paper. The authors find that the finance literature
 conforms very well to the inverse square law(c = 2) if data are taken from
 a large collection of journals. When applied to individual finance
 journals, they find that values of c range from 1.95 to 3.26. They also
 find that top-rated journals have higher concentrations among their
 contributors. This implies that the phenomenon "success breeds success" is
 more common in higher-quality publications.

 Corporate Sale-and-Leasebacks and Shareholder Wealth.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 289-99
Issue: 1
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 In this paper, the authors examine the market valuation effects of
 corporate saleleasebacks. Specifically, they test whether such
 transactions offer a net benefit to lessees or lessors by evaluating the
 impact on share prices from announcements of saleleasebacks of major
 corporate assets. Their evidence indicates that the announcements are
 associated with positive abnormal returns to lessees. They conclude that
 this positive market reaction results from an overall reduction in the
 present value of expected taxes occasioned by the transactions. The
 evidence also suggests that the gains from saleleasebacks accrue solely to
 lessee firms.

Abstract:

 Prior studies report lower issue costs for shelf registered debt and
 conclude that the benefits of increased underwriter competition can be
 realized by those firms using this registration procedure. This study
 reexamines the purported superiority of issuing debt via shelf
 registration, and finds that the savings in issue costs displayed by
 earlier studies can be attributed to a self-selection bias and not the
 method of registration.

 Default Risk and the Duration of Zero Coupon Bonds.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 1
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper applies a contingent claims approach to examine the duration
 of a zero coupon bond subject to default risk. One replicating portfolio
 for a default-prone zero coupon bond contains a long position in the
 default-free asset plus a short position in a put option on the underlying
 assets. The duration of the bond is shown to be a weighted combination of
 the duration of the default-free bond and the put option. The duration is
 less than maturity and is not an immunizing duration. The technique is
 then extended to subordinated debt.

Title: 
 Can Futures Market Data Be Used to Understand the Behavior of Real Interest Rates?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 245-57
Issue: 1
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper examines whether futures market data can be used to understand
 the behavior of real interest rates. Several ways of examining the data
 indicate that futures market data are not particularly informative about
 real interest rates. No only does this evidence cast some doubt on results
 in previous research that make use of futures market data to draw
 inferences about real interest rates, but it also indicates that future
 research on real interest rates may need to turn to a different line of
 attack.

 The Weekend Effect: Trading Patterns of Individual and Institutional Investors.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 231-43
Issue: 1
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 In this paper, the authors document regularities in trading patterns of
 individual and institutional investors related to the day of the week.
 They find a relative increase in trading activity by individuals on
 Mondays. In addition, there is a tendency for individuals to increase the
 number of sell transactions relative to buy transactions, which might
 explain at least part of the weekend effect.

Title: 
 Heteroskedasticity in Stock Return Data: Volume versus GARCH Effects.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 221-29
Issue: 1
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper provides empirical support for the notion that autoregressive
 conditional heteroskedasticity in daily stock return data reflects time
 dependence in the process generating information flow to the market. Daily
 trading volume, used as a proxy for information arrival time, is shown to
 have significant explanatory power regarding the variance of daily
 returns, which is an implication of the assumption that daily returns are
 subordinated to intraday equilibrium returns.	Furthermore, autoregressive
 conditional heteroskedasticity effects tend to disappear when volume is
 included in the variance equation.

Title: 
 Intraday Price Change and Trading Volume Relations in the Stock and Stock Option Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 191-220
Issue: 1
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This study investigates intraday relations between price changes and
 trading volumes of options and stocks for a sample of firms whose options
 traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange during the first quarter of
 1986. After purging the price change series of the effects of bid/ask
 spreads, multivariate time-series analysis is used to estimate the
 lead/lag relation between the price changes in the option and stock
 markets. The results indicate that price changes in the stock market lead
 the option market by as much as fifteen minutes. The analysis of trading
 volume indicates that the stock market lead may be even longer.

Title: 
 Disentangling the Coefficient of Relative Risk Aversion from the Elasticity of Intertemporal Substitution: An Irrelevance Result.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 175-90
Issue: 1
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 For homothetic time and state separable preferences, the coefficient of
 relative risk aversion is equal to the reciprocal of the elasticity of
 intertemporal substitution. This paper shows that, when the growth rate of
 consumption is independent and identically distributed, asset pricing
 models based upon preferences in which the coefficient of relative risk
 aversion and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution are no longer
 linked do not have more explanatory power. Further, in these stochastic
 environments, estimates of the coefficient of relative risk aversion in
 the standard preferences are measures of the true coefficient of relative
 risk aversion and not the elasticity of intertemporal substitutions. These
 results are fairly accurate descriptions of economies calibrated using
 United States annual data.

Title: 
 Purchasing Power Parity in the Long Run.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 157-74
Issue: 1
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper reexamines the evidence on purchasing power parity in the long
 run. Previous studies have generally been unable to reject the hypothesis
 that the real exchange rate follows a random walk. If true, this implies
 that purchasing power parity does not hold. In contrast, this paper casts
 serious doubt on this random walk hypothesis. The results follow from more
 powerful estimation techniques, applied in a multilateral framework.
 Deviations from purchasing power parity, while substantial in the short
 run, appear to take about three years to be reduced in half.

Title: 
 How Target Shareholders Benefit from Value-Reducing Defensive Strategies in Takeovers.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 137-56
Issue: 1
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper shows that target shareholders can be made better-off through
 the use of certain types of defensive strategies that reduce the value of
 the target by different amounts for different bidders. In many cases,
 simply the threat of such strategies can make target shareholders
 better-off. Therefore, empirical tests based on stock price reactions at
 the adoption of defensive strategies may be underestimating the effect of
 such strategies. The paper also identifies the necessary characteristics
 that make these strategies effective and shows that many observed defenses
 possess similar properties.

 Modeling Structural and Temporal Variation in the Market's Valuation of Banking Firms.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 113-36
Issue: 1
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Hidden capital exists whenever the accounting measure of a firm's net
 worth diverges from its economic value. Such unbooked capital has
 on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet sources. This paper develops a
 model to estimate both forms of hidden capital and to test hypotheses
 about their determinants. In effect, the analysis expands the two-index
 model by endogenizing the market and interest-rate sensitivities of any
 stock and decomposing each sensitivity into on-balance-sheet and
 off-balance-sheet elements. For a sample of banks during 1975-85, the
 model finds considerable variation in both forms of hidden capital.

 An Examination of the Impact of the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 on Commercial Banks and Savings and Loans.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Volume: 45
Year: 1990

Abstract:

 This paper evaluates the effects of events leading to the passage of the
 Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982. The evidence
 suggests that the call for reform by President Reagan's Housing Commission
 and the Senate passage of the bill produced positive abnormal returns to
 stockholders of large savings and loans and commercial banks. Stockholders
 of small S&Ls and banks, on the other hand, generally experienced negative
 abnormal returns. Furthermore, when hopes of passage of the act faded,
 significant negative (positive) abnormal returns were experienced by
 stockholders of large (small) S&Ls and banks.

 Equilibrium Block Trading and Asymmetric Information.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 73-94
Issue: 1
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper investigates the existence of equilibria with
 information-based black trading in a multiperiod market when no investor
 is constrained to block trade. Attention is restricted to equilibria in
 which a strategic uninformed institution (i.e., one which is forced to
 rebalance its portfolio, but is free to choose an optimal rebalancing
 strategy) is willing to trade a block rather than "break up" the block
 into a series of smaller trades. Examples of such equilibria are found and
 analyzed.

 Financial Intermediaries and Liquidity Creation.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Trading losses associated with information asymmetries can be mitigated
 by designing securities that split the cash flows of underlying assets. 
 These securities, which can arise endogenously, have values that do not
 depend on the information known only to informed agents. Bank debt
 (deposits) is an example of this type of liquid security that protects
 relatively uninformed agents, and the authors provide a rationale for
 deposit insurance in this content. High-grade corporate debt and
 government bonds are other examples, implying that a money market mutual
 fund based payments system may be an alternative to one based on insured
 bank deposits.

 Do Managerial Objectives Drive Bad Acquisitions?

Journal: Journal of Finance

Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 In a sample of 326 U.S. acquisitions between 1975 and 1987, three types
 of acquisitions have systematically lower and predominantly negative
 announcement period returns to bidding firms. The returns to bidding
 shareholders are lower when their firm diversifies, when it buys a rapidly
 growing target, and when its managers performed poorly before the
 acquisition. These results suggest that managerial objectives may drive
 acquisitions that reduce bidding firms' values.

Title: 
 Margin Regulation and Stock Market Volatility.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 3-29
Issue: 1
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Using daily and monthly stock returns, the authors find no convincing
 evidence that Federal Reserve margin requirements have served to dampen
 stock market volatility. The contrary conclusion, expressed in recent
 papers by Gikas Hardouvelis (1988), is traced to flows in his test design.
 The authors do detect the expected negative relation between margin
 requirements and the amount of margin credit outstanding. They also
 confirm the recent finding by William Schwert (1988) that changes in
 margin requirements by the Fed have tended to follow, rather than lead,
 changes in market volatility.

Abstract:

 Few prediction schemes have been more accurate, and at the same time more
 perplexing, than the Super Bowl Stock Market Predictor, which asserts that
 the league affiliation of the Super Bowl winner predicts stock market
 direction. In this study, the authors examine the record and statistical
 significance of this anomaly and demonstrate that an investor would have
 clearly outperformed the market by reacting to Super Bowl game outcomes.

Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The assumption that the market portfolio follows a specified diffusion
 process implies, in a simple equilibrium framework, that the
 representative individual must have a certain utility function that is
 identified in the paper. Not every diffusion process is viable, i.e., can
 be "endogenized" to be the market portfolio's price process in such an
 equilibrium model. The paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions
 for viability that imply that viable diffusion processes constitute a
 rather restricted family.

 International Interest Rates, Exchange Rates, and the Stochastic Structure of Supply.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 655-71
Issue: 2
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 In a dual-currency, flexible exchange rate model, both nominal and real
 foreign exchange premia depend on investor risk attitudes, consumption
 parameters, and the stochastic structure of currency and commodity
 supplies. When supplies are random, their joint correlation structure
 determines the sign of the premia. If the money supplies are identically
 distributed, then all foreign exchange premia, regardless of the currency
 of denomination, are zero. A positive correlation between the value of a
 country's currency and its nominal interest rate need not indicate real
 interest rate movements. Relative bond prices can be negatively correlated
 with the terms of trade.

 Ownership Structure, Deregulation, and Bank Risk Taking.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 643-54
Issue: 2
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper investigates the relationship between bank ownership structure
 and risk taking. It is hypothesized that stockholder controlled banks have
 incentives to take higher risk than managerially controlled banks and that
 these differences in risk become more pronounced in periods of
 deregulation. In support of this hypothesis, the authors show that
 stockholder controlled banks exhibit significantly higher risk taking
 behavior than managerially controlled banks during the 1979-82 period of
 relative deregulation.

 The Structure of Spot Rates and Immunization.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 629-42
Issue: 2
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Empirical studies of the modern theories of bond pricing typically choose
 proxies for the state variables in a rather arbitrary fashion. This paper
 empirically analyzes the question of the optimal spot rates to use as
 state variables. The authors' findings indicate that the four-year spot
 rate serves as the best proxy in the one-state-variable model. In the case
 of the two-state-variables model, the six-year rate and eight-month rate
 are identified as best. Tests of the out-of-sample prediction ability
 indicate that their model is superior to F. R. Macaulay's duration model
 and alternative proxies for state variables.

 The Effect of Executive Stock Option Plans on Stockholders and Bondholders.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 617-27
Issue: 2
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Executive stock option plans have asymmetric payoffs that could induce
 managers to take on more risk. Evidence from traded call options and stock
 return data supports this notion. Implicit share price variance, computed
 from the Black-Scholes options pricing model, and stock return variance
 increase after the approval of an executive stock option plan. The event
 is accompanied by a significant positive stock and a negative bond market
 reaction. This evidence is consistent with the notion that executive stock
 options may induce a wealth transfer from bondholders to stockholders.

 Corporate Control and the Choice of Investment Financing: The Case of Corporate Acquisitions.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 603-16
Issue: 2
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors test the proposition that corporate control considerations
 motivate the means of investment financing-cash (and debt) or stock.
 Corporate insiders who value control will prefer financing investments by
 cash or debt rather than by issuing new stock, which dilutes their
 holdings and increases the risk of losing control. Their empirical results
 support this hypothesis: in corporate acquisitions, the larger the
 managerial ownership fraction of the acquiring firm the more likely the
 use of cash financing. Also, the previously observed negative bidders'
 abnormal returns associated with stock financing are mainly in

Title: 
 An Examination of Stock Market Return Volatility during Overnight and Intraday Periods, 1964-1989.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 591-601
Issue: 2
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the variance of hourly market returns during 1964-89.
 Results indicate that return volatility falls from the opening hour until
 early afternoon and rises thereafter, and is significantly greater for
 intraday versus overnight periods. Market variance is also shown to change
 significantly over time, rising after NASDAQ began in 1971, rising after
 trading in stock options began in 1973, falling after fixed commissions
 were eliminated in 1975, rising after trading in stock index futures was
 introduced in 1982, and falling after margin requirements for stock index
 futures became larger in 1988.

Title: 
 Statistical Properties of the Roll Serial Covariance Bid/Ask Spread Estimator.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 579-90
Issue: 2
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Exact small sample population moments of the standard serial covariance
 and variance estimators are derived under the assumptions of the Roll
 bid/ask spread models. Noise explains why serial covariance estimates are
 often positive in annual samples of daily and weekly returns. Small sample
 estimator bias partially explains why weekly estimates are more negative
 than daily estimates. Noise causes the Roll spread estimator to be
 severely biased by Jensen's inequality. The French-Roll adjusted variance
 estimator is unbiased but noisy. Empirical tests confirm the major
 implications.

Title: 
 Expectations and the Treasury Bill-Federal Funds Rate Spread over Recent Monetary Policy Regimes.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 467-77
Issue: 2
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper shows that the spread between the three-month Treasury bill
 and the federal funds rate has significant predictive power for the future
 change in the federal funds rate during the volatile nonborrowed reserves
 operating regime, but it has less and no predictive power during the
 borrowed reserves regime and the federal funds targeting regime,
 respectively. These findings suggest that Treasury bill rates forecast
 future federal funds rates most accurately when the Federal Reserve
 follows a well-defined rule that does not smooth the impact of shocks on
 the federal funds rate.

Title: 
 Valuing Flexibility as a Complex Option.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 549-65
Issue: 2
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper develops an approach for valuing flexible production systems
 using contingent claims pricing. Demand curves for the authors' model's
 underlying assets (output products) may be downward sloping, in contrast
 with the standard option pricing assumption. Also, their marginal
 production (exercise) costs may be increasing. In addition, they allow for
 multiple products and a productions capacity constraint. These elements of
 the model result in complex exercise decisions for the contingent claims
 that comprise the production system's value. The authors illustrate their
 approach by valuing a flexible system that produces two products that have
 profit margin functions with stochastic parameters.

Title: 
 International Investment Restrictions and Closed-End Country Fund Prices.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 523-47
Issue: 2
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Some closed-end country funds trade at large premiums relative to their
 net asset values. This paper examines whether international investment
 restrictions raise country fund-price-net-asset value ratios by segmenting
 international capital markets. The authors test whether a relation exists
 between announcements of changes in investment restrictions and changes in
 these ratios using weekly data from May 1981 to January 1989. The results
 provide evidence that some foreign markets are at least partially
 segmented from the U.S. capital markets. Coauthors are Greggory Brauer,
 Robert Neal, and Simon Wheatley.

Title: 
 Evaluating the Performance of International Mutual Funds.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 497-521
Issue: 2
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 In this paper, the authors examine the performance of a sample of fifteen
 U.S.-based internationally diversified mutual funds between 1982 and 1988.
 Two performance measures are used, the Jensen measure and the positive
 period weighting measure proposed by Mark Grinblatt and Sheridan Titman.
 They find no evidence that the funds, either individually or as a whole,
 provide investors with performance that surpasses that of a broad,
 international equity index over this sample period.

Title: 
 Relative Price Variability, Real Shocks, and the Stock Market.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 479-96
Issue: 2
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 In this paper, the authors investigate the effects of relative price
 variability on output and the stock market, and gauge the extent to which
 inflation proxies for relative price variability in stock-return-inflation
 regressions. The evidence shows that the negative stock-return-inflation
 relations proxy for the adverse effects of relative price variability on
 economic activity, particularly during the 1970s, when the United States
 experienced oil supply shocks. Hence, it appears that inflation spuriously
 affects the stock market in two ways: the aggregate output link of E. F. 
 Fama (1981) and the supply shocks reflected in relative price variability.

Title: 
 Anomalous Price Behavior around Repurchase Tender Offers.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 455-77
Issue: 2
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper reports anomalous price behavior around repurchase tender
 offers. Buying shares before the expiration date of a repurchase tender
 offer and tendering to the firm produces, on average, abnormal returns of
 more than 9 percent over a period shorter than one week. In addition, the
 authors find that repurchasing companies experience economically and
 statistically significant abnormal returns in the two years after the
 repurchase. The upward price drift is mainly caused by the behavior of the
 small firms in the sample.

Title: 
 Empirical Estimates of Beta When Investors Face Estimation Risk.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 431-53
Issue: 2
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors examine empirical implications of models of differential
 information that formalize the following intuition: securities for which
 there is relatively little information are perceived as relatively more
 risky because of the greater uncertainty surrounding the exact parameters
 of their return distributions. The implication that beta risk for low
 information firms should decline as information increases is confirmed
 with several data sets. The authors find such a decline over the first
 several periods subsequent to initial public offerings and initial
 listings. There is also an abrupt risk decline at the first annual
 earnings announcement.

Title: 
 Are the Latent Variables in Time-Varying Expected Returns Compensation for Consumption Risk?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 397-429
Issue: 2
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Multibeta asset pricing models are examined using proxies for economic
 state variables in a framework that exploits time-varying expected returns
 to estimate conditional betas. Examples include multiple consumption-beta
 models and models where asset returns proxy for the state variables. When
 the state variables are not specified, the tests indicate two or three
 time-varying expected risk premiums in the sample of quarterly asset
 returns. Conditional betas relative to consumption generate less striking
 evidence against the model than betas relative to asset returns, but both
 the consumption and the market variables fail to proxy for the state
 variables.

Title: 
 Positive Feedback Investment Strategies and Destabilizing Rational Speculation.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 379-95
Issue: 2
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Analyses of rational speculation usually presume that it dampens
 fluctuations caused by "noise" traders. This is not necessarily the case
 if noise traders follow positive-feedback strategies--buy when prices rise
 and sell when prices fall. It may pay to jump on the bandwagon and
 purchase ahead of noise demand. If rational speculators' early buying
 triggers positive-feedback trading, then an increase in the number of
 forward-looking speculators can increase volatility about fundamentals.
 This model is consistent with a number of empirical observations about the
 correlation of asset returns, the overreaction of prices to news, price
 bubbles, and expectations. Coauthors are Andrei Shleifer, Lawrence H.
 Summers, and Robert J. Waldmann.

Title: 
 Corporate Financial Policy and the Theory of Financial Intermediation.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 351-77
Issue: 2
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the optimal structure of financial contracts in an
 economy subject to two forms of moral hazard. Multiple information
 problems are shown to generate a role for multiple classes of financial
 claimants. The author then shows that economic efficiency is enhanced if
 the financial structure of the economy consists of both direct and
 intermediated financial contract markets. Consequently, his results
 demonstrate a motivation for the complementarity between capital markets
 and depository financial institutions.

Title: 
 Capital Structure and the Informational Role of Debt.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 321-49
Issue: 2
Volume: 45
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper provides a theory of capital structure based on the effect of
 debt on investors' information about the firm and on their ability to
 oversee management. The authors postulate that managers are reluctant to
 relinquish control and unwilling to provide information that could result
 in such an outcome. Debt is a disciplining device because default allows
 creditors the option to force the firm into liquidation and generates
 information useful to investors. The authors characterize the time path of
 the debt level and obtain comparative statics results on the debt level,
 bond yield, probability of default, probability of reorganization, etc.
