Title: 
 Moral Hazard and the Portfolio Management Problem.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 2009-28
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper investigates the significance of nonlinear contracts on the
 incentive for portfolio managers to collect information. In addition, the
 manager must be motivated to disclose this information truthfully. The
 author analyzes three contracting regimes: (1) first-best where effort is
 observable, (2) linear with unobservable effort, and (3) the optimal
 contract within the Bhattacharya-Pfleiderer quadratic class. He finds that
 the linear contract leads to a serious lack of effort expenditure by the
 manager. This underinvestment problem can be successfully overcome through
 the use of quadratic contracts. These contracts are shown to be
 asymptotically optimal for very risk-tolerant principals.

Title: 
 Is a Bond Rating Downgrade Bad News, Good News, or No News for Stockholders?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 2001-08
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors examine the reaction of common stock returns to bond rating
 changes. While recent studies find a significant negative stock response
 to downgrades, they argue that this reaction should not be expected for
 all downgrades because some rating changes are anticipated by market
 participants and downgrades because of an anticipated move to transfer
 wealth from bondholders to stockholders should be good news for
 stockholders. The authors find that downgrades associated with
 deteriorating financial prospects convey new negative information to the
 capital market but that downgrades due to changes in firms' leverage do
 not.

Title: 
 The Determinants of Leveraged Buyout Activity: Free Cash Flow vs. Financial Distress Costs.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1985-99
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper investigates the determinants of leveraged buyout activity by
 comparing firms that have implemented leveraged buyouts to those that have
 not. Consistent with the free cash flow theory, the authors find that
 firms that initiate leveraged buyouts can be characterized as having a
 combination of unfavorable investment opportunities (low Tobin's q) and
 relatively high cash flow. Leveraged buyout firms also tend to be more
 diversified than firms that do not undertake leveraged buyouts. In
 addition, firms with high expected costs of financial distress (e.g, those
 with high research and development expenditures) are less likely to do
 leveraged buyouts.

Title: 
 Option Valuation and Hedging Strategies with Jumps in the Volatility of Asset Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1969-84
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The author develops a model in which the volatility of risky assets is
 subject to random and discontinuous shifts over time. The author derives
 prices of claims contingent on such assets and analyzes options-based
 trading strategies to hedge against the risk of jumps in the return
 volatility. Unsystematic and systematic events, such as takeovers, major
 changes in business plans, or shifts in economic policy regimes, may
 drastically alter firms' risk portfolios. The author's model captures the
 effect of such events on options markets.

 Why Option Prices Lag Stock Prices: A Trading-Based Explanation.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1957-67
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 While many studies find that option prices lead stock prices, J. A.
 Stephan and R. E. Whaley (1990) find that stocks lead options. The authors
 find no evidence that options, even deep out-of-the-money options, lead
 stocks. After confirming Stephan and Whaley's results, they show their
 results can be explained as spurious leads induced by infrequent trading
 of options. The authors show that the stock lead disappears when the
 average of the bid and ask prices is used instead of transaction prices.
 Hence, they find no evidence of arbitrage opportunities associated with
 the stock lead.

Title: 
 The Impact of Large Portfolio Insurers on Asset Prices.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1943-55
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors develop a simple model in which the presence of portfolio
 insurers in a market of risk-averse traders leads to multiple equilibria
 for the pricing of financial assets and can cause an increase in
 volatility, including insurance-induced price drops. They demonstrate,
 however, that centralized portfolio insurance firms may actually reduce,
 not increase, volatility even if the existence of these firms increases
 the total amount of funds under insurance.

Title: 
 Asset-Pricing Tests under Alternative Distributions.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1927-42
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Given the normality assumption, the author rejects the mean-variance
 efficiency of the Center for Research in Security Prices value-weighted
 stock index for three of the six consecutive ten-year subperiods from 1926
 to 1986. However, the normality assumption is strongly rejected by the
 data. Under plausible alternative distributional assumptions of the
 elliptical class, the efficiency can no longer be rejected. When the
 normality assumption is violated but the ellipticity assumption is
 maintained, many tests tend to be biased toward overrejection and both the
 accuracy of estimated beta and R ('superscript'2) are usually overstated.

 Stock Market Crashes and the Performance of Circuit Breakers: Empirical Evidence.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1909-25
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This study examines the behavior of a small stock market with circuit
 breakers and with a one-hour preauction order imbalance disclosure during
 the October 1987 crash. The crash and its aftershocks lasted for a week
 and selling pressure was concentrated in higher beta, larger
 capitalization, and lower leverage firm stocks. Circuit breakers when
 implemented reduced the next-day opening order imbalance and the initial
 price loss; however, they had no effect on the long-run response. Some
 price overreaction and reversal phenomena also are documented.

Title: 
 Accounting for Forward Rates in Markets for Foreign Currency.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1887-1908
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Forward and spot exchange rates between major currencies imply large
 standard deviations of both predictable returns from currency speculation
 and of the equilibrium price measure (the intertemporal marginal rate of
 substitution). Representative agent theory with time-additive preferences
 cannot account for either of these properties. The authors show that the
 theory does considerably better along these dimensions when the
 representative agent's preferences exhibit habit persistence but that the
 theory fails to reproduce some of the other properties of the data--in
 particular, the strong autocorrelation of forward premiums.

Title: 
 Currency Hedging for International Portfolios.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1865-86
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the benefits from currency hedging, both for
 speculative and risk minimization motives, in international bond and
 equity portfolios. The risk-return performances of globally diversified
 portfolios are compared with and without forward contracts. Over the
 period 1974 to 1990, inclusion of forward contracts results in
 statistically significant improvements in the performance of unconditional
 portfolios containing bonds. Conditional strategies are also implemented,
 both in sample and out of sample, and are shown to both significantly
 improve the risk-return tradeoff of global portfolios and to outperform
 unconditional hedging strategies.

Title: 
 Jump Diffusion Option Valuation in Discrete Time.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1833-63
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The author develops a simple, discrete time model to value options when
 the underlying process follows a jump diffusion process. Multivariate
 jumps are superimposed on the binomial model of J. C. Cox, S. A. Ross, and
 M. Rubinstein (1979) to obtain a model with a limiting jump diffusion
 process. This model incorporates the early exercise feature of American
 options as well as arbitrary jump distributions. It yields an efficient
 computational procedure that can be implemented in practice. As an
 application of the model, the author illustrates some characteristics of
 the early exercise boundary of American options with certain types of jump
 distributions.

Title: 
 Asset-Pricing Puzzles and Incomplete Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1803-32
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The representative agent theory of asset pricing is modified to
 incorporate heterogeneous agents and incomplete markets. The model
 features two types of agents who differ up to a nontradable, idiosyncratic
 component in their endowment processes. Numerical solutions indicate that
 individuals are able to diversify a substantial portion of their
 idiosyncratic income risk through riskless borrowing and lending alone.
 Restrictions on the variability of intertemporal marginal rates of
 substitution are used to argue that incomplete markets, as modeled here,
 cannot account for the properties of asset returns that are anomalous from
 the perspective of representative agent theory.

Title: 
 On the Relation between the Expected Value and the Volatility of the Nominal Excess Return on Stocks.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1779-1801
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors find support for a negative relation between conditional
 expected monthly return and conditional variance of monthly return using a
 GARCH-M model modified by allowing (1) seasonal patterns in volatility,
 (2) positive and negative innovations to returns having different impacts
 on conditional volatility, and (3) nominal interest rates to predict
 conditional variance. Using the modified GARCH-M model, they also show
 that monthly conditional volatility may not be as persistent as was
 thought. Positive unanticipated returns appear to result in a downward
 revision of the conditional volatility, whereas negative unanticipated
 returns result in an upward revision of conditional volatility.

Title: 
 Measuring and Testing the Impact of News on Volatility.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1749-78
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper defines the news impact curve that measures how new
 information is incorporated into volatility estimates. Various new and
 existing ARCH models, including a partially nonparametric one, are
 compared and estimated with daily Japanese stock return data. New
 diagnostic tests are presented that emphasize the asymmetry of the
 volatility response to news. The authors' results suggest that the model
 by L. Glosten, R. Jagannathan, and D. Runkle (1989) is the best parametric
 model. The EGARCH also can capture most of the asymmetry; however, there
 is evidence that the variability of the conditional variance implied by
 the EGARCH is too high.

 A New Approach to International Arbitrage Pricing.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1719-47
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper uses a nonlinear arbitrage-pricing model, a conditional linear
 model, and an unconditional linear model to price international equities,
 bonds, and forward currency contracts. Unlike linear models, the nonlinear
 arbitrage-pricing model requires no restrictions on the payoff space,
 allowing it to price payoffs of options, forward contracts, and other
 derivative securities. Only the nonlinear arbitrage-pricing model does an
 adequate job of explaining the time-series behavior of a cross section of
 international returns.

Title: 
 Information Sharing in Credit Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1693-1718
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors present a model with adverse selection where information
 sharing between lenders arises endogenously. Lenders' incentives to share
 information about borrowers are positively related to the mobility and
 heterogeneity of borrowers, to the size of the credit market, and to
 advances in information technology; such incentives are instead reduced by
 the fear of competition from potential entrants. In addition, information
 sharing increases the volume of lending when adverse selection is so
 severe that safe borrowers drop out of the market. These predictions are
 supported by international and historical evidence in the context of the
 consumer credit market.

 Issue Size Choice and "Underpricing" in Thrift Mutual-to-Stock Conversions.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1659-92
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Issue size choice and underpricing in mutual-to-stock conversions of
 thrifts are explained as a function of growth opportunities, perquisite
 consumption, and proprietary information. The authors provide evidence
 that thrifts with greater growth opportunities choose larger issue size
 and experience higher after-market price appreciation. This finding
 persists when they allow for investors' inferences about managers'
 proprietary information. Variables that explain underpricing in typical
 initial public offerings are significant by themselves but lose
 significance when combined with the issue size choice variables.
 Managerial holdings and the offer price do not act as dissipative signals
 of value in thrift conversions.

 Risk Management: Coordinating Corporate Investment and Financing Policies.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1629-58
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper develops a general framework for analyzing corporate risk
 management policies. We begin by observing that if external sources of
 finance are more costly to corporations than internally generated funds,
 there will typically be a benefit to hedging: hedging adds value to the
 extent that it helps ensure that a corporation has sufficient internal
 funds available to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities.
 We then argue that this simple observation has wide ranging implications
 for the design of risk management strategies. We delineate how these
 strategies should depend on such factors as shocks to investment and
 financing opportunities. We also discuss exchange rate hedging strategies
 for multinationals, as well as strategies involving 'nonlinear'instruments
 like options.

 An Analysis of Changes in Specialist Inventories and Quotations.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1595-1628
Issue: 5
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors develop a dynamic model of market-making incorporating
 inventory and information effects. The marketmaker is both a dealer and an
 investor, quoting prices that induce mean reversion in inventory toward
 targets determined by portfolio considerations. The authors test the model
 with inventory data from a New York Stock Exchange specialist. Specialist
 inventories exhibit slow mean reversion, with a half-life of over
 forty-nine days, suggesting weak inventory effects. However, after
 controlling for shifts in desired inventories, the half-life falls to
 seven and three-tenths days. Further, quote revisions are negatively
 related to specialist trades and are positively related to the information
 conveyed by order imbalances.

 This paper presents a transaction-level empirical analysis of the trading
 activities of New York Stock Exchange specialists. The main findings of
 the analysis are the following: adjustment lags in inventories vary across
 stocks and are in some cases as long as one or two months; decomposition
 of specialist trading profits by trading horizon shows that the principal
 source of these profits is short term; an analysis of the dynamic
 relations among inventories, signed order flow, and quote changes suggests
 that trades in which the specialist participates have a higher immediate
 impact on the quotes than trades with no specialist participation.

Title: 
 Sensitivity of Multivariate Tests of the Capital Asset-Pricing Model to the Return Measurement Interval.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1543-51
Issue: 4
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The capital asset pricing model's (CAPM) primary empirical implication is
 a positively sloped linear relation between a security's expected rate of
 return and its relative risk (beta). Recent research indicates that
 inferences about the risk-return relation are sensitive to the choice of
 the return measurement interval. The authors perform multivariate tests of
 the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM using monthly and annual returns on
 market-value-ranked portfolios. The CAPM is rejected using monthly
 returns, a result consistent with previous research. In contrast, the
 authors fail to reject the CAPM when annual holding period returns are
 used.

Title: 
 An Incentive Approach to Banking Regulation.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1523-42
Issue: 4
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors examine the optimal design of a risk-adjusted deposit
 insurance scheme when the regulator has less information than the bank
 about the inherent risk of the bank's assets (adverse selection) and when
 the regulator is unable to monitor the extent to which bank resources are
 being directed away from normal operations toward activities that lower
 asset quality (moral hazard). Under a socially optimal insurance scheme:
 (1) asset quality is below the first-best level, (2) higher-quality banks
 have larger asset bases and face lower capital adequacy requirements than
 lower-quality banks, and (3) the probability of failure is equated across
 banks.

 Alternative Information 
Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1507-22
Issue: 4
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the information content of bank loan agreements. The
 authors differentiate borrowers according to financial analysts'
 percentage earnings forecast errors and most recent forecast revisions.
 The empirical results suggest that banks rely on other indicators as
 initial screening devices to determine where to best deploy their
 evaluation and monitoring efforts. If these other indicators are reliable
 and signal-improving prospects, banks do little further investigation.
 However, if the indicators are noisy and signal-declining prospects, banks
 have incentives to expend resources to investigate the borrowers,
 resulting in the production of valuable information.

 Short Selling and Efficient Sets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1497-1506
Issue: 4
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The effects of short selling on the composition and location of the
 efficient set has been analyzed in a variety of ways. However, the
 situation typically facing investors where the initial margin requirement
 is less than 100 percent and the risk-free interest rate that is paid on
 the short proceeds is less than the rate paid on initial margin has not
 previously been considered. The Elton-Gruber-Padberg algorithm (1976,
 1978), subject to certain modifications, is shown here to be capable of
 identifying the efficient set under such conditions.

Title: 
 Crowding Out and the Informativeness of Security Prices.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1475-96
Issue: 4
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Individual investors trade less aggressively on any particular piece of
 information as more investors observe it. The trades of the new investors
 observing a piece of information 'crowd out'some of the trades of the old
 investors who observe that same piece of information. This paper shows
 that when traders are risk averse, these crowding out effects lead the
 proportions of traders who choose to observe one signal versus another to
 differ from the proportions that maximize the informativeness of prices.

Title: 
 The Irrelevance of Margin: Evidence form the Crash of'87.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1456-73
Issue: 4
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Following the crash of 1987, one contentious regulatory issue has been
 whether margin activity exacerbated the decline in equity values. The
 authors contrast the crash behavior of NASDAQ securities eligible for
 margin trading with the behavior of ineligible ones. Consistent with the
 hypothesis that margin-eligible securities were more frequently subjected
 to margin calls and forced sales, they find that abnormal volumes were
 uniformly larger for eligible securities. However, there is no evidence
 that this activity provoked additional price depreciation. Margin-eligible
 securities actually fell by one percent less than the ineligible
 securities over the period.

 The Effect of Money Shocks on Interest Rates in the Presence of Conditional Heteroskedasticity.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1445-55
Issue: 4
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Most current empirical work finds no evidence that money shocks lower
 interest rates. The authors show that these nonresults are mainly due to a
 failure to model the conditional heteroskedasticity of interest rates.
 Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasiticity (ARCH) models find a
 significant liquidity effect where ordinary least squares (OLS) models do
 not. The existence of a liquidity effect is found using different models
 and sample periods when ARCH models are used in estimation but never when
 OLS is employed.

 Trading Patterns and Prices in the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1421-43
Issue: 4
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The behavior of quote arrivals and bid-ask spreads is examined for
 continuously recorded deutsche mark-dollar exchange rate data over time,
 across locations, and by market participants. A pattern in the intraday
 spread and intensity of market activity over time is uncovered and related
 to theories of trading patterns. Models for the conditional mean and
 variance of returns and bid-ask spreads indicate volatility clustering at
 high frequencies. The proposition that trading intensity has an
 independent effect on returns volatility is rejected but holds for spread
 volatility. Conditional returns volatility is increasing in the size of
 the spread.

 Treasury Auction Bids and the Salomon Squeeze.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1403-19
Issue: 4
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Recent press accounts claim that collusion is common practice in Treasury
 auctions and that as a result the auction profits are excessive. But, this
 paper finds that the auction prices are on average marginally higher than
 the secondary market bid prices. The auction profits, however, are
 systematically related to the total fraction of winning bids tendered by
 banks and dealers. The postauction prices of the two-year notes in which
 Salomon Brothers had a 94 percent holding are also examined. The secondary
 market prices of these notes were significantly higher than the estimated
 competitive prices in the four-week postissue period.

 Brokerage Commission Schedules.

Abstract:

 It is generally optimal for risk-sharing reasons to base a charge for
 information on the signal realization. When this is not possible, a charge
 based on the amount of trading, a brokerage commission, may be a good
 alternative. The optimal brokerage commission schedule is derived for a
 risk-neutral information seller faced with risk-averse purchasers who may
 differ in their risk aversion. Revenues from the brokerage commission are
 compared with those from a fixed charge for information and the optimal
 mutual fund management fee.

 Security Design.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1349-78
Issue: 4
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors explain why an issuer may wish to raise external capital by
 selling multiple financial claims that partition its total asset cash
 flows, rather than a single claim. They show that, in an asymmetric
 information environment, the issuer's expected revenue is enhanced by such
 cash flow partitioning because it makes informed trade more profitable.
 This approach seems capable of shedding light on corporate incentives to
 issue debt and equity, as well as on financial intermediaries' incentives
 to issue multiple classes of claims against portfolios of securitized
 assets.

 The Reverse LBO Decision and Firm Performance: Theory and Evidence.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1323-48
Issue: 4
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors investigate the transition from private to public ownership
 of companies that had previously been subject to leveraged buyouts. They
 show that the information asymmetry problem firms face when they go to
 public markets for equity, as well as behavioral and debt overhang
 effects, will produce a pattern in which superior performance before an
 offering should be expected, with disappointing performance subsequently.
 The authors find empirical evidence of this phenomenon by studying
 sixty-two reverse leveraged buyouts that went public between 1983 and
 1987. The market appears to anticipate this pattern.

Title: 
 Ownership Concentration, Corporate Control Activity, and Firm Value: Evidence from the Death of Inside Blockholders.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1293-1321
Issue: 4
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors analyze how ownership concentration affects firm value and
 control of public companies by examining effects of deaths of inside
 blockholders. They find shareholder wealth increases, ownership
 concentration falls, and extensive corporate control activity ensues.
 Share price responses are related to the deceased's equity stake. Control
 group holdings fall for two-thirds of the firms due to either the estate's
 dispersal or inheritors selling stock. A majority of firms become targets
 of control bids: three-quarters of bids are successful; one-third are
 hostile. The authors' evidence is broadly consistent with Stulz's (1988)
 model of the relationship between ownership concentration and firm value.

 A Test for the Number of Factors in an Approximate Factor Model.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1263-91
Issue: 4
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 An important issue in applications of multifactor models of asset returns
 is the appropriate number of factors. Most extant tests for the number of
 factors are valid only for strict factor models, in which diversifiable
 returns are uncorrelated across assets. In this paper, the authors develop
 a test statistic to determine the number of factors in an approximate
 factor model of asset returns, which does not require that diversifiable
 components of returns be uncorrelated across assets. They find evidence
 for one to six pervasive factors in the cross section of New York Stock
 Exchange and American Stock Exchange stock returns.

 No Arbitrage and Arbitrage Pricing: A New Approach.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1231-62
Issue: 4
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors argue that arbitrage pricing theories (APT) imply the
 existence of a low-dimensional nonnegative nonlinear pricing kernel. In
 contrast to standard constructs of the APT, they do not assume a linear
 factor structure on the payoffs. This allows the authors to price both
 primitive and derivative securities. Seminonparametric techniques are used
 to estimate the pricing kernel and test the theory. Empirical results
 using size-based portfolio returns and yields on bonds reject the nested
 capital asset pricing model and linear APT and support the nonlinear APT.
 Diagnostics show that the nonlinear model is more capable of explaining
 variations in small firm returns.

 Imperfect Information and Cross-Autocorrelation among Stock Prices.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1211-30
Issue: 4
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The author develops a model to explain why stock returns are positively
 cross-autocorrelated. When marketmakers observe noisy signals about the
 value of their stocks but cannot instantaneously condition prices on the
 signals of other stocks, which contain marketwide information, the pricing
 error of one stock is correlated with the other signals. As marketmakers
 adjust prices after observing true values or previous price changes of
 other stocks, stock returns become positively cross-autocorrelated. If the
 signal quality differs among stocks, the cross-autocorrelation pattern is
 asymmetric. The author shows that both own- and cross-autocorrelations are
 higher when market movements are larger.

 Fundamentals or Noise? Evidence from the Professional Basketball Betting Market.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1193-1209
Issue: 4
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper uses the betting market for professional basketball games to
 address the issue of unexplained asset price volatility. A pricing model
 is presented that identifies two components in point spreads for
 professional basketball games. Both components--the market's estimate of
 relative team abilities and an idiosyncratic factor--are essentially
 unobserved but can be identified ex post. The structure of this market
 enables tests of competing hypotheses about point spread variation. The
 tests reject the hypothesis that variation in the two components
 represents irrelevant noise. The hypothesis that unobserved fundamentals
 account for this variation is consistent with the data.

 How Markets Process Information: News Releases and Volatility.

Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors examine the impact of scheduled macroeconomic news
 announcements on interest rate and foreign exchange futures markets. They
 find these announcements are responsible for most of the observed
 time-of-day and day-of-the-week volatility patterns in these markets.
 While the bulk of the price adjustment to a major announcement occurs
 within the first minute, volatility remains substantially higher than
 normal for roughly fifteen minutes and slightly elevated for several
 hours. Nonetheless, these subsequent price adjustments are basically
 independent of the first minute's return. The authors identify those
 announcements with the greatest impact on these markets.

 Stock Price Volatility, Ordinary Dividends, and Other Cash Flows to Shareholders.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1147-60
Issue: 4
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper shows that the results of variance-bound tests depend on how
 cash distributions to shareholders are measured. As in prior studies, the
 authors find apparent evidence of excess volatility when a narrow
 definition of cash flow (dividends only) is applied. However, they are
 unable to reject the hypothesis of market efficiency when the cash flow
 measure also includes share repurchases and takeover distributions in
 addition to ordinary cash dividends.

Title: 
 The Investment Performance of U.S. Equity Pension Fund Managers: An Empirical Investigation.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1039-55
Issue: 3
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This paper presents an empirical examination of the selectivity and
 market timing performance of a sample of U.S. equity pension fund
 managers. Regardless of the choice of benchmark portfolio or estimation
 model, the average selectivity measure is postive and the average timing
 measure is negative. However, both selectivity and timing appear to be
 somewhat sensitive to the choice of a benchmark when managers are
 classified by investment style. Meta-analysis revealed some real variation
 around the mean values for each measure. The 80 percent probability
 intervals for selectivity revealed that the best managers produced
 substantial risk-adjusted excess returns. The authors also found a
 negative correlation between selectivity and timing, but they argue that
 the observed negative correlation in their data is largely an artifact of
 negatively correlated sampling errors for the two estimates.

Title: 
 Market Integration and Price Execution for NYSE-Listed Securities.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1009-38
Issue: 3
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 For New York Stock Exchange listed securities, the price execution of
 seemingly comparable orders differs systematically by location. In
 general, executions at the Cincinnati, Midwest, and New York stock
 exchanges are most favorable to trade initiators, while executions at the
 National Association of Security Dealers are least favorable. These
 intermarket price differences depend on trade size, with the smallest
 trades exhibiting the biggest per share price difference. Collectively,
 these results raise questions about the adequacy of the existing
 intermarket quote system, the broker's fiduciary responsibility for 'best
 execution,'and the propriety of order flow inducements.

Title: 
 Measuring Asset Values for Cash Settlement in Derivative Markets: Hedonic Repeated Measures Indices and Perpetual Futures.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 911-31
Issue: 3
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 Two proposals are made that may facilitate the creation of derivative
 market instruments, such as futures contracts, cash settled based on
 economic indices. The first proposal concerns index number construction:
 indices based on infrequent measurements of nonstandardized items may
 control for quality change by using a hedonic repeated measures method, an
 index number construction method that follows individual assets or
 subjects through time and also takes account of measured quality
 variables. The second proposal is to establish markets for perpetual
 claims on cash flows matching indices of dividends or rents. Such markets
 may help us to measure the prices of the assets generating these dividends
 or rents even when the underlying asset prices are difficult or impossible
 to observe directly. A perpetual futures contract is proposed that would
 cash settle every day in terms of both the change in the futures price and
 the dividend or rent index for that day.

Title: 
 Option Valuation with Systematic Stochastic Volatility.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 881-910
Issue: 3
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 The authors use an extension of the equilibrium framework of M.
 Rubinstein (1976) and M. Brennan (1979) to derive an option valuation
 formula when the stock return volatility is both stochastic and
 systematic. Their formula incorporates a stochastic volatility process as
 well as a stochastic interest rate process in the valuation of options. If
 the 'mean,'volatility, and 'covariance' processes for the stock return and
 the consumption growth are predictable, the authors' option valuation
 formula can be written in 'preference-free'form. Further, many popular
 option valuation formulae in the literature can be written as special
 cases of their general formula.

 The Modern Industrial Revolution, Exit, and the Failure of Internal Control Systems.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 831-80
Issue: 3
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 Since 1973 technological, political, regulatory, and economic forces have
 been changing the worldwide economy in a fashion comparable to the changes
 experienced during the nineteenth century Industrial Revolution. As in the
 nineteenth century, we are experiencing declining costs, increasing
 average (but decreasing marginal) productivity of labor, reduced growth
 rates of labor income, excess capacity, and the requirement for downsizing
 and exit. The last two decades indicate corporate internal control systems
 have failed to deal effectively with these changes, especially slow growth
 and the requirement for exit. The next several decades pose a major
 challenge for Western firms and political systems as these forces continue
 to work their way through the worldwide economy.

Title: 
 Dividend Surprises Inferred from Option and Stock Prices.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1623-40
Issue: 4
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper introduces a new method to measure the unexpected component of
 dividend announcements. While measures used previously were based on
 various arbitrary models of dividend expectations, the authors' suggested
 method compares the reaction of stock and option prices to dividend
 announcements. Their measure is compared to commonly used model-based
 measures, to a Box-Jenkins time-series-based measure, and to a Value-Line
 Investor Survey-based measure of dividend surprises.  The new measure is
 more highly correlated with the market's reaction to the announcements
 than are alternative measures of dividend surprises. The new measure is
 also shown to be insensitive to the extent to which the options used to
 identify unexpected dividend announcements are in- or out-of-the-money.

Title: 
 The Post-merger Performance of Acquiring Firms: A Re-examination of an Anomaly.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1605-21
Issue: 4
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The existing literature on the post-merger performance of acquiring firms
 is divided. The authors reexamine this issue, using a nearly exhaustive
 sample of mergers between NYSE acquirers and NYSE/AMEX targets. The
 authors find that stockholders of acquiring firms suffer a statistically
 significant loss of about 10 percent over the five-year post- merger
 period, a result robust to various specifications. Their evidence suggests
 that neither the firm size effect nor beta estimation problems are the
 cause of the negative post-merger returns. They examine whether this
 result is caused by a slow adjustment of the market to the merger event.
 Their results do not seem consistent with this hypothesis.

 Causal Relations among Stock Returns, Interest Rates, Real Activity, and Inflation.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1591-603
Issue: 4
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Using a multivariate vector-autoregression approach, this paper
 investigates causal relations and dynamic interactions among asset
 returns, real activity, and inflation in the postwar United States. Major
 findings are (1) stock returns appear Granger-causally prior and help
 explain real activity; (2) with interest rates in the vector
 autoregression, stock returns explain little variation in inflation,
 although interest rates explain a substantial fraction of the variation in
 inflation; and (3) inflation explains little variation in real activity.

 Information, Asset Prices, and the Volume of Trade.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 4
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 A dynamic equilibrium model is constructed in which agents with access to
 different information sets participate in the capital market. Agents must
 use the equilibrium price of capital to make optimal forecasts of the
 return to holding capital. Examples show that the volume of trade, as well
 as the price of capital, can be highly correlated with a measure of the
 information content of prices. The measure of information is the
 difference between the unconditional entropy of the dividend and the
 entropy of the dividend conditional on observing the price of capital.

Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper provides a simple proof of a recent theorem presented by Haim
 Reisman (1992) concerning the use of proxies for the factors in the
 return-generating process of the arbitrage pricing theory. In the
 single-factor case, the theorem asserts that any variable correlated with
 the factor can serve as the benchmark in an approximate arbitrage pricing
 theory expected return relation. The significance of this result is
 considered and a new direction for empirical work on "arbitrage pricing"
 is outlined.

 Debt Financing and Tax Status: Tests of the Substitution Effect and the Tax Exhaustion Hypothesis Using Firms' Responses to the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1557-68
Issue: 4
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This study tests the joint prediction of the substitution effect and the
 tax exhaustion hypothesis that an increase in nondebt tax shields leads to
 a decrease in leverage. Controls are introduced for the debt securability
 effect, the pecking order theory of financing, and the probability of
 losing tax shields. Using the relationship between changes in investment
 tax shields and changes in debt tax shields of firms in response to the
 Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, strong empirical support is found for
 predictions based on the substitution effect and the tax exhaustion
 hypothesis.

 Underwriter Compensation and Corporate Monitoring.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 4
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Studies suggest that underwriting syndicates provide marketing services
 and certify the fairness of offer prices. The authors argue that syndicate
 lead banks also monitor manager effort, increasing the value of
 capital-raising companies. A given level of monitoring is associated with
 a given level of intrinsic value, so there is a "schedule" of certifiable
 offer prices, depending on the level of monitoring. Monitoring, marketing,
 and certification are, therefore, all legitimate syndicate functions. New
 evidence supporting the conclusion that syndicates provide corporate
 monitoring is presented.

Title: 
 Common Stock Offerings and Earnings Expectations: A Test of the Release of Unfavorable Information.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1517-36
Issue: 4
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the revisions of analysts' forecasts of future
 earnings around announcements of common stock offerings. The forecasts of
 the correct year earnings are, on average, decreased when firms announce
 plans to issue additional common stock. The size of the decrease is
 significantly related to announcement period abnormal stock returns. In
 contrast, forecasts of the five-year growth rate of earnings are, on
 average, unchanged. The authors interpret these results as being
 consistent with the claim that equity offering announcements convey
 unfavorable information regarding the firm's short-term, but not its
 long-term, earnings prospects.

Title: 
 Interest Rate Swaps and Corporate Financing Choices.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1503-16
Issue: 4
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper describes the firm's decision to borrow short- term versus
 long-term and shows how the introduction of interest rate swaps affects
 this choice. The model shows that in the absence of a swap market,
 interest rate uncertainty can lead firms to substitute long-term for
 short-term financing. However, when swaps exist, there is a tendency for
 firms that expect their credit quality to improve to borrow short-term and
 use swaps to hedge interest rate risk. The model suggests that, while the
 demand for fixed for floating swaps is enhanced, the demand for floating
 for fixed swaps is reduced by the presence of asymmetric information.

Title: 
 Futures Manipulation with "Cash Settlement."

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1485-502
Issue: 4
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper investigates the susceptibility of futures markets to price
 manipulation in a two-period model with asymmetric information and "cash
 settlement" futures contracts. Without "physical delivery," strategies
 based on "corners" or "squeezes" are infeasible. However, uninformed
 investors still earn positive expected profits by establishing a futures
 position and then trading in the spot market to manipulate the spot price
 used to compute the cash settlement at delivery. The authors also show
 that as the number of manipulators grows, profits from manipulation fall
 to zero. However, even in the limit, manipulation still has a nontrivial
 impact on market liquidity. More broadly, they interpret manipulation as a
 form of endogenous "noise trading" which can arise in multiperiod security
 markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1461-84
Issue: 4
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Standard models of informed speculation suggest that traders try to learn
 information that others do not have. This result implicitly relies on the
 assumption that speculators have long horizons, i.e., can hold the asset
 forever. By contrast, the authors show that if speculators have short
 horizons, they may herd on the same information, trying to learn what
 other informed traders also know. There can be multiple herding
 equilibria, and herding speculators may even choose to study information
 that is completely unrelated to fundamentals.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 4
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This paper presents evidence supporting the theory that problems of
 asymmetric information in debt markets affect financially unhealthy firms'
 ability to obtain outside finance and, consequently, their allocation of
 real investment expenditure over time. The author tests this hypothesis by
 estimating the Euler equation of an optimizing model of investment.
 Including the effect of a debt constraint greatly improves the Euler
 equation's performance in comparison to the standard specification. When
 the sample is split on the basis of two measures of financial distress,
 the standard Euler equation fits well for the a priori
 unconstrained.groups, but is rejected for the others.

 The author studies the divestiture decisions of managers who care about
 their reputations. Managers' divestiture and investment decisions are
 publicly observable, but managers privately observe signals with respect
 to the future payoff distribution of investments they have initiated. He
 establishes that in equilibrium there is too little divestiture. These
 inefficiencies create the opportunity for wealth-enhancing
 divestiture-motivated takeovers. A key result is that only managers of
 targets with "middle of the road" asset specificity should consider the
 takeover threat credible. These findings suggest that uniqueness of assets
 is an important determinant of both agency costs and takeover activity.
 The author's analysis leads to several empirical predictions.

 Insiders and Outsiders: The Choice between Informed and Arm's-Length Debt.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1367-400
Issue: 4
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 While the benefits of bank financing are relatively well understood, the
 costs are not. This paper argues that while informed banks make flexible
 financial decisions which prevent a firm's projects from going awry, the
 cost of this credit is that banks have bargaining power over the firm's
 profit once projects have begun. The firm's portfolio choice of borrowing
 source and the choice of priority for its debt claims attempt to optimally
 circumscribe the powers of banks.

Title: 
 Liquidation Values and Debt Capacity: A Market Equilibrium Approach.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1343-66
Issue: 4
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors explore the determinants of liquidation values of assets,
 particularly focusing on the potential buyers of assets. When a firm in
 financial distress needs to sell assets, its industry peers are likely to
 be experiencing problems themselves, leading to asset sales at prices
 below value in best use. Such illiquidity makes assets cheap in bad times
 and so ex ante is a significant private cost of leverage. The authors use
 this focus on asset buyers to explain variation in debt capacity across
 industries and over the business cycle, as well as the rise in U.S.
 corporate leverage in the 1980s.

 Inflation and Asset Returns in a Monetary Economy.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 4
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Postwar U.S. data are characterized by negative correlations between real
 equity returns and inflation and by positive correlations between real
 equity returns and money growth. These patterns are closely matched
 quantitatively by an equilibrium monetary asset pricing model. The model
 also implies negative correlations between expected.asset returns and
 expected inflation, and it predicts that the inflation-asset return
 correlation will be more strongly negative when inflation is generated by
 fluctuations in real economic activity than when it is generated by
 monetary fluctuations.

 Reference Variables, Factor Structure, and the Approximate Multibeta Representation.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1303-14
Issue: 4
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The arbitrage pricing theory implies that if asset returns have a factor
 structure, then an approximate multibeta representation holds with respect
 to the factors as reference variables. This paper assumes that asset
 returns satisfy a factor structure and derives a condition under which the
 approximate multibeta representation holds with respect to a set of
 reference variables that may not be the factors. This condition is that
 the regression matrix of the reference variables on the factors is
 nonsingular. Implications for the testability of the arbitrage pricing
 theory are also discussed.

Title: 
 Arbitrage with Holding Costs: A Utility-Based Approach.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1283-302
Issue: 4
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Unit time costs, or holding costs, are incurred in many arbitrage
 contexts. Examples include losing the use of short sale proceeds and
 lending funds at below market rates in reverse repurchase agreements. This
 paper analyzes the investment problem of a risk-averse arbitrageur who
 faces holding costs. The model allows prices to deviate from "fundamental"
 values without allowing for riskless arbitrage opportunities. After
 characterizing an arbitrageur's optimal strategy, the model is examined in
 the context of the Treasury market. The analysis reveals that holding
 costs are an important friction in this market and that they can
 significantly affect arbitrageur behavior.

Title: 
 Interest Rate Volatility and the Term Structure: A Two-Factor General Equilibrium Model.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1259-82
Issue: 4
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors develop a two-factor general equilibrium model of the term
 structure. The factors are the short-term interest rate and the volatility
 of the short-term interest rate. The authors derive closed-form
 expressions for discount bonds and study the properties of the term
 structure implied by the model. The dependence of yields on volatility
 allows the model to capture many observed properties of the term
 structure. The authors also derive closed-form expressions for discount
 bond options. The authors use Hansen's generalized method of moments
 framework to test the cross-sectional restrictions imposed by the model.
 The tests support the two-factor model.

Title: 
 An Empirical Comparison of Alternative Models of the Short-Term Interest Rate.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1209-27
Issue: 3
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 The authors estimate and compare a variety of continuous-time models of
 the short-term riskless rate using the Generalized Method of Moments. The
 authors find that the most successful models in capturing the dynamics of
 the short-term interest rate are those that allow the volatility of
 interest rate changes to be highly sensitive to the level of the riskless
 rate. A number of well-known models perform poorly in the comparisons
 because of their implicit restrictions on term structure volatility. They
 show that these results have important implications for the use of
 different term structure models in valuing interest rate contingent claims
 and in hedging interest rate risk. Coauthors are Andrew Karolyi, Francis
 A. Longstaff, and Anthony B. Sanders.

Title: 
 Can Capital Income Taxes Survive in Open Economies?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1159-80
Issue: 3
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 Optimal-tax theory forecasts that small open economies should not tax
 capital income. Yet, countries do tax capital income. Why the
 inconsistency? This paper shows that use of the double-taxation
 convention, whereby governments credit taxes paid abroad against domestic
 taxes, helps explain this inconsistency. In particular, capital income
 will be taxed if a dominant capital exporter acts as a Stackelberg leader
 when setting its tax policy. Due to the convention, other countries will
 then tax capital imports, making it attractive for the dominant capital
 exporter to tax capital income. Without a dominant capital exporter,
 however, the model still forecasts no capital-income taxes.

Title: 
 Capital Structure as an Optimal Contract between Employees and Investors.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1141-58
Issue: 3
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 The ex ante optimal contract between investors and employees is derived
 endogenously and is interpreted in terms of debt, equity, and employees'
 compensation. Although public equity financing is feasible in this model
 through verified accounting income, debt is needed to force
 value-enhancing restructuring before the income realizes. The optimal debt
 level, however, is lower than that which maximizes the value of the firm
 when there is nonmonetary restructuring-related cost to employees. The
 paper explains how stock prices react to exchange offers, how earnings can
 be diluted by a decrease in leverage, and why employees' claims are
 generally senior to those of investors. New testable implications about
 leverage and compensation levels are derived.

Title: 
 The Structure of Corporate Ownership in Japan.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1121-40
Issue: 3
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 The author examines the structure of corporate ownership in a sample of
 Japanese firms in the mid 1980s. Ownership is highly concentrated in
 Japan, with financial institutions by far the most important large
 shareholders. Ownership concentration in independent Japanese firms is
 positively related to the returns from exerting greater control over
 management. This is not the case in firms that are members of corporate
 groups (keiretsu). Ownership concentration and the accounting profit rate
 in both independent and keiretsu firms are unrelated. The results are
 consistent with the notion that there exist two distinct corporate
 governance systems in Japan--one among independent firms and the other
 among firms that are members of keiretsu.

Issue: 3
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This paper chronicles the history of the Beatrice company from its
 founding in 1891 as a small creamery, through its growth by acquisition
 into a diversified consumer and industrial products firm, and its
 subsequent leveraged buyout and sell-off. The paper analyzes the value
 consequences and firm's acquisition and divestiture policies, its
 organizational strategy, and its governance. The analysis sheds light on a
 number of issues in organization theory, strategy, and corporate finance,
 including the sources of value in diversifying acquisitions, the cost of
 overcentralization and weak corporate governance, and the mechanisms of
 value creation in the market for corporate control.

 Management Buyout Proposals and Inside Information.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1061-79
Issue: 3
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This paper explores stock price behavior surrounding withdrawn buyout
 proposals to determine whether managers' proposal announcements reveal any
 information that is unrelated to the efficiency gains associated with
 completed buyouts. On average, firms whose managers withdraw buyout
 proposals do not sustain significantly positive stock price effects unless
 they receive subsequent acquisition bids. In addition, managers of firms
 with completed buyouts are no more likely to have access to inside
 information than managers who withdrew proposals. The author interprets
 this evidence as inconsistent with the notion that inside information
 commonly motivates management buyout proposals.

Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 Trading by corporate insiders and their tippees is analyzed in
 Anheuser-Busch's 1982 tender offer for Campbell Taggart. Court records
 that identify insider transactions are used to disentangle the individual
 insider trades from liquidity trades. Consistent with previous studies,
 insider trading was found to have had a significant impact on the price of
 Campbell Taggart. However, the impact of informed trading on the market is
 complicated. Trading volume net of insider purchases rose. Contrary to the
 broad implications of adverse selection models, Campbell Taggart's
 liquidity improved when the insiders were active in the market and all the
 insiders received superior execution for their orders.

 Mergers and the Value of Antitrust Deterrence.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1005-29
Issue: 3
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 While the U.S. has pursued a vigorous antitrust policy towards horizontal
 mergers over the past four decades, mergers in Canada have until recently
 been permitted to take place in a virtually unrestricted antitrust
 environment. The absence of an antitrust overhang in Canada presents an
 interesting opportunity to test the conjecture that the rigid market share
 and concentration criteria of the U.S. policy effectively deters a
 significant number of potentially collusive mergers. The effective
 deterrence hypothesis implies that the probability of a horizontal merger
 being anticompetitive is higher in Canada than in the U.S. However,
 parameters in cross-sectional regressions reject the market power
 hypothesis on samples of both U.S. and Canadian mergers. Judging from the
 Canadian evidence, there simply isn't much to deter.

Title: 
 Does the Bond Market Predict Bankruptcy Settlements?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 943-80
Issue: 3
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This study shows the extent to which deviations from the absolute
 priority rule increase or decrease the bankruptcy emergence payoff to
 traded (i.e., usually junior claimants) bondholders. The data indicate
 that, on average, bondholders benefit, albeit slightly, from absolute
 priority rule violations. This paper also examines the degree to which the
 bond market, in the bankruptcy filing month, anticipates departures from
 the absolute priority rule and other influences on the payoff to
 bondholders. In other words, the authors investigate the informational
 efficiency of the market for bankrupt bonds. Overall, despite the complex
 and lengthy nature of bankruptcy proceedings, the results support
 efficiency.

 The 1985 Ohio Thrift Crisis, the FSLIC's Solvency, and Rate Contagion for Retail CDs.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 919-41
Issue: 3
Volume: 47
Year: 1992

Abstract:

 This paper uses both an ARIMA transfer-function intervention model and a
 panel data analysis to examine the effect of the Ohio deposit insurance
 crisis in 1985 on the pricing of six-month retail certificates of deposit
 (CDs) for federally-insured Ohio banks and savings and loans. Adjusting
 for pricing reactions due to changes in market rates, the authors find a
 significant, unanticipated rise in CD-rate premiums on the initial event
 week of the crisis that continued for approximately seven weeks.
 Consistent with a contingent insurance guarantee hypothesis, rate premiums
 are found to be risk based.

Abstract:

 This paper investigates the behavior of stock and option prices around
 block trades in stocks. The results indicate that for both uptick and
 downtick block trades the stock prices adjust within a fifteen minute
 period after the block trade. Moreover, for uptick blocks there is no
 evidence of any stock price reaction before the block trade. However, the
 adjustment of stock price for downtick blocks begins about fifteen minutes
 before the block trade. They also find that option price behavior differs
 considerably from stock price behavior. Specifically, the authors' results
 suggest that options exhibit abnormal price behavior starting thirty
 minutes before the block and ending one hour after the block. The pattern
 is more pronounced for downtick blocks and for put options. The authors
 interpret this abnormal price behavior of options before the block trade
 as consistent with intermarket frontrunning.

Title: 
 One Market? Stocks, Futures, and Options during October 1987.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 851-77
Issue: 3
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 The authors provide new evidence regarding the degree of integration
 among markets for stocks, futures, and options prior to and during the
 October 1987 market crash. Where previous analyses have resulted in
 recommendations for the implementation of circuit breakers, the
 coordination of margin requirements across markets, and changes in
 regulatory jurisdiction, their analysis indicates that delinkage between
 markets during the crash was primarily caused by an antiquated mechanism
 for processing stock-market orders. The results suggest that market
 integration may be better served by efficient order execution than by
 further restricting markets.

Title: 
 Swaps: Plain and Fanciful.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 831-50
Issue: 3
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 The outstanding face amount of plain vanilla interest rate swaps exceeds
 two trillion dollars. While pricing and hedging of such swaps appear to be
 quite simple, many existing theories are based on the incorrect
 characterization of a swap as a simple exchange of a fixed for a floating
 rate note. This characterization is not consistent with standardized swap
 contracts and the treatment of swaps in bankruptcy. This paper provides an
 alternative perspective on swaps.

Title: 
 More Powerful Portfolio Approaches to Regressing Abnormal Returns on Firm-Specific Variables for Cross-Sectional Studies.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 2055-70
Issue: 5
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Ordinary Least Squares regression ignores both heteroscedasticity and
 cross-correlations of abnormal returns; therefore, tests of regression
 coefficients are weak and biased. A portfolio ordinary least squares
 (POLS) regression accounts for correlations and ensures unbiasedness of
 tests, but does not improve their power. The authors propose portfolio
 weighted least squares (PWLS) and portfolio constant correlation model
 (PCCM) regressions to improve the power. Both utilize the
 heteroscedasticity of abnormal returns in estimating the coefficients;
 PWLS ignores the correlations, while PCCM uses intra- and inter-industry
 correlations. Simulation results show that both lead to more powerful
 tests of regression coefficients than POLS.

Title: 
 Additional Evidence on Integration in the Canadian Stock Market.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 2035-54
Issue: 5
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper reexamines the integration of the Canadian and U.S. stock
 markets in the 1977-86 period that is relatively free from capital
 controls. The study employs both the capital asset pricing model and the
 arbitrage pricing theory frameworks. Under both models, the evidence is
 consistent with segmentation in the 1977-81 subperiod, but supports
 integration in the 1982-86 subperiod. Using the arbitrage pricing theory
 framework, the author finds that the Canadian stocks interlisted on the
 U.S. exchanges and NASDAQ are priced.in an integrated market and
 segmentation is predominant for the noninterlisted Canadian stocks.

 Futures-Trading Activity and Stock Price Volatility.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 2015-34
Issue: 5
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors examine whether greater futures-trading activity (volume and
 open interest) is associated with greater equity volatility. They
 partition each trading activity series into expected and unexpected
 components, and document that while equity volatility covaries positively
 with unexpected futures-trading volume, it is negatively related to
 forecastable futures-trading activity. Further, though futures-trading
 activity is systematically related to the futures contract life cycle, the
 authors find no evidence of a relation between the futures life cycle and
 spot equity volatility. These findings are consistent with theories
 predicting that active futures markets enhance the liquidity and depth of
 the equity markets.

 Seasonalities in NYSE Bid-Ask Spreads and Stock Returns in January.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1999-2014
Issue: 5
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Using end-of-month bid-ask spreads for 540 NYSE stocks over the period
 1982-87, the authors document a seasonal pattern in which both relative
 and absolute spreads decline from the end of December to the end of the
 following January. Cross-sectional regressions do not, however, provide
 evidence of a significant correlation between changes in spreads at the
 turn of the year and January stock returns. Either there is no cause and
 effect relation between the coincidental seasonals in bid-ask spreads and
 January returns for NYSE stocks or the data are too "noisy" to reveal any
 relation.

 Stock Price Dynamics and Firm Size: An Empirical Investigation.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 5
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors show that after controlling for the effects of bid-ask
 spreads and trading volume the conditional future volatility of equity
 returns is negatively related to the level of stock price. This "leverage
 effect" is stronger for small, as compared to large, firms. The authors
 also document that while the essential characteristics of the relations
 between stock price dynamics and firm size are stable, the strengths of
 the relationships appear to change over time.

Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper analyzes how mutual fund performance relates to past
 performance. These tests are based on a multiple portfolio benchmark that
 was formed on the basis of securities characteristics. The authors find
 evidence that differences in performance between funds persist over time
 and that this persistence is consistent with the ability of fund managers
 to earn abnormal returns.

Title: 
 One-Time Cash Flow Announcements and Free Cash-Flow Theory: Share Repurchases and Special Dividends.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1963-75
Issue: 5
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The leading explanation for the positive price response surrounding
 tender offer share repurchase and specially designated dividend (SDD)
 announcements is the information signaling hypothesis. This paper
 reexamines these announcements to determine if Jensen's free cash-flow
 theory also has explanatory power. Lang and Litzenberger's (1989) findings
 suggest an important role for the free cash-flow theory in explaining the
 market's reaction to dividend changes. In contrast, they find the market's
 reaction to share repurchases and SDDs is approximately the same for both
 high-Q and low-Q firms. They thus have an empirical puzzle: If Jensen's
 free cash-flow theory applies to dividend changes, it is difficult to see
 why it does not also apply to the analogous events examined here.

Title: 
 Managers' Trading around Stock Repurchases.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1947-61
Issue: 5
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors analyze personal open market trades by managers around stock
 repurchases by tender offer. With the exception of Dutch auction offers,
 managers trade their firm's shares prior to repurchase announcements as
 though repurchases convey favorable inside information to outsiders. Prior
 to fixed price repurchase offers that do not follow takeover-related
 events, managers increase their buying and reduce their selling of their
 firm's shares. Prior to repurchases that follow takeover-related events,
 only a decrease in selling is found. No abnormal trading precedes Dutch
 auction repurchase offers.

 The Intra-industry Transfer of Information Inferred from Announcements of Corporate Security Offerings.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1935-45
Issue: 5
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This study investigates the extent to which information inferred by
 investors from initial announcements of corporate security offerings
 affects share prices in the capital markets. The empirical tests measure
 the response in the common stock prices of both firms announcing a
 security offering and nonannouncing firms operating in the same industry.
 Small but significantly negative abnormal returns are shown by industry
 shares upon initial announcements of common stock, convertible debt, and
 straight public offerings. Such an industry response indicates that share
 prices incorporate an inside assessment of factors relevant to the
 valuation of an industry subset of firms.

Title: 
 Insider Trading in Financial Signaling Models.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1905-34
Issue: 5
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors study the impact of voluntary trade by the manager. They find
 that, in contrast to standard signaling models, an action is good news for
 some firms and bad news for others, depending on observable
 characteristics of the firm, its managers, and their compensation plans.
 Further, voluntary trade eliminates separating equilibria and, thus, the
 possibility of exactly inferring the manager's private information. This
 may cause the manager to take inefficient actions so as to earn trading
 profits. Such undesirable behavior can be more effectively constrained by
 compensation contracts based on phantom shares or nontradeable options
 instead of large stockholdings.

Abstract:

 The authors adapt a contingent claims model of the firm to reflect the
 incentive effects of the capital structure and, thereby, to measure the
 agency costs of debt. An underlying model of the firm and the stochastic
 features of its product market are analyzed and an optimal operating
 policy is chosen. The authors identify the change in operating policy
 created by leverage and value this change. The model determines the value
 of the firm and its associated liabilities incorporating the agency
 consequences of debt.

 Relationship-Specific Assets and the Pricing of Underwriter Services.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1865-85
Issue: 5
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper investigates the effect of setup costs on the pricing of
 investment banking services. The existence of setup costs is predicted to
 result in lower underwriter spreads in initial public offerings for firms
 that are expected to issue again. Consistent with this prediction, the
 author finds significantly lower spreads for firms that make subsequent
 issues. He also finds that a firm's likelihood of changing underwriters in
 a subsequent offer is related to the time between offerings and the
 underwriter's pricing performance in the initial public offerings. These
 results suggest that the deviations from optimal initial public offerings
 pricing carry a penalty for the underwriter.

Title: 
 Dividends and Losses.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1837-63
Issue: 5
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 An annual loss is essentially a necessary condition for dividend
 reductions in firms with established earnings and dividend records: 50.9
 percent of 167 NYSE firms with losses during 1980-85 reduced dividends,
 versus 1.0 percent of 440 firms without losses. As hypothesized by Merton
 H. Miller and Franco Modigliani, dividend reductions depend on whether
 earnings include unusual items that are likely to temporarily depress
 income. Dividend reductions are more likely given greater current losses,
 less negative unusual items, and more persistent earnings difficulties.
 Dividend policy has information content in that knowledge that a firm has
 reduced dividends improves the ability of current earnings to predict
 future earnings.

Abstract:

 Members of the Institutional Investor All-American Research Team supply
 more accurate earnings forecasts than other analysts when forecasts are
 matched.by the corporation followed and by the date of brokerage house
 issuance. This contemporaneous advantage is complemented by a timing
 advantage; All-Americans supply forecasts more often than other analysts.
 Stocks returns immediately following large upward forecast revisions
 suggest that All-Americans impact prices more than other analysts.
 However, there is virtually no difference in returns following large
 downward revisions. Nevertheless, the collective results suggest a
 positive relation between reputation and performance, and assuming that
 All-Americans are better paid, pay and performance.

Title: 
 When Will Mean-Variance Efficient Portfolios Be Well Diversified?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1785-809
Issue: 5
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors characterize the conditions under which efficient portfolios
 put small weights on individual assets. These conditions bound mean
 returns with measures of average absolute covariability between assets.
 The bounds clarify the relationship between linear asset pricing models
 and well-diversified efficient portfolios. The authors argue that the
 extreme weightings in sample efficient portfolios are due to the dominance
 of a single factor in equity returns. This makes it easy to diversify on
 subsets to reduce residual risk, while weighing the subsets to reduce
 factor risk simultaneously. The latter involves taking extreme positions.
 This behavior seems unlikely to be attributable to sampling error.

 Trading Halts and Market Activity: An Analysis of Volume at the Open and the Close.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1765-84
Issue: 5
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper analyzes how the daily opening and closing of financial
 markets affect trading volume. The authors model the desire to trade at
 the beginning and end of the day a a function of overnight return
 volatility. NYSE data from 1933-88 indicate that closing volume is
 positively related.to expected overnight volatility, while volume at the
 open is positively related to both expected and unexpected volatility from
 the previous night. The authors interpret the symmetric response of
 trading at the open and the close to expected volatility as being due to
 investor heterogeneities in the ability to bear risk when the market is
 closed. This desire of investors to trade prior to market closings
 indicates a cost of mandating marketwide circuit breakers.

 Simple Technical Trading Rules and the Stochastic Properties of Stock Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1731-64
Issue: 5
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper tests two of the simplest and most popular trading
 rules--moving average and trading range break--by utilizing the Dow Jones
 Index from 1897 to 1986. Standard statistical analysis is extended through
 the use of bootstrap techniques. Overall, their results provide strong
 support for the technical strategies. The returns obtained from these
 strategies are not consistent with four popular null models: the random
 walk, the AR(1), the GARCH-M, and the Exponential GARCH. Buy signals
 consistently generate higher returns than sell signals, and further, the
 returns following buy signals are less volatile than returns following
 sell signals. Moreover, returns following sell signals are negative, which
 is not easily explained by any of the currently existing equilibrium
 models.

 Stock Returns, Real Activity, and the Trust Question.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1701-30
Issue: 5
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Periodic antitrust attacks on corporations may have influenced stock
 prices. For the period 1904 to 1944, each antitrust case filed is
 associated with a 0.5 to 1.9 percent drop of the Dow and each unexpected
 case with even larger drops. Other aspects of antitrust besides actual
 filings may help account for other movements, in particular the 1929
 Crash. Historical evidence bears on the question of whether antitrust is
 exogenous and also links antitrust and the "corporation problem." These
 results illustrate the sorts of real factors, aside from changes in
 concurrent output, that may account for stock price volatility.

Title: 
 An Empirical Analysis of Illegal Insider Trading.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1661-99
Issue: 5
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Whether insider trading affects stock prices is central to both the
 current debate over whether insider trading is harmful or pervasive, and
 to the broader public policy issue of how best to regulate securities
 markets. Using previously unexplored data on illegal insider trading from
 the Securities and Exchange Commission, this paper finds that the stock
 market detects the possibility of informed trading and impounds this
 information into the stock price. Specifically, the abnormal return on an
 insider trading day averages 3 percent, and almost half of the
 pre-announcement stock price run-up observed before takeovers occurs on
 insider trading days. Both the amount traded by the insider and additional
 trade-specific characteristics lead to the market's recognition of the
 informed trading.

 A Simple Measure of Price Adjustment Coefficients.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 387-400
Issue: 1
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 One measure of market efficiency is the speed with which prices adjust to
 new information. The author develops a simple approach to estimating these
 price adjustment coefficients by using the information in return
 processes. This approach is used to estimate t he price adjustment
 coefficients for firms listed on the NYSE and the A MEX as well as for
 over-the-counter stocks. The author finds evidence of a lagged adjustment
 to new information in shorter return intervals for firms in all market
 value classes and some support for the propositi on that prices adjust
 much more slowly and with more noise for smaller firms.

 Value of Latent Information: Alternative Event Study Methods.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 363-85
Issue: 1
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper presents an econometric model to value latent information
 underlying corporate events. This model computes the market's inference of
 the value of latent information from the probability of an event,
 conditional on firm-specific, preevent information. It provides a
 convenient framework for testing significance of preevent information
 variables, such as accounting attributes and lagged stock return.
 Simulations show that this mode l, when applied to both event and preevent
 period data, can decrease th e incidence of bias in event studies. If
 restricted to only event peri od data, this model reduces to a truncated
 regression and does not perf orm as well as standard procedures.

Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Recent studies using aging analysis have found high rates of default for
 rated, nonconvertible high-yield bonds. This paper examines the remainder
 of the market and concludes that rated. and nonrated convertible
 high-yield bonds had significantly lower defaul t rates. It also provides
 some evidence that nonrated, nonconvertible securities may have lower
 default rates. Even after controlling for issue size and coupon rates in a
 logit model, these differences rema in statistically significant.

 Tax-Induced Intra-Year Patterns in Bonds Yields.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 331-44
Issue: 1
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The ratio of the yields on short-term tax-exempt and taxable bonds
 exhibits a sawtooth pattern that is consistent with th e impacts of tax
 deferments from dates on which interest payments are received to dates on
 which the resulting tax payments are paid. The effect of the tax deferment
 at turns of calendar years does not diff er appreciably from the effect at
 the turn of any other tax quarter. Investors with tax payment schedules
 that differ from that of the investor that is indifferent between
 investing in taxable and tax-exempt bonds may benefit from tax-related
 timing strategies for investing in these bonds. Issuers may benefit from
 tax-related timin g strategies for scheduling interest payments.

Abstract:

 An apparent pricing anomaly exists in the market for U.S. Treasury
 strips: zero-coupon strips created from principal payments typically trade
 at significantly higher prices than otherwi se identical zero-coupon
 strips created from coupon payments. In additi on to documenting this
 phenomenon, this study demonstrates that differences in liquidity and
 differences in reconstitution characteristics explain much of this price
 variation.

 The Valuation Effects of Warrant Extensions.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 305-14
Issue: 1
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 In this paper, the authors examine the warrant price and stock price
 reactions to the announcement of warrant life extensions. As predicted by
 option-pricing theory, warrant prices increase in response to an
 extension. The authors' principal finding is that the stocks of firms
 making the extension announcements experience positive abnormal returns on
 average. They interpret the evidence as supportive of an anticipation
 hypothesis in which the market perceiv es the decision to extend the
 warrants' expiration date as a favorable indication for the stock price
 before the subsequent expiration.

 The Pricing of Initial Public Offerings: A Dynamic Model with Information Production.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 285-304
Issue: 1
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper presents an information-theoretic model of initial public
 offering pricing in which insiders sell stock in both the initial public
 offering and the secondary market, have private information about their
 firm's prospects, and outsiders may engage in costly information
 production about the firm. High-value firms, knowing they are going to
 pool wit h low-value firms, induce outsiders to engage in information
 productio n by underpricing, which compensates outsiders for the cost of
 produci ng information. The information is reflected in the secondary
 market pr ice of equity, giving a higher expected stock price for
 high-value firms.

 On the Determinants of Corporate Hedging.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 267-84
Issue: 1
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Finance theory indicates that hedging increases firm value by reducing
 expected taxes, expected costs of financial distre ss, or other agency
 costs. This paper provides evidence on these hypothe ses using survey data
 on firms' use of forwards, futures, swaps, and options combined with
 COMPUTSTAT data on firm characteristics. Of 16 9 firms in the sample, 104
 firms use hedging instruments in 1986. The data suggest that firms which
 hedge face more convex tax functions, have less coverage of fixed claims,
 are larger, have more growth options in their investment opportunity set,
 and employ fewer hedgin g substitutes.

 The Value of Bank Durability: Borrowers as Bank Stakeholders.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 247-66
Issue: 1
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors examine the value of bank durability to borrowing firms. The
 analysis is based on theoretical models of the asset services view of
 intermediation that imply that private information and associated
 relationship-specific activities are intrinsic to bank lending. The
 authors analyze share price effects on firms with lending relationships
 with Continental Illinois Bank during its de facto failure and subsequent
 FDIC rescue. They find the bank's impending insolvency had negative
 effects and the FDIC rescue positi ve effects on client firm share prices.
 The authors conclude that borro wers incur significant costs in response
 to unanticipated reductions in bank durability and, thus, are bank
 stakeholders.

 Trading and Manipulation around Seasoned Equity Offerings.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 213-45
Issue: 1
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors investigate the potential for manipulation due to the
 interaction between secondary market trading prior to a seasoned equity
 offering and the pricing of the offering. Informed traders acting
 strategically may attempt to manipulate offering prices by selling shares
 prior to the seasoned equity offering, and profit subsequently from lower
 prices in the offering. The model predicts increased selling prior to a
 seasoned equity offering, leading to increases in the marketmaker's
 inventory and temporary price decreases. Further, sinc e manipulation
 conceals information, the ratio of temporary to permane nt components of
 the price movements is predicted to increase.

 Variations in Trading Volume, Return Volatility, and Trading Costs: Evidence on Recent Price Formation Models.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 187-211
Issue: 1
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Patterns in stock market trading volume, trading costs, and return
 volatility are examined using New York Stock Excha nge data from 1988.
 Intraday test results indicate that, for actively traded firms trading
 volume, adverse selection costs, and return volatility are higher in the
 first half-hour of the day. This eviden ce is inconsistent with the Admati
 and Pfleiderer (1988) model which predicts that trading costs are low when
 volume and return volatilit y are high. Interday test results show that,
 for actively traded firms , trading volume is low and adverse selection
 costs are high on Monday , which is consistent with the predictions of the
 Foster and Viswanath an (1990) model.

 Price Information and Equilibrium Liquidity in Fragmented and Centralized Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 157-85
Issue: 1
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper compares centralized.and fragmented markets, such as floor and
 telephone markets. Risk-averse agents compete for one market order. In
 centralized markets, these agents a re market makers or limit order
 traders. They are assumed to observe th e quotes of their competitors. In
 fragmented markets they are dealers. They can only assess the positions of
 their competitors. The author analyzes differences in bidding strategies
 reflecting differences in market structures. The equilibrium number of
 dealers is shown to be increasing in the frequency of trades and the
 volatility of the valu e of the asset: The expected spread is shown to be
 equal in both marke ts, ceteris paribus. But the spread is more volatile
 in centralized than in fragmented markets.

 General Tests of Latent Variable Models and Mean-Variance Spanning.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 131-56
Issue: 1
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The methods of Michael R. Gibbons and Wayne Ferson (1985) are extended,
 relaxing the assumption that expected returns are linear functions of
 predetermined instruments. A model of conditional mean-variance spanning
 generalizes G. Huberman and S. Kandel (1987). The empirical results
 indicate that more than a single risk premium is needed to model expected
 stock and bond returns, but the number of common factors in the expected
 returns is small. However, when size-based common stock portfolios proxy
 for the risk factors, the authors reject the hypothesis that four of them
 describe the conditional expected returns of the other assets.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 1
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The relative performance of no-load, growth-oriented mutual funds
 persists in the near term, with the strongest evidence for a one-year
 evaluation horizon. Portfolios of recent poor performers do significantly
 worse than standard benchmarks; those of recent top performers do better,
 though not significantly so. The difference in risk-adjusted performance
 between the top and bottom octile portfoli os is six to eight percent per
 year. These results are not attributable to known anomalies or
 survivorship bias. Investigations with a differen t (previously used) data
 set and with some post-1988 data confirm the finding of persistence.

Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper documents that strategies that buy stocks that have performed
 well in the past and sell stocks that hav e performed poorly in the past
 generate significant positive returns o ver three- to twelve-month holding
 periods. The authors find that the profitability of these strategies are
 not due to their systematic risk or to delay ed stock price reactions to
 common factors. However, part of the abnorm al returns generated in the
 first year after portfolio formation dissipates in the following two
 years. A similar pattern of returns around the earnings announcements of
 past winners and losers is also documented.

 Long-Term Market Overreaction or Biases in Computed Returns?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 39-63
Issue: 1
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors show that the returns to the typical long-term contrarian
 strategy implemented in previous studies are upwardly biased because they
 are calculated by cumulating single-per iod (monthly) returns over long
 intervals. The cumulation process not on ly cumulates "true" returns but
 also the upward bias in single-period reutrns induced by measurement
 errors. The authors also show that the remaining "true" returns to loser
 or winner firms have no relation to overreaction. This study has important
 implicati ons for event studies that use cumulative returns to assess the
 impact o f information events.

Title: 
 What Moves the Stock and Bond Markets? A Variance Decomposition for Long-Term Asset Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 3-37
Issue: 1
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper uses a vector autoregressive model to decompose excess stock
 and ten-year bond returns into changes in expectations of future stock
 dividends, inflation, short-term real interest rates, and excess stock and
 bond returns. In monthly postwa r U.S. data, stock and bond returns are
 driven largely by news about future excess stock returns and inflation,
 respectively. Real intere st rates have little impact on returns, although
 they do affect the short-term nominal interest rate and the slope of the
 term structure. These findings help to explain the low correlation between
 excess st ock and bond returns.

Title: 
 Spanning with Short-Selling Restrictions.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 791-93
Issue: 2
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 In principle, the set of attainable payoff vectors is reduced if assets
 cannot be sold short. However, the authors show that the original space of
 payoff vectors is spanned despite short sale restrictions if there is one
 additional asset whose payoff is a positively weighted sum of the payoffs
 of the original assets. For example, this condition is automatically
 fulfilled if the original assets are stocks and the additional asset is an
 index future consisting of these stocks.

 A Reexamination of Traditional Hypotheses about the Term Structure: A Comment.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 779-89
Issue: 2
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 An example of a continuous time economy is given whose general
 equilibrium term structure of interest rates obeys the Expectations
 Hypothesis for continuously compounded interest rates and returns,
 contradicting the 1981 claim by Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross that such an
 economy is mathematically impossible. This example does not generate
 exploitable arbitrage opportunities of the type Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross
 claim must arise. The 'Logarithmic Expectations Hypothesis,' as we call
 it, is therefore an acceptable benchmark from which to measure term premia
 in continuous time term structure modeling.

Title: 
 Options, Short Sales, and Market Completeness.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 761-77
Issue: 2
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper presents empirical evidence that trading in options
 contributes to both transactional and informational efficiency of the
 stock market by reducing the effect of constraints on short sales. The
 significantly higher average level of short interest exhibited by
 optionable stocks supports the argument that options facilitate short
 selling. The authors also find significant effects on option prices
 related to the short interest in the underlying stock. They then present
 evidence that options also increase information efficiency. Earlier work,
 that is replicated and extended here, has suggested that short sale
 constraints cause stock prices to underweight negative information.
 Options appear to reduce that effect.

 Disagreements among Shareholders over a Firm's Disclosure Policy.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 747-60
Issue: 2
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the issue of voluntary disclosure of information by
 firms with heterogeneous shareholders. It shows that, in a rational
 expectations setting, better-informed shareholders prefer less disclosure
 than less well-informed shareholders. This is due to differences in the
 adverse risk-sharing effect and the beneficial cost-saving effect of
 disclosure among shareholders with different risk tolerances and
 information acquisition cost functions. The presence of individual
 liquidity shocks is shown to reduce shareholder disagreements regarding a
 firm's disclosure policy.

 The Strategic Role of Debt in Takeover Contests.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 731-45
Issue: 2
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 In a takeover contest, the presence of bidders' existing debtholders, if
 they can be expropriated by issuing new debt with equal or senior
 priority, allows bidders to commit to bid more than their valuation of the
 target. Such commitment can be beneficial because it deters potential
 entry by subsequent bidders and may allow a first bidder to acquire the
 target at a bargain price. The cost is that if entry by subsequent bidders
 does nevertheless take place, because the first bidder has committed
 himself to bid high premia, a bidding war ensues resulting in offers that
 may involve excessive premia, i.e., bids that are larger than the bidders'
 valuation of the target.

Title: 
 Do Short-Term Objectives Lead to Under- or Overinvestment in Long-Term Projects?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 719-29
Issue: 2
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors examine managerial investment decisions in the presence of
 imperfect information and short-term managerial objectives. Prior research
 has argued that such an environment induces managers to underinvest in
 long-run projects. The authors show that short-term objectives and
 imperfect information may also lead to overinvestment and they identify
 how the direction of the distortion depends upon the type of informational
 imperfection present. When investors cannot observe the level of
 investment in the long-run project, suboptimal investment will be induced.
 When investors can observe investment but not its productivity, however,
 overinvestment will occur.

 Information, Ownership Structure, and Shareholder Voting: Evidence from Shareholder-Sponsored Corporate Governance Proposals.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 697-718
Issue: 2
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper examines how information and ownership structure affect voting
 outcomes on shareholder-sponsored proposals to change corporate governance
 structure. The authors find that the outcomes of votes vary systematically
 with the governance and performance records of target firms, the identity
 of proposal sponsors, and the type of proposal. The authors also find that
 outcomes vary significantly as a function of ownership by insiders,
 institutions, outside blockholders, employee stock ownership plans, and
 outside directors who are blockholders. These results suggest that both
 public information and ownership structure have a significant influence on
 voting outcomes.

 Calls of Warrants: Timing and Market Reaction.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the timing of, and reaction to, calls of callable
 warrants. Three main findings emerge. First, unlike convertible bonds or
 preferred stock, callable warrants are called almost as soon as possible.
 Second, there is a negative price reaction of about 3 percent when a call
 is announced. Finally, at the completion of a call, the stock price
 rebounds by an average of 7 percent. The total reaction from announcement
 through completion of the call is a positive excess return of about 4
 percent.

Title: 
 Testing the Predictive Power of Dividend Yields.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 663-79
Issue: 2
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper reexamines the ability of dividend yields to predict
 long-horizon stock returns. The authors use the bootstrap methodology, as
 well as simulations, to examine the distribution of test statistics under
 the null hypothesis of no forecasting ability. These experiments are
 constructed so as to maintain the dynamics of regressions with lagged
 dependent variables over long horizons. They find that the empirically
 observed statistics are well within the 95 percent bounds of their
 simulated distributions. Overall there is no strong statistical evidence
 indicating that dividend yields can be used to forecast stock returns.

Title: 
 Predictable Stock Returns: The Role of Small Sample Bias.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 641-61
Issue: 2
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Predictive regressions are subject to two small sample biases: the
 coefficient estimate is biased if the predictor is endogenous and
 asymptotic standard errors in the case of overlapping periods are biased
 downward. Both biases work in the direction of making t-ratios too large
 so that standard inference may indicate predictability even if none is
 present. Using annual returns since 1872 and monthly returns since 1927,
 the authors estimate empirical distributions by randomizing residuals in
 the vector autoregression representation of the variables. The estimated
 biases are large enough to affect inference in practice and should be
 accounted for when studying predictability.

 Empirical Testing of Real Option-Pricing Models.

Issue: 2
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This research is the first to examine the empirical predictions of a real
 option-pricing model using a large sample of market prices. The author
 finds empirical support for a model that incorporates the option to wait
 to develop land. The option model has explanatory power for predicting
 transactions prices over and above the intrinsic value. Market prices
 reflect a premium for the option to wait to invest that has a mean value
 of 6 percent in the sample. The author also estimates implied standard
 deviations for individual commercial property prices ranging from 18 to 28
 percent per year.

 A Semiautoregression Approach to the Arbitrage Pricing Theory.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 599-620
Issue: 2
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper develops a semiautoregression approach to estimate factors of
 the arbitrage pricing theory that has the advantage of providing a simple
 asymptotic variance-covariance matrix for the factor estimates, which
 makes it easy to adjust for measurement errors. Using the extracted
 factors, the author confirms the finding that the arbitrage pricing theory
 describes asset returns slightly better than the capital asset pricing
 model, although there is still some mispricing in the arbitrage pricing
 theory model. The author finds that not only are the factors priced by the
 market, but the factor premiums move over time in relation to business
 cycle variables.

 Tax-Induced Trading and the Turn-of-the-Year Anomaly: An Intraday Study.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 575-98
Issue: 2
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This study tests the tax-induced trading hypothesis as an explanation of
 the turn-of-the-year anomaly using Canadian and U.S. intraday data. Since
 the Canadian tax year-end precedes the calendar year-end by five business
 days, tax effects may be isolated. The authors find the anomaly is related
 to the degree of seller- and buyer-initiated trading and depends upon the
 incidence of the taxation year-end. Seller-initiated transactions (at bid
 prices) dominate until the tax year-end after which buyer-initiated trades
 (at ask prices) dominate. The anomaly is a function of bid-ask prices.

 Macroeconomic Influences and the Variability of the Commodity Futures Basis.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 555-73
Issue: 2
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors provide evidence that the spread between commodity spot and
 futures prices (the basis) reflects the macroeconomic risks common to all
 asset markets. The basis of many commodities is correlated with the stock
 index dividend yield and corporate bond quality spread. Explanatory power
 is related to exposure to macroeconomic fluctuations: about 40 percent of
 the variation in the basis of a portfolio of commodities with high
 business cycle sensitivity is explained by the stock and bond yields.
 Further diagnostics indicate that these associations are largely due to
 the presence of risk premiums, rather than spot price forecasts, in the
 basis.

 A General Equilibrium Model of International Portfolio Choice.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 529-53
Issue: 2
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The author investigates, in a two-country general equilibrium model,
 whether a bias in consumption towards domestic goods will necessarily lead
 to a preference for domestic securities. We develop a model where
 investors are constrained to consume only from their domestic capital
 stock and where it is costly to transfer capital across countries. In this
 model, investors less risk averse than an investor with log utility bias
 their portfolios towards domestic assets. Investors more risk averse than
 log, however, prefer foreign assets. Thus, this model suggests that it is
 unlikely that the portfolios observed empirically can be explained by the
 high proportion of domestic goods in total consumption.

Issue: 2
Volume: 48

Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors show that for certain capital structures equity has an
 incentive to buy out another claim and alter the firm's investment
 strategy so as to maximize the combined value of equity and the acquired
 claim. This restructuring may reintroduce agency problems into capital
 structures which appear to avoid agency conflicts. By bundling claims, it
 is possible to avoid this agency problem. The agency problem is also
 eliminated.by dispersed ownership of the claims.

 Limitation of Liability and the Ownership Structure of the Firm.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 487-512
Issue: 2
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper models the optimal choice of shareholder liability. If
 investors want managers to be monitored, the monitors should be residual
 claimants (shareholders), and monitoring and firm value will increase as
 shareholders commit more of their wealth to the firm. When liquidating
 wealth is costly, contingent liability dominates direct investment as a
 wealth commitment device; however, if wealth is unobservable, under this
 regime only relatively poor investors will hold shares in equilibrium.
 This may be prevented at a cost by verifying shareholder wealth and
 restricting stock transfers. Comparative statics on various liability

Title: 
 Market Discounts and Shareholder Gains for Placing Equity Privately.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 459-85
Issue: 2
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Despite selling at substantial discounts, private placements of equity
 are associated with positive abnormal returns. The authors find evidence
 that discounts reflect information costs borne by private investors and
 abnormal returns reflect favorable information about firm value. Results
 are consistent with the role of private placements as a solution to the
 Myers and Majluf (1984) underinvestment problem and with the use of
 private placements to signal undervaluation. The authors also find some
 evidence of anticipated monitoring benefits from private sales of equity.
 For the smaller firms that comprise their sample, information effects
 appear to be relatively more important than ownership effects.

Title: 
 CEO Compensation in Financially Distressed Firms: An Empirical Analysis.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 425-58
Issue: 2
Volume: 48
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper studies senior management compensation policy in seventy-seven
 publicly traded firms that filed for bankruptcy or privately restructured
 their debt during 1981 to 1987. Almost one-third of all CEOs are replaced,
 and those who keep their jobs often experience large salary and bonus
 reductions. Newly appointed CEOs with ties to previous management are
 typically paid 35 percent less than the CEOs they replace. In contrast,
 outside replacement CEOs are typically paid 36 percent more than their
 predecessors, and are often compensated with stock options. On average,
 CEO wealth is significantly related to shareholder wealth after firms
 renegotiate their debt contracts. However, managers' compensation is
 sometimes explicitly tied to the value of creditors' claims.

Title: 
 Transformed Securities and Alternative Factor Structures.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 397-405
Issue: 1
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 M. Grinblatt and S. Titman (1985) reformulate a result of G. Chamberlain
 and M.  Rothschild (1983) to show that the approximate factor structure of
 Chamberlain and Rothschild is asymptotically equivalent to the strict
 factor structure of S. A. Ross (1976) as long as investors can always
 repackage securities into an equal number of arbitrary portfolios. This
 paper uses a Procrustes rotation methodology that is compatible with the
 repackaging interpretation of Grinblatt and Titman to show that the
 empirical structure of stock prices is consistent with the convergency
 hypothesis.

Title: 
 A Comparison of Forward and Futures Prices of an Interest Rate-Sensitive Financial Asset.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 381-96
Issue: 1
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper focuses on contractual distinctions as an explanation for the
 price divergence between futures and forward contracts. Specifically, it
 investigates the effect of marking-to-market on the observed price
 differences using the pricing model described in Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross
 (1981). Using previously unavailable data, this paper employs Eurodollars,
 an interest rate-sensitive financial asset, to test the Cox, Ingersoll,
 and Ross model. Unlike prior empirical studies, test results support both
 the weak prediction concerning the sign of the average price difference
 and the stronger prediction that specific covariances explain the
 variation in the price differences.

 Intra-day Arbitrage Opportunities in Foreign Exchange and Eurocurrency Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 363-79
Issue: 1
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors have two primary objectives in this study. First, they
 examine the frequency of attaining simultaneous equilibrium on spot and
 forward foreign exchange markets and on domestic and foreign securities
 markets. Second, they measure the profitability of covered interest
 arbitrage and one-way arbitrage. The authors' empirical analysis has been
 conducted using real-time quotations. The empirical results indicate that
 the markets are efficient in the sense that profit opportunities from
 traditional covered interest arbitrage are rarely available and the
 frequency of attaining simultaneous market equilibrium is surprisingly
 low, thus opening the door for one-way arbitrage.

 Bankruptcy and Insider Trading: Differences between Exchange-Listed and OTC Firms.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 349-62
Issue: 1
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Over the two-year period prior to the bankruptcy announcement, insider
 trading is significantly greater for over-the-counter bankrupt firms, but
 not for exchange-listed firms, than for an industry-size matched sample of
 nonbankrupt firms. In addition, the level of insider selling increases
 over the final five months leading to the first public announcement of
 over-the-counter firms. Finally, firms displaying the most negative price
 reaction over the announcement period are found to have a significantly
 larger proportion of insider selling than other firms.

Title: 
 An Option-Theoretic Approach to the Valuation of Dividend Reinvestment and Voluntary Purchase Plans.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 331-47
Issue: 1
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Many firms with dividend reinvestment plans also allow their shareholders
 to voluntarily invest supplemental funds to purchase additional shares.
 The purchase price for newly issued shares often is determined by the
 average stock price over a prespecified time period preceding the
 investment date. This gives the firm's shareholders an option to invest in
 additional shares only when the stock price exceeds the computed average.
 This paper uses both theoretical and numerical methods to analyze the
 value of these voluntary purchase options in theory and practice.

Abstract:

 This study provides comprehensive publications performance data over a
 twenty-five-year period for finance doctorates. These data indicate that
 publishing one article per year in any finance journal (or finance,
 accounting, economics, or business journal) over any prolonged period of
 time is a truly remarkable feat, met by only 5 percent of the graduates.
 Tenure screens combining various quantity and quality requirements are
 examined to assess their ability to predict future publication
 productivity. Faculty and administrators seeking defensible benchmarks for
 evaluating faculty research productivity in finance will find that these
 data and results are particularly useful.

Title: 
 Option Replication in Discrete Time with Transaction Costs.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 271-93
Issue: 1
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Option replication is discussed in a discrete-time framework with
 transaction costs. The model represents an extension of the
 Cox-Ross-Rubinstein binomial option pricing model to cover the case of
 proportional transaction costs. The method proceeds by constructing the
 appropriate replicating portfolio at each trading interval. Numerical
 values of these prices are presented for a range of parameter values. The
 paper derives a simple Black-Scholes type approximation for the option
 prices with transaction costs and demonstrates numerically that it is
 quite accurate for plausible parameter values.

Title: 
 Long-Lived Private Information and Imperfect Competition.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 247-70
Issue: 1
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors develop a multiperiod auction model in which multiple
 privately informed agents strategically exploit their long-lived
 information. They show that such traders compete aggressively and cause
 most of their common private information to be revealed very rapidly. In
 the limit, as the interval between auctions approaches zero, market depth
 becomes infinite and all private information is revealed immediately.
 These results are in contrast to those of Albert S. Kyle (1985) in which
 the monopolistic informed trader causes his information to be incorporated
 into prices gradually and, when the interval between auctions is
 vanishingly small, market depth is constant over time.

Title: 
 Is Fairly Priced Deposit Insurance Possible?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 227-45
Issue: 1
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors analyze risk-sensitive, incentive-compatible deposit
 insurance in the presence of private information and moral hazard. 
 Without deposit-linked subsidies, it is impossible to implement
 risk-sensitive, incentive-compatible deposit insurance pricing in a
 competitive, deregulated environment except when the deposit insurer is
 the least risk averse agent in the economy. The authors establish this
 formally in the context of an insurance scheme in which privately informed
 depository institutions are offered deposit insurance premia contingent on
 reported capital; the result holds for alternative sorting instruments as
 well. This suggests a contradiction between deregulation and fairly
 priced, risk-sensitive deposit insurance.

 Corporate Dividends and Seasoned Equity Issues: An Empirical Investigation.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 201-25
Issue: 1
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper investigates whether managers rely on dividends to obtain a
 higher price in a stock offering and whether the stock price reaction to
 dividend and offering announcements justifies such a coordination. The
 evidence does not support either conjecture. Issuing firms are not more
 likely to pay or increase dividends than nonissuing firms. Moreover, there
 is little evidence that firms time stock-offering announcements right
 after dividend declarations to benefit from the attendant information
 disclosure. The analysis of dividend and stock-offering announcement
 effects suggests few if any benefits from linking dividend and
 stock-offering announcements.

Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper develops and tests hypotheses that explain the choice of
 accounts receivable management policies. The tests focus on both
 cross-sectional explanations of policy-choice determinants, as well as
 incentives to establish captives. The authors find size, concentration,
 and credit standing of the firm's traded debt and commercial paper are
 each important in explaining the use of factoring, accounts receivable
 secured debt, captive finance subsidiaries, and general corporate credit.
 They also offer evidence that captive formation allows more flexible
 financial contracting. However, the authors find no evidence that captive
 formation expropriates bondholder wealth.

 LBOs, Reversions and Implicit Contracts.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 139-67
Issue: 1
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The conventional view of going-private transactions is that they are
 designed to enhance the efficiency of the firm. A starkly different view
 is that these and other control transactions are motivated to effect
 transfers from other stakeholders in the firm to equity holders. This
 study exploits data describing pension terminations as a way to test these
 theories. The authors conclude that the efficiency theory can plausibly
 explain a substantial number of leveraged-buyout-related terminations, but
 not enough to undermine the transfer theory. More specific predictions
 from the efficiency theory are needed to structure more exacting tests.

 The Success of Acquisitions: Evidence from Divestitures.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 107-38
Issue: 1
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper studies a sample of large acquisitions completed between 1971
 and 1982. By the end of 1989, acquirers have divested almost 44 percent of
 the target companies. The authors characterize the ex post success of the
 divested acquisitions and consider 34 percent to 50 percent of classified
 divestitures as unsuccessful. Acquirer returns and total (acquirer and
 target) returns at the acquisition announcement are significantly lower
 for unsuccessful divestitures than for successful divestitures and
 acquisitions not divested. Although diversifying acquisitions are almost
 four times more likely to be divested than related acquisitions, they do
 not find strong evidence that diversifying acquisitions are less
 successful than related ones.

 Dutch Auction Repurchases: An Analysis of Shareholder Heterogeneity.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 71-105
Issue: 1
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper documents that firms face upward-sloping supply curves when
 they repurchase shares in a Dutch auction, and it analyzes the market
 reaction to these offers. The announcement price increase is highly
 correlated with the ultimate repurchase premium. Prices decline at
 expiration only for pro-rated offers. The cumulative return is positive
 and highly correlated with the repurchase premium, excepting pro-rated
 offers. Much of this price increase is consistent with movement along an
 upward-sloping supply curve. Trading volume around the Dutch auction
 parallels fixed-price repurchases. Supply elasticity is larger for firms
 with large trading volume, firms included in the S&P 500 Index, and
 takeover targets.

 Predictable Stock Returns in the United States and Japan: A Study of Long-Term Capital Market Integration.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 43-69
Issue: 1
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper uses the predictability of monthly excess returns on U.S. and
 Japanese equity portfolios over the U.S Treasury bill rate to study the
 integration of long-term capital markets in these two countries. During
 the period 1971-90, similar variables, including the dividend-price ratio
 and interest-rate variables, help to forecast excess returns in each
 country. In addition, in the 1980s, U.S. variables help to forecast excess
 Japanese stock returns. There is some evidence of common movement in
 expected excess returns across the two countries, which is suggestive of
 integration of long-term capital markets.

 Industrial Structure and the Comparative Behavior of International Stock Market Indices.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 3-41
Issue: 1
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Stock Price Indices are compared across countries in an attempt to
 explain why they exhibit such disparate behavior. Three separate
 explanatory influences are empirically documented. First, part of the
 behavior can be attributed to a technical aspect of index construction;
 some indices are more diversified than others. Second, each country's
 industrial structure plays a major role in explaining stock price
 behavior. Third, for the majority of countries, a portion of national
 equity index behavior can be ascribed to exchange rate behavior. Exchange
 rates explain a significant portion of common currency
 denominated.national index returns, although the amount explained by
 exchange rates is less than the amount explained by industrial structure
 for most countries.

 A Simple and Numerically Efficient Valuation Method for American Puts Using a Modified Geske-Johnson Approach.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 809-16
Issue: 2
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 R. Geske and H. E. Johnson (1984) develop an equation for the American
 put price and obtain accurate prices using a method requiring
 quadrivariate normal integrals evaluated over an interval containing four
 equally spaced exercise points. The authors show that a modification of
 their method, which uses optimal placement of exercise points, yields, in
 most cases, accurate values using nothing more than bivariate normals. In

Title: 
 Positive Prices in CAPM.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 791-808
Issue: 2
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Some equilibrium prices in the capital asset pricing model may be
 negative because of nonmonotonicity of preferences. The authors identify
 several sets of sufficient conditions for prices to be positive. The
 central conditions impose bounds on the investors' risk aversion. These
 bounds do not need to hold globally but only in a relevant range of
 portfolios or combinations of mean and standard deviation. The relevant
 range is specified on the basis of exogenous parameters and variables, and
 it must contain any endogenously determined equilibrium. The bounds on
 risk aversion ensure that the preferences for assets are sufficiently
 well-behaved within the relevant range.

Title: 
 The Pricing of Best Efforts New Issues.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 781-90
Issue: 2
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper offers an explanation for the underpricing of best efforts new
 issues and demonstrates that best efforts contracts allow issuers to use
 information from the market. If investors obtain information that
 indicates that a project will not be profitable, their demand will be low
 and the offering will be withdrawn. If this information is costly,
 investors will have to be compensated for its purchase through a lower
 offering price, which means that issuers will have to underprice. The
 result is consistent with the empirical observation that underpricing is
 considerably greater for best efforts than for firm commitment contracts.

 Market Making in the Options Markets and the Costs of Discrete Hedge Rebalancing.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 765-79
Issue: 2
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 In this paper, the authors provide empirical evidence consistent with the
 hypothesis that options market makers face risks in managing inventory
 that are unique to the options market. In particular, they show that risks
 associated with the inability to rebalance an option position continuously
 and uncertainty about the return volatility of the underlying stock each
 account for a statistically and economically significant proportion of the
 bid-ask spreads quoted for a sample of Chicago Board Options Exchange
 options.

 An Analysis of Intraday Patterns in Bid/Ask Spreads for NYSE Stocks.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 753-64
Issue: 2
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The behavior of time-weighted bid-ask spreads over the trading day are
 examined. The plot of minute-by-minute spreads versus time of day has a
 crude reverse J-shaped pattern. Schwartz identifies four determinants of
 spreads: activity, risk, information, and competition. Using a linear
 regression model, a significant relationship between these same factors
 and intraday spreads is demonstrated, but dummy variables for time of day
 have a reverse J-shape. For given values of the activity, risk,
 information, and competition measures, spreads are higher at the beginning
 and end of the day relative to the interior period.

Title: 
 The Effect of Bond Rating Agency Announcements on Bond and Stock Prices.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 733-52
Issue: 2
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper examines daily excess bond returns associated with
 announcements of additions to Standard and Poor's Credit Watch List, and
 to rating changes by Moody's and Standard and Poor's. Reliably nonzero
 average excess bond returns are observed for additions to Standard and
 Poor's Credit Watch List when an expectations model is used to classify
 additions as either expected or unexpected. Bond price effects are also
 observed for actual downgrade and upgrade announcements by rating
 agencies. Excluding announcements with concurrent disclosures weakens the
 results for downgrades, but not upgrades. The stock price effects of
 rating agency announcements are also examined and contrasted with the bond
 price effects.

Title: 
 Sequential Sales, Learning, and Cascades.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 695-732
Issue: 2
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 When IPO shares are sold sequentially, later potential investors can
 learn from the purchasing decisions of earlier investors. This can lead
 rapidly to "cascades" in which subsequent investors optimally ignore their
 private information and imitate earlier investors. Although rationing in
 this situation gives rise to a winner's curse, it is irrelevant. The model
 predicts that: (1) Offerings succeed or fail rapidly. (2) Demand can be so
 elastic that even risk-neutral issuers underprice to completely avoid
 failure. (3) Issues with good inside information can price their shares so
 high that they sometimes fail. (4) An underwriter may want to reduce the
 communication among investors by spreading the selling effort over a more
 segmented market.

Title: 
 Optimal Contracting and Insider Trading Restrictions.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 673-94
Issue: 2
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Restrictions on trading by insider agents are analyzed using an optimal
 contracting framework. Prohibition of insider trading is shown to be
 Pareto preferred if, and only if, a revelation or moral hazard problem
 exists. If prohibition of insider trading is valuable, then trade
 registration with a delay is shown to be as valuable as a complete
 prohibition. Short-selling restrictions, however, are generally of less
 value than complete prohibition. Finally, regulation of insider agent
 trading by governmental institutions and/or professional associations is
 discussed.

Title: 
 Dual Trading in Futures Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 643-71
Issue: 2
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 With dual trading, brokers trade both for their customers and for their
 own account. The authors study dual trading and find that customers who
 are less likely to be informed have higher expected profits with dual
 trading while customers who are more likely to be informed have higher
 expected profits without dual trading. They also examine the effects of
 frontrunning. The authors test the major empirical implications of their
 model. Consistent with the model, dual traders earn higher profits than
 nondual traders, and customers of dual-trading brokers do better than
 customers of nondual-trading brokers.

Title: 
 Trading Mechanisms in Securities Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 607-41
Issue: 2
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper analyzes price formation under two trading mechanisms: a
 continuous quote-driven system where dealers post prices before order
 submission and an order-driven system where traders submit orders before
 prices are determined. The order-driven system operates either as a
 continuous auction, with immediate order execution, or as a periodic
 auction, where orders are stored for simultaneous execution. With free
 entry into market making, the continuous systems are equivalent. While a
 periodic auction offers greater price efficiency and can function where
 continuous mechanisms fail, traders must sacrifice continuity and bear
 higher information costs.

Title: 
 Time and the Process of Security Price Adjustment.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 576-605
Issue: 2
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper delineates the link between the existence of information, the
 timing of trades, and the stochastic process of prices. The authors show
 that time affects prices, with the time between trades affecting spreads.
 Because the absence of trades is correlated with volume, the authors'
 model predicts a testable relation between spreads and normal and
 unexpected volume, and demonstrates how volume affects the speed of price
 adjustment. Their model also demonstrates how the transaction price series
 will be a biased representation of the true price process, with the
 variance being both overstated and heteroskedastic.

Title: 
 The January Anomaly: Effects of Low Share Price, Transaction Costs, and Bid-Ask Bias.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 553-75
Issue: 2
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The January effect is primarily a low-share price effect and less so a
 market value effect. In the recent 1977-86 period, after-transaction-cost
 raw and excess January returns are lower on low-price stocks than on
 high-price stocks. Failure of informed traders to eliminate significantly
 large before-transaction-cost excess January returns on low-price stocks
 is potentially explained by higher transactions costs and a bid-ask bias.
 At the least, the January anomaly found in prior tests is not persistent
 and, thereby, not likely to be exploitable by typical investors.

Title: 
 Seasonality and Consumption-Based Asset Pricing.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 511-52
Issue: 2
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Most of the evidence on consumption-based asset pricing is based on
 seasonally adjusted consumption data. The consumption-based models have
 not worked well for explaining asset returns, but with seasonally adjusted
 data there are reasons to expect spurious rejections of the models. This
 paper examines asset pricing models using not seasonally adjusted
 aggregate consumption data. The authors find evidence against models with
 time-separable preferences, even when the models incorporate seasonality
 and allow seasonal heteroskedasticity. A model that uses not seasonally
 adjusted consumption data and nonseparable preferences with seasonal
 effects works better according to several criteria. The parameter
 estimates imply a form of seasonal habit persistence in aggregate
 consumption expenditures.

Title: 
 Characterizing Predictable Components in Excess Returns on Equity and Foreign Exchange Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 467-509
Issue: 2
Volume: 47
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This paper first characterizes the predictable components in excess rates
 of returns on major equity and foreign-exchange markets using lagged
 excess returns, dividend yields, and forward premiums as instruments.
 Vector autoregressions demonstrate one-step-ahead predictability and
 facilitate calculations of implied long-horizon statistics, such as
 variance ratios. Estimation of latent variable models then subjects the
 vector autoregressions to constraints derived from dynamic asset pricing
 theories. Examination of volatility bounds on intertemporal marginal rates
 of substitution provides summary statistics that quantify the challenge
 facing dynamic asset pricing models.

Abstract:

 Two easily measured variables, size and book-to-market equity, combine to
 capture the cross-sectional variation in average stock returns associated
 with market "beta", size, leverage, book-to-market equity, and
 earnings-price ratios. Moreover, when the tests allow for variation in
 "beta" that is unrelated to size, t he relation between market "beta" and
 average return is flat, even when "beta" is the only explanatory variable.
