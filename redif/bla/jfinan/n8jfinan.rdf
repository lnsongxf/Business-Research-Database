Title: 
 How Much Can Marketability Affect Security Values?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1767-74
Issue: 5
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 How marketability affects security prices is one of the most important
 issues in finance. The authors derive a simple analytical upper bound on
 the value of marketability using option-pricing theory. They show that
 discounts for lack of marketability can potentially be large even when the
 illiquidity period is very short. This analysis also provides a benchmark
 for assessing the potential costs of exchange rules and regulatory
 requirements restricting the ability of investors to trade when desired.
 Furthermore, these results provide new insights into the relation between
 discounts for lack of marketability and the length of the marketability
 restriction.

Title: 
 Asset Price Dynamics and Infrequent Feedback Trades.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1747-66
Issue: 5
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article combines the continuous arrival of information with the
 infrequency of trades and investigates the effects on asset price dynamics
 of positive- and negative-feedback trading. Specifically, the authors
 model an economy where stocks and bonds are traded by two types of agents:
 speculators who maximize expected utility and feedback traders who
 mechanically respond to price changes and infrequently submit market
 orders. They show that positive-feedback strategies increase the
 volatility of stock returns and the response of stock prices to dividend
 news. Conversely, the presence of negative-feedback traders makes stock
 returns less volatile and prices less responsive to dividends.

Title: 
 Fairly Priced Deposit Insurance and Bank Charter Policy.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1735-46
Issue: 5
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The thrust of current deposit insurance reform--risk-based insurance
 premiums and capital requirements--is an effort to price deposit insurance
 more fairly. Fairly pricing deposit insurance eliminates inequitable
 wealth transfers but it does not lead to an efficient equilibrium. This
 paper shows that an alternative charter policy results in an efficient
 separating equilibrium.

Title: 
 Does the Liquidity of a Debt Issue Increase with Its Size? Evidence from the Corporate Bond and Medium-Term Note Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1719-34
Issue: 5
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 To investigate the liquidity of large issues, this study tests for yield
 differences between corporate bonds and medium-term notes. In the sample,
 medium-term notes have an average issue size of $4 million, compared with
 $265 million for bonds. Among medium-term notes that have the same
 issuance date, the same maturity date, and the same corporate issuer, the
 authors find no relation between size and yields. Moreover, bonds and
 medium-term notes have statistically equivalent yields. Thus, rather than
 suggesting that large issues have greater liquidity, these findings
 indicate that large and small securities issued by the same borrower are
 close substitutes.

Title: 
 Finance Research Productivity and Influence.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1691-1717
Issue: 5
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This study examines differences in finance research productivity and
 influence across 661 academic institutions over the five-year period from
 1989 through 1993. The authors find that forty institutions account for
 over 50 percent of all articles published by sixteen leading journals over
 the five-year period; sixty-six institutions account for two-thirds of the
 articles. Influence is more skewed, with as few as twenty institutions
 accounting for 50 percent of all citations to articles in these journals.
 The number of publications and publication influence increase with faculty
 size and academic accreditation. Prestigious business schools are
 associated with high publication productivity and influence. Coauthors are
 Robert J. Bricker, Kelly R. Brunarski, and Betty J. Simkins.

Title: 
 An Empirical Analysis of the Limit Order Book and the Order Flow in the Paris Bourse.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1655-89
Issue: 5
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 As a centralized, computerized, limit order market, the Paris Bourse is
 particularly appropriate for studying the interaction between the order
 book and order flow. Descriptive methods capture the richness of the data
 and distinctive aspects of the market structure. Order flow is
 concentrated near the quote, while the depth of the book is somewhat
 larger at nearby valuations. We analyze the supply and demand of
 liquidity. For example, thin books elicit orders and thick books result in
 trades. To gain price and time priority, investors quickly place orders
 within the quotes when the depth at the quotes or the spread is large.
 Consistent with information effects, downward (upward) shifts in both bid
 and ask quotes occur after large sales (purchases).

Title: 
 The Allocation of Informed Trading across Related Markets: An Analysis of the Impact of Changes in Equity-Option Margin Requirements.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1635-53
Issue: 5
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors examine the impact of changes in equity-option margin
 requirements on the liquidity of options and underlying stock markets.
 They find that the decrease in margin was associated with an increase in
 spreads and trade informativeness, and a decrease in depth for the
 underlying stocks. In contrast, option spreads decreased indicating a
 change in the relative allocation of informed traders between the two
 markets. When the required margin was increased, no significant change was
 observed in the underlying stocks but option spreads increased. Overall,
 the authors' results indicate that uninformed traders are more sensitive
 to the margin dimension of trading costs.

Title: 
 The Errors in the Variables Problem in the Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1605-34
Issue: 5
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Recent research has documented the failure of market beta to capture the
 cross-section of expected returns within the context of a two-pass
 estimation methodology. However, the two-pass methodology suffers from the
 errors-in-variables (EIV) problem that could attenuate the apparent
 significance of market beta. This article provides a new correction for
 the EIV problem that is robust to conditional heteroscedasticity. After
 the correction, I find more support for the role of market beta and less
 support for the role of firm size in explaining the cross-section of
 expected returns. While the EIV correction leads to a diminished role of
 firm size, the size variable remains a significant force in explaining the
 cross-section of expected returns.

 Good News, Bad News, Volatility, and Betas.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1575-1603
Issue: 5
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors investigate the conditional covariances of stock returns
 using bivariate exponential ARCH models. These models allow market
 volatility, portfolio-specific volatility, and beta to respond
 asymmetrically to positive and negative market and portfolio returns,
 i.e., 'leverage' effects. Using monthly data, the authors find strong
 evidence of conditional heteroscedasticity in both market and nonmarket
 components of returns, and weaker evidence of time-varying conditional
 betas. Surprisingly, while leverage effects appear strong in the market
 component of volatility, they are absent in conditional betas and weak
 and/or inconsistent in nonmarket sources of risk.

Title: 
 The Long-Run Negative Drift of Post-listing Stock Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1547-74
Issue: 5
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 After firms move trading in their stock to the American or New York Stock
 Exchanges, stock returns are generally poor. Although many listing firms
 issue equity around the time of listing, postlisting performance is not
 entirely explained by the equity issuance puzzle. Similar to the
 conclusions regarding other long-run phenomena, poor postlisting
 performance appears related to managers timing their application for
 listing. Managers of smaller firms, where initial listing requirements may
 be more binding, tend to apply for listing before a decline in
 performance. Poor postlisting performance is not observed in larger firms.

Title: 
 Backwardation in Oil Futures Markets: Theory and Empirical Evidence.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1517-45
Issue: 5
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Oil futures prices are often below spot prices. This phenomenon, known as
 strong backwardation, is inconsistent with Hotelling's theory under
 certainty that the net price of an exhaustible resource rises over time at
 the rate of interest. The authors introduce uncertainty and characterize
 oil wells as call options. They show that production occurs only if
 discounted futures are below spot prices, production is nonincreasing in
 the riskiness of future prices, and strong backwardation emerges if the
 riskiness of future prices is sufficiently high. The empirical analysis
 indicates that U.S. oil production is inversely related and backwardation
 is directly related to implied volatility.

 Initial Shareholdings and Overbidding in Takeover Contests.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1491-1515
Issue: 5
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Within the context of takeovers, this paper shows that in private-value
 auctions the optimal individually rational strategy for a bidder with
 partial ownership of the item is to overbid, i.e., to bid more than his
 valuation. This strategy, however, can lead to an inefficient outcome and
 the winning bidder making a net loss. Further, the overbidding result
 implies that the presence of a large shareholder increases the bid premium
 in single-bidder takeovers at the expense of reducing the probability of
 the takeover actually occurring.

 Optimal Investment, Monitoring, and the Staging of Venture Capital.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1461-89
Issue: 5
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This paper examines the structure of staged venture capital investments
 when agency and monitoring costs exist. Expected agency costs increase as
 assets become less tangible, growth options increase, and asset
 specificity rises. Data from a random sample of 794 venture-capital-backed
 firms support the predictions. Venture capitalists concentrate investments
 in early stage and high technology companies where informational
 asymmetries are highest. Decreases in industry ratios of tangible assets
 to total assets, higher market-to-book ratios, and greater R&D intensities
 lead to more frequent monitoring. Venture capitalists periodically gather
 information and maintain the option to discontinue funding projects with
 little probability of going public.

 What Do We Know about Capital Structure? Some Evidence from International Data.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1421-60
Issue: 5
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors investigate the determinants of capital structure choice by
 analyzing the financing decisions of public firms in the major
 industrialized countries. At an aggregate level, firm leverage is fairly
 similar across the G-7 countries. The authors find that factors identified
 by previous studies as correlated in the cross-section with firm leverage
 in the United States are similarly correlated in other countries as well.
 However, a deeper examination of the U.S. and foreign evidence suggests
 that the theoretical underpinnings of the observed correlations are still
 largely unresolved.

 Corporate Control, Portfolio Choice, and the Decline of Banking.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1377-1420
Issue: 5
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 In the 1980s, U.S. banks became systematically less profitable and
 riskier as nonbank competition eroded the profitability of banks'
 traditional activities. Bank failures rose exponentially during this
 decade. The leading explanation for the persistence of these trends
 centers on fixed-rate deposit insurance: the insurance gives bank
 equityholders an incentive to take on risk when the value of bank charters
 falls. The authors propose and test an alternative explanation based on
 corporate control considerations. They show that managerial entrenchment
 played a more important role than did the moral hazard associated with
 deposit insurance in explaining the recent behavior of the banking
 industry.

Title: 
 Interest Rates as Options.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1371-76
Issue: 5
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Since people can hold currency at a zero nominal interest rate, the
 nominal short rate cannot be negative. The real interest rate can be and
 has been negative, since low risk real investment opportunities like
 filling in the Mississippi delta do not guarantee positive returns. The
 inflation rate can be and has been negative, most recently (in the United
 States) during the Great Depression. The nominal short rate is the 'shadow
 real interest rate' (as defined by the investment opportunity set) plus
 the inflation rate, or zero, whichever is greater. Thus the nominal short
 rate is an option. Longer term interest rates are always positive, since
 the future short rate may be positive even when the current short rate is
 zero. We can easily build this option element into our interest rate trees
 for backward induction or Monte Carlo simulation: just create a
 distribution that allows negative nominal rates, and then replace each
 negative rate with zero.

Title: 
 Market Microstructure and the Ex-date Return.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1507-19
Issue: 4
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article examines the role of measurement biases, due to order flow
 effects, in abnormal split ex-day returns. The authors conjecture that
 postsplit orders consist of numerous small buyers and fewer larger
 sellers. This change in order flow causes closing prices to occur more
 frequently at the ask price, consistent with M. T. Maloney and J. H.
 Mulherin (1992) and M. Grinblatt and D. Keim (1991). In addition, this
 change causes specialists' spreads to increase, perhaps to offset larger
 average inventories. The authors examine both NYSE and NASDAQ samples and
 find that order flow biases can explain approximately 80 percent (48
 percent) of the NYSE (NASDAQ) ex-day return.

 Trading Volume and Transaction Costs in Specialist Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1489-1505
Issue: 4
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Prior work with competitive rational expectations equilibrium models
 indicates that there should be a positive relation between trading volume
 and differences in beliefs or information among traders. We show that this
 result is sensitive to whether and how transaction costs are modeled. In a
 specialist market with endogenous transaction costs we show that trading
 volume can be negatively related to the degree of informational asymmetry
 in the market. Our analysis highlights the dependence of volume on market
 structure, and our results suggest that the 'volume effects' of corporate
 or macroeconomic events reflect a decrease, rather than an increase, in
 heterogeneity of beliefs or asymmetry of information.

Abstract:

 The authors compare the relative magnitudes of the components of the
 bid-ask spread for New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)/American Stock Exchange
 (AMEX) stocks to those of National Association of Securities Dealers
 Automated Quotations (NASDAQ)/National Market System (NMS) stocks. They
 find that the order-processing cost component is smaller, and the adverse
 selection component is greater, on the NYSE/AMEX trading systems than on
 the NASDAQ/NMS system. The inventory holding component is also greater for
 exchange-traded stocks than for NASDAQ/NMS stocks, but this may be
 attributable to differences in the characteristics of the firms whose
 stocks trade on the respective systems.

Title: 
 The Role of ESOPs in Takeover Contests.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1451-70
Issue: 4
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article examines both the shareholder wealth effects of employee
 stock ownership plans (ESOPs) announced by firms subject to takeover
 pressure and the takeover incidence of targets with and without ESOPs.
 Although we do not find that defensive ESOPs significantly reduce
 shareholder wealth on average, we identify two factors - the change in
 managerial and employee ownership due to the ESOP and the simultaneous
 announcement of other defensive tactics - that are associated with
 negative stock price reactions. We find that ESOPs are strong deterrents
 to takeover. ESOP targets that are acquired earn higher returns than
 targets without ESOPs, but the difference is not statistically
 significant.

Title: 
 Ratings, Commercial Paper, and Equity Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1431-49
Issue: 4
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors present the first evidence that initial ratings of commercial
 paper influence common stock returns. Highly rated industrial issues of
 commercial paper, unaccompanied by bank letters of credit, are associated
 with significantly positive abnormal returns; lower-rated issues are not.
 The stock price effects of changes in commercial paper ratings also
 demonstrate the relevance of ratings to the financing of firms. Rating
 downgrades, especially those that imply an exit from the commercial paper
 market, produce significantly negative abnormal returns; upgrades have no
 effects. Initial commercial paper ratings and subsequent reratings appear
 to help investors sort firms by their future prospects.

 The Effect of Bankruptcy Protection on Investment: Chapter 11 as a Screening Device.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1403-30
Issue: 4
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Asymmetric information and conflicts of interest between equity and debt
 holders can force a distressed but efficient firm to liquidate and may
 enable a distressed inefficient firm to continue. In the extreme, if it is
 costless for an inefficient firm to mimic an efficient firm in a debt
 restructuring, efficient and inefficient firms are equally likely to
 continue or liquidate. This article shows that Chapter 11 procedures
 impose costs on inefficient firms that would otherwise mimic efficient
 firms. This separation induces voluntary filing for bankruptcy by
 inefficient firms and consequently enables efficient firms to continue
 when they would otherwise be liquidated.

Title: 
 Signaling and Takeover Deterrence with Stock Repurchases: Dutch Auctions versus Fixed Price Tender Offers.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1373-1402
Issue: 4
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article presents a model of repurchase tender offers in which firms
 choose between the Dutch auction method and the fixed price method. Dutch
 auction repurchases are more effective takeover deterrents, while fixed
 price repurchases are more effective signals of undervaluation. The model
 yields empirical implications regarding price effects of repurchases,
 likelihood of takeover, managerial compensation, and cross-sectional
 differences in the elasticity of the supply curve for shares.

Title: 
 Tax-Induced Intertemporal Restrictions on Security Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1347-71
Issue: 4
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article derives testable restrictions on equilibrium asset prices
 when investors have the option to time the realization of their capital
 gains and losses for tax purposes. The tax-timing option alters both the
 magnitude and timing of equity returns relative to those in a tax-free
 model. The tax-induced restrictions are empirically examined, and the tax
 rates and preference parameters are estimated. While the tax-free model
 can be rejected in favor of the tax-based model as the specified
 alternative, the tax-based model is still unable to adequately explain
 cross-sectional differences in asset returns.

Title: 
 Public Information Arrival.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1331-46
Issue: 4
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors develop a measure of public information flow to financial
 markets and use it to document the patterns of information arrival, with
 an emphasis on the intraday flows. The measure is the number of news
 releases by Reuter's News Service per unit of time. The authors find that
 public information arrival is nonconstant, displaying seasonalities and
 distinct intraday patterns. Next they relate their measure of public
 information to aggregate measures of intraday market activity. The
 authors' results suggest a positive, moderate relationship between public
 information and trading volume but an insignificant relationship with
 price volatility.

Title: 
 Volume and Autocovariances in Short-Horizon Individual Security Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1305-29
Issue: 4
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article tests for the relations between trading volume and
 subsequent returns patterns in individual securities' short-horizon
 returns that are suggested by such articles as L. Blume, D. Easley, and M.
 O'Hara (1994) and J. Y. Campbell, S. J. Grossman, and J. Wang (1993).
 Using a variant of B. Lehmann's (1990) contrarian trading strategy, the
 authors find strong evidence of a relation between trading activity and
 subsequent autocovariances in weekly returns. Specifically,
 high-transaction securities experience price reversals, while the returns
 of low-transactions securities are positively autocovarying. Overall,
 information on trading activity appears to be an important predictor of
 the returns of individual securities.

 Exploiting the Conditional Density in Estimating the Term Structure: An Application to the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross Model.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1279-1304
Issue: 4
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors propose an empirical method that utilizes the conditional
 density of the state variables to estimate and test a term structure model
 with known price formulae using data on both discount and coupon bonds.
 The method is applied to an extension of a two-factor model due to J. C.
 Cox, J. E. Ingersoll, and S. A. Ross (1985). The authors' results show
 that estimates based on only bills imply unreasonably large price errors
 for longer maturities. They reject the original Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross
 model using a likelihood ratio test and conclude that the extended Cox,
 Ingersoll, and Ross model also fails to provide a good description of the
 Treasury market.

Title: 
 Interactions of Corporate Financing and Investment Decisions: A Dynamic Framework.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1253-77
Issue: 4
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article analyzes the interaction between a firm's dynamic
 investment, operating, and financing decisions in a model with operating
 adjustment and recapitalization costs. Using numerical analysis, we solve
 the model for cases that highlight interaction effects. We find that
 higher production flexibility (due to lower costs of shutting down and
 reopening a production facility) enhances the firm's debt capacity,
 thereby increasing the net tax shield value of debt financing. While
 higher financial flexibility (resulting from lower recapitalization costs)
 has a similar effect, production flexibility and financial flexibility
 are, to some extent, substitutes. We find that the impact of debt
 financing on the firm's investment and operating decisions is economically
 insignificant.

 Corporate Debt Value, Bond Covenants, and Optimal Capital Structure.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1213-52
Issue: 4
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article examines corporate debt values and capital structure in a
 unified analytical framework. It derives closed-form results for the value
 of long-term risky debt and yield spreads, and for optimal capital
 structure, when firm asset value follows a diffusion process with constant
 volatility. Debt values and optimal leverage are explicitly linked to firm
 risk, taxes, bankruptcy costs, risk-free interest rates, payout rates, and
 bond covenants. The results elucidate the different behavior of junk bonds
 versus investment-grade bonds, and aspects of asset substitution, debt
 repurchase, and debt renegotiation.

Title: 
 A Theory of the Dynamics of Security Returns around Market Closures.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1163-1211
Issue: 4
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Numerous empirical studies document patterns in the means and variances
 of security returns measured over periods that are punctuated by market
 closures. This article develops a multiperiod model in which closures
 delay the resolution of uncertainty, thereby redistributing risk across
 time and agents. Since agents are risk averse in the model, this
 redistribution affects the equilibrium price, altering risk premia,
 liquidity costs, and the degree of informational asymmetry. As a
 consequence, closures alter both the means and variances of returns. The
 article demonstrates that closures can generate a variety of mean and
 variance effects, including those that mirror the empirical phenomena.

 Is the Electronic Open Limit Order Book Inevitable?

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 4
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Under fairly general conditions, this article derives the equilibrium
 price schedule determined by the bids and offers in an open limit order
 book. The analysis shows that the order book has a small-trade positive
 bid-ask spread, and limit orders profit from small trades; the electronic
 exchange provides as much liquidity as possible in extreme situations; the
 limit order book does not invite competition from third market dealers,
 while other trading institutions do; and, if an entering exchange earns
 nonnegative trading profits, the consolidated price schedule matches the
 limit order book price schedule.

Title: 
 Financial Distress and Corporate Performance.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1015-40
Issue: 3
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This study finds that highly leveraged firms lose substantial market
 share to their more conservatively financed competitors in industry
 downturns. Specifically, firms in the top leverage decile in industries
 that experience output contractions see their sales decline by 26 percent
 more than do firms in the bottom leverage decile. A similar decline takes
 place in the market value of equity. These findings are consistent with
 the view that the indirect costs of financial distress are significant and
 positive. Consistent with the theory that firms with specialized products
 are especially vulnerable to financial distress, we find that highly
 leveraged firms that engage in research and development suffer the most in
 economically distressed periods. We also find that the adverse
 consequences of leverage are more pronounced in concentrated industries.

 The Impact of Public Information on the Stock Market.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 923-50
Issue: 3
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 We study the relation between the number of news announcements reported
 daily by Dow Jones & Company and aggregate measures of securities market
 activity including trading volume and market returns. We find that the
 number of Dow Jones announcements and market activity are directly related
 and that the results are robust to the addition of factors previously
 found to influence financial markets such as day-of-the-week dummy
 variables, news importance as proxies by large 'New York Times' headlines
 and major macroeconomic announcements, and non-information sources of
 market activity as measured by dividend capture and triple switching
 rating. However, the observed relation between news and market activity is
 not particularly strong and the patterns in news announcements do not
 explain the day-of-the-week seasonalities in market activity. Our analysis
 of the Dow Jones database confirms the difficulty of linking volume and
 volatility to observed measures of information.

Title: 
 Implied Binomial Trees.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 771-818
Issue: 3
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This article develops a new method for inferring risk-neutral
 probabilities (or state-contingent prices) from the simultaneously
 observed prices of European options. These probabilities are then used to
 infer a unique fully specified recombining binomial tree that is
 consistent with these probabilities (and, hence, consistent with all the
 observed option prices). A simple backwards recursive procedure solves for
 the entire tree. From the standpoint of the standard binomial option
 pricing model, which implies a limiting risk-neutral lognormal
 distribution for the underlying asset, the approach here provides the
 natural (and probably the simplest) way to generalize to arbitrary ending
 risk-neutral probability distributions.

Title: 
 Explaining Forward Exchange Bias . . . Intraday.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1321-29
Issue: 4
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Intraday interest rates are zero. Consequently, a foreign exchange dealer
 can short a vulnerable currency in the morning, close this position in the
 afternoon, and never face an interest cost. This tactic might seem
 especially attractive in times of fixed-rate crisis, since it suggests an
 immunity to the central bank's interest rate defense. In equilibrium,
 however, buyers of the vulnerable currency must be compensated on average
 with an intraday capital gain as long as no devaluation occurs. That is,
 currencies under attack should typically appreciate intraday. Using data
 on intraday exchange rate changes within the European Monetary System, we
 find this prediction is borne out.

Title: 
 The Exchange Rate in the Presence of Transaction Costs: Implications for Tests of Purchasing Power Parity.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1309-19
Issue: 4
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 With transaction costs for trading goods, the nominal exchange rate moves
 within a band around the nominal purchasing power parity (PPP) value. The
 authors model the behavior of the band and of the exchange rate within the
 band. The model explains why there are below-unity slope coefficients in
 regression tests of PPP and why these increase toward unity under
 hyperinflation or with low-frequency data. The authors' results are
 independent of the presence of nontraded goods in the economy.

 Do Managerial Motives Influence Firm Risk Reduction Strategies?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1291-1308
Issue: 4
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article finds evidence consistent with the hypothesis that managers
 consider personal risk when making decisions that affect firm risk. The
 author finds that chief executive officers (CEOs) with more personal
 wealth vested in firm equity tend to diversify. CEOs who are specialists
 at the existing technology tend to buy similar technologies. When
 specialists have many years vested, they tend to diversify, however. Poor
 performance in the existing lines of business is associated with movements
 into new lines of business.

Title: 
 Convertible Bonds Are Not Called Late.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1275-89
Issue: 4
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Starting with Ingersoll (1977), the academic literature has repeatedly
 sought to explain why convertible bonds are called late. The findings here
 demonstrate there is no call delay to explain. This paper finds that most
 convertible bonds, given their call protection, are called as soon as
 possible. For those that are not, there are significant cash flow
 advantages to delaying. The median call delay for all convertible bonds is
 less than four months. If a safety premium is desired to assure the
 conversion value will exceed the call price at the end of call notice
 period, the median call period is less than a month.

 An Analysis of the Recommendations of the "Superstar" Money Managers at Barron's Annual Roundtable.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1257-73
Issue: 4
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors examine the performance of common stock recommendations made
 by prominent money managers at Barron's Annual Roundtable from 1968 to
 1991. To avoid survivorship bias, they examine the performance of
 recommendations by all the participants. The buy recommendations earn
 significant abnormal returns of 1.91 percent from the recommendation day
 to the publication day, a period of about fourteen days. However, the
 abnormal returns are essentially zero for one to three year
 postpublication day holding periods. Thus, an individual investing
 according to the Roundtable recommendations published in in Barron's would
 not benefit from the advice.

 Fundamental Economic Variables, Expected Returns, and Bond Fund Performance.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1229-56
Issue: 4
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 In this article, the authors develop relative pricing (APT) models that
 are successful in explaining expected returns in the bond market. They
 utilize indexes as well as unanticipated changes in economic variables as
 factors driving security returns. An innovation in this article is the
 measurement of the economic factors as changes in forecasts. The return
 indexes are the most important variables in explaining the time series of
 returns. However the addition of the economic variables leads to a large
 improvement in the explanation of the cross-section of expected returns.
 The authors utilize their relative pricing models to examine the
 performance of bond funds.

 Predictability of Stock Returns: Robustness and Economic Significance.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1201-28
Issue: 4
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article examines the robustness of the evidence on predictability of
 U.S. stock returns, and addresses the issue of whether this predictability
 could have been historically exploited by investors to earn profits in
 excess of a buy-and-hold strategy in the market index. We find that the
 predictive power of various economic factors over stock returns changes
 through time and tends to vary with the volatility of returns. The degree
 to which stock returns were predictable seemed quite low during the
 relatively calm markets in the 1960s but increased to a level where, net
 of transaction costs it could have been exploited by investors in the
 volatile markets of the 1970s.

 One Security, Many Markets: Determining the Contributions to Price Discovery.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1175-99
Issue: 4
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 When homogeneous or closely-linked securities trade in multiple markets,
 it is often of interest to determine where price discovery (the
 incorporation of new information) occurs. This article suggests an
 econometric approach based on an implicit unobservable efficient price
 common to all markets. The information share associated with a particular
 market is defined as the proportional contribution of that market's
 innovations to the innovation in the common efficient price. Applied to
 quotes for the thirty Dow stocks, the technique suggests that the
 preponderance of the price discovery takes place at the New York Stock
 Exchange (a median 92.7 percent information share).

 The Behavior of Stock Prices around Institutional Trades.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 4
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 All trades executed by thirty-seven large investment management firms
 from July 1986 to December 1988 are used to study the price impact and
 execution cost of the entire sequence('package') of trades that the
 authors interpret as an order. The authors find that market impact and
 trading cost are related to firm capitalization, relative package size,
 and, most importantly, to the identity of the management firm behind the
 trade. Money managers with high demands for immediacy tend to be
 associated with larger market impact.

Title: 
 Covenants and Collateral as Incentives to Monitor.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1113-46
Issue: 4
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Although monitoring borrowers is thought to be a major function of
 financial institutions, the presence of other claimants reduces an
 institutional lender's incentives to do this. Thus loan contracts must be
 structured to enhance the lender's incentives to monitor. Covenants make a
 loan's effective maturity, and the ability to collateralize makes a loan's
 effective priority, contingent on monitoring by the lender. Thus both
 covenants and collateral can be motivated as contractual devices that
 increase a lender's incentive to monitor. These results are consistent
 with a number of stylized facts about the use of covenants and collateral
 in institutional lending.

 Do LBO Supermarkets Charge More? An Empirical Analysis of the Effects of LBOs on Supermarket Pricing.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1095-1112
Issue: 4
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article examines changes in supermarket prices in local markets
 following supermarket leveraged buyouts (LBOs). The author finds that
 prices rise following LBOs in local markets in which the LBO firm's rivals
 are also highly leveraged and that LBO firms have higher prices than their
 less leveraged rivals, suggesting that LBOs create incentives to raise
 prices. However she also finds that prices fall following LBOs in local
 markets in which rival firms have low leverage and are concentrated. These
 price drops are associated with LBO firms exiting the local market
 suggesting that rivals attempt to 'prey' on LBO chains.

 The Valuation of Cash Flow Forecasts: An Empirical Analysis.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1059-93
Issue: 4
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article compares the market value of highly leveraged transactions
 to the discounted value of their corresponding cash flow forecasts. For
 the authors' sample of 51 highly leveraged transactions completed between
 1983 and 1989, the valuations of discounted cash flow forecasts are within
 10 percent on average of the market values of the completed transactions.
 Their valuations perform at least as well as valuation methods using
 comparable companies and transactions. The authors also invert their
 analysis by estimating the risk premia implied by transaction values and
 forecast cash flows and relating those risk premia to firm and industry
 betas, firm size, and firm book-to-market ratios.

 Performance Changes Following Top Management Dismissals.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1029-57
Issue: 4
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors document that forced resignations of top managers are
 preceded by large and significant declines in operating performance and
 followed by large improvements in performance. However, forced
 resignations are rare and are due more often to external factors (e.g.,
 blockholder pressure, takeover attempts, etc.) than to normal board
 monitoring. Following the management change, these firms significantly
 downsize their operations and are subject to a high rate of corporate
 control activity. Normal retirements are followed by small increases in
 operating income and are also subject to a slightly higher than normal
 incidence of postturnover corporate control activity.

 The Priority Structure of Corporate Liabilities.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 899-917
Issue: 3
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 Most discussions of corporate capital structure effectively assume that
 all debt is the same. Yet debt differs by maturity, covenant restrictions,
 conversion rights, call provisions, and priority. Here, the authors
 examine priority structure across a sample of 4995 COMPUSTAT industrial
 firms from 1981 to 1991. They analyze the variation in the use of capital
 leases, secured debt, ordinary debt, subordinated debt, and preferred
 stock both as a fraction of the firm's market value and as a fraction of
 total fixed claims. The authors' evidence provides consistent support for
 contracting cost hypotheses, mixed support for tax hypotheses, and little
 support for the signaling hypothesis.

 Capital Requirements for Securities Firms.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 821-51
Issue: 3
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 Regulatory authorities set capital requirements to cover the position
 risk of securities firms and to protect against losses arising from
 fluctuations in the value of their holdings. The requirements may be set
 using the comprehensive approach required by the U.S. Securities and
 Exchange Commission, the building-block approach required by the European
 Community, or the portfolio approach required by the United Kingdom. We
 compare these three alternatives using a large sample of U.K. equity
 trading books. The portfolio approach systematically specifies larger
 requirements for riskier books, and vice versa. It is more efficient than
 the building-block approach, and far more efficient than the comprehensive
 approach.

 A Simple Approach to Valuing Risky Fixed and Floating Rate Debt.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 789-819
Issue: 3
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 We develop a simple approach to valuing risky corporate debt that
 incorporates both default and interest rate risk. We use this approach to
 derive simple closed-form valuation expressions for fixed and floating
 rate debt. The model provides a number of interesting new insights about
 pricing and hedging corporate debt securities. For example, we find that
 the correlation between default risk and the interest rate has a
 significant effect on the properties of the credit spread. Using Moody's
 corporate bond yield data, we find that credit spreads are negatively
 related to interest rates and that durations of risky bonds depend on the
 correlation with interest rates. This empirical evidence is consistent
 with the implications of the valuation model.

Title: 
 Dynamic Asset Allocation and the Informational Efficiency of Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 773-87
Issue: 3
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 Markets have an allocational role; even in the absence of news about
 payoffs, prices change to facilitate trade and allocate resources to their
 best use. Allocational price changes create noise in the signal extraction
 process, and markets where such trading is important are markets in which
 we may expect to find a failure of informational efficiency. An important
 source of allocational trading is the use of dynamic trading strategies
 caused by the incomplete equitization of risks. Incomplete equitization
 causes trade. Trade implies the inefficiency of passive strategies, thus
 requiring investors to determine whether price changes are informational
 or allocational.

 What Constitutes Evidence of Discrimination in Lending?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 739-48
Issue: 2
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors analyze a simple model of bank lending in order to ascertain
 what can be inferred from relative denial and default rates about lending
 discrimination. They show that if minority applicants are of lower average
 creditworthiness than majority applicants, then, contrary to a popular
 argument, a uniform, nondiscriminatory credit policy cannot simultaneously
 produce higher denial rates for minority applicants and equal default
 rates for minority and majority applicants. Moreover, the authors show
 that equality of denial or default rates always implies discrimination. In
 particular, equal denial (default) rates imply discrimination against
 majority (minority) applicants.

Title: 
 Lattice Models for Pricing American Interest Rate Claims.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 719-37
Issue: 2
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article establishes efficient lattice algorithms for pricing
 American interest-sensitive claims in the Heath, Jarrow, and Morton
 paradigm under the assumption that the volatility structure of forward
 rates is restricted to a class that permits a Markovian representation of
 the term structure. The class of volatilities that permits this
 representation is quite large and imposes no severe restrictions on the
 structure for the spot rate volatility. The algorithm exploits the
 Markovian property of the term structure and permits the efficient
 computation of all types of interest rate claims. Specific examples are
 provided.

Title: 
 The Effect of Lender Identity on a Borrowing Firm's Equity Return.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 699-718
Issue: 2
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Previous research demonstrates that a firm's common stock price tends to
 fall when it issues new public securities. By contrast, commercial bank
 loans elicit significantly positive borrower returns. This article
 investigates whether the lender's identity influences the market's
 reaction to a loan announcement. Although the authors find no significant
 difference between the market's response to bank and nonbank loans, they
 do find that lenders with a higher credit rating are associated with
 larger abnormal borrower returns. This evidence complements earlier
 findings that an auditor's or investment banker's perceived 'quality'
 signals valuable information about firm value to uninformed market
 investors.

Title: 
 Performance Persistence.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 679-98
Issue: 2
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors explore performance persistence in mutual funds using
 absolute and relative benchmarks. Their sample, largely free of
 survivorship bias, indicates that relative risk-adjusted performance of
 mutual funds persists; however, persistence is mostly due to funds that
 lag the S&P 500. A profit analysis indicates that poor performance
 increases the probability of disappearance. A year-by-year decomposition
 of the persistence effect demonstrates that the relative performance
 pattern depends upon the time period observed and it is correlated across
 managers. Consequently, it is due to a common strategy that is not
 captured by standard stylistic categories or risk adjustment procedures.

Title: 
 Did J. P. Morgan's Men Add Liquidity? Corporate Investment, Cash Flow, and Financial Structure at the Turn of the Twentieth Century.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 661-78
Issue: 2
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article presents evidence suggesting that the relationship that
 existed between the partnership of J. P. Morgan and its client firms
 partially resolved the latter's external financing problems by diminishing
 the principal-agent and asymmetric information problems. The author
 estimates and compares investment regression equations for a sample of
 Morgan-affiliated companies and a control group of nonaffiliated
 companies. The econometric results seem to indicate that companies not
 affiliated to the house of Morgan were liquidity constrained.

Title: 
 Debt Financing under Asymmetric Information.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 633-59
Issue: 2
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors analyze the optimal design of debt maturity, coupon payments,
 and dividend payout restrictions under asymmetric information. They show
 that, if the asymmetry of information is concentrated around long-term
 cash flows, firms finance with coupon-bearing long-term debt that
 partially restricts dividend payments. If the asymmetry of information is
 concentrated around near-term cash flows and there exists considerable
 refinancing risk, firms finance with coupon-bearing long-term debt that
 does not restrict dividend payments. Finally, if the asymmetry of
 information is uniformly distributed across dates, firms finance with
 short-term debt.

Title: 
 The Maturity Structure of Corporate Debt.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 609-31
Issue: 2
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors provide an empirical examination of the determinants of
 corporate debt maturity. Their evidence offers strong support for the
 contracting-cost hypothesis. Firms that have few growth options, are
 large, or are regulated have more long-term debt in their capital
 structure. The authors find little evidence that firms use the maturity
 structure of their debt to signal information to the market. The evidence
 is consistent, however, with the hypothesis that firms with larger
 information asymmetries issue more short-term debt. The authors find no
 evidence that taxes affect debt maturity.

Title: 
 Price Reactions to Dividend Initiations and Omissions: Overreaction or Drift?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 573-608
Issue: 2
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article investigates market reactions to initiations and omissions
 of cash dividend payments. Consistent with prior literature, the authors
 find that the magnitude of short-run price reactions to omissions are
 greater than for initiations. In the year following the announcements,
 prices continue to drift in the same direction, though the drift following
 omissions is stronger and more robust. This postdividend
 initiation/omission price drift is distinct from and more pronounced than
 that following earnings surprises. A trading rule employing both samples
 earns positive returns in twenty-two out of twenty-five years. The authors
 find little evidence for clientele shifts in either sample.

Title: 
 Returns from Investing in Equity Mutual Funds 1971 to 1991.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 549-72
Issue: 2
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Several recent studies suggest that equity mutual fund managers achieve
 superior returns and that considerable persistence in performance exists.
 This study utilizes a unique data set including returns from all equity
 mutual funds existing each year. These data enables the author to more
 precisely examine performance and the extent of survivorship bias. In the
 aggregate, funds have underperformed benchmark portfolios both after
 management expenses and even gross of expenses. Survivorship bias appears
 to be more important than other studies have estimated. Moreover, while
 considerable performance persistence existed during the 1970s, there was
 no consistency in fund returns during the 1980s.

Title: 
 Testing the Expectations Hypothesis on the Term Structure of Volatilities in Foreign Exchange Options.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 529-47
Issue: 2
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article tests the expectations hypothesis in the term structure of
 volatilities in foreign exchange options. In particular, it addresses
 whether long-dated volatility quotes are consistent with expected future
 short-dated volatility quotes, assuming rational expectations. For options
 observed daily from December 1, 1989 to August 31, 1992 on dollar exchange
 rates against the pound, mark, yen, and Swiss franc, the authors are
 unable to reject the expectations hypothesis in the great majority of
 cases. The current spread between long- and short-dated volatility rates
 proves to be a significant predictor of the direction of future
 short-dated rates.

Title: 
 Predicting Volatility in the Foreign Exchange Market.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 507-28
Issue: 2
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Measures of volatility implied in option prices are widely believed to be
 the best available volatility forecasts. In this article, we examine the
 information content and predictive power of implied standard deviations
 (ISDs) derived from Chicago Mercantile Exchange options on foreign
 currency futures. The article finds that statistical time-series models,
 even when given the advantage of 'ex post' parameter estimates, are
 outperformed by ISDs. ISDs, however, also appear to be biased volatility
 forecasts. Using simulations to investigate the robustness of these
 results, the article finds that measurement errors and statistical
 problems can substantially distort inferences. Even accounting for these,
 however, ISDs appear to be too variable relative to future volatility.

 Time-Varying Expected Returns in International Bond Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 481-506
Issue: 2
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article examines the predictable variation in long-maturity
 government bond returns in six countries. A small set of global
 instruments can forecast 4 to 12 percent of monthly variation in excess
 bond returns. The predictable variation is statistically and economically
 significant. Moreover, expected excess bond returns are highly correlated
 across countries. A model with one global risk factor and constant
 conditional betas can explain international bond return predictability if
 the risk factor is proxied by the world excess bond return but not if it
 is proxied by the world excess stock return.

Title: 
 The World Price of Foreign Exchange Risk.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 445-79
Issue: 2
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Departures from purchasing power parity imply that different countries
 have different prices for goods when a common numeraire is used.
 Stochastic changes in exchange rates are associated with changes in these
 prices and constitute additional sources of risk in asset pricing models.
 This article investigates whether exchange rate risks are priced in
 international asset markets using a conditional approach that allows for
 time variation in the rewards for exchange rate risk. The results for
 equities and currencies of the world's four largest equity markets support
 the existence of foreign exchange risk premia.

Title: 
 Time-Varying World Market Integration.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 403-44
Issue: 2
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 We propose a measure of capital market integration arising from a
 conditional regime-switching model. Our measure allows us to describe
 expected returns in countries that are segmented from world capital
 markets in one part of the sample and become integrated later in the
 sample. We find that a number of emerging markets exhibit time-varying
 integration. Some markets appear more integrated than one might expect
 based on prior knowledge of investment restrictions. Other markets appear
 segmented even though foreigners have relatively free access to their
 capital markets. While there is a perception that world capital markets
 have become more integrated, our country-specific investigation suggests
 that this is not always the case.

 Mean Reversion in Equilibrium Asset Prices: Evidence from the Futures Term Structure.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 361-75
Issue: 1
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors use the term structure of futures prices to test whether
 investors anticipate mean reversion in spot asset prices. The empirical
 results indicate mean reversion in each market they examine. For
 agricultural commodities and crude oil, the magnitude of the estimated
 mean reversion is large; for example, point estimates indicate that 44
 percent of a typical spot oil price shock is expected to be reversed over
 the subsequent eight months. For metals, the degree of mean reversion is
 substantially less but still statistically significant. The authors detect
 only weak evidence of mean reversion in financial asset prices. Coauthors
 are Jay F. Coughenour, Paul J. Seguin, and Margaret Monroe Smoller.

 Information Quality, Performance Measurement, and Security Demand in Rational Expectations Economies.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 341-59
Issue: 1
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The relationship between asset demand and information quality in rational
 expectations economies is analyzed. First the authors derive a number of
 new summary descriptive statistics that measure four basic characteristics
 of investment style: asset selection, market timing, aggressiveness, and
 specialization. Then they relate these statistics to the divergence
 between a given investor's information structure and the market average
 information structure. Finally, the authors demonstrate that informational
 differentials can be identified and consistently estimated, using ordinary
 least squares, from the time-series of observed asset demand.

Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article presents a framework for analyzing the dynamic effects of
 anticipated large demand pressures on asset risk premia. The authors show
 that large institutions who can time their entry into the market will
 trade either at the open or during periods of unusual demand pressures.
 They show that if these institutions do enter later in the day, they trade
 in the same direction as institutions which provide liquidity
 continuously; institutions therefore appear to exhibit 'herding' behavior.
 The authors also explore how changing the uncertainty of demand pressures
 late in the day affects trading costs throughout the day.

 Venture Capitalists and the Oversight of Private Firms.

Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article examines the representation of venture capitalists on the
 boards of private firms in their portfolios. If venture capitalists are
 intensive monitors of managers, their involvement as directors should be
 more intense when the need for oversight is greater. The authors shows
 that venture capitalists' representation on the board increases around the
 time of chief executive officer turnover, while the number of other
 outsiders remains constant. He also shows that distance to the firm is an
 important determinant of the board membership of venture capitalists, as
 might be anticipated if the oversight of local firms is less costly than
 more distant businesses.

 This article tests a theoretical model of the basis and open interest of

Title: 
 Trading Behavior and the Unbiasedness of the Market Reaction to Dividend Announcements.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 255-79
Issue: 1
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article examines the price formation process during dividend
 announcement day using daily closing prices and transactions data. The
 authors find that the unconditional positive excess returns, first
 documented by A. Kalay and U. Loewenstein (1985), are higher for
 small-firm and low-priced stocks. Price volatility and trading volume also
 increase during this period. Examination of trade prices relative to the
 bid-ask spread and volume of trades at bid and asked prices shows that the
 excess returns cannot be attributed to measurement errors or to spillover
 effects of tax-related ex-day trading. Rather, the price behavior is
 related to the absorption of dividend information.

Title: 
 Do Expected Shifts in Inflation Affect Estimates of the Long-Run Fisher Relation?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 225-53
Issue: 1
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Recent empirical studies suggest that nominal interest rates and expected
 inflation do not move together one-for-one in the long run, a finding at
 odds with many theoretical models. This article shows that these results
 can be deceptive when the process followed by inflation shifts
 infrequently. The authors characterize the shifts in inflation by a Markov
 switching model. Based upon this model's forecasts, they reexamine the
 long-run relationship between nominal interest rates and inflation.
 Interestingly, the authors are unable to reject the hypothesis that, in
 the long run, nominal interest rates reflect expected inflation
 one-for-one.

Title: 
 Another Look at the Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 185-224
Issue: 1
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors' examination of the cross-section of expected returns reveals
 economically and statistically significant compensation (about 6 to 9
 percent per annum) for beta risk when betas are estimated from time-series
 regressions of annual portfolio returns on the annual return on the
 equally weighted market index. The relation between book-to-market equity
 and returns is weaker and less consistent than that in Fama and French
 (1992). The authors conjecture that past book-to-market results using
 COMPUSTAT data are affected by a selection bias and provide indirect
 evidence.

Title: 
 Portfolio Inefficiency and the Cross-Section of Expected Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 157-84
Issue: 1
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The capital asset pricing model implies that the market portfolio is
 efficient and expected returns are linearly related to betas. Many do not
 view these implications as separate, since either implies the other, but
 the authors demonstrate that either can hold nearly perfectly while the
 other fails grossly. If the index portfolio is inefficient, then the
 coefficient and R[squared] from an ordinary least squares regression of
 expected returns on betas can equal essentially any values and bear no
 relation to the index portfolio's mean-variance location. That location
 does determine the outcome of a mean-beta regression fitted by generalized
 least squares.

Title: 
 Size and Book-to-Market Factors in Earnings and Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 131-55
Issue: 1
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors study whether the behavior of stock prices, in relation to
 size and book-to-market equity (BE/ME), reflects the behavior of earnings.
 Consistent with rational pricing, high BE/ME signals persistent poor
 earnings and low BE/ME signals strong earnings. Moreover, stock prices
 forecast the reversion of earnings growth observed after firms are ranked
 on size and BE/ME. Finally, there are market, size, and BE/ME factors in
 earnings like those in returns. The market and size factors in earnings
 help explain those in returns but the authors find no link between BE/ME
 factors in earnings and returns.

Title: 
 Implementing Option Pricing Models When Asset Returns Are Predictable.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 87-129
Issue: 1
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The predictability of an asset's returns will affect the prices of
 options on that asset, even though predictability is typically induced by
 the drift, which does not enter the option pricing formula. For discretely
 sampled data, predictability is linked to the parameters that do enter the
 option pricing formula. The authors construct an adjustment for
 predictability to the Black-Scholes formula and show that this adjustment
 can be important even for small levels of predictability, especially for
 longer maturity options. They propose several continuous-time linear
 diffusion processes that can capture broader forms of predictability and
 provide numerical examples that illustrate their importance for pricing
 options.

Title: 
 Pricing Derivatives on Financial Securities Subject to Credit Risk.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 53-85
Issue: 1
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article provides a new methodology for pricing and hedging
 derivative securities involving credit risk. Two types of credit risks are
 considered. The first is where the asset underlying the derivative
 security may default. The second is where the writer of the derivative
 security may default. The authors apply the foreign currency analogy of R.
 Jarrow and S. Turnbull (1991) to decompose the dollar payoff from a risky
 security into a certain payoff and a 'spot exchange rate.' Arbitrage-free
 valuation techniques are then employed. This methodology can be applied to
 corporate debt and over the counter derivatives, such as swaps and caps.

 The New Issues Puzzle.

Issue: 1
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Companies issuing stock during 1970 to 1990, whether an initial public
 offering or a seasoned equity offering, have been poor long-run
 investments for investors. During the five years after the issue,
 investors have received average returns of only 5 percent per year for
 companies going public and only 7 percent per year for companies
 conducting a seasoned equity offer. Book-to-market effects account for
 only a modest portion of the low returns. An investor would have had to
 invest 44 percent more money in the issuers than in nonissuers of the same
 size to have the same wealth five years after the offering date.

Title: 
 Postbankruptcy Performance and Management Turnover.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 3-21
Issue: 1
Volume: 50
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article examines the performance of 197 public companies that
 emerged from Chapter 11. Over 40 percent of the sample firms continue to
 experience operating losses in the three years following bankruptcy; 32
 percent reenter bankruptcy or privately restructure their debt. The
 continued involvement of prebankruptcy management in the restructuring
 process is strongly associated with poor postbankruptcy performance. The
 substantial number of firms emerging from Chapter 11 that are not viable
 or need further restructuring provides little evidence that the process
 effectively rehabilitates distressed firms and is consistent with the view
 that there are economically important biases toward continuation of
 unprofitable firms.

 Poison Put Bonds: An Analysis of Their Economic Role.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1905-20
Issue: 5
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article examines the effect of issuing debt with and without 'poison
 put' covenants on outstanding debt and equity claims for the period 1988
 to 1989. The analysis shows that poison put covenants affect stockholders
 negatively and outstanding bondholders positively, while debt issued
 without such covenants has no effect. The study also finds a negative
 relationship between stock and bond returns for firms issuing poison put
 debt. These results are consistent with a 'mutual interest hypothesis,'
 which suggests that the issuance of poison put debt protects managers and,
 coincidentally, bondholders at the expense of stockholders.

 An Empirical Study of the Consequences of U.S. Tax Rules for International Acquisitions by U.S. Firms.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1893-1904
Issue: 5
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article examines the effect of tax factors on the equity values of
 U.S. multinational corporations making foreign acquisitions. Abnormal
 stock returns are found to be related to a tax variable that captures
 differences in the international tax status of acquiring firms but not
 related to a naive tax variable that captures differences between tax
 rates in target countries and the United States. The authors' evidence
 suggests that aggregate intercountry differentials in after-tax returns
 are competed away, while firm-specific, tax-related advantages (or
 disadvantages) are reflected in abnormal returns around the announcement
 date of the acquisition.

 Macroeconomic Seasonality and the January Effect.

Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Many financial markets researchers have sought an explanation for the
 role of January in stock returns. Any explanation of this phenomenon that
 is consistent with rational pricing must specify a source of seasonality
 in expected returns. The pervasive seasonality in the macroeconomy is an
 appealing possibility. A multifactor model that links macroeconomic risk
 to expected return is found to show substantial seasonality in expected
 returns. This model accounts for the seasonality in average returns, while
 the capital asset pricing model cannot.

Abstract:

 In this article, the authors measure and interpret the common 'factors'
 that describe money market returns. Results are presented for both three-
 and four-factor models. The authors find that the three-factor model
 explains, on average, 86 percent of the total variation in most money
 market returns while the four-factor model explains, on average, 90
 percent of this variation. Using mimicking portfolios, they provide an
 interpretation of the systematic risks represented by these factors.

 Why Did NASDAQ Market Makers Stop Avoiding Odd-Eighth Quotes?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1841-60
Issue: 5
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 On May 26 and 27, 1994, several national newspapers reported the findings
 of W. Christie and P. Schultz (1994) who cannot reject the hypothesis that
 marketmakers of active NASDAQ stocks implicitly colluded to maintain
 spreads of at least $0.25 by avoiding odd-eighth quotes. On May 27,
 dealers in Amgen, Cisco Systems, and Microsoft sharply increased their use
 of odd-eighth quotes, and mean inside and effective spreads fell nearly 50
 percent. This pattern was repeated for Apple Computer the following
 trading day. Using individual dealer quotes for Apple and Microsoft, the
 authors find that virtually all dealers moved in unison to adopt
 odd-eighth quotes.

 Why Do NASDAQ Market Makers Avoid Odd-Eighth Quotes?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1813-40
Issue: 5
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The NASDAQ multiple dealer market is designed to produce narrow bid-ask
 spreads through the competition for order flow among individual dealers.
 However, the authors find that odd-eighth quotes are virtually nonexistent
 for 70 of 100 actively traded NASDAQ securities, including Apple Computer
 and Lotus Development. The lack of odd-eighth quotes cannot be explained
 by the negotiation hypothesis of L. Harris (1991), trading activity, or
 other variables thought to impact spreads. This result implies that the
 inside spread for a large number of NASDAQ stocks is at least $0.25 and
 raises the question of whether NASDAQ dealers implicitly collude to
 maintain wide spreads.

 Corporate Events, Trading Activity, and the Estimation of Systematic Risk: Evidence from Equity Offerings and Share Repurchases.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1787-1811
Issue: 5
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors investigate the relation between trading activity, the
 measurement of security returns, and the evolution of security prices by
 examining estimates of systematic risk surrounding equity offerings and
 share repurchases. In contrast to prior studies, they find no evidence of
 changes in systematic risk following either equity offerings or share
 repurchases after correcting for biases caused by infrequent trading and
 price adjustment delays. Moreover, changes in ordinary least squares beta
 estimates are significantly related to contemporaneous changes in trading
 activity. The authors' results have implications for studies interested in
 the properties of security returns, particularly those examining periods
 in which trading activity changes.

Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Consistent with previous research, the authors fail to find a significant
 correlation between the abnormal returns of their sample firms with
 international activities and changes in the dollar. They investigate the
 possibility that this failure is due to mispricing. Lagged changes in the
 dollar are a significant variable in explaining current abnormal returns
 of the authors' sample firms, suggesting that misprizing does occur. A
 simple trading strategy based upon these results generates significant
 abnormal returns. Corroborating evidence from returns around earnings
 announcements as well as errors in analysts' forecasts of earnings is also
 provided.

 Free Cash Flow, Shareholder Value, and the Undistributed Profits Tax of 1936 and 1937.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1727-54
Issue: 5
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 In 1936, the federal government unexpectedly imposed a tax on
 undistributed corporate profits. Despite the direct costs of the tax, its
 announcement produced a positive revaluation of corporate equity,
 particularly among lower-payout firms. The authors interpret this as
 evidence of a divergence between managerial and shareholder preferences
 regarding dividend payout policies, consistent with the presence of agency
 costs. They also find that, despite the incentives created by the tax, the
 actual growth in dividends during 1936 was lower among firms judged more
 likely to be subject to higher agency costs after controlling for
 liquidity, debt, and the growth in earnings.

Abstract:

 This article investigates the change in operating performance of firms as

 between post-IPO operating performance and equity retention by the
 original entrepreneurs but no relation between post-IPO operating
 performance and the level of initial underpricing. Postissue declines in
 the market-to-book ratio, price/earnings ratio, and earnings per share are
 also documented.

 Security Analysis and Trading Patterns When Some Investors Receive Information before Others.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1665-98
Issue: 5
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 In existing models of information acquisition, all informed investors
 receive their information at the same time. This article analyzes trading
 behavior and equilibrium information acquisition when some investors
 receive common private information before others. The model implies that,
 under some conditions, investors will focus only on a subset of securities
 ('herding'), while neglecting other securities with identical exogenous
 characteristics. In addition, the model is consistent with empirical
 correlations that are suggestive of oft-cited trading strategies such as
 profit taking (short-term position reversal) and following the leader
 (mimicking earlier trades).

Title: 
 Testing for Linear and Nonlinear Granger Causality in the Stock Price-Volume Relation.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1639-64
Issue: 5
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Linear and nonlinear Granger causality tests are used to examine the
 dynamic relation between daily Dow Jones stock returns and percentage
 changes in New York Stock Exchange trading volume. The authors find
 evidence of significant bidirectional nonlinear causality between returns
 and volume. They also examine whether the nonlinear causality from volume
 to returns can be explained by volume serving as a proxy for information
 flow in the stochastic process generating stock return variance as
 suggested by P. Clark's (1973) latent common-factor model. After
 controlling for volatility persistence in returns, the authors continue to
 find evidence of nonlinear causality from volume to returns.

Title: 
 Time-Series Variation in Dividend Pricing.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1617-38
Issue: 5
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Ex-dividend day returns vary over time. The ex-day returns of high-yield
 stocks are persistently positive for some time periods and negative for
 others; in contrast, ex-day returns of low-yield stocks are always
 positive and less variable. The authors are unable to explain the
 variation with changes in the tax code but they do find a strong effect
 for the introduction of negotiated commissions. The authors find evidence
 that corporate dividend capturing is affecting ex-day returns and confirm
 the findings of R. H. Gordon and D. F. Bradford (1980) that the price of
 dividends is countercyclical.

Title: 
 Industry Returns and the Fisher Effect.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1595-1615
Issue: 5
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors investigate the cross-sectional relation between
 industry-sorted stock returns and expected inflation, and they find that
 this relation is linked to cyclical movements in industry output. Stock
 returns of noncyclical industries tend to covary positively with expected
 inflation, while the reverse holds for cyclical industries. From a
 theoretical perspective, the authors describe a model that captures both
 (1) the cross-sectional variation in these relations across industries and
 (2) the negative and positive relation between stock returns and inflation
 at short and long horizons, respectively. The model is developed in an
 economic environment in which the spirit of the Fisher model is preserved.

 The Cross-Section of Realized Stock Returns: The Pre-COMPUSTAT Evidence.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1579-93
Issue: 5
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Using a database that is free of survivorship bias, this article finds
 that book-to-market equity, earnings yield, and cash flow yield have
 significant explanatory power with respect to the cross-section of
 realized stock returns during the period from July 1940 through June 1963.
 There is a strong January seasonal in the explanatory power of these
 variables, even though small stocks are, by construction, excluded from
 the sample.

 Contrarian Investment, Extrapolation, and Risk.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1541-78
Issue: 5
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 For many years, scholars and investment professionals have argued that
 value strategies outperform the market. These value strategies call for
 buying stocks that have low prices relative to earnings, dividends, book
 assets, or other measures of fundamental value. While there is some
 agreement that value strategies produce higher returns, the interpretation
 of why they do so is more controversial. This article provides evidence
 that value strategies yield higher returns because these strategies
 exploit the suboptimal behavior of the typical investor and not because
 these strategies are fundamentally riskier.

 Parameter-Based Decision Making under Estimation Risk: An Application to Futures Trading.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 345-57
Issue: 1
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This study shows how the standard portfolio model of futures trading
 should be modified when there is less than perfect information about the
 relevant parameters (estimation risk). The standard and the optimal
 decision rules for futures trading in the presence of estimation risk are
 compared and discussed. An operational model of futures trading for use
 under estimation risk is advanced. In the presence of relevant prior and
 sample information, the model can be used to optimally blend both types of
 information.

 The Interaction between Nonexpected Utility and Asymmetric Market Fundamentals.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 325-43
Issue: 1
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper studies a nonexpected utility, general equilibrium asset
 pricing model in which market fundamentals follow a bivariate Markov
 switching process. The results show that nonexpected utility is capable of
 exactly matching the means of the risk-free rate and the risk premium.
 Asymmetric market fundamentals are capable of generating a negative sample
 correlation between the risk-free rate and the risk premium. Moreover, an
 equilibrium asset pricing model endowed with asymmetric market
 fundamentals is consistent with all five first and second moments of the
 risk-free rate and the risk premium in the U.S. data.

Title: 
 Holiday Trading in Futures Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 307-24
Issue: 1
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 In this paper, the authors find significantly higher preholiday returns
 in futures contracts compared to nonholiday returns. The findings are
 consistent with the inventory adjustment hypothesis, since higher
 preholiday returns associated with lower trading volume are most
 pronounced for exchange-closed holidays. There is evidence of positive
 postholiday returns associated with higher trading volume for
 exchange-open holidays. This is consistent with positive holiday
 sentiments. The holiday effect is uniquely independent: the magnitude of
 excess holiday returns is the largest among all seasonal variations.

 Trading Profits in Dutch Auction Self-Tender Offers.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 291-306
Issue: 1
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors document abnormal trading profits in Dutch auction
 self-tenders. Tender period profits--buying after announcement and selling
 just before expiration--are 1.74 percent. Buying just before expiration
 and tendering yields abnormal profits of 1.36 percent. Total profits from
 buying just after announcement and tendering remain positive after
 adjusting for bid-ask spreads. Trading profits are higher for smaller
 firms and positively correlated with tender period unsystematic risk,
 suggesting that they arise due to the pricing of event risk.

 The Effect of Dividend Changes on Stock and Bond Prices.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 281-89
Issue: 1
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This study examines stock and bond price reactions to dividend changes.
 The positive stock market response to dividend increases has several
 potential explanations, two of the more commonly discussed being
 information content and wealth redistribution between stockholders and
 bondholders. The evidence presented supports the wealth redistribution
 hypothesis but does not rule out the information content hypothesis.
 Typically, the authors find that the bond price reaction to announcements
 of large dividend changes is opposite to the stock price reaction. Their
 results differ from those of G. Handjinicolaou and A. Kalay (1984).

Abstract:

 This paper examines the efficiency of the legal gambling market for major
 league baseball. Weak-form tests of market efficiency within and across
 odds lines are performed. Surprisingly, the consistently observed
 favorite-longshot bias in racetrack betting is shown to exist in reverse
 for baseball bettors. However, these and other deviations from efficiency
 are shown to be insufficient to allow for profitable betting strategies
 when commissions are considered.

Abstract:

 The authors examine stock returns following large one-day price declines
 and find that the bid-ask bounce and the degree of market liquidity
 explain short-term price reversals. Further, they do not find evidence
 consistent with the overreaction hypothesis. The authors observe that
 securities with large one-day price declines perform poorly over an
 extended time horizon.

 Circuit Breakers and Market Volatility: A Theoretical Perspective.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 237-54
Issue: 1
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper examines ex ante effects of 'circuit breakers' (mandated
 trading halts). The author shows that circuit breakers, by causing agents
 to suboptimally advance trades in time, may have the perverse effect of
 increasing price variability and exacerbating price movements. He next
 considers a situation in which a circuit breaker causes trading to be
 halted in both a 'dominant' (more liquid) and a 'satellite' market. As
 agents switch from the dominant market to the satellite market, price
 variability and market liquidity decline on the dominant market and
 increase on the satellite market.

Title: 
 The Value of Wildcard Options.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 215-36
Issue: 1
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Wildcard options are embedded in many derivative contracts. They arise
 when the settlement price of the contract is established before the time
 at which the wildcard option holder must declare his intention to make or
 accept delivery and the exercise of the wildcard option closes out the
 underlying asset position. This paper provides a simple method for valuing
 wildcard options and illustrates the technique by valuing the sequence of
 wildcard options embedded in the S&P 100 index option contract. The
 results show that wildcard options can account for an economically
 significant fraction of S&P 100 index option value.

 Volume, Volatility, and New York Stock Exchange Trading Halts.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 183-214
Issue: 1
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Trading halts increase, rather than reduce, both volume and volatility.
 Volume (volatility) in the first full trading day after a trading halt is
 230 percent (50 to 115 percent) higher than following 'pseudohalts':
 nonhalt control periods matched on time of day, duration, and absolute
 net-of-market returns. These results are robust over different halt types
 and news categories. Higher posthalt volume is observed into the third
 day, while higher posthalt volatility decays within hours. The extent of
 media coverage is a partial determinant of volume and volatility following
 both halts and pseudohalts but a separate halt effect remains after
 controlling for the media effect.

 Market Statistics and Technical Analysis: The Role of Volume.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors investigate the informational role of volume and its
 applicability for technical analysis. They develop a new equilibrium model
 in which aggregate supply is fixed and traders receive signals with
 differing quality. The authors show that volume provides information on
 information quality that cannot be deduced from the price statistic. They
 show how volume, information precision, and price movements relate, and
 demonstrate how sequences of volume and prices can be informative. The
 authors also show that traders who use information contained in market
 statistics do better than traders who do not. Technical analysis, thus,
 arises as a natural component of the agents' learning process.

 Testing Volatility Restrictions on Intertemporal Marginal Rates of Substitution Implied by Euler Equations and Asset Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 123-52
Issue: 1
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The Euler equations derived from intertemporal asset pricing models,
 together with the unconditional moments of asset returns, imply a lower
 bound on the volatility of the intertemporal marginal rate of
 substitution. This paper develops and implements statistical tests of
 these lower bound restrictions. While the availability of short time
 series of consumption data often undermines the ability of these tests to
 discriminate among different utility functions, the authors find that the
 restrictions implied by a number of widely studied financial data sets
 continue to pose quite a challenge to the current generation of
 intertemporal asset pricing theories.

 On the Cross-sectional Relation between Expected Returns and Betas.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 101-21

Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 There is an exact linear relation between expected returns and true
 'betas' when the market portfolio is on the ex ante mean-variance
 efficient frontier but empirical research has found little relation
 between sample mean returns and estimated betas. A possible explanation is
 that market portfolio proxies are mean-variance inefficient. The authors
 categorize proxies that produce particular relations between expected
 returns and true betas. For the special case of a zero relation, a market
 portfolio proxy must lie inside the efficient frontier but it may be close
 to the frontier.

 Mortgage Redlining: Race, Risk, and Demand.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 81-99
Issue: 1
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Charges that geographical redlining is widely practiced by mortgage
 lenders and is associated with racial discrimination have received much
 attention. However, empirical research in this area has yet to document a
 convincing answer to the question of whether redlining even exists. Much
 of the previous research in this area has suffered from failure to account
 for variations in risk and/or failure to adequately control for
 geographical differences in demand. This study addresses these problems in
 an effort to determine whether the disparity in the flow of mortgage
 credit can be explained by differences in risk and demand.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 57-79
Issue: 1
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors model reputation acquisition by investment banks in the
 equity market. Entrepreneurs sell shares in an asymmetrically informed
 equity market either directly or using an investment bank. Investment
 banks, who interact repeatedly with the equity market, evaluate
 entrepreneurs' projects and report to investors in return for a fee.
 Setting strict evaluation standards (unobservable to investors) is costly
 for investment banks, inducing moral hazard. Investment banks'
 credibility, therefore, depends on their equity-marketing history.
 Investment banks' evaluation standards, their reputations, underwriter
 compensation, the market value of equity sold, and entrepreneurs' choice
 between underwritten and nonunderwritten equity issues emerge
 endogenously.

Title: 
 The Effect of a Rating Downgrade on Outstanding Commercial Paper.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 39-56
Issue: 1
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Douglas W. Diamond (1991) argues that a firm's reputation determines
 whether it borrows directly or through an intermediary. The authors test
 the Diamond model by examining the quantity response of commercial paper
 issued by bank holding companies to a rating downgrade. From 1986 to 1991,
 cumulative abnormal declines averaged 6.69 percent in the first two weeks
 after the downgrade and 11.05 percent in the subsequent twelve weeks. In
 contrast to commercial paper issued by bank holding companies, large CDs
 issued by affiliated banks did not change significantly in the period
 around a downgrade, suggesting that deposit insurance may have removed
 market discipline from the CD market.

Title: 
 The Benefits of Lending Relationships: Evidence from Small Business Data.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 3-37
Issue: 1
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper empirically examines how ties between a firm and its creditors
 affect the availability and cost of funds to the firm. The authors analyze
 data collected in a survey of small firms by the Small Business
 Administration. The primary benefit of building close ties with an
 institutional creditor is that the availability of financing increases.
 The authors find smaller effects on the price of credit. Attempts to widen
 the circle of relationships by borrowing from multiple leaders increases
 the price and reduces the availability of credit. In sum, relationships
 are valuable and appear to operate more through quantities rather than
 prices.

 Cointegration, Fractional Cointegration, and Exchange Rate Dynamics.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 737-45
Issue: 2
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Multivariate tests due to Soren Johansen, as implemented by Richard T.
 Baillie and Tim Bollerslev (1989) and Francis X. Diebold, Javier
 Gardeazabal, and Kamil Yilmaz (1994), reveal mixed evidence on whether a
 group of exchange rates are cointegrated. Further analysis of the
 deviations from the cointegrating relationship suggests that it possesses
 long memory and may possibly be well described as a fractionally
 integrated process. Hence, the influence of shocks to the equilibrium
 exchange rates may only vanish at very long horizons.

Title: 
 On Cointegration and Exchange Rate Dynamics.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 727-35
Issue: 2
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Richard T. Baillie and Tim Bollerslev (1989) have recently argued that
 nominal dollar spot exchange rates are cointegrated. Here the authors
 examine an immediate implication of their finding, namely, that
 cointegration implies an error-correction representation yielding
 forecasts superior to those from a martingale benchmark in light of a
 large earlier literature highlighting the predictive superiority of the
 martingale. In an out-of-sample forecasting exercise, the authors find the
 martingale model to be superior. They then perform a battery of improved
 cointegration tests and find that the evidence for cointegration is much
 less strong than previously thought, a result consistent with the outcome
 of the forecasting exercise.

Title: 
 Journal Communication and Influence in Financial Research.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 713-25
Issue: 2
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article uses the articles and citations from a set of eight finance
 journals to explore interjournal citation patterns, the research interests
 of individual journals, each journal's influence in particular areas,
 areas of recent interest to finance, and the extent of interdisciplinary
 borrowing by finance. The authors find the following: two journals
 comprise the research core of finance research, most journals publish in a
 variety of research areas but are influential in a smaller number, a
 higher level of interest in financial markets than in corporate finance or
 financial institutions, and an overall low level of borrowing from outside
 disciplines.

 The Rationality and Price Effects of U.S. Department of Agriculture Forecasts of Oranges.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 681-95
Issue: 2
Volume: 49

Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article examines the effect of public information on the orange
 juice market. The authors investigate the rationality, information
 content, and price effects of U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts of
 the production of oranges. U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts are
 found to be unbiased and efficient. The first forecast contains the most
 new information and subsequent reports become valuable only when freezes
 occur. Significant price movements occur in response to announced
 production in both Florida and California. However, the majority of price
 variations cannot be explained by these movements in supply.

 Expected Returns, Time-Varying Risk, and Risk Premia.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 655-79
Issue: 2
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 A new empirical model for intertemporal capital asset pricing is
 presented that allows both time-varying risk premia and betas where the
 latter are identified from the dynamics of the conditional covariance of
 returns. The model is more successful in explaining the predictable
 variations in excess returns when the returns on the stock market and
 corporate bonds are included as risk factors than when the stock market is
 the single factor. Although changes in the covariance of returns induce
 variations in the betas, most of the predictable movements in returns are
 attributed to changes in the risk premia.

 Efficiency Gains in Unsuccessful Management Buyouts.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 637-54
Issue: 2
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article uses a sample of 120 unsuccessful management buyouts to test
 whether operational improvements following successful management buyouts
 are a result of organizational changes or private information. The
 findings are consistent with the organizational changes hypothesis. Firms
 with an unsuccessful management buyout had no increase in operating
 performance following the buyout attempt. In addition, the cumulative
 abnormal stock return from before the attempted buyout until two years
 after the attempt is insignificantly different from 0 percent. The author
 also finds that management turnover following an unsuccessful management
 buyout is significantly higher than normal.

 The Effect of Market Segmentation and Illiquidity on Asset Prices: Evidence from Exchange Listings.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 611-36
Issue: 2
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article documents the effect on share value of listing on the New
 York Stock Exchange and reports the results of a joint test of Robert C.
 Merton's (1987) investor recognition factor and Yakov Amihud and Haim
 Mendelson's (1986) liquidity factor as explanations of the change in share
 value. The authors find that, during the 1980s, stocks earned abnormal
 returns of 5 percent in response to the listing announcement and that
 listing is associated with an increase in the number of shareholders and a
 reduction in bid-ask spreads. Cross-sectional regressions provide support
 for both investor recognition and liquidity as sources of value from
 exchange listing.

 The Spinoff and Merger Ex-date Effects.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 581-609
Issue: 2
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article shows that some of the wealth gains from financial decisions
 involving changes in security form occur on predictable ex dates. For a
 sample of 113 spinoffs during 1964 to 1990, we document an average excess
 return of 3.0 percent on ex dates, roughly the same magnitude as the
 average announcement-date return. We conjecture that the spinoff ex-date
 return arises because the parent and subsidiary stocks attract different
 investors who prefer to buy the separated shares after the ex date. We
 also document that, on average, the target shareholders in stock-for-stock
 mergers earn an excess return of 1.5 percent on merger ex dates.

 A Characterization of the Daily and Intraday Behavior of Returns on Options.

Volume: 49

Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The daily and intraday behavior of returns on Chicago Board Options
 Exchange options is examined. Option returns contain systematic patterns
 even after adjusting for  patterns in the means and variances of the
 underlying assets. This is consistent with the hypothesis that informed
 trading in options can make the order flow in the options market
 informative about the value of the underlying asset, making options
 nonredundant. The intraday patterns in adjusted option return variances
 are further consistent with a model of strategic trading by informed and
 discretionary liquidity traders.

Abstract:

 This article presents general conditions under which it is possible to
 obtain asset pricing relations from the intertemporal optimal investment
 decision of the firm. Under the assumption of linear homogeneous
 production and adjustment cost functions, it is possible to establish,
 state by state, the equality between the return on investment and the
 market return of the financial claims issued by the firm. This result
 proves to be, in essence, robust to the consideration of very general
 constraints on investment and the inclusion of taxes.

 Time Variations and Covariations in the Expectation and Volatility of Stock Market Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 515-41
Issue: 2
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article investigates empirically the comovements of the conditional
 mean and volatility of stock returns. It extends the results in the
 literature by demonstrating the role of the commercial paper-Treasury
 yield spread in predicting time variation in volatility. The conditional
 mean and volatility exhibit an asymmetric relation, which contrasts with
 the contemporaneous relation that has been tested previously. The
 volatility leads the expected return, and this time-series relation is
 documented using offset correlations, short-horizon contemporaneous
 correlations, and a vector autoregression. These results bring into
 question the value of modeling expected returns as a constant function of
 conditional volatility.

Title: 
 Mean Reversion of Standard & Poor's 500 Index Basis Changes: Arbitrage-Induced or Statistical Illusion?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 479-513
Issue: 2
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Mean reversion in stock index basis changes has been presumed to be
 driven by the trading activity of stock index arbitragers. The authors
 propose here instead that the observed negative autocorrelation in basis
 changes is mainly a statistical illusion, arising because many stocks in
 the index portfolio trade infrequently. Even without formal arbitrage,
 reported basis changes would appear negatively autocorrelated as lagging
 stocks eventually trade and get updated. The implications of this study go
 beyond index arbitrage, however. The authors' analysis suggests that
 spurious elements may creep in whenever the price-change or return series
 of two securities or portfolios of securities are differenced.

Title: 
 Managers, Owners, and the Pricing of Risky Debt: An Empirical Analysis.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 453-77
Issue: 2
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article examines managerial ownership structure and return premia on
 corporate bonds. It is argued that, when managerial ownership is low, an
 increase in managerial ownership increases management's incentives to
 increase stockholder wealth at the expense of bondholder wealth. When
 ownership increases more, however, it is argued that management becomes
 more risk averse, with incentives more closely aligned with bondholders.
 This study finds a positive relation between managerial ownership and bond
 return premia in the low to medium (5 to 25 percent) ownership range.
 There is also weak evidence for a nonpositive relation in the large (over
 25 percent) ownership range. Coauthors are Nikolaos T. Milonas, Anthony
 Saunders, and Nickolaos G. Travlos.

 The Financial and Operating Performance of Newly Privatized Firms: An International Empirical Analysis.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 403-52
Issue: 2
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This study compares the pre- and postprivatization financial and
 operating performance of sixty-one companies from eighteen countries and
 thirty-two industries that experience full or partial privatization
 through public share offerings during the period 1961 to 1990. The
 authors' results document strong performance improvements, achieved
 surprisingly without sacrificing employment security. Specifically, after
 being privatized, firms increase real sales, become more profitable,
 increase their capital investment spending, improve their operating
 efficiency, and increase their work forces. Furthermore, these companies
 significantly lower their debt levels and increase dividend payout.
 Finally, the authors document significant changes in the size and
 composition of corporate boards of directors after privatization.

 Robust Financial Contracting and the Role of Venture Capitalists.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 371-402
Issue: 2
Volume: 49
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors derive a role for inside investors, such as venture
 capitalists, in resolving various agency problems that arise in a
 multistage financial contracting problem. Absent an inside investor, the
 choice of securities is unlikely to reveal all private information and
 overinvestment may occur. An inside investor, however, always makes
 optimal investment decisions if and only if he holds a fixed-fraction
 contract, where he always receives a fixed fraction of the project's
 payoff and finances that same fraction of future investments. This
 contract also eliminates any incentives of the venture capitalist to
 misprice securities issued in later financing rounds.
