Title: 
 Endogenous Borrowing Constraints with Incomplete Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 2187-2209
Issue: 5
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article develops ways to endogenize the borrowing constraints used
 in a class of computable incomplete markets models. The authors allow the
 constraints to depend on an investor's characteristics, such as time
 preference, risk aversion, and income streams. The proposed constraint can
 be interpreted as a borrowing limit within which an investor has no
 incentive to default. Using a numerical algorithm, the authors find that,
 for an array of structural parameters, the endogenous borrowing
 constraints can be much less stringent than the ad hoc borrowing
 constraints adopted by the existing studies.

Title: 
 A New Look at the Monday Effect.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 2171-86
Issue: 5
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 It is well documented that expected stock returns vary with the day of
 the week (the Monday or weekend effect). In this article, the authors show
 that the well-known Monday effect occurs primarily in the last two weeks
 (fourth and fifth weeks) of the month. In addition, the mean Monday return
 of the first three weeks of the month is not significantly different from
 zero. This result holds for most of the subperiods during the 1962-93
 sampling period and for various stock return indexes. The monthly effect
 reported by Robert A. Ariel (1987) and Josef Lakonishok and Seymour Smidt
 (1988) cannot fully explain this phenomenon.

Title: 
 An Examination of Uncovered Interest Rate Parity in Segmented International Commodity Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 2145-70
Issue: 5
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors examine the effect of segmented commodity markets on the
 relation between forward future spot exchange rates in a dynamic economy.
 They calculate the slope coefficient in their theoretical economy from
 regressing exchange rate changes on forward premia. With reasonable
 parameter values, the slope coefficient is less than unity. However, even
 for extreme parameters the slope is not less than zero, as found in the
 data. A negative slope coefficient in a nominal version of the model
 requires the covariance between monetary shocks and relative output shocks
 to be significantly negative, in contrast to the covariance in the data.

Title: 
 Winner-Loser Reversals in National Stock Market Indices: Can They Be Explained?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 2129-44
Issue: 5
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article examines possible explanations for 'winner-loser reversals'
 in the national stock market indices of sixteen countries. There is no
 evidence that loser countries are riskier than winner countries either in
 terms of standard deviations, covariance with the world market or other
 risk factors, or performance in adverse economic states of the world.
 While there is evidence that small markets are subject to larger reversals
 than large markets, perhaps due to some form of market imperfection, the
 reversals are not only a small market phenomenon. The apparent anomaly of
 winner-loser reversals in national market indices therefore remains
 unresolved.

Title: 
 Cost of Transacting and Expected Returns in the Nasdaq Market.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 2113-27
Issue: 5
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article empirically examines the liquidity premium predicted by the
 Amihud and Mendelson (1986) model using NASDAQ data over the 1973-90
 period. The results support the model and are much stronger than for the
 New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), as reported by Nai-Fu Chen and Raymond Kan
 (1989) and Venkat R. Eleswarapu and Marc R. Reinganum (1993). The author
 conjectures that the stronger evidence on the NASDAQ is due to the
 dealers' inside spreads on the NASDAQ being a better proxy for the actual
 cost of transacting than the quoted spreads on the NYSE, since the NASDAQ
 dealers do not face competition from limit orders or floor traders.

Title: 
 Trading Costs and Exchange Delisting: The Case of Firms That Voluntarily Move from the American Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 2103-12
Issue: 5
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors examine forty-seven stocks that voluntarily left the American
 Stock Exchange from 1992 through 1995 and listed on the NASDAQ . They find
 that both effective and quoted spreads increase by about 100 percent after
 listing on the NASDAQ. These spread changes are consistent across stocks.
 In contrast, excess returns are positive when firms announce a switch from
 the American Stock Exchange to the NASDAQ. The authors are unable to
 explain this apparent contradiction.

 Journal Influence on the Design of Finance Doctoral Education.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 2091-2102
Issue: 5
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article surveys the influence of research journals on finance
 doctoral education. Influence is measured by citations from syllabi of
 finance seminars. A sample of 101 distinct syllabi submitted by
 thirty-three finance doctoral programs yields a list of 1,031 articles
 cited by at least two schools. These 1,031 articles generate 3,273
 citations referencing seventeen finance, economics, and accounting
 journals, where multiple citations from a single school are counted as a
 single citation. The most notable findings are the wide variety of seminar
 content across finance doctoral programs and the dominance of five finance
 journals in providing this diverse content.

Title: 
 Speculation Duopoly with Agreement to Disagree: Can Overconfidence Survive the Market Test?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 2073-90
Issue: 5
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 In a duopoly model of informed speculation, the authors show that
 overconfidence may strictly dominate rationality since an overconfident
 trader may not only generate higher expected profit and utility than his
 rational opponent but also higher than if he were also rational. This
 occurs because overconfidence acts like a commitment device in a standard
 Cournot duopoly. As a result, for some parameter values the Nash
 equilibrium of a two-fund game is a prisoner's dilemma in which both funds
 hire overconfident managers. Thus, overconfidence can persist and survive
 in the long run.

 Special Repo Rates: An Empirical Analysis.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 2051-72
Issue: 5
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Darrell Duffie (1996) examines the theoretical impact of repo 'specials'
 on the prices of Treasury securities and concludes that, all else the
 same, an issue on special will carry a higher price than an otherwise
 identical issue. The authors examine this hypothesis and find strong
 evidence in support of it. They also examine whether the liquidity premium
 associated with 'on-the-run' issues is due to repo specialness and find
 evidence of a distinct effect. Finally, the authors investigate whether
 auction tightness and percentage awarded to dealers are related to
 subsequent specialness and find that both variables are generally
 significant.

 Empirical Performance of Alternative Option Pricing Models.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 2003-49
Issue: 5
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Substantial progress has been made in developing more realistic option
 pricing models. Empirically, however, it is not known whether and by how
 much each generalization improves option pricing and hedging. The authors
 fill this gap by first deriving an option model that allows volatility,
 interest rates, and jumps to be stochastic. Using S&P 500 options, they
 examine several alternative models from three perspectives: (1) internal
 consistency of implied parameters/volatility with relevant time-series
 data, (2) out-of-sample pricing, and (3) hedging. Overall, incorporating
 stochastic volatility and jumps is important for pricing and internal
 consistency. But for hedging, modeling stochastic volatility alone yields
 the best performance.

Title: 
 A Nonparametric Model of Term Structure Dynamics and the Market Price of Interest Rate Risk.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1973-2002
Issue: 5
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article presents a technique for nonparametrically estimating
 continuous-time diffusion processes that are observed at discrete
 intervals. The authors illustrate the methodology by using daily three and
 six month Treasury bill data, from January 1965 to July 1995, to estimate
 the drift and diffusion of the short rate, and the market price of
 interest rate risk. While the estimated diffusion is similar to that
 estimated by K. C. Chan, et al.(1992), there is evidence of substantial
 nonlinearity in the drift. This is close to zero for low and medium
 interest rates but mean reversion increases sharply at higher interest
 rates.

 Stock Return Predictability and the Role of Monetary Policy.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1951-72
Issue: 5
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article examines whether shifts in the stance of monetary policy can
 account for the observed predictability in excess stock returns. Using
 long-horizon regressions and short-horizon vector autoregressions, the
 article concludes that monetary policy variables are significant
 predictors of future returns, although they cannot fully account for
 observed stock return predictability. The author undertakes variance
 decompositions to investigate how monetary policy affects the individual
 components of excess returns (risk-free discount rates, risk premia, or
 cash flows).

 Risk Premia and Variance Bounds.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1913-49
Issue: 5
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 If a pricing kernel assigns a premium to a risk variable that differs
 from the one assigned by the minimum-variance admissible kernel, then the
 pricing kernel must exhibit more variability than the minimum-variance
 kernel. Based on this intuition, the authors derive a variance bound that
 is more stringent than that of Lars Peter Hansen and Ravi Jagannathan
 (1991). When the authors apply their bound to the kernel of a
 representative consumer with power utility, they find that the consumption
 risk premium increases the severity of the 'equity-premium puzzle' of
 Rajnish Mehra and Edward C. Prescott (1985).

Title: 
 International Asset Pricing and Portfolio Diversification with Time-Varying Risk.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1881-1912
Issue: 5
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors test the conditional capital asset pricing model (CAPM) for
 the world's eight largest equity markets using a parsimonious generalized
 autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) parameterization.
 Their methodology can be applied simultaneously to many assets and, at the
 same time, accommodate general dynamics of the conditional moments. The
 evidence supports most of the pricing restrictions of the model, but some
 of the variation in risk-adjusted excess returns remains predictable
 during periods of high interest rates. The authors' estimates indicate
 that, although severe market declines are contagious, the expected gains
 from international diversification for a U.S. investor average 2.11
 percent per year and have not significantly declined over the last two
 decades.

 International Portfolio Investment Flows.

Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article develops a model of international equity portfolio
 investment flows based on differences in informational endowments between
 foreign and domestic investors. It is shown that, when domestic investors
 possess a cumulative information advantage over foreign investors about
 their domestic market, investors tend to purchase foreign assets in
 periods when the return on foreign assets is high and to sell when the
 return is low. The implications of the model are tested using data on U.S.
 equity portfolio flows.

 The Operating Performance of Firms Conducting Seasoned Equity Offerings.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1823-50
Issue: 5
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Recent studies have documented that firms conducting seasoned equity
 offerings have inordinately low stock returns during the five years after
 the offering, following a sharp run-up in the year prior to the offering.
 This article documents that the operating performance of issuing firms
 shows substantial improvement prior to the offering but then deteriorates.
 The multiples at the time of the offering, however, do not reflect an
 expectation of deteriorating performance. Issuing firms are
 disproportionately high-growth firms but issuers have much lower
 subsequent stock returns than nonissuers with the same growth rate.

Title: 
 Myth or Reality? The Long-Run Underperformance of Initial Public Offerings: Evidence from Venture and Nonventure Capital-Backed Companies.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1791-1821
Issue: 5
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors investigate the long-run underperformance of recent initial
 public offering (IPO) firms in a sample of 934 venture-backed IPOs from
 1972 to 1992 and 3,407 nonventure-backed IPOs from 1975 to 1992. They find
 that venture-backed IPOs outperform nonventure-backed IPOs using equal
 weighted returns. Value weighting significantly reduces performance
 differences and substantially reduces underperformance for
 nonventure-backed IPOs. In tests using several comparable benchmarks and
 the Fama-French (1993) three factor asset pricing model, venture-backed
 companies do not significantly underperform, while the smallest
 nonventure-backed firms do. Underperformance, however, is not an IPO
 effect. Similar size and book-to-market firms that have not issued equity
 perform as poorly as IPOs.

 Do Long-Term Shareholders Benefit from Corporate Acquisitions?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1765-90
Issue: 5
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Using 947 acquisitions during 1970-89, this article finds a relationship
 between the postacquisition returns and the mode of acquisition and form
 of payment. During a five-year period following the acquisition, on
 average, firms that complete stock mergers earn significantly negative
 excess returns of -25.0 percent whereas firms that complete cash tender
 offers earn significantly positive excess returns of 61.7 percent. Over
 the combined preacquisition and postacquisition period, target
 shareholders who hold on to the acquirer stock received as payment in
 stock mergers do not earn significantly positive excess returns. In the
 top quartile of target to acquirer size ratio, they earn negative excess

Title: 
 Long-Term Market Overreaction: The Effect of Low-Priced Stocks.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1959-70
Issue: 5
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Conrad and Kaul (1993) report that most of De Bondt and Thaler's (1985)
 long-term overreaction findings can be attributed to a combination of
 bid-ask effects when monthly cumulative average returns (CARs) are used,
 and price, rather than prior returns. In direct tests, we find little
 difference in test-period returns whether CARs or buy-and-hold returns are
 used, and that price has little predictive ability in cross-sectional
 regressions. The difference in findings between this study and Conrad and
 Kaul's is primarily due to their statistical methodology. They confound
 cross-sectional patterns and aggregate time-series mean reversion, and
 introduce a survivor bias. Their procedures increase the influence of
 price at the expense of prior returns.

 The CAPM Is Wanted, Dead or Alive.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1947-58
Issue: 5
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Kothari, Shanken, and Sloan (1995) claim that betas from annual returns
 produce a stronger positive relation between beta and average return than
 betas from monthly returns. They also contend that the relation between
 average return and book-to-market equity (BE/ME) is seriously exaggerated
 by survivor bias. We argue that survivor bias does not explain the
 relation between BE/ME and average return. We also show that annual and
 monthly betas produce the same inferences about the beta premium. Our main
 point on the beta premium is, however, more basic. It cannot save the
 Capital asset pricing model (CAPM), given the evidence that beta alone
 cannot explain expected return.

 The Wealth Effects of Bank Financing Announcements in Highly Leveraged Transactions.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1931-46
Issue: 5
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors analyze the effect of financing announcements of highly
 leveraged transactions on the stock prices of the banks that lead highly
 leveraged transaction lending syndicates. For their sample of forty-one
 highly leveraged transactions, the authors document that the first highly
 leveraged transaction and bank financing announcements result in positive
 wealth effects for the lending banks. They also find that these wealth
 effects are lower in 1985, for smaller highly leveraged transactions, and
 for banks with a high loan loss reserve to total asset ratio. Finally,
 they report that leveraged buyout targets gain about 2 percent, whereas
 leveraged recap targets lose about 2 percent, when the first bank
 financing agreement is announced.

 An Anatomy of the "S&P Game": The Effects of Changing the Rules.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1909-30
Issue: 5
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This study analyzes the effects of changes in S&P 500 index composition
 from January 1986 through June 1994, a period during which Standard and
 Poor's began its practice of preannouncing changes five days beforehand.
 The new announcement practice has given rise to the 'S&P game' and has
 altered the way stock prices react. The authors find that prices increase
 abnormally from the close on the announcement day to the close on the
 effective day. The overall increase is greater than under the old
 announcement policy, although part of the increase reverses after the
 stock is included in the index.

Title: 
 Tests of the Relations among Marketwide Factors, Firm-Specific Variables, and Stock Returns Using a Conditional Asset Pricing Model.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1891-1908
Issue: 5
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 In this article, the authors generalize C. Harvey's (1989) empirical
 specification of conditional asset pricing models to allow for both
 time-varying covariances between stock returns and marketwide factors and
 time-varying reward-to-covariabilities. The model is then applied to
 examine the effects of firm size and book-to-market equity ratios. The
 authors find that the traditional asset pricing model with commonly used
 factors can only explain a small portion of the stock returns predicted by
 firm size and book-to-market equity ratios. The results indicate that
 allowing time-varying covariances and time-varying
 reward-to-covariabilities does little to salvage the traditional asset
 pricing models. Coauthors are Raymond Kan, Lilian Ng, and Chu Zhang.

 Bank Information Monopolies and the Mix of Private and Public Debt Claims.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1863-89
Issue: 5
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article examines the determinants of the mix of private and public
 debt using detailed information on the debt structure of 250 publicly
 traded corporations from 1980 through 1990. The authors find that the
 relationship between bank borrowing and the importance of growth
 opportunities depends on the number of banks the firm uses and whether the
 firm has public debt outstanding. For firms with a single bank
 relationship, the reliance on bank debt is negatively related to the
 importance of growth opportunities. In contrast, among firms borrowing
 from multiple banks, the relationship is positive.

 Limit Order Trading.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1835-61
Issue: 5
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors analyze the rationale for limit order trading. Use of limit
 orders involves two risks: (1) an adverse information event can trigger an
 undesirable execution, and (2) favorable news can result in a desirable
 execution not being obtained. On the other hand, a paucity of limit orders
 can result in accentuated short-term price fluctuations that compensate a
 limit order trader. The authors' empirical tests suggest that trading via
 limit orders dominates trading via market orders for market participants
 with relatively well-balanced portfolios, and that placing a network of
 buy and sell limit orders as a pure trading strategy is profitable.

 The Determinants of the Maturity of Corporate Debt Issues.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1809-33
Issue: 5
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors document the determinants of the term to maturity of 7,369
 bonds and notes issued between 1982 and 1993. Their main finding is that
 large firms with investment grade credit ratings typically borrow at the
 short end and at the long end of the maturity spectrum, while firms with
 speculative grade credit ratings typically borrow in the middle of the
 maturity spectrum. This pattern is consistent with the theory that risky
 firms do not issue short-term debt in order to avoid inefficient
 liquidation, but are screened out of the long-term debt market because of
 the prospect of risky asset substitution.

 Quotes, Prices, and Estimates in a Laboratory Market.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 5
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This study examines the behavior of laboratory markets in which two
 uninformed marketmakers compete to trade with heterogeneously informed
 investors. The data provide three main results. First, marketmakers set
 quotes to protect against adverse selection and to control inventory.
 Second, when investors are 1ess well-informed, their trades are less
 reliable measures of their information, and marketmakers respond to those
 trades with greater skepticism. Third, errors in marketmakers' reactions
 to trades cause the time-series behavior of quotes and prices to depend on
 the information environment in ways beyond those captured in extant
 theory.

 Transparency and Liquidity: A Study of Block Trades on the London Stock Exchange under Different Publication Rules.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1765-90
Issue: 5
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article examines whether reducing a market's transparency, by
 delaying the publication of prices for block trades, has any impact on
 liquidity. The analysis uses a sample of 5,987 blocks from the London
 Stock Exchange that cover three different publication regimes: immediate
 (1987/88), ninety minutes (1991/92), and twenty-four hours (1989/90).
 Delaying publication does not affect the time taken by prices to reach a
 new level, which is rapid under all regimes. Spreads differ across years
 but their size relates more closely to market volatility than to speed of
 publication. There is, therefore, no gain in liquidity from delayed
 publication.

 Measuring International Economic Linkages with Stock Market Data.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1743-63
Issue: 5
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article develops a new framework for measuring financial and real
 economic linkages between countries. Using U.S. and U.K. data from 1957 to
 1989, the authors find closer financial linkages after the Bretton Woods
 currency arrangement was abandoned and Britain suspended exchange
 controls. In a pairwise application to fifteen countries over a shorter
 period, they also find that news about future dividend growth is more
 highly correlated between countries than contemporaneous output measures.
 This suggests that there are lags in the international transmission of
 economic shocks and that contemporaneous output correlation may understate
 the magnitude of integration.

 Expectations and the Cross-Section of Stock Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1715-42
Issue: 5
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Previous research has shown that stocks with low prices relative to book
 value, cash flow, earnings, or dividends (that is, value stocks) earn high
 returns. Value stocks may earn high returns because they are more risky.
 Alternatively, systematic errors in expectations may explain the high
 returns earned by value stocks. The author tests for the existence of
 systematic errors using survey data on forecasts by stock market analysts.
 He shows that investment strategies that seek to exploit errors in
 analysts' forecasts earn superior returns because expectations about
 future growth in earnings are too extreme.

 Momentum Strategies.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1681-1713
Issue: 5
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 We examine whether the predictability of future returns from past returns
 is due to the market's underreaction to information, in particular to past
 earnings news. Past return and past earnings surprise each predict large
 drifts in future returns after controlling for the other. Market risk,
 size, and book-to-market effects do not explain the drifts. There is
 little evidence of subsequent reversals in the returns of stocks with high
 price and earnings momentum. Security analysts' earnings forecasts also
 respond sluggishly to past news, especially in the case of stocks with the
 worst past performance. The results suggest a market that responds only
 gradually to new information.

 The Strategic Exercise of Options: Development Cascades and Overbuilding in Real Estate Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1653-79
Issue: 5
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article develops an equilibrium framework for strategic option
 exercise games. The author focuses on a particular example: the timing of
 real estate development. An analysis of the equilibrium exercise policies
 of developers provides insights into the forces that shape market
 behavior. The model isolates the factors that make some markets prone to
 bursts of concentrated development. The model also provides an explanation
 for why some markets may experience building booms in the face of
 declining demand and property values. While such behavior is often
 regarded as irrational overbuilding, the model provides a rational
 foundation for such exercise patterns.

 A Simple Nonparametric Approach to Derivative Security Valuation.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1633-52
Issue: 5
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Canonical valuation uses historical time series to predict the
 probability distribution of the discounted value of primary assets'
 discounted prices plus accumulated dividends at any future date. Then the
 axiomatically rationalized maximum entropy principle is used to estimate
 risk-neutral (equivalent martingale) probabilities that correctly price
 the primary assets, as well as any predesignated subset of derivative
 securities whose payoffs occur at this date. Valuation of other derivative
 securities proceeds by calculation of its discounted, risk-neutral
 expected value. Both simulation and empirical evidence suggest that
 canonical valuation has merit.

 Recovering Probability Distributions from Option Prices.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1611-32
Issue: 5
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article derives underlying asset risk-neutral probability
 distributions of European options on the S&P 500 index. Nonparametric
 methods are used to choose probabilities that minimize an objective
 function subject to requiring that the probabilities are consistent with
 observed option and underlying asset prices. Alternative optimization
 specifications produce approximately the same implied distributions. A new
 and fast optimization technique for estimating probability distributions
 based on maximizing the smoothness of the resulting distribution is
 proposed. Since the crash, the risk-neutral probability of a three (four)
 standard deviation decline in the index (about -36 percent (-46 percent)
 over a year) is about 10 (100) times more likely than under the assumption
 of lognormality.

 General Properties of Option Prices.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1573-1610
Issue: 5
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 When the underlying price process is a one-dimensional diffusion, as well
 as in certain restricted stochastic volatility settings, a contingent
 claim's delta is bounded by the infimum and supremum of its delta at
 maturity. Further, if the claim's payoff is convex (concave), the claim's
 price is a convex (concave) function of the underlying asset's value.
 However, when volatility is less specialized, or when the underlying
 process is discontinuous or non-Markovian, a call's price can be a
 decreasing, concave function of the underlying price over some range,
 increasing with the passage of time, and decreasing in the level of
 interest rates.

Abstract:

 The authors derive a unified model that gives closed form solutions for
 caps and floors written on interest rates as well as puts and calls
 written on zero-coupon bonds. The crucial assumption is that simple
 interest rates over a fixed finite period that matches the contract, which
 the authors want to price, are log-normally distributed. Moreover, this
 assumption is shown to be consistent with the Heath-Jarrow-Morton model
 for a specific choice of volatility.

Title: 
 Dividends, Taxes, and Signaling: Evidence from Germany.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 397-408
Issue: 1
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The higher taxation of dividends in the United States gave rise to
 theories that explain why companies pay dividends. Tax-based signaling
 models propose that the higher tax on dividends is a necessary condition
 to make them informative about companies' values. In Germany, where
 dividends are not tax-disadvantaged and in fact are taxed lower for most
 investor classes, these models predict that dividends are not informative.
 However, the authors find that the stock price reaction to dividend news
 in Germany is similar to that found in the United States. This suggests
 other reasons, beyond taxation, that make dividends informative.

Title: 
 The Pricing of Initial Public Offers of Corporate Straight Debt.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 379-96
Issue: 1
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This study examines the initial-day and aftermarket price performance of
 corporate straight debt IPOs. The authors find that initial public
 offereings (IPOs) of speculative grade debt are underpriced like equity
 IPOs, while those rated investment grade are overpriced. IPOs of
 investment grade debt are typically issued by firms listed on the major
 exchanges and underwritten by prestigious underwriters. In contrast, junk
 bond IPOs are more likely to be handled by less prestigious underwriters
 and are typically issued by over-the-counter firms. The authors' analysis
 also reveals that bond rating, market listing of the firm, and investment
 banker quality are significant determinants of bond IPO returns.

 Marketable Incentive Contracts and Capital Structure Relevance.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 353-78
Issue: 1
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article investigates the claim that debt finance can increase firm
 value by curtailing managers' access to 'free cash flow.' The author first
 shows that incentive contracts that tie the managers' pay to stockholder
 wealth are often a superior solution to the free cash flow problem. He
 then considers the possibility that the manager can trade on secondary
 capital markets. Liquid secondary markets are shown to undermine
 management incentive schemes and, in many cases, to restore the value of
 debt finance in controlling the free cash flow problem.

 Third Market Broker-Dealers: Cost Competitors or Cream Skimmers?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 341-52
Issue: 1
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article compares the bid-ask spread for New York Stock Exchange-NYSE
 listed securities before and after a major third market broker-dealer,
 Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, begins to selectively purchase
 and execute orders in those securities. Tests reveal the quoted bid-ask
 spread tightens when Madoff enters the market. Furthermore, trading costs
 as measured by the difference between the transaction price and the
 midpoint of the contemporaneous bid-ask spread do not increase. Together,
 these results suggest that the adverse selection problem associated with
 allowing agents to selectively execute orders in exchange-listed
 securities may be economically insignificant.

 The Delisting Bias in CRSP Data.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 327-40
Issue: 1
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The author documents a delisting bias in the stock return data base
 maintained by the Center for Research in Security Prices. He finds that
 delists for bankruptcy and other negative reasons are generally surprises
 and that correct delisting returns are not available for most of the
 stocks that have been delisted for negative reasons since 1962. Using
 over-the-counter price data, the author shows that the omitted delisting
 returns are large. Implications of the bias are discussed.

 Transactions Costs and Holding Periods for Common Stocks.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 309-25
Issue: 1
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Yakov Amihud and Haim Mendelson (1986) and George Constantinides (1986)
 provide a theoretical basis for the proposition that assets with higher
 transactions costs are held by investors for longer holding periods, and
 vice versa. The authors examine average holding periods and bid-ask
 spreads for Nasdaq stocks from 1983 through 1991 and for New York Stock
 Exchange (NYSE) stocks from 1975 through 1989 and find strong evidence
 that, as predicted, the length of investors' holding periods is related to
 bid-ask spreads. They also find that the relation between holding periods
 and bid-ask spreads is much stronger on Nasdaq, where spreads are larger,
 than on the NYSE, where spreads are smaller.

 Market Orders and Market Efficiency.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 277-308
Issue: 1
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This work compares a dealer market and a limit-order book. Dealers
 commonly observe order flow and collect information from multiple market
 orders. They may be better informed than other traders, although they do
 not earn rents from this information. Dealers earn rents as suppliers of
 liquidity and their decisions to enter or exit the market are independent
 of the degree of adverse selection. Introduction of a limit-order book
 lowers the execution-price risk faced by speculators and leads them to
 trade more aggressively on their information. Introduction of the book
 also lowers dealer profits but increases the informational efficiency of
 prices.

 Competition and Collusion in Dealer Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 245-76
Issue: 1
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article develops a game-theoretic model to analyze marketmakers'
 intertemporal pricing strategies. The authors show that dealers who adopt
 noncooperative pricing strategies may set bid-ask spreads above
 competitive levels. This form of 'implicit collusion' differs from
 explicit collusion, where dealers cooperate to fix prices. Price
 discreetness or asymmetric information are not required for collusion to
 occur. Rather, institutional arrangements that restrict access to the
 order flow are important determinants of the ability to collude because
 they reduce dealers' incentives to compete on price. Public policy efforts
 to increase interdealer competition should focus on such restrictions.

 Quotes, Order Flow, and Price Discovery.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 221-44
Issue: 1
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The goal of this article is to examine the impact of 1975 Congressional
 mandate to integrate the trading of NYSE-listed stocks. The conclusions
 are that, most of the time, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) quote
 matches or determines the best displayed quote, and the NYSE is the most
 frequent initiator of quote changes. Non-NYSE markets attract a
 significant portion of their volume when they are posting inferior bids or
 offers, indicating they obtain order flow for other reasons, such as
 'payment for order flow.' Yet, when a non-NYSE market does post a better
 bid or offer, it does attract additional order flow.

 Equity Issuance and Adverse Selection: A Direct Test Using Conditional Stock Offers.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 197-219
Issue: 1
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors conduct a unique test of adverse selection in the equity
 issuance process. While common stock is the dominant means of payment in
 bank mergers, stock acquisition agreements provide target shareholders
 with varying degrees of protection against adverse price movements in the
 bidder's stock between the time of the merger agreement and the time of
 merger completion. The authors show that it is the degree of protection
 against adverse price changes and not the percent of stock offered in a
 bank merger that explains bidder merger announcement abnormal returns.
 This result is difficult to explain outside of an adverse selection
 framework.

 Transactions Costs and Capital Structure Choice: Evidence from Financially Distressed Firms.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 161-96
Issue: 1
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This study provides evidence that transaction costs discourage debt
 reductions by financially distressed firms when they restructure their
 debt out of court. As a result, these firms remain highly leveraged and
 one-in-three subsequently experience financial distress. Transactions
 costs are significantly smaller, hence leverage falls by more and there is
 less recurrence of financial distress when firms recontract in Chapter 11.
 Chapter 11 therefore gives financially distressed firms more flexibility
 to choose optimal capital structures.

 Agency Problems, Equity Ownership, and Corporate Diversification.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 135-60
Issue: 1
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors provide evidence on the agency cost explanation for corporate
 diversification. They find that the level of diversification is negatively
 related to managerial equity ownership and to the equity ownership of
 outside blockholders. In addition, the authors report that decreases in
 diversification are associated with external corporate control threats,
 financial distress, and management turnover. These findings suggest that
 agency problems are responsible for firms maintaining value-reducing
 diversification strategies and that the recent trend toward increased
 corporate focus is attributable to market disciplinary forces.

 Internal Capital Markets and the Competition for Corporate Resources.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 111-33
Issue: 1
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article examines the role of corporate headquarters in allocating
 scare resources to competing projects in an internal capital market.
 Unlike a bank, headquarters has control rights that enable it to engage in
 'winner-picking'--the practice of actively shifting funds from one project
 to another. By doing a good job in the winner-picking dimension,
 headquarters can create value even when it cannot help at all to relax
 overall firmwide credit constraints. The model implies that internal
 capital markets may sometimes function more efficiently when headquarters
 oversees a small and focused set of projects.

 Cash Flow and Investment: Evidence from Internal Capital Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 83-109
Issue: 1
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Using data from the 1986 oil price decrease, the author examines the
 capital expenditures of nonoil subsidiaries of oil companies. He tests the
 joint hypothesis that (1) a decrease in cash/collateral decreases
 investment, holding fixed the profitability of investment, and (2) the
 finance costs of different parts of the same corporation are independent.
 The results support this joint hypothesis: oil companies significantly
 reduced their nonoil investment compared to the median industry
 investment. The 1986 decline in investment was concentrated in nonoil
 units that were subsidized by the rest of the company in 1985.

 On Persistence in Mutual Fund Performance.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 57-82
Issue: 1
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Using a sample free of survivor bias, the author demonstrates that common
 factors in stock returns and investment expenses almost completely explain
 persistence in equity mutual funds' mean and risk-adjusted returns.
 Darryll Hendricks, Jayendu Patel, and Richard Zeckhauser's (1993) 'hot
 hands' result is mostly driven by the one-year momentum effect of
 Narasimham Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman (1993), but individual funds do
 not earn higher returns from following the momentum strategy in stocks.
 The only significant persistence not explained is concentrated in strong
 underperformance by the worst-return mutual funds. The results do not
 support the existence of skilled or informed mutual fund portfolio
 managers.

 The Limits of Arbitrage.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 35-55
Issue: 1
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Textbook arbitrage in financial markets requires no capital and entails
 no risk. In reality, almost all arbitrage requires capital and is
 typically risky. Moreover, professional arbitrage is conducted by a
 relatively small number of highly specialized investors using other
 people's capital. Such professional arbitrage has a number of interesting
 implications for security pricing, including the possibility that
 arbitrage becomes ineffective in extreme circumstances when prices diverge
 far from fundamental values. The model also suggests where anomalies in
 financial markets are likely to appear, and why arbitrage fails to
 eliminate them.

 Evidence on the Characteristics of Cross Sectional Variation in Stock Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1-33
Issue: 1
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Firm sizes and book-to-market ratios are both highly correlated with the
 average returns of common stocks. Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French
 (1993) argue that the association between these characteristics and
 returns arise because the characteristics are proxies for nondiversifiable
 factor risk. In contrast, the evidence in this article indicates that the
 return premia on small capitalization and high book-to-market stocks does
 not arise because of the comovements of these stocks with pervasive
 factors. It is the characteristics rather than the covariance structure of
 returns that appear to explain the cross-sectional variation in stock
 returns.

 Price Limit Performance: Evidence from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 885-99
Issue: 2
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Price limit advocates claim that price limits decrease stock price
 volatility, counter overreaction, and do not interfere with trading
 activity. Conversely, price limit critics claim that price limits cause
 higher volatility levels on subsequent days (volatility spillover
 hypothesis), prevent prices from efficiently reaching their equilibrium
 level (delayed price discovery hypothesis), and interfere with trading due
 to limitations imposed by price limits (trading interference hypothesis).
 Empirical research does not provide conclusive support for either
 positions. The authors examine the Tokyo Stock Exchange price limit system
 to test these hypotheses. Their evidence supports all three hypotheses

Title: 
 Firm Size, Book-to-Market Ratio, and Security Returns: A Holdout Sample of Financial Firms.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 875-83
Issue: 2
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Fama and French (1992) document a significant relation between firm size,
 book-to-market ratios, and security returns for nonfinancial firms.
 Because of their initial interest in leverage as an explanatory variable
 for security returns, Fama and French exclude from their analysis
 financial firms, thus creating a natural holdout sample on which to test
 the robustness of their results. The authors document that the relation
 between firm size, book-to-market ratios, and security returns is similar
 for financial and nonfinancial firms. In addition, they present evidence
 that survivorship bias does not significantly affect the estimated size or
 book-to-market premiums in returns. The authors' results indicate
 data-snooping and selection biases do not explain the size and
 book-to-market patterns in returns.

Title: 
 Good News for Value Stocks: Further Evidence on Market Efficiency.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 859-74
Issue: 2
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article examines the hypothesis that the superior return to
 so-called value stocks is the result of expectational errors made by
 investors. The authors study stock price reactions around earnings
 announcements for value and glamour stocks over a five-year period after
 portfolio formation. The announcement returns suggest that a significant
 portion of the return difference between value and glamour stocks is
 attributable to earnings surprises that are systematically more positive
 for value stocks. The evidence is inconsistent with a risk-based
 explanation for the return differential. Coauthors are Josef Lakonishok,
 Andrei Shleifer, and Robert Vishny.

Title: 
 The Implications of Equity Issuance Decisions within a Parent-Subsidiary Governance Structure.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 841-57
Issue: 2
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors provide evidence about the motivation for a parent-subsidiary
 governance structure by analyzing valuation effects of seasoned equity
 offerings by publicly traded affiliated units. Their results support
 Vikram Nanda's (1991) theoretical model which predicts equity offerings
 convey differential information about subsidiary and parent value.
 Subsidiary equity issuance has negative valuation effects on issuing
 subsidiaries and positive effects on parents, while parent equity issuance
 reduces issuing parent wealth and increases subsidiary wealth. The
 authors' evidence suggests that a parent-subsidiary organizational
 structure enhances corporate financing flexibility and mitigates
 underinvestment problems identified by Stewart Myers and Nicholas Majluf
 (1984). There is no evidence of subsidiary wealth expropriation.

Title: 
 The Valuation of American Options with Stochastic Interest Rates: A Generalization of the Geske-Johnson Technique.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 827-40
Issue: 2
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The Geske-Johnson approach provides an efficient and intuitively
 appealing technique for the valuation and hedging of American-style
 contingent claims. Here, the authors generalize their approach to a
 stochastic interest rate economy. The method is implemented using options
 exercisable on one of a finite number of dates. The authors illustrate how
 the value of an American-style option increases with interest rate
 volatility. The magnitude of this effect depends on the extent to which
 the option is in the money, the volatilities of the underlying asset and
 the interest rates, as well as the correlation between them.

 Equilibrium Valuation of Foreign Exchange Claims.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 799-826
Issue: 2
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article studies the equilibrium valuation of foreign exchange
 contingent claims. Within a continuous-time Lucas (1982) two-country
 model, exchange rates, interest rates, and, in particular, factor risk
 prices are all endogenously and jointly determined. This guarantees the
 internal consistency of these price processes with a general equilibrium.
 In the same model, closed-form valuation formulas are presented for
 currency options and currency futures options. Common to these formulas is
 that stochastic volatility and stochastic interest rates are admitted.
 Hedge ratios and other comparative statics are also provided analytically.
 It is shown that most existing currency option models are included as
 special cases.

Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article examines the auction of a portfolio of collateralized
 mortgage obligations to major broker dealers and institutional investors.
 The unique data set allows the authors to analyze a number of important
 empirical questions related to the valuation of collateralized mortgage
 obligations by the bidders and the elasticity of demand for the
 securities. The results reveal that the valuations differ substantially,
 implying a significant elasticity of demand.

 Institutional Equity Trading Costs: NYSE versus Nasdaq.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 713-35
Issue: 2
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors compare execution costs (market impact plus commission) on
 the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq for institutional investors.
 The differences in cost generally conform to each market's area of
 specialization. Controlling for firm size, trade size, and the money
 management firm's identity, costs are lower on Nasdaq for trades in
 comparatively smaller firms, while costs for trading the larger stocks are
 lower on NYSE. The cost differences estimated from a regression model are,
 however, sensitive to the choice of time period.

 When It's Not the Only Game in Town: The Effect of Bilateral Search on the Quality of a Dealer Market.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 683-712
Issue: 2
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors report results from experimental asset markets with liquidity
 traders and an insider where they allow bilateral trade to take place, in
 addition to public trade with dealers. In the absence of the search
 alternative, dealer profits are large--unlike in models with risk-neutral,
 competitive dealers. However, when the authors allow traders to
 participate in the search market, dealer profits are close to zero.
 Dealers compete more aggressively with the alternative trading avenue than
 with each other. There is no evidence that price discovery is less
 efficient when the specialists are not the only game in town.

 Tick Size, Share Prices, and Stock Splits.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 655-81
Issue: 2
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Minimum price variation rules help explain why stock prices vary
 substantially across countries and other curiosities of share prices.
 Companies tend to split their stock so that the institutionally mandated
 minimum tick size is optimal relative to the stock price. A large relative
 tick size provides an incentive for dealers to make markets and for
 investors to provide liquidity by placing limit orders, despite its
 placing a high floor on the quoted bid-ask spread. A simple model suggests
 that idiosyncratic risk, firm size, and visibility of the firm affect the
 optimal relative tick size and thus the share price.

 On Stock Market Returns and Monetary Policy.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 635-54
Issue: 2
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Financial economists have long debated whether monetary policy is
 neutral. This article addresses this question by examining how stock
 return data respond to monetary policy shocks. Monetary policy is measured
 by innovations in the federal funds rate and nonborrowed reserves, by
 narrative indicators, and by an event study of Federal Reserve policy
 changes. In every case the evidence indicates that expansionary policy
 increases ex post stock returns. Results from estimating a multifactor
 model also indicate that exposure to monetary policy increases an asset's
 ex ante return.

 Are There Tax Effects in the Relative Pricing of U.S. Government Bonds?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 609-33
Issue: 2
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors investigate the impact of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 on the
 relative pricing of U.S. Treasury Bonds. They obtain positive
 statistically and economically significant estimates for the implicit tax
 rates of a 'representative' investor in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
 After the 1986 tax reform, the point estimates for the tax rate are close
 to zero. Tests for a regime shift associated with the 1986 tax reform
 support the hypothesis that this event largely eliminated tax effects from
 the term structure. The authors discuss both institutional and statutory
 explanations for this change.

 Assessing Goodness-of-Fit of Asset Pricing Models: The Distribution of the Maximal R-Squared.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 591-607
Issue: 2
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The development of asset pricing models that rely on instrumental
 variables together with the increased availability of easily accessible
 economic time-series have renewed interest in predicting security returns.
 Evaluating the significance of these new research findings, however, is no
 easy task. Because these asset pricing theory tests are not independent,
 classical methods of assessing goodness-of-fit are inappropriate. This
 study investigates the distribution of the maximal R-square when k of m
 regressors are used to predict security returns. The authors provide a
 simple procedure that adjusts critical R-square values to account for
 selecting variables by searching among potential regressors.

 Assessing Specification Errors in Stochastic Discount Factor Models.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 557-90
Issue: 2
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 In this article, the authors develop alternative ways to compare asset
 pricing models when it is understood that their implied stochastic
 discount factors do not price all portfolios correctly. Unlike comparisons
 based on chi square statistics associated with null hypotheses that models
 are correct, the authors' measures of model performance do not reward
 variability of discount factor proxies. One of their measures is designed
 to exploit fully the implications of arbitrage-free pricing of derivative
 claims. The authors demonstrate empirically the usefulness of their
 methods in assessing some alternative stochastic factor models that have
 been proposed in asset pricing literature.

 Strategic Debt Service.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 531-56
Issue: 2
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 When firms experience financial distress, equity holders may act
 strategically, forcing concessions from debtholders and paying less than
 the originally contracted interest payments. This article incorporates
 strategic debt service in a standard, continuous time asset pricing model,
 developing simple closed-form expressions for debt and equity values. The
 authors find that strategic debt service can account for a substantial
 proportion of the premium on risky corporate debt. They analyze the
 efficiency implications of strategic debt service, showing that it can
 eliminate both direct bankruptcy costs and agency costs of debt.

 Analyst Following of Initial Public Offerings.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 507-29
Issue: 2
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors examine data on analyst following for a sample of initial
 public offerings completed between 1975 and 1987 to see how they related
 to three well-documented initial public offering (IPO) anomalies. They
 find that higher underpricing leads to increased analyst following.
 Analysts are overoptimistic about the earnings potential and long-term
 growth prospects of recent IPOs. More firms complete IPOs when analysts
 are particularly optimistic about the growth prospects of recent IPOs. In
 the long run, IPOs have better stock performance when analysts ascribe low
 growth potential rather than high growth potential. These results suggest
 that the anomalies may be partially driven by overoptimism.

 How Much Do Taxes Discourage Incorporation?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 477-505
Issue: 2
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The double taxation of corporate income should discourage firms from
 incorporating. The authors investigate the extent to which the aggregate
 allocation of assets and taxable income in the United States between
 corporate and noncorporate firms responds to the size of this tax
 distortion during the period 1959-86. In theory, profitable firms should
 shift out of the corporate sector when the tax distortion is large, and
 conversely for firms with tax losses. The authors' empirical results
 provide strong support for these forecasts and imply that the resulting
 excess burden equals 16 percent of business tax revenue.

 Good Timing: CEO Stock Option Awards and Company News Announcements.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 449-76
Issue: 2
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article analyzes the timing of CEO stock option awards as a method
 of investigating corporate managers' influence over the terms of their own
 compensation. In a sample of 620 stock option awards to CEOs of Fortune
 500 companies between 1992 and 1994, the author finds that the timing of
 awards coincides with favorable movements in company stock prices.
 Patterns of companies' quarterly earnings announcements are consistent
 with an interpretation that CEOs receive stock option awards shortly
 before favorable corporate news. The author evaluates and rejects several
 alternative explanations of the results, including insider trading and the
 manipulation of news announcement dates.

 Options on Leveraged Equity: Theory and Empirical Tests.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1151-80
Issue: 3
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 The authors develop an option pricing model for calls and puts written on
 leveraged equity in an economy with corporate taxes and bankruptcy costs.
 The model explains implied Black-Scholes volatility biases by relating
 them to the firm's structural characteristics such as leverage and debt
 covenants. The authors test the model by comparing predicted pricing
 biases with biases observed in a large cross-section of firms with liquid
 exchange traded option contracts. Their empirical study detects leverage
 related pricing biases. The magnitudes of these biases correspond to those
 predicted by their model. The authors also find significant pricing biases
 for firms financed primarily by short-term debt. This supports their model
 because short-term debt introduces net-worth hurdles similar to net-worth
 covenants.

Abstract:

 Using a sample of forty-nine countries, the authors show that countries
 with poorer investor protections, measured by both the character of legal
 rules and the quality of law enforcement, have smaller and narrower
 capital markets. These findings apply to both equity and debt markets. In
 particular, French civil law countries have both the weakest investor
 protections and the least developed capital markets, especially as
 compared to common law countries. Coauthors are Florencio
 Lopez-de-Silanes, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert W. Vishny.

 Market Segmentation and Stock Prices: Evidence from an Emerging Market.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1059-85
Issue: 3
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 The authors examine the relationship between stock prices and market
 segmentation induced by ownership restrictions in Mexico. The focus is on
 multiple classes of equity that differentiate between foreign and domestic
 traders, and between domestic individuals and institutions. Significant
 stock price premia are documented for shares not restricted to a
 particular investor group. The authors analyze the theoretical and
 empirical determinants of premia across firms and over time. In addition
 to economywide factors, segmentation reflects the relative scarcity of
 unrestricted shares. The results provide additional support for Rene Stulz
 and Walter Wasserfallen's (1995) hypothesis that firms discriminate
 between investor groups with different demand elasticities.

Title: 
 Measuring Mutual Fund Performance with Characteristic-Based Benchmarks.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1035-58
Issue: 3
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This article develops and applies new measures of portfolio performance
 which use benchmarks based on the characteristics of stocks held by the
 portfolios that are evaluated. Specifically, the benchmarks are
 constructed from the returns of 125 passive portfolios that are matched
 with stocks held in the evaluated portfolio on the basis of the marked
 capitalization, book-to-market, and prior-year return characteristics of
 those stocks. Based on these benchmarks, 'Characteristic Timing' and
 'Characteristic Selectivity' measures are developed that detect,
 respectively, whether portfolio managers successfully time their portfolio
 weightings on these characteristics and whether managers can select stocks
 that outperform the average stock having the same characteristics. The
 authors apply these measures to a new database of mutual fund holdings
 covering over 2500 equity funds from 1975 to 1994. Their results show that
 mutual funds, particularly aggressive-growth funds, exhibit some
 selectivity ability, but that funds exhibit no characteristic timing
 ability. Coauthors are Mark Grinblatt, Sheridan Titman, and Russ Wermers.

Title: 
 Do Changes in Dividends Signal the Future or the Past?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1007-34
Issue: 3
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 Many dividend theories imply that changes in dividends have information
 content about the future earnings of the firm. The authors investigate
 this implication and find only limited support for it. Firms that increase
 dividends in year 0 have experienced significant earnings increases in
 years -1 and 0, but show no subsequent unexpected earnings growth. Also,
 the size of the dividend increase does not predict future earnings. Firms
 that cut dividends in year 0 have experienced a reduction in earnings in
 year 0 and in year -1, but these firms go on to show significant increases
 in earnings in year 1. However, consistent with Lintner's model on
 dividend policy, firms that increase dividends are less likely than
 nonchanging firms to experience a drop in future earnings. Thus, their
 increase in concurrent earnings can be said to be somewhat 'permanent'. In
 spite of the lack of future earnings growth, firms that increase dividends
 have significant (though modest) positive excess returns for the following
 three years.

Title: 
 Heterogeneous Information Arrivals and Return Volatility Dynamics: Uncovering the Long-Run in High Frequency Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 975-1005
Issue: 3
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 Recent empirical evidence suggests that the interdaily volatility
 clustering for most speculative returns are best characterized by a slowly
 mean-reverting fractionally integrated process. Meanwhile, much shorter
 lived volatility dynamics are typically observed with high frequency
 intradaily returns. The present article demonstrates that, by interpreting
 the volatility as a mixture of numerous heterogeneous short-run
 information arrivals, the observed volatility process may exhibit long-run
 dependence. As such, the long-memory characteristics constitute an
 intrinsic feature of the return generating process, rather than the
 manifestation of occasional structural shifts. These ideas are confirmed
 by the authors' analysis of a one-year time series of five-minute
 Deutschemark-U.S. dollar exchange rates.

 Testing Market Efficiency: Evidence from the NFL Sports Betting Market.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1725-37
Issue: 4
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article examines the efficiency of the National Football League
 betting market. The standard ordinary least squares regression methodology
 is replaced by a probit model. This circumvents potential econometric
 problems, and allows the authors to implement more sophisticated betting
 strategies where bets are placed only when there is a relatively high
 probability of success. In-sample tests indicate that probit-based betting
 strategies generate statistically significant profits. Whereas the
 profitability of a number of these betting strategies is confirmed by
 out-of-sample testing, there is some inconsistency among the remaining
 out-of-sample predictions. The authors' results also suggest that widely
 documented inefficiencies in this market tend to dissipate over time.

 The Market for Equity Options in the 1870s.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1707-23
Issue: 4
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The introduction of exchange-traded options in 1973 led to explosive
 growth in the stock options market, but put and call options on equity
 securities have existed for more than a century. Prior to the listing of
 option contracts, trading was conducted in an order-driven
 over-the-counter market. From 1873 to 1875, quotes for options contracts
 were published weekly in The Commercial and Financial Chronicle during a
 period that saw extensive marketing efforts by a number of brokerage
 firms. In this article, the authors examine these quotes to determine why
 this seemingly sophisticated market existed for only a brief period in
 financial history.

 Gaussian Estimation of Single-Factor Continuous Time Models of the Term Structure of Interest Rates.

Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article presents the first application in finance of recently
 developed methods for the Gaussian estimation of continuous time dynamic
 models. A range of one factor continuous time models of the short-term
 interest rate are estimated using a discrete time model and compared to a
 recent discrete approximation used by K. C. Chan, et al. (1992). Whereas
 the volatility of short-term rates is highly sensitive to the level of
 rates in the United States, it is not in the United Kingdom.

 The Relation between Default-Free Interest Rates and Expected Economic Growth Is Stronger Than You Think.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1681-94
Issue: 4
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The relation between default-free interest rates and expected economic
 growth is substantially stronger than suggested by extant literature.
 Futures-implied Treasury bill yield spreads are more highly correlated
 with future real consumption, investment, and GNP growth than spot
 spreads. This stronger relation arises because using futures removes a
 component of the spot term structure that covaries negatively with real
 economic growth. Treasury forward rates from spot bills contain a premium
 for the risk that short-sellers will default. This risk premium is
 negatively related to expected economic growth.

 Public Offerings of State-Owned and Privately-Owned Enterprises: An International Comparison.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1659-79
Issue: 4
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors compare initial offer prices in privatizations to initial
 prices in public offerings of private companies. The evidence indicates
 that government officials in the United Kingdom underprice initial public
 offerenings (IPOs) significantly more than their private company
 counterparts. In Canada and Malaysia, however, the opposite is true. There
 does not appear to be a general tendency for privatizations to be
 underpriced to a greater degree than private company IPOs. The authors
 provide additional evidence on the determinants of privatization initial
 returns. Their findings indicate that initial returns are significantly
 higher in relatively primitive capital markets and for privatized
 companies in regulated industries.

 Corporate Governance and Equity Prices: Evidence from the Czech and Slovak Republics.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1641-58
Issue: 4
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The Czech and Slovak Republics' mass privatization scheme used voucher
 points distributed to the population and a competitive bidding process to
 change the governance of a large number of firms. Voucher prices and
 following secondary market prices are shown to depend upon the resulting
 ownership structures. The more concentrated ownership is, the higher
 prices are. High absolute ownership by a single domestic investor is
 associated with even higher voucher prices. The author finds some evidence
 that initially prices are relatively lower when a bank-sponsored
 investment fund has a relatively large stake in a firm. This suggests
 conflicts of interest.

 Does the Specialist Matter? Differential Execution Costs and Intersecurity Subsidization on the New York Stock Exchange.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1615-40
Issue: 4
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article tests for differences in execution costs among specialist
 firms for New York Stock Exchange listed securities. Execution cost
 differences provide a measure of the relative performance of specialist
 firms. The authors find a substantial difference in effective spreads and
 order processing costs across specialist firms, controlling for stock
 characteristics. While economically significant, the differences in
 execution costs between specialist firms are much smaller than the
 cross-market differences reported by Roger Huang and Hans Stoll (1996).
 Within a specialist firm, there is a positive relation between order
 processing costs and trading activity that is consistent with the
 hypothesis that active stocks subsidize inactive stocks.

 Informed Traders, Intervention, and Price Leadership: A Deeper View of the Microstructure of the Foreign Exchange Market.

Volume: 52

Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article identifies price leadership patterns in foreign exchange
 trading, with a focus on central bank intervention as an informational
 trigger for leadership positioning. Granger causality tests applied to
 DM/US$ spot rate quotes reveal Deutsche Bank as a price leader up to sixty
 minutes prior to Bundesbank interventionary reports. By the minus
 twenty-five-minute mark, interbank quote adjustments become two-way
 Granger-causal. These results suggest that central bank activity is
 revealed in stages: first to the price leader, then to competitors, and
 lastly to the general public.

 Portfolio Disclosures and Year-End Price Shifts.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1563-88
Issue: 4
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Commercial paper sells at an extra discount if it matures in the next
 calendar year but Treasury bills do not. The discount is apparent in
 downward price shifts before the year-end, and upward price shifts at the
 turn of the year that are significantly correlated with the simultaneous
 returns to small stocks, and that cannot reflect tax-loss selling.
 Cross-sectional and time-series tests on prices, as well as flow of funds
 evidence on trades by institutional investors, indicate that both the debt
 and equity patterns reflect agency problems related to portfolio

Title: 
 Institutions and Individuals at the Turn-of-the-Year.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1543-62
Issue: 4
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article evaluates the tax-loss-selling hypothesis against the
 window-dressing hypothesis as explanations for turn-of-the-year anomalies.
 The authors examine differences between securities dominated by individual
 investors versus those dominated by institutional investors and find that
 the effect is more pervasive in the former. Controlling for
 capitalization, they find that, in early January (late December), stocks
 with greater individual investor interest outperform (underperform) stocks
 with greater institutional investor interest. These results hold for both
 stocks that previously appreciated in value and stocks that previously
 depreciated in value. The results are more consistent with the
 tax-loss-selling hypothesis as an explanation for the turn-of-the-year
 effect.

Title: 
 The Cyclical Behavior of Interest Rates.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1519-42
Issue: 4
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article investigates the behavior of the term structure of interest
 rates over the business cycle. In contrast to prior studies that measure
 the business cycle by the simple growth in aggregate economic activity,
 the authors consider the deviation of aggregate economic activity from its
 potentially stochastic trend. They show that incorporating both an
 independent trend and cyclical component in consumption improves the
 efficiency in estimating consumption-based asset pricing models. The
 authors also find that the term spread is more informative about future
 changes in stochastically detrended real gross domestic product (GDP) than
 future growth rates in real GDP.

Title: 
 CEO Contracting and Antitakeover Amendments.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1495-1517
Issue: 4
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article examines incentives for adopting antitakeover charter
 amendments (ATAs) that are associated with compensational contracts. The
 evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that antitakeover measures such
 as ATAs help managers protect above-market levels of compensation. Chief
 executive officers (CEOs) of firms that adopt ATAs receive higher salaries
 and more valuable option grants than CEOs at similar firms that do not
 adopt them. Furthermore, the magnitude of this difference increases
 following ATA adoption. The evidence is inconsistent with the hypothesis
 that ATAs facilitate the writing of efficient compensation contracts.

Title: 
 Defensive Mechanisms and Managerial Discretion.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1467-93
Issue: 4
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors study a model where firms may possess free cash flow and
 takeovers may be disruptive. They show that the possibility of a takeover,
 combined with defensive mechanisms and the ability to pay greenmail, can
 solve the free cash flow problem in an efficient way. The payment of
 greenmail reveals information that generates a stock price decline that
 exceeds the value of the greenmail payment, even though the payment of
 greenmail is value maximizing. Optimal defensive measures limit takeover
 attempts if the target stock price is too low. The authors also provide
 cross-sectional implications of the analysis.

Title: 
 Do Firms Knowingly Sell Overvalued Equity?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1439-66
Issue: 4
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article examines the relationship between top executives' trading
 and the long-run stock returns of seasoned equity issuing firms. Primary
 issuers, who sell mostly newly issued primary shares, significantly
 underperform their benchmarks, regardless of the top executives' prior
 trading pattern. However, top executives' trading is reliably associated
 with the stock returns of secondary issuers, who sell mostly secondary
 shares previously held by existing shareholders. On average, secondary
 issuers do not underperform their benchmarks. The results suggest that
 increased free cash flow problems after issue play an important role in
 explaining the underperformance of issuing firms.

 Managerial Entrenchment and Capital Structure Decisions.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1411-38
Issue: 4
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors study associations between managerial entrenchment and firms'
 capital structures, with results generally suggesting that entrenched CEOs
 seek to avoid debt. In a cross-sectional analysis, they find that leverage
 levels are lower when CEOs do not face pressure from either ownership and
 compensation incentives or active monitoring. In an analysis of leverage
 changes, the authors find that leverage increases in the aftermath of
 entrenchment-reducing shocks to managerial security, including
 unsuccessful tender offers, involuntary CEO replacements, and the addition
 to the board of major stockholders.

 Approximating the Asset Pricing Kernel.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1383-1410
Issue: 4
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article tests a simple consumption-based asset pricing model by
 approximating the true asset pricing kernel using low-order orthonormal
 polynomials based on the model's state variables. Approximated kernels
 based solely on next period's consumption growth are not rejected by
 overall measures of model fit but they produce statistically and
 economically large pricing errors. Approximated kernels based on two
 quarters of future consumption growth and technology shocks have
 substantially improved overall fit. In particular, the best of these
 kernels are capable of eliminating the small firm effect.

 On the Robustness of Size and Book-to-Market in Cross-Sectional Regressions.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1355-82
Issue: 4
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors use a robust regression estimator to analyze the risk premia
 on size and book-to-market. They find that the risk premium on size that
 was estimated by Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French (1992) completely
 disappears when the 1 percent most extreme observations are trimmed each
 month. The authors also show that the negative average of the monthly size
 coefficients reported by Fama and French can be entirely explained by the
 sixteen months with the most extreme coefficients. They argue that further
 investigation of these results could lead to an understanding of the
 economic forces underlying the size effect, and may also yield important
 insights into how firms grow.

 Why Firms Use Currency Derivatives.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1323-54
Issue: 4
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors examine the use of currency derivatives in order to
 differentiate among existing theories of hedging behavior. Firms with
 greater growth opportunities and tighter financial constraints are more
 likely to use currency derivatives. This result suggests that firms might
 use derivatives to reduce cash flow variation that might otherwise
 preclude firms from investing in valuable growth opportunities. Firms with
 extensive foreign exchange-rate exposure and economies of scale in hedging
 activities are also more likely to use currency derivatives. Finally, the
 source of foreign exchange-rate exposures is an important factor in the
 choice among types of currency derivatives.

Title: 
 An Econometric Model of the Term Structure of Interest-Rate Swap Yields.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1287-1321
Issue: 4
Volume: 52
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article develops a multi-factor econometric model of the term
 structure of interest-rate swap yields. The model accommodates the
 possibility of counterparty default, and any differences in the
 liquidities of the Treasury and Swap markets. By parameterizing a model of
 swap rates directly, the authors are able to compute model-based estimates
 of the defaultable zero-coupon bond rates implicit in the swap market
 without having to specify a priori the dependence of these rates on
 default hazard or recovery rates. The time series analysis of spreads
 between zero-coupon swap and treasury yields reveals that both credit and
 liquidity factors were important sources of variation in swap spreads over
 the past decade.

 Determinants of Contract Choice: The Use of Warrants to Compensate Underwriters of Seasoned Equity Issues.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 363-80
Issue: 1
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The issuer's decision to include warrants as compensation to underwriters
 is studied for a sample of 1,991 negotiated firm commitment issues of
 seasoned equity. Using a two-stage logit model to correct for
 self-selection bias, the authors find direct evidence that warrant
 compensation functions as a bond, substituting for reputational capital
 and enabling the underwriter to certify the issue price. To a lesser
 degree, the decision also is affected by regulations on underwriter
 compensation and on the use of underwriter warrants. Issuers' decisions
 are consistent with an objective of minimizing total underwriting cost,
 including cash compensation, warrants, and underpricing.

 Does Money Explain Asset Returns? Theory and Empirical Analysis.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 345-61
Issue: 1
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 A cash-in-advance model of a monetary economy is used to derive a
 money-based capital asset pricing model (M-CAPM), which allows the authors
 to implement tests of asset pricing restrictions without consumption data.
 A test as in Eugene F. Fama and James D. Macbeth (1973) of the model
 suggests that the money betas have some explanatory power for the
 cross-sectional variation of expected returns; however, the model is
 rejected using conditional information. Consistent with their predictions,
 estimates of the curvature parameter are lower than those of the
 consumption capital asset pricing model (C-CAPM) and pricing errors of the
 M-CAPM tend to be smaller than those of the C-CAPM.

 Volatility in Wheat Spot and Futures Markets, 1950-1993: Government Farm Programs, Seasonality, and Causality.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 325-43
Issue: 1
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors explore how wheat spot and futures market volatility has been
 impacted by government farm programs during the 1950-93 period. They find
 that changing volatility in both markets is highly associated with
 changing farm programs. The mandatory allotment programs of the 1950s and
 early 1960s (1/3/50-4/10/64) were associated with low volatility, while
 the voluntary programs initiated in the mid-1960s seem to have induced
 high volatility (4/11/64-12/22/85). Both market-driven loan rates and
 conservation reserve programs appear to have helped volatility revert to
 lower levels since the mid-1980s (12/23/85-12/30/93). The authors also
 examine seasonality and causality in conjunction with the farm programs.

 Capital Requirements, Monetary Policy, and Aggregate Bank Lending: Theory and Empirical Evidence.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 279-324
Issue: 1
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Capital requirements linked solely to credit risk are shown to increase
 equilibrium credit rationing and lower aggregate lending. The model
 predicts that the bank's decision to lend will cause an abnormal run-up in
 the borrower's stock price and that this reaction will be greater the more
 capital-constrained the bank. The author provides empirical support for
 this prediction. The model explains the recent inability of the Federal
 Reserve to stimulate bank lending by increasing the money supply. He shows
 that increasing the money supply can either raise or lower lending when
 capital requirements are linked only to credit risk.

 Is There a Window of Opportunity for Seasoned Equity Issuance?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 253-78
Issue: 1
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The aggregate volume of equity issues is used to search for periods when
 seasoned equity capital can be raised at favorable terms. The authors find
 that the price reaction to equity issue announcements in high equity issue
 volume periods is approximately 200 basis points lower on average than in
 low equity issue volume periods. The lower price reaction in hot markets
 is economically important and is independent of the macroeconomic
 characteristics of hot and cold markets. The evidence supports the
 existence of windows of opportunity for equity issues that result at least
 partially from reduced levels of asymmetric information.

 Shareholder Activism by Institutional Investors: Evidence for CalPERS.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 227-52
Issue: 1
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This study examines firm characteristics that lead to shareholder
 activism and analyzes the effects of activism on target firm governance
 structure, shareholder wealth, and operating performance for the fifty-one
 firms targeted by the California Public Employees' Retirement System
 (CalPERS) over the 1987-93 period. Firm size and level of institutional
 holdings are found to be positively related to the probability of being
 targeted, and 72 percent of firms targeted after 1988 adopt proposed
 changes or make changes resulting in a settlement with CalPERS.
 Shareholder wealth increases for firms that adopt or settle and decreases
 for firms that resist. No statistically significant change in operating
 performance is found.

 Real Interest Rates and Inflation: An Ex-Ante Empirical Analysis.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 205-25
Issue: 1
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors develop a method of measuring ex ante real interest rates
 using prices of index and nominal bonds. Employing this method and newly
 available data, they directly test the Fisher hypothesis that the real
 rate of interest is independent of inflation expectations. The authors
 find a negative correlation between ex ante real interest rates and
 expected inflation. This contradicts the Fisher hypothesis but is
 consistent with the theories of Robert A. Mundell and James Tobin, Michael
 R. Darby and Martin Feldstein, and Rene Stulz. The authors also find that
 nominal interest rates include an inflation risk premium that is
 positively related to a proxy for inflation uncertainty.

Title: 
 Return Volatility and Trading Volume: An Information Flow Interpretation of Stochastic Volatility.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 169-204
Issue: 1
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This paper develops an empirical return volatility-trading volume model
 from a microstructure framework in which informational asymmetries and
 liquidity needs motivate trade in response to information arrivals. The
 resulting system modifies the so-called 'mixture of distribution
 hypothesis' (MDH). The dynamic features are governed by the information
 flow, modeled as a stochastic volatility process, and generalize standard
 autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity specifications.
 Specification tests support the modified MDH representation and show that
 it vastly outperforms the standard MDH. The findings suggest that the
 model may be useful for analysis of the economic factors behind the
 observed volatility clustering in returns.

Title: 
 Do Brokerage Analysts' Recommendations Have Investment Value?

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 137-67
Issue: 1
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 An analysis of new buy and sell recommendations of stocks by security
 analysts at major U.S. brokerage firms shows significant, systematic
 discrepancies between prerecommendation prices and eventual values. The
 initial return at the time of the recommendations is large, even though
 few recommendations coincide with new public news or provide previously
 unavailable facts. However, these initial price reactions are incomplete.
 For buy recommendations, the mean postevent drift is modest (+2.4 percent)
 and short-lived, but for sell recommendations, the drift is larger (-9.1
 percent) and extends for six months. Analysts appear to have market timing
 and stock picking abilities.

 Preferences for Stock Characteristics as Revealed by Mutual Fund Portfolio Holdings.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 111-35
Issue: 1
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This investigation of the cross-section of mutual fund equity holdings
 for the years 1991 and 1992 shows that mutual funds have a significant
 preference towards stocks with high visibility and low transaction costs,
 and are averse to stocks with low idiosyncratic volatility. These findings
 are relevant to theories concerning investor recognition, a potential
 agency problem in mutual funds, tests of trend-following and herd behavior
 by mutual funds, and corporate finance.

 Of Tournaments and Temptations: An Analysis of Managerial Incentives in the Mutual Fund Industry.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 85-110
Issue: 1
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors test the hypothesis that, when their compensation is linked
 to relative performance, managers of investment portfolios likely to end
 up as 'losers' will manipulate fund risk differently than those managing
 portfolios likely to be 'winners.' An empirical investigation of the
 performance of 334 growth-oriented mutual funds during 1976 to 1991
 demonstrates that mid-year losers tend to increase fund volatility in the
 latter part of an annual assessment period to a greater extent than
 mid-year winners. Furthermore, the authors show that this effect became
 stronger as industry growth and investor awareness of fund performance
 increased over time.

Title: 
 Multifactor Explanations of Asset Pricing Anomalies.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 55-84
Issue: 1
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Previous work shows that average returns on common stocks are related to
 firm characteristics like size, earnings/price, cash flow/price,
 book-to-market equity, past sales growth, long-term past return, and
 short-term past return. Because these patterns in average returns
 apparently are not explained by the capital asset pricing model, (CAPM),
 they are called anomalies. The authors find that, except for the
 continuation of short-term returns, the anomalies largely disappear in a
 three-factor model. Their results are consistent with rational
 intertemporal CAPM or arbitrage pricing theory asset pricing but the
 authors also consider irrational pricing and data problems as possible
 explanations.

 The Conditional CAPM and the Cross-Section of Expected Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 3-53
Issue: 1
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Most empirical studies of the static capital asset pricing model (CAPM)
 assume that betas remain constant over time and that the return on the
 value-weighted portfolio of all stocks is a proxy for the return on
 aggregate wealth. The general consensus is that the static CAPM is unable
 to explain satisfactorily the cross-section of average returns on stocks.
 The authors assume that the CAPM holds in a conditional sense, i.e., betas
 and the market risk premium vary over time. They include the return on
 human capital when measuring the return on aggregate wealth. The authors'
 specification performs well in explaining the cross-section of average
 returns.

 Robust Structure without Predictability: The "Compass Rose" Pattern of the Stock Market.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 751-62
Issue: 2
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Plotting daily stock returns against themselves with one day's lag
 reveals a striking pattern. Evenly spaced lines radiate from the origin;
 the thickest lines point in the major directions of the compass. This
 'compass rose' pattern appears in every stock. It is caused by
 discreteness. However, counterexamples demonstrate that the existence of
 exchange-imposed tick sizes (e.g., eighths) is neither necessary nor
 sufficient for the compass rose. The compass rose cannot be used to make
 abnormal profits: it is structure without predictability. Among other
 consequences, the compass rose may bias estimation of ARCH models and
 tests for chaos.

 An Empirical Investigation of Short-Selling Activity Prior to Seasoned Equity Offerings.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 729-49
Issue: 2
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors investigate the nature and magnitude of short-selling
 activity around seasoned equity offerings, the relation between
 short-selling activity and issue discounts, and the consequences of the
 Securities and Exchange Commission adoption of Rule 10b-21 in response to
 concerns about manipulative short-selling practices. Seasoned offerings
 are characterized by abnormally high levels of short selling and option
 open interest. Higher levels of such activity are related to lower
 expected proceeds from the issuance of new shares. Where it could not be
 circumvented, Rule 10b-21 appears to have curbed short-selling activity
 and reduced issue discounts.

Title: 
 Bank Debt Restructurings and the Composition of Exchange Offers in Financial Distress.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 711-27
Issue: 2
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article examines the relation between bank debt forgiveness and the
 structure of public debt exchange offers in financial distress. The author
 finds that the structure of exchange offers and the likelihood of an
 offer's success are significantly related to whether the bank participates
 in the restructuring transaction. Exchange offers made in conjunction with
 bank concessions are characterized by significantly greater reductions in
 public debt outstanding and significantly less senior debt offered to
 bondholders. Overall, the results suggest that the structure of a firm's
 public and private claims significantly affects the firm's ability to
 modify its capital structure in financial distress.

 A Theory of Corporate Scope and Financial Structure.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 691-709
Issue: 2
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors simultaneously address three basic issues regarding the
 corporation: the optimal scope of operation, the optimal financial
 structure, and the relationship between these two. The starting point is
 that financial structure serves as a bonding device on the managers'
 self-interest behavior. The effectiveness of this bonding depends on the
 distribution of the firm's future cash flow, which in turn depends on the
 firm's scope. The authors' theory also links the firm's investment
 decisions to its operation scope. As empirical implications, the theory
 reconciles the failure of the 1960s U.S. conglomerates with the success of
 the Japanese keiretsu.

 Dividends and Profits: Some Unsubtle Foreign Influences.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 661-89
Issue: 2
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 American corporations earn a significant share of their profits from
 foreign sources, out of which they appear to pay dividends at rates that
 are three times higher than their payout rates from domestic profits. Why
 firms do so is unclear, although this behavior is consistent with the use
 of dividends to signal profitability. This payout behavior implies that a
 significant part of the U.S. tax revenue generated by the foreign profits
 of U.S. corporations arises through the taxation of dividends received by
 individuals and that the cost of capital may be higher for foreign than
 for domestic operations.

 Asymmetric Information, Managerial Opportunism, Financing, and Payout Policies.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 637-60
Issue: 2
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors examine corporate issuance and payout policies in the
 presence of both adverse selection (in capital markets) and managerial
 opportunism. Their results establish the importance of the locus of
 decision control in the firm. When shareholders determine policies, debt
 financing is always optimal in the presence of either adverse selection or
 managerial opportunism. However, when both of these problems are
 simultaneously present, equity issuance can become an optimal signaling
 mechanism. Shareholder's most preferred signaling mechanism is restricting
 dividends, followed by equity financing and, finally, underpricing
 securities. When managers determine policies, a reversed hierarchy may be
 obtained.

 Call and Continuous Trading Mechanisms under Asymmetric Information: An Experimental Investigation.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 613-36
Issue: 2
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The author examines the relative performance of call and continuous
 auctions under asymmetric information by manipulating trading rules and
 information sets in laboratory asset markets. He finds significant
 differences in an environment that extends the A. S. Kyle (1985) framework
 to permit the exogenous liquidity trading motive to have a natural
 economic interpretation. The adverse selection costs incurred by noise
 traders are significantly lower under the call auction, despite no
 significant reduction in average price efficiency. This result suggests
 that discussions of the costs and benefits of insider trading should take
 place within the context of a specific trading mechanism.

 Transparency and Liquidity: A Comparison of Auction and Dealer Markets with Informed Trading.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 579-611
Issue: 2
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Trading systems differ in their degree of transparency, here defined as
 the extent to which marketmakers can observe the size and direction of the
 current order flow. The authors investigate whether greater transparency
 enhances market liquidity by reducing the opportunities for taking
 advantage of uninformed participants. They compare the price formation
 process in several stylized trading systems with different degrees of
 transparency: various types of auction markets and a stylized dealer
 market. The authors find that greater transparency generates lower trading
 costs for uninformed traders on average, although not necessarily for
 every size of trade.

 Non-fundamental Speculation.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 553-78
Issue: 2
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The author studies an intertemporal asset market where insiders coexist
 with 'nonfundamental' speculators. Nonfundamental speculators possess no
 private information on fundamental values of assets but have superior
 knowledge about some aspect of the market environment. The author shows
 that the entry of these (rational) speculators can lead to reductions in
 market liquidity and in the information content of prices, even in an
 efficient market. Also, equilibrium trades display patterns of empirical
 interest. For example, speculators appear to chase trends and lose money
 after market 'overreactions,' while insiders trade as contrarians and
 profit after such overreactions.

 Idiosyncratic Variation of Treasury Bill Yields.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 527-51
Issue: 2
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The author documents a dramatic increase in the importance of two types
 of variation in Treasury bill yields beginning in the early 1980s. The
 first is idiosyncratic variation in individual short-maturity (less than
 three months) bill yields. The second is a common component in Treasury
 bill yields that is not shared by yields on other instruments, such as
 short-maturity privately issued instruments or longer-maturity Treasury
 notes and bonds. Some evidence suggests the first type reflects increased
 market segmentation. These results have important implications for the
 calibration and testing of no-arbitrage term structure models and
 interpreting tests of the expectations hypothesis.

 Special Repo Rates.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 493-526
Issue: 2
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article provides the causes and symptoms of special repo rates in a
 competitive market for repurchase agreements. A repo rate is, in effect,
 an interest rate on loans collateralized by a specific instrument. A
 'special' is a repo rate significantly below prevailing market riskless
 interest rates. This article shows that specials can occur when those
 owning the collateral are inhibited, whether from legal or institutional
 requirements or from frictional costs, from supplying collateral into
 repurchase agreements. Specialness increases the equilibrium price for the
 underlying instrument by the present value of savings in borrowing costs
 associated with the repo specials.

 Oil and the Stock Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance

Issue: 2
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors test whether the reaction of international stock markets to
 oil shocks can be justified by current and future changes in real cash
 flows and/or changes in expected returns. They find that, in the postwar
 period, the reaction of U.S. and Canadian stock prices to oil shocks can
 be completely accounted for by the impact of these shocks on real cash
 flows alone. In contrast, in both the United Kingdom and Japan,
 innovations in oil prices appear to cause larger changes in stock prices
 than can be justified by subsequent changes in real cash flows or by
 changing expected returns.

Title: 
 Measuring Fund Strategy and Performance in Changing Economic Conditions.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 425-61
Issue: 2
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The use of predetermined variables to represent public information and
 time-variation has produced new insights about asset pricing models but
 the literature on mutual fund performance has not exploited these
 insights. This paper advocates conditional performance evaluation in which
 the relevant expectations are conditioned on public information variables.
 The authors modify several classical performance measures to this end and
 find that the predetermined variables are both statistically and
 economically significant. Conditioning on public information controls for
 biases in traditional market timing models and makes the average
 performance of the mutual funds in the authors' sample look better.

Title: 
 On the Predictability of Stock Returns: An Asset-Allocation Perspective.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 385-424
Issue: 2
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Sample evidence about the predictability of monthly stock returns is
 considered from the perspective of a risk-averse Bayesian investor who
 must allocate funds between stocks and cash. The investor uses the sample
 evidence to update prior beliefs about the parameters in a regression of
 stock returns on a set of predictive variables. The regression relation
 can seem weak when described by usual statistical measures but the current
 values of the predictive variables can exert a substantial influence on
 the investor's portfolio decision, even when the investor's prior beliefs
 are weighted against predictability.

 Why Do Markets Move Together? An Investigation of U.S.-Japan Stock Return Comovements.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 951-86
Issue: 3
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This article explores the fundamental factors that affect cross-country
 stock return correlations. Using transactions data from 1988 to 1992, the
 authors construct overnight and intraday returns for a portfolio of
 Japanese stocks using their NYSE-traded American depository receipts and a
 matched-sample portfolio of U.S. stocks. They find that U.S. macroeconomic
 announcements, shocks to the yen/dollar foreign exchange rate and Treasury
 bill returns, and industry effects have no measurable influence on U.S.
 and Japanese return correlations. However, large shocks to broad-based
 market indices (Nikkei Stock Average and Standard and Poor's 500 Stock
 Index) positively impact both the magnitude and persistence of the return
 correlations.

 Swap Rates and Credit Quality.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 921-49
Issue: 3
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 This article presents a model for valuing claims subject to default by
 both contracting parties, such as swaps and forwards. With counterparties
 of different default risk, the promised cash flows of a swap are
 discounted by a switching discount rate that, at any given state and time,
 is equal to the discount rate of the counterparty for whom the swap is
 currently out of the money (that is, a liability). The impact of
 credit-risk asymmetry and of netting is presented through both theory and
 numerical examples, which include interest rate and currency swaps.

Title: 
 Delayed Reaction to Good News and the Cross-Autocorrelation of Portfolio Returns.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 889-919
Issue: 3
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 We document a directional asymmetry in the small stock concurrent and
 lagged response to large stock movements. When returns on large stocks are
 negative, the concurrent beta for small stocks is high, but the lagged
 beta is insignificant. When returns on large stocks are positive, small
 stocks have small concurrent betas and very significant lagged betas. That
 is, the cross-autocorrelation puzzle documented by Lo and MacKinlay
 (199Oa) is associated with a slow response by some small stocks to good,
 but not to bad, common news. Time series portfolio tests and
 cross-sectional tests of the delay for individual securities suggest that
 existing explanations of the cross-autocorrelation puzzle based on data
 mismeasurement, minor market imperfections, or time-varying risk premiums
 fail to capture the directional asymmetry in the data.

 Diversification, Integration and Emerging Market Closed-End Funds.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 835-69
Issue: 3
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 We study a new class of unconditional and conditional mean-variance
 spanning tests that exploits the duality between Hansen-Jagannathan bounds
 (1991) and mean-standard deviation frontiers. The tests are shown to be
 equivalent to standard spanning tests in population, but we document
 substantial differences in the small sample performance of alternative
 tests. Our empirical application examines the diversification benefits
 from emerging equity markets using an extensive new data set on U.S. and
 U.K.-traded closed-end funds. We find significant diversification benefits
 for the U.K. country funds, but not for the U.S. funds. The difference
 appears to relate to differences in portfolio holdings rather than to the
 behavior of premiums in the United States versus the United Kingdom.

Title: 
 Cream-Skimming or Profit-Sharing? The Curious Role of Purchased Order Flow.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 811-33
Issue: 3
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  July 
Abstract:

 Purchased order flow refers to the practice of dealers or trading locales
 paying brokers for retail order flow. It is alleged that such agreements
 are used to 'cream skim' uninformed liquidity trades, leaving the
 information-based trades to established markets. We develop a test of this
 hypothesis, using a model of the stochastic process of trades. We then
 estimate the model for a sample of stocks known to be used in order
 purchase agreements that trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and
 the Cincinnati Stock Exchange. Our main empirical result is that there is
 a significant difference in the information content of orders executed in
 New York and Cincinnati, and that this difference is consistent with
 cream-skimming.

 Evidence of Discrimination in Lending: An Extension.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1551-54
Issue: 4
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The author generalizes the model of Michael F. Ferguson and Stephen R.
 Peters (1995) to allow for unequal recovery rates in the event of default
 by majority borrowers versus minority borrowers. This simple extension has
 two direct implications: (1) a uniform credit policy, as defined by
 Ferguson and Peters, entails cross-subsidization across groups; and (2) it
 is possible for a profit-maximizing (and therefore economically
 nondiscriminatory) lending policy to generate lower average default rates
 among minority borrowers than among majority borrowers.

 Noise Trading in Small Markets.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1537-50
Issue: 4
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Considering noise traders as agents with unpredictable beliefs, the
 author shows that, in an imperfectly competitive market with risk averse
 investors, noise traders may earn higher expected utility than rational
 investors. This happens when, by deviating from the Nash equilibrium
 strategy, noise traders hurt rational investors more than themselves. It
 follows that the willingness of arbitrageurs to exploit noise traders'
 misperceptions is lower relative to a perfectly competitive economy. This
 result reinforces the theory that noise trading may explain closed-end
 fund discounts and small firms' returns, since these markets are less
 competitive than the market for large firms' stock.

 Earnings Announcements and the Components of the Bid-Ask Spread.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1523-35
Issue: 4
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This study investigates the behavior of the components of the bid-ask
 spread around earnings announcements. The authors find that the adverse
 selection cost component significantly increases surrounding the
 announcements, while the inventory holding and order processing components
 significantly decline during the same periods. Their results suggest that
 the directional change in the total bid-ask spread depends on the relative
 magnitudes of the changes in these three components. Specifically, the
 decreases in inventory holding costs and order processing costs imply that
 earnings announcements may have an insignificant impact on the total
 bid-ask spread, even when they result in increased information asymmetry.

 Relative Pricing of Eurodollar Features and Forward Contracts.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1499-1522
Issue: 4
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Past research explains observed spreads between futures and forward
 Eurodollar yields as being due to the futures contract's mark-to-market
 feature. The authors derive closed-form solutions for this yield spread
 and show that, theoretically, it should be small. Also, differences in
 liquidity, taxation, and default risk cannot account for the large spreads
 observed. The authors also present evidence that the spreads, which are
 nonneglible primarily in the first half of the sample period, are likely
 to be attributable to the mispricing of futures contracts relative to the
 forward rates and that the mispricing was gradually eliminated over time.

 Decision Frequency and Synchronization across Agents: Implications for Aggregate Consumption and Equity Return.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1479-97
Issue: 4
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article examines a model in which decisions are made at fixed
 intervals and are unsynchronized across agents. Agents choose nondurable
 consumption and portfolio composition, and either or both can be chosen
 infrequently. A small utility cost is associated with both decisions being
 made infrequently. Calibrating returns to the U.S. economy, less frequent
 and unsynchronized decision-making delivers the low volatility of
 aggregate consumption growth and its low correlation with equity return
 found in U.S. data. Allowing portfolio rebalancing to occur every period
 has a negligible impact on the joint behavior of aggregate consumption and
 returns.

 Strategic Trading When Agents Forecast the Forecasts of Others.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1437-78
Issue: 4
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors analyze a multiperiod model of trading with differentially
 informed traders, liquidity traders, and a marketmaker. Each informed
 trader's initial information is a noisy estimate of the long-term value of
 the asset and the different signals received by informed traders can have
 a variety of correlation structures. With this setup, informed traders not
 only compete with each other for trading profits, they also learn about
 other traders' signals from the observed order flow. The authors' work
 suggests that the initial correlation among the informed traders' signals
 has a significant effect on the informed traders' profits and the
 informativeness of prices.

 Liquidity, Information, and Infrequently Traded Stocks.

Issue: 4
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article investigates whether differences in information-based
 trading can explain observed differences in spreads for active and
 infrequently traded stocks. Using a new empirical technique, we estimate
 the risk of information-based trading for a sample of New York Stock
 Exchange (NYSE) listed stocks. The authors use the information in trade
 data to determine how frequently new information occurs, the composition
 of trading when it does, and the depth of the market for different
 volume-decile stocks. Their most important empirical result is that the
 probability of information-based trading is lower for high volume stocks.
 Using regressions, we provide evidence of the economic importance of
 information-based trading on spreads. Coauthors are Nicholas M. Kiefer,
 Maureen O'Hara, and Joseph B. Paperman.

 Equilibrium Analysis of Portfolio Insurance.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1379-1403
Issue: 4
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 A martingale approach is used to characterize general equilibrium in the
 presence of portfolio insurance. Insurers sell to noninsurers in bad
 states and general equilibrium requires that the risk premium rises to
 induce noninsurers to increase their holdings. The authors show that
 portfolio insurance increases price volatility, causes mean reversion in
 asset returns, raises the Sharpe ratio and volatility in bad states, and
 causes volatility to be correlated with volume. They also explain why
 out-of-the-money S&P 500 put options trade at a higher volatility than do
 in-the-money puts.

 Evidence of Bank Market Discipline in Subordinated Debenture Yields: 1983-1991.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1347-77
Issue: 4
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors examine debenture yields over the period 1983-91 to evaluate
 the market's sensitivity to bank-specific risks and conclude that
 investors have rationally reflected changes in the government's policy
 toward absorbing private losses in the event of a bank failure. Although
 this evidence does not establish that market discipline can effectively

 cannot rationally differentiate among the risks undertaken by the major
 U.S. banking firms.

Title: 
 Impact of the 1988 Basle Accord on International Banks.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1321-46
Issue: 4
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The ostensible purpose of the Basle Accord was to standardize
 bank-capital regulations among the twelve leading industrial countries.
 Its ulterior goal was to 'level the playing field' by eliminating a
 funding-cost advantage of Japanese banks that had allowed them to capture
 more than one-third of international lending. The wealth gain for Japanese
 bank shareholders was 31.63 percent. Wealth effects for shareholders of
 non-Japanese banks were not significant. These results suggest that the
 Baste Accord did not eliminate the pricing advantage of Japanese banks,
 challenging the non-Japanese regulators' contention that the regulation
 would help level the playing field.

Title: 
 Regulatory Incentives and the Thrift Crisis: Dividends, Mutual-to-Stock Conversions, and Financial Distress.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1285-1319
Issue: 4
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 During the 1980s, insolvency of individual thrifts and the thrift deposit
 insurer created severe incentive problems. Lacking cash to close insolvent
 thrifts, regulators induced nearly $10 billion of private capital to flow
 into the industry through mutual-to-stock conversions. The authors test a
 theory of how regulators encouraged capital-impaired mutual thrifts to
 convert by permitting them to pay dividends rather than rebuild capital.
 They estimate the costs of this policy and interpret the 1991 Federal
 Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act as requiring regulators to
 impose restraints on depository institutions parallel to debt covenants
 that prevent capital distributions by nonfinancial firms experiencing
 distress.

Title: 
 Tax-Exempt Debt and the Capital Structure of Nonprofit Organizations: An Application to Hospitals.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1247-83
Issue: 4
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The availability of tax-exempt financing provides nonprofit (NP)
 organizations with their own tax-based incentives to issue debt. In this
 article, we develop a theoretical model in which NPs gain an indirect
 arbitrage from tax-exempt debt issuance, constrained by: (1) the
 requirement that fixed investment exceed tax-exempt debt flows (the
 project financing constraint), and (2) the constraint against share
 issuance. These constraints cause them to impute tax benefits to projects
 that afford access to the tax-exempt bond market. Empirical tests indicate
 that NP hospitals behave as if they have target levels of tax-exempt debt.
 Debt targeting is constrained by the availability of capital projects,
 while excess debt capacity stimulates investment.

Title: 
 The Method of Payment in Corporate Acquisitions, Investment Opportunities, and Management Ownership.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1227-46
Issue: 4
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article examines the motives underlying the payment method in
 corporate acquisitions. The findings support the notion that the higher
 the acquirer's growth opportunities, the more likely the acquirer is to
 use stock to finance an acquisition. Acquirer managerial ownership is not
 related to the probability of stock financing over small and large ranges
 of ownership but is negatively related over a middle range. In addition,
 the likelihood of stock financing increases with higher preacquisition
 market and acquiring firm stock returns. It decreases with an acquirer's
 higher cash availability, higher institutional shareholdings and
 blockholdings, and in tender offers.

Title: 
 The Value of Diversification during the Conglomerate Merger Wave.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1201-25
Issue: 4
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The current trend toward corporate focus reverses the diversification
 trend of the late 1960s and early 1970s. This article examines the value
 of diversification when many corporations started to diversify. The author
 finds no evidence that diversified companies were valued at a premium over
 single segment firms during the 1960s and 1970s. On the contrary, there
 was a large diversification discount during the 1960s but this discount
 declined to zero during the 1970s. Insider ownership was negatively
 related to diversification during the 1960s but, when the diversification
 discount declined, firms with high insider ownership were the first to
 diversify.

Title: 
 Bustup Takeovers of Value-Destroying Diversified Firms.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1175-1200
Issue: 4
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors examine whether the value loss from diversification affects
 takeover and breakup probabilities. They estimate diversification's value
 effect by imputing stand-alone values for individual business segments and
 find that firms with greater value losses are more likely to be taken
 over. Moreover, those acquired firms whose losses are greatest are most
 likely to be bought by leveraged buyouts associations, which frequently
 break up their targets. For a subsample of large diversified targets,
 higher value losses increase the extent of posttakeover bustup and
 post-takeover bustup generally results in divested divisions being
 operated as part of a focused, stand-alone firm.

 The Capital Budgeting Process: Incentives and Information.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1139-74
Issue: 4
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors study the capital allocation process within firms. Observed
 budgeting processes are explained as a response to decentralized
 information and incentive problems. It is shown that these imperfections
 can result in underinvestment when capital productivity is high and
 overinvestment when it is low. The authors also investigate how the
 budgeting process may be expected to vary with firm or division
 characteristics, such as investment opportunities and the technology for
 information transfer.

Title: 
 Who Manages Risk? An Empirical Examination of Risk Management Practices in the Gold Mining Industry.

Journal: Journal of Finance
Pages: 1097-1137
Issue: 4
Volume: 51
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article examines a new database that details corporate risk
 management activity in the North American gold mining industry. The author
 finds little empirical support for the predictive power of theories that
 view risk management as a means to maximize shareholder value. However,
 firms whose managers hold more options manage less gold price risk, and
 firms whose managers hold more stock manage more gold price risk,
 suggesting that managerial risk aversion may affect corporate risk
 management policy. Further, risk management is negatively associated with
 the tenure of firms' CFOs, perhaps reflecting managerial interests,
 skills, or preferences.
