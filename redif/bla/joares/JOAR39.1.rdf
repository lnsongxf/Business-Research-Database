Title: Analyst Coverage and Intangible Assets 
Author-Name: Mary E. Barth

Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>This study examines the relation between
 analysts' incentives to cover firms and the extent of their intangible
 assets. Because intangible assets typically are unrecognized and estimates
 of their fair values are not disclosed, absent analyst coverage firms with
 more intangible assets likely have less informative prices. Accordingly,
 we expect analysts have greater incentives to cover firms with more
 intangible assets and, thus, predict they have higher analyst coverage. As
 predicted, we find that analyst coverage is significantly greater for
 firms with larger research and development and advertising expenses
 relative to their industry, and for firms in industries with larger
 research and development expense. We also predict and find that analyst
 coverage is increasing in firm size, growth, trading volume, equity
 issuance, and perceived mispricing, and is decreasing in the size of the
 firm's analysts' brokerage houses and the effort analysts expend to follow
 the firm. These findings indicate that analyst coverage depends on private
 benefits and costs of covering a firm. We also test hypotheses related to
 analyst effort. We predict and find that analysts expend greater effort to
 follow firms with more intangible assets, after controlling for other
 factors associated with analyst effort. Our evidence indicates that
 intangible assets, most of which are not recognized in firms' financial
 statements, are associated with greater incentives for analysts to cover
 such firms, and greater costs of coverage. An open question is whether
 financial statement recognition of intangible assets could more
 efficiently provide information about such assets to investors.

Title: Auditors' Perceived Business Risk and Audit Fees: Analysis and Evidence 
Author-Name: Timothy B. Bell

Author-Name: Douglas A. Shackelford  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>This study analyzes the relation between
 auditors' perceived business risk and audit fees to determine whether
 audit firms or their clients bear the expected legal costs of business
 risk. We predict that hourly audit fees and the number of audit hours are
 increasing in business risk. Using confidential survey data collected by a
 large international accounting firm for 422 audits, we find that high
 business risk increases the number of audit hours, but not the fee per
 hour. This implies that firms perceive firm-level differences in business
 risk and obtain compensation through billing additional hours, not by
 raising the hourly charge.

Title: Do Analysts and Auditors Use Information in Accruals? 
Author-Name: Mark T. Bradshaw  
Author-Name: Scott A. Richardson  
Author-Name: Richard G. Sloan  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>Existing research indicates that firms with
 high accruals are more likely to experience future earnings problems, but
 that investors' expectations, as reflected in stock prices, do not appear
 to anticipate these problems. In this paper, we directly examine the
 published opinions of two types of professional investor intermediaries to
 see if they provide investors with information concerning the future
 earnings problems experienced by firms with high accruals. First, we
 examine the earnings forecasts of sell-side analysts. We show that
 analysts' earnings forecasts do not incorporate the predictable future
 earnings declines associated with high accruals. Second, we examine the
 behavior of independent auditors. We find no evidence that auditors signal
 the future earnings problems associated with high accruals through either
 their audit opinions or through auditor changes. Overall, our evidence
 indicates that analysts and auditors do not alert investors to the future
 earnings problems associated with high accruals, thus corroborating
 previous findings that investors do not appear to anticipate these
 problems.

Title: Balancing Performance Measures 
Author-Name: Srikant Datar  
Author-Name: Susan Cohen Kulp  
Author-Name: Richard A. Lambert  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>This paper uses an agency theory model in
 which the agent's actions are multi-dimensional to analyze the optimal
 weights to apply to performance measures in a compensation contract. We
 show how the optimal contract trades off the congruity of the overall
 performance measure with the desire to minimize the risk imposed upon the
 agent. In contrast to the single action case, we find that an increase in
 the sensitivity of a performance measure to an agent's action does not
 necessarily increase the weight placed on that performance measure, even
 if that measure is perfectly congruent with the firm's outcome.

Title: An Experimental Investigation of Retention and Rotation Requirements 
Author-Name: Nicholas Dopuch  
Author-Name: Ronald R. King  
Author-Name: Rachel Schwartz  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>We provide results from an experiment
 designed to assess whether mandatory rotation and/or retention of auditors
 increases auditors' independence by reducing their willingness to issue
 reports biased in favor of management. Auditors' reporting is compared
 across the following four regimes: one that does not require either
 rotation or retention, a second that requires retention only, a third that
 requires rotation only, and a fourth that requires both rotation and
 retention. We find that the rotation requirements in the third and fourth
 regimes decreased auditor-subjects' willingness to issue biased reports,
 relative to the two regimes in which rotation was not imposed. In these
 other two regimes, however, many manager-subjects voluntarily retained the
 same auditor-subjects over multi-periods. While the long running
 interactions between manager- and auditor-subjects resulted in more
 favorable reports by auditor-subjects (a lower level of independence), the
 established relationships also induced manager-subjects to make higher
 investments.

Title: Imperfect Information and Credible Communication 
Author-Name: Paul E. Fischer  
Author-Name: Phillip C. Stocken  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>This paper analyzes a communication game
 between a sender and receiver with misaligned incentives. Because of the
 misalignment, in equilibrium, the sender's privately observed information
 is not perfectly communicated. We study the relation between the quality
 of the sender's information and the quality of the information
 communicated. We establish that the quality of information communicated is
 a non-monotonic function of the quality of the sender's information, and
 it is maximized when the sender has imperfect information. We suggest that
 our model applies to a setting where an equity research analyst
 communicates information about a firm's value to investors.

Title: Toward an Implied Cost of Capital 
Author-Name: William R. Gebhardt  
Author-Name: Charles M. C. Lee  
Author-Name: Bhaskaran Swaminathan  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>In this study, we propose an alternative
 technique for estimating the cost of equity capital. Specifically, we use
 a discounted residual income model to generate a market implied
 cost-of-capital. We then examine firm characteristics that are
 systematically related to this estimate of cost-of-capital. We show that a
 firm's implied cost-of-capital is a function of its industry membership,
 B/M ratio, forecasted long-term growth rate, and the dispersion in analyst
 earnings forecasts. Together, these variables explain around 60% of the
 cross-sectional variation in future (two-year-ahead) implied
 costs-of-capital. The stability of these long-term relations suggests they
 can be exploited to estimate future costs-of-capital. We discuss the
 implications of these findings for capital budgeting, investment
 decisions, and valuation research.

Title: Accounting for Changing Prices: The Value Relevance of Historical Cost, Price Level, and Replacement Cost Accounting in Mexico 
Author-Name: Elizabeth A. Gordon  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>This paper investigates the value relevance
 of historical cost, price level and replacement cost accounting using a
 sample of Mexican firms from 1989 to 1995. It contributes to prior
 research by distinguishing between two distinct aspects of changing
 prices:(1) the change in the general price level, and (2) the change in
 the value of specific non-monetary assets. I select Mexico to examine
 because it is unique in requiring and disclosing separately price level
 and replacement cost adjustments. A sample of Mexican firms also addresses
 a key reason cited for mixed results in previous assessments of the
 usefulness of price level and replacement cost accounting using United
 States data: the effects of inflation are too weak to detect. High rates
 of inflation in Mexico, ranging between 7% and 52% during the sample
 period, mitigate that potential problem. Results indicate that replacement
 cost adjustments are relatively and incrementally relevant beyond
 historical cost and price level measures while price level adjustments are
 incrementally value relevant beyond historical measures.
