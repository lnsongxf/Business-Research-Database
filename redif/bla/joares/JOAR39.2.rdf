Title: Book-to-Market Components, Future Security Returns, and Errors in Expected Future Earnings 
Author-Name: Bruce K. Billings  
Author-Name: Richard M. Morton  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>This study investigates whether the ability
 of book-to-market to predict returns derives from systematic errors in the
 market’s expectation of future earnings. We extend Beaver and Ryan (1996,
 2000) by decomposing book-to-market into a more persistent (bias)
 component and a delayed recognition (lag) component. We find that both
 components are related to analyst expectations of future earnings, but the
 lag component is the dominant factor across all forecast horizons.
 Similarly, we find that the lag component explains most of the inverse
 relation between book-to-market and future returns. Given that lag is
 constructed by regressing book-to-market ratios on lagged price changes,
 our results are consistent with the lag component capturing systematic
 stock price reversals. We find that the components have unique relations
 with subsequent earnings forecast revisions, and controlling for these
 relations substantially mitigates the components’ ability to predict
 returns. Our component-level analysis provides insight into how expected
 future earnings, summarized in book-to-market ratios help to explain this
 market anomaly.

Title: A Temporal Analysis of Earnings Surprises: Profits versus Losses 
Author-Name: Lawrence D. Brown  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>I show that median earnings surprise has
 shifted rightward from small negative (miss analyst estimates by a small
 amount) to zero (meet analyst estimates exactly) to small positive (beat
 analyst estimates by a small amount) during the 16 years, 1984 to 1999. I
 show that a rightward temporal shift in median surprise from negative to
 positive describes earnings, but neither profits nor losses. Median profit
 surprise shifts within the positive quadrant, from zero to one cent per
 share. Median loss surprise shifts within the negative quadrant from
 extreme negative (about -33 cents per share) to zero. I show that the
 median surprise for profits exceeds that for losses in every year. I
 document significant positive temporal trends in both meet and beat
 analyst estimates for both profits and losses, but I find a greater
 frequency of profits that either meet or beat analyst estimates in every
 year. I find a significant positive temporal trend in positive profits
 that are “a little bit of good news,” and a significant negative temporal
 trend in managers who report losses that are an “extreme amount of bad
 news.” My results are robust to the four internal validity threats I
 consider—namely temporal changes in: (1) analyst forecast accuracy, (2)
 the mix of earnings of one sign preceded by earnings of another sign four
 quarters ago, (3) the timeliness of the most recent analyst forecast, and
 (4) the I/B/E/S definition of actual earnings. I find that managers of
 growth firms are relatively more likely than managers of value firms to
 report good news profits. I show that when they do report positive profit
 surprises, managers of growth firms are more likely to report “a little
 bit of good news” in every year.

Title: Market Efficiency, Bounded Rationality, and Supplemental Business Reporting Disclosures 
Author-Name: J. Richard Dietrich  
Author-Name: Steven J. Kachelmeier  
Author-Name: Don N. Kleinmuntz  
Author-Name: Thomas J. Linsmeier  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>The AICPA Special Committee on Financial
 Reporting has urged disclosure of relevant forward-looking information on
 risks and opportunities to supplement conventional financial statements.
 We conduct a laboratory market experiment to assess the effects of such
 disclosures on capital allocation decisions. We develop two sets of
 competing hypotheses regarding how capital markets react to supplemental
 disclosures. One set is based on the assumption of semi-strong market
 efficiency, while the other posits that the bounded rationality of
 individual traders leads to inefficient market prices. We find that
 explicit disclosure of management’s best estimate of an uncertain quantity
 improves market efficiency, even though this disclosure is redundant with
 information in financial statements. Second, we find disclosure of an
 upper bound of management’s estimate has the potential to bias security
 prices upward, while informationally equivalent disclosure of both upper
 and lower bounds removes this bias. These results suggest that
 experimental market reactions to these supplemental disclosures are
 inconsistent with market efficiency. Supplemental analyses of individuals’
 price predictions and trading behavior support our conclusion that
 inefficiencies are at least partially attributable to individual
 information processing biases.

Title: The Association between External Monitoring and Earnings Management in the Property-Casualty Insurance Industry 
Author-Name: Jennifer J. Gaver  
Author-Name: Jeffrey S. Paterson  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>This paper examines the association between
 external monitoring and earnings management by property-casualty insurers.
 We extend previous work by Petroni and Beasley (1996) by expanding the set
 of external monitors to include both auditors and actuaries. We
 investigate whether certain auditor-actuary pairs are associated with less
 understatement of the loss reserve account by financially struggling
 insurers. Our data consist of loss adjustments reported by 465
 property-casualty insurers for reserves established in 1993. The results
 indicate that under-reserving by weak insurers is essentially eliminated
 when the firm uses auditors and actuaries that are both from Big Six
 accounting firms. In contrast, non-Big Six actuaries have less impact on
 under-reserving by weak insurers. Our results suggest that the quality
 usually associated with Big Six auditors falls when the audit firm relies
 on third party actuaries to evaluate the loss reserve estimates of
 struggling insurance clients. We conjecture that Big Six actuaries insist
 on more conservative loss reserve levels because, compared to actuarial
 consulting firms, they are more attuned to the liability exposure of the
 auditor.

Title: Balance Sheet Management: The Case of Short-Term Obligations Reclassified as Long-Term Debt 
Author-Name: Jeffrey D. Gramlich  
Author-Name: Mary Lea McAnally  
Author-Name: Jacob Thomas  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>We investigate potential management of
 balance sheet ratios by a sample of firms that reclassify short-term
 obligations to long-term debt and subsequently declassify that debt
 (return it to the current liability section). Although aggregate measures
 of liabilities and equity remain unchanged when firms reclassify
 (declassify), the practice does increase (decrease) reported measures of
 liquidity, such as the current ratio, and long-term leverage. Our results
 suggest that firms reclassify and declassify to smooth reported liquidity
 and leverage, relative to the prior year and to industry benchmarks. Our
 evidence is also consistent with firms working around restrictive debt
 covenants.

Title: The Impact of Securities Litigation Reform on the Disclosure of Forward-Looking Information By High Technology Firms 
Author-Name: Marilyn F. Johnson

Author-Name: Karen K. Nelson  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>This study evaluates corporate voluntary
 disclosure of forward-looking information under the safe harbor provision
 of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Using a sample of
 523 computer hardware, computer software, and pharmaceutical firms, we
 find a significant increase in both the frequency of firms issuing
 earnings and sales forecasts and the mean number of forecasts issued
 following the Act’s passage. To provide more direct evidence that our
 findings are attributable to the Act reducing firms’ legal exposure, we
 develop a proxy for litigation risk and examine whether the increase in
 disclosure is more pronounced for firms at greatest risk of a lawsuit. As
 expected, we find that the change in disclosure is increasing in firms’ ex
 ante risk of litigation. Finally, we report that the safe harbor had no
 adverse impact on the quality of forward-looking information. Forecast
 errors, whether directional or non-directional, were not significantly
 affected by the Act’s passage.

Title: The Inefficiency of the Mean Analyst Forecast as a Summary Forecast of Earnings 
Author-Name: Oliver Kim  
Author-Name: Steve C. Lim  
Author-Name: Kenneth W. Shaw  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>We show analytically that mean analyst
 forecasts inefficiently aggregate information by assigning too much weight
 to analysts’ common information relative to their private information when
 used as a summary forecast measure of forthcoming earnings. A more precise
 summary forecast of earnings than the current mean forecast is the current
 mean forecast plus a positive multiple of the change in the mean forecast.

Title: Equity Risk and the Labor Stock: The Case of Union Contracts 
Author-Name: Joshua G. Rosett  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>This paper investigates the role of the
 stock of unionized labor in determining equity investment risk. I estimate
 a labor stock measure based on expected compensation costs, and use the
 ratio of labor stock to total assets as a risk proxy. At the median, the
 labor stock is comparable in magnitude to total assets. Regression
 estimates show the associations between labor-based risk proxies and
 equity market risk measures are both economically and statistically
 significant. In addition, the labor-based measures provide risk
 information over and above information contained in standard risk proxies
 such as financial and operating leverage.

Title: Reporting Discretion and Private Information Communication through Earnings 
Author-Name: Mandira Roy Sankar  
Author-Name: K. R. Subramanyam  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>We model a two-period pure exchange economy
 where a risk averse manager, who has private information regarding future
 earnings, is required to issue an earnings report to investors at the end
 of each period. While the manager is prohibited from directly disclosing
 her private information, she is allowed to bias reported earnings in the
 first period, subject to GAAP rules that require that a specified
 proportion of the bias be reversed subsequently. We show there is a
 minimum threshold of reversal, such that, when the proportion of required
 reversal is above this threshold, the manager smooths income and
 communicates her private information through reported earnings.
 Consequently, the market attaches greater weight to reported earnings than
 under a regime that allows no discretion. When the required reversal is
 below the minimum threshold, the manager increases reported earnings
 without limit and the equilibrium degenerates. When the manager is not
 endowed with any private information, the market unravels the “true”
 earnings and price is unaffected by earnings management. Our results
 underscore the importance of both allowing and restricting reporting
 discretion through formal mechanisms.

Title: Investor and (Value Line) Analyst Underreaction to Information about Future Earnings: The Corrective Role of Non-Earnings-Surprise Information 
Author-Name: Philip Shane  
Author-Name: Peter Brous  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>Prior research suggests that financial
 analysts’ earnings forecasts and stock prices underreact to earnings news.
 This paper provides evidence that analysts and investors correct this
 underreaction in response to the next earnings announcement and to other
 (non-earnings-surprise) information available between earnings
 announcements. Our evidence also suggests that analysts and investors
 underreact to information reflected in analysts’ earnings forecast
 revisions and that non-earnings-surprise information helps correct this
 underreaction as well. Controlling for corrective non-earnings-surprise
 information significantly increases estimates of the degree to which
 analysts’ forecasting behavior can explain drifts in returns following
 both earnings announcements and analysts’ earnings forecast revisions.
