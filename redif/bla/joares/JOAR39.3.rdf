Title: Option Value to Waiting Created by a Control Problem 
Author-Name: Anil Arya  
Author-Name: Jonathan Glover  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>We study a principal-agent model in which
 there is an option to defer a capital project approval decision. A control
 (incentive) problem makes the option to wait valuable when it would not
 have been valuable otherwise. Deferring the project approval decision has
 both a cost and a benefit. The cost of waiting is that the agent’s
 uncertainty regarding future project cost realizations cannot be
 exploited. However, by delaying the first project’s approval decision, the
 principal can condition its approval on the agent’s cost report of the
 second project. Such conditioning can be valuable in the provision of
 incentives because of a diversification effect.

Title: Domestic Accounting Standards, International Accounting Standards, and the Predictability of Earnings 
Author-Name: Hollis Ashbaugh  
Author-Name: Morton Pincus  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>We investigate (1) whether the variation in
 accounting standards across national boundaries relative to International
 Accounting Standards (IAS) has an impact on the ability of financial
 analysts to forecast non-U.S. firms’ earnings accurately, and (2) whether
 analyst forecast accuracy changes after firms adopt IAS. IAS are a set of
 financial reporting policies that typically require increased disclosure
 and restrict management’s choices of measurement methods relative to the
 accounting standards of our sample firms’ countries of domicile. We
 develop indexes of differences in countries’ accounting disclosure and
 measurement policies relative to IAS, and document that greater
 differences in accounting standards relative to IAS are significantly and
 positively associated with the absolute value of analyst earnings forecast
 errors. Further, we show that analyst forecast accuracy improves after
 firms adopt IAS. More specifically, after controlling for changes in the
 market value of equity, changes in analyst following, and changes in the
 number of news reports, we find that the convergence in firms’ accounting
 policies brought about by adopting IAS is positively associated with the
 reduction in analyst forecast errors.

Title: Auditing in the Presence of Outside Sources of Information 
Author-Name: Mark Bagnoli

Author-Name: Susan G. Watts  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>We examine how an auditor’s ability to
 terminate a multi-period client relationship provides the auditor with a
 real option whose value depends on the nature of informational asymmetry
 between the incumbent and other potential auditors. In particular, we
 isolate conditions under which the auditor’s private and public sources of
 information behave as complements rather than substitutes. In such
 circumstances, increasing the likelihood of publicly provided information
 induces the auditor to expend more (rather than less)resources in private
 information gathering activities.

Title: Misstatement Direction, Litigation Risk, and Planned Audit Investment 
Author-Name: Orie Barron  
Author-Name: Jamie Pratt  
Author-Name: James D. Stice  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>This study reports the results of an
 experiment showing that auditor assessments of litigation risk and planned
 audit investments are higher when potential errors overstate financial
 performance than when those errors understate performance. This result is
 much stronger in the presence of high levels of litigation risk in the
 client’s industry. These results suggest that in industries where
 litigation risk is high audited financial statements may contain more
 unintentional material understatement errors than overstatement errors.
 Thus, litigation risk—through its effect on auditors—may encourage
 financial statements that understate firm performance

Title: Tax and Regulatory Motivations for Issuing Non-voting, Non-convertible Preferred Stock 
Author-Name: Carolyn M. Callahan  
Author-Name: Wayne H. Shaw  
Author-Name: William D. Terando  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>This paper extends prior studies that
 attempt to explain the existence of unique securities, particularly Engel,
 Erickson, and Maydew [1999], by investigating why firms issue non-voting,
 non-convertible preferred stock (PS) instead of other securities. We find
 that the choice of PS is influenced by tax and regulatory changes imposed
 by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86) and the 1989 Basle Banking Accord as
 well as various firm specific incentives. We find that industrials issue
 PS to preserve tax attributes by avoiding an ownership change and to
 maximize foreign tax credit utilization. In addition, we find that the
 regulatory requirements of the Basle Accord influence the choice by banks
 to issue PS. Finally, we show that although firms could have issued
 alternative securities that would have allowed them to achieve the same
 tax or regulatory goals, firm specific factors limit their ability to do
 so. For example, firms can also avoid triggering an ownership change by
 issuing straight debt, however, financial distress considerations may
 constrain their ability to issue additional debt. Therefore, we
 demonstrate that the final choice of PS is influenced by a combination of
 tax, regulatory, and firm specific incentives.

Title: Agent Employment Horizons and Contracting Demand for Forward-Looking Performance Measures 
Author-Name: Shane S. Dikolli  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>In this paper, the principal rewards an
 agent’s farsighted effort both in the short and long term, with the
 short-term reward based on a noisy, forward-looking performance measure
 and the long-term reward based on a potentially less noisy, trailing
 performance measure. The main result is that optimal contracting weights
 depend on the agent’s employment time horizon: the shorter the agent’s
 employment horizon the greater the emphasis on the forward-looking
 performance measure and vice versa. This implies that contracting on
 forward-looking performance measures can be valuable in mitigating any
 adverse long-term effects of employees myopically focusing on short-term
 trailing performance measures.

Title: Electric Utility Stranded Costs: Valuation and Disclosure Issues 
Author-Name: Julia D’Souza  
Author-Name: John Jacob  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>We analyze the stock market’s valuation of
 electric utility “stranded costs” (i.e., costs that might become
 unrecoverable under deregulation), and investigate whether stranded costs
 that have arisen as a result of voluntary firm business decisions are
 valued differently from those that are more directly linked to regulatory
 mandates. Further, we study whether investor valuations differ across
 jurisdictions. Finally, we examine the relation between investor valuation
 of stranded costs and the decision by utilities to make stranded
 cost-related disclosures in their financial statements voluntarily. <p>We
 find that investors anticipate that, on average, approximately 10% of
 total stranded costs will be borne by utility shareholders. Stranded costs
 arising from voluntary operating or investing decisions made by utilities
 are valued more negatively than those associated with mandatory power
 purchase contracts, consistent with investors assigning a higher recovery
 probability to the latter. Investor valuations of stranded costs
 associated with utility generating investments do not differ
 systematically across jurisdictions. We find that stranded costs are
 valued less negatively for voluntary disclosers not just in the year of
 disclosure but also in the preceding two years, implying that it is not
 disclosure per se that favorably influences valuation. Voluntary
 disclosers operate in jurisdictions that have more clearly established
 stranded cost recovery mechanisms, suggesting that both stranded cost
 disclosure and valuation are prompted by reduction in uncertainty about
 recoverability.</p>

Title: The Contribution of Internal Audit as a Determinant of External Audit Fees and Factors Influencing This Contribution 
Author-Name: William L. Felix, Jr.  
Author-Name: Audrey A. Gramling  
Author-Name: Mario j. Maletta  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>Despite extensive research on the
 determinants of external audit fees, there is little empirical evidence on
 the effect of internal audit contribution on the external audit fee. Using
 a cross-sectional regression model based on prior audit fee research, this
 study provides evidence that internal audit contribution is a significant
 determinant of the external audit fee. Further, a second model that
 provides evidence on the determinants of internal audit contribution is
 developed and tested. This second model indicates that internal audit
 contribution is influenced by internal audit quality and, conditional on
 the level of inherent risk, the availability of internal audit and the
 extent of coordination between internal and external auditors. These
 results are based on a unique data-set comprised of publicly available
 data matched with survey responses from internal and external auditors
 affiliated with 70 non-financial services Fortune 1000 firms. The sample
 includes all of the former “Big 6” international accounting firms and
 clients from twenty-nine different industries.

Title: Analyst Specialization and Conglomerate Stock Breakups 
Author-Name: Stuart C. Gilson  
Author-Name: Paul M. Healy  
Author-Name: Christopher F. Noe  
Author-Name: Krishna G. Palepu  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>This paper examines whether firms emerging
 from conglomerate stock breakups are able to affect the types of financial
 analysts that cover their firms as well as the quality of information
 generated about their performance. Our sample comprises 103
 focus-increasing spin-offs, equity carve-outs, and targeted stock
 offerings between 1990 and 1995. We find that, after these transactions,
 sample firms experience a significant increase in coverage by analysts
 that specialize in subsidiary firms’ industries, and a 30–50% increase in
 analyst forecast accuracy for parent and subsidiary firms. The improvement
 in forecast accuracy is partially attributable to expanded disclosure.
 However, forecast improvements for specialists exceed those for
 non-specialists, leading us to conclude that corporate focus can
 facilitate improved capital market intermediation by financial analysts
 with industry expertise.

Title: Can Auditors Predict the Choices Made by Other Auditors? 
Author-Name: Karim Jamal  
Author-Name: Hun-Tong Tan  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>An implicit assumption of prior literature
 on strategic behavior of auditors is that auditors know the preferences of
 their colleagues. In this study, we conduct an experiment to investigate
 the validity of this assumption. In our experiment, we match a manager
 with a pair of top and mediocre audit seniors, as assessed by their firm.
 Each auditor predicts the choices that will be made by other auditors on
 two tasks that differ in their level of ambiguity. Our results show no
 difference in the accuracy among managers, top seniors, and mediocre
 seniors when they predict the choices made by specific individual auditors
 for both tasks. When predicting the number of managers and seniors who
 will choose a specific option on the high-ambiguity task, managers
 outperform top seniors, who in turn outperform mediocre seniors. For the
 low-ambiguity task, we find no difference among managers, top seniors, and
 mediocre seniors. Our results provide some limited support for models of
 strategic auditor behavior, and indicate that the ability to predict the
 choices of others is a dimension of an auditor’s expertise.

Title: Auditor Reputation Building 
Author-Name: Brian W. Mayhew  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>This paper reports the results of an
 experimental economics study designed to examine reputation building by
 information verifiers (auditors). The results identify boundary conditions
 to reputation formation and supply insight into auditors’ incentives to
 form reputations. Reputations form in all sessions of treatments that
 supply nearly immediate rewards to participants who adopt reputation
 equilibrium strategies. In contrast, reputations form in less than half of
 the sessions of a treatment where participants have to maintain reputation
 equilibrium strategies for number of periods before the market rewards
 their effort. The results suggest the immediacy of rewards for adopting
 reputation strategies is a critical determinant of reputation formation.

Title: Cost-System Choice and Incentives—Traditional vs. Activity-Based Costing 
Author-Name: Birendra Mishra  
Author-Name: Igor Vaysman  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>We incorporate information and managerial
 incentives into the analysis of a common cost-management
 tool—activity-based costing (ABC). We study the choice of a costing system
 in a firm where the owners contract with a manager to use either a
 traditional or an ABC system and make production decisions. We show that,
 as commonly argued in managerial-accounting literature, in a first-best
 setting with no informational asymmetries the ABC system is always
 preferred to the traditional costing one. However, when the firm’s manager
 has relevant private information, the owners’ choice of a costing system
 is not as clear. We demonstrate that the firm earns higher expected
 profits under the ABC system when the uncertainty about the manager’s
 private information is high. Conversely, the firm's expected profit is
 higher under the traditional costing system when the uncertainty
 surrounding the manager’s private information is low because the gross
 benefits of better information provided by ABC are exceeded by the
 additional informational rents the owners must pay the manager under this
 system. Our results provide a formal explanation of the coexistence of
 traditional and ABC systems in practice.

Title: Cross-Jurisdictional Income Shifting by U.S. Multinationals: Evidence from International Bond Offerings 
Author-Name: Kaye J. Newberry  
Author-Name: Dan S. Dhaliwal  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>We examine whether tax incentives influence
 where U.S. multinationals locate their interest deductions worldwide. Our
 sample includes international bond offerings by U.S. multinationals during
 1987–1997 denominated in the currencies of Australia, Canada, France,
 Germany, Italy, Japan, or the United Kingdom. Our results suggest that
 U.S. multinationals’ debt location decisions take into account the effect
 of jurisdiction-specific tax-loss carryforwards and binding foreign tax
 credit limitations on the value of debt tax shields. Our results are also
 consistent with U.S. multinationals locating interest deductions in
 different tax jurisdictions as a mechanism to achieve tax-motivated income
 shifting.

Title: Economic Consequences of the Declining Relevance of Financial Reports 
Author-Name: Nishi Sinha  
Author-Name: John Watts  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>The proliferation of alternative
 information sources has reduced the relevance of corporate annual reports.
 This paper examines economic outcomes in an oligopolistic industry as
 investors become better informed but financial reports convey a smaller
 portion of the total information. Results show that an increase in
 alternate sources of information, and the resulting decline in relevance
 of financial reports, leads to a loss in economic efficiency despite the
 presence of additional information. Investors benefit, but at the expense
 of consumers and social welfare. Investors benefit not necessarily because
 the amount of information in the economy increases, but because there is a
 change in the channels through which the same information is communicated.

Title: Accountability Demands and the Auditor’s Evidence Search Strategy: The Influence of Reviewer Preferences and the Nature of the Response (Belief vs. Action) 
Author-Name: Cynthia Williams Turner  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>This study examines differences in
 auditors’ search behaviors associated with the preferences of audit
 management (reviewer preferences) and the nature of the required response
 (belief versus action) in the context of an accounts receivable
 collectibility review. I find that auditors facing reviewers who expressed
 concern about auditors spending time specifically looking for evidence
 inconsistent with explanations provided by the client (credence
 preference) examined fewer evidence items and followed a more
 client-prompted search (i.e., a search for evidence that follows directly
 from the client’s explanation) than those facing reviewers who expressed
 concern about auditors’ ready acceptance of client explanations without
 adequate justification (skepticism preference) and those facing reviewers
 who expressed no specific concern (unknown preference). Further, auditors
 in the action conditions examined fewer evidence items and spent less time
 per evidence item than those in the judgment conditions. Additional
 analyses also indicate that auditors who were held accountable to a
 reviewer with an unknown preference generally responded as if the reviewer
 maintained a skepticism preference.

Title: Mutual Fund Manager Forecasting Behavior 
Author-Name: Richard H. Willis  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:lang="en"> <p>I examine publicly released annual earnings
 forecasts issued in conjunction with stock recommendations by mutual fund
 managers of actively managed open-end mutual funds. I find that mutual
 fund manager annual earnings forecasts systematically overestimate the
 earnings number later disclosed at the annual earnings announcement. In
 further analyses, I attempt to distinguish between two explanations for
 this forecast bias: an untruthful reporting bias (market manipulation) and
 a truthful cognitive bias (optimism). These explanations generate
 different predictions about the timing of changes in fundholdings of
 forecasted securities between the forecast release and annual earnings
 announcement dates. I interpret my findings as more consistent with an
 optimism explanation for mutual fund manager annual forecast bias and less
 consistent with a market manipulation explanation for this bias. I am,
 however, unable to eliminate an unobservable selection bias either in the
 decision of the mutual fund manager to report a forecast publicly or in
 the media’s decision to publish that forecast as an explanation for my
 finding that mutual fund manager forecasts are biased.
