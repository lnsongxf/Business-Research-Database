Title: Aggregate Earnings and Corporate Bond Markets 
Author-Name: XANTHI GKOUGKOUSI  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>I examine the
 previously unexplored relation between aggregate earnings changes and
 corporate bond market returns. I find that aggregate earnings changes have
 a negative relation to investment-grade corporate bond market returns and
 a positive relation to high-yield corporate bond market returns. The
 aggregate earnings-returns relation is lower (i.e., less positive or more
 negative) for bonds with higher credit ratings and longer maturities.
 Further, I show that the aggregate earnings-returns relation is driven by
 both the expected and the news component of aggregate earnings changes.
 The expected component is negatively related to expected returns, and the
 news component is positively related to cash flow news and changes in
 nominal interest rates, and negatively related to changes in default
 premia. My results contribute to the understanding of the role of earnings
 in corporate bond markets as well as the macroeconomic role of accounting
 information.

Title: The Relation Between Reporting Quality and Financing and Investment: Evidence from Changes in Financing Capacity

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We use changes in the
 value of a firm's real estate assets as an exogenous change in a firm's
 financing capacity to examine (1) the relation between reporting quality
 and financing and investment conditional on this change, and (2) firms’
 reporting quality responses to the change in financing capacity. We find
 that financing and investment by firms with higher reporting quality is
 less affected by changes in real estate values than are financing and
 investment by firms with lower reporting quality. Further, firms increase
 reporting quality in response to decreases in financing capacity. Our
 findings contribute to the literature on reporting quality and investment,
 and on the determinants of reporting quality choices.

Title: Auditor Choice in Politically Connected Firms 
Author-Name: OMRANE GUEDHAMI  
Author-Name: JEFFREY A. PITTMAN  
Author-Name: WALID SAFFAR  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We extend recent
 research on the links between political connections and financial
 reporting by examining the role of auditor choice. Our evidence that
 public firms with political connections are more likely to appoint a Big 4
 auditor supports the intuition that insiders in these firms are eager to
 improve accounting transparency to convince outside investors that they
 refrain from exploiting their connections to divert corporate resources.
 In evidence consistent with another prediction, we find that this link is
 stronger for connected firms with ownership structures conducive to
 insiders seizing private benefits at the expense of minority investors. We
 also find that the relation between political connections and auditor
 choice is stronger for firms operating in countries with relatively poor
 institutional infrastructure, implying that tough external monitoring by
 Big 4 auditors becomes more valuable for preventing diversion in these
 situations. Finally, we report that connected firms with Big 4 auditors
 exhibit less earnings management and enjoy greater transparency, higher
 valuations, and cheaper equity financing.

Title: Management Forecast Consistency 
Author-Name: GILLES HILARY  
Author-Name: CHARLES HSU  
Author-Name: RENCHENG WANG  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We posit that
 management forecasts, which are predictable transformations of realized
 earnings without random errors, are more informative than unbiased
 forecasts, which manifest small but unpredictable errors, even if biased
 forecasts are less accurate. Consistent with this intuition, we find that
 managers who make consistent forecasting errors have a greater ability to
 influence investor reactions and analyst revisions, even after controlling
 for the effect of accuracy. This effect is more economically significant
 and statistically robust than that of forecast accuracy. More
 sophisticated investors and experienced analysts are found to have a
 better understanding of the benefits of consistent management forecasts.

Title: Economic Determinants and Information Environment Effects of Earnouts: New Insights from SFAS 141(R) 
Author-Name: BRIAN CADMAN  
Author-Name: RICHARD CARRIZOSA  
Author-Name: LUCILE FAUREL  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Contingent
 considerations (earnouts) in acquisition agreements provide sellers with
 future payments conditional on meeting certain conditions. Prior research
 provides evidence that acquiring firms use earnouts to minimize agency
 costs associated with acquisitions. Using earnout fair value information,
 recently mandated by SFAS 141(R), we provide new insights into the
 economic determinants to include earnout provisions in acquisition
 agreements, including motivations to resolve moral hazard and adverse
 selection problems, bridge valuation gaps, and retain target firm
 managers. We document variations in initial earnout fair value estimates
 and earnout fair value adjustments that correspond with these underlying
 motivations. We also provide evidence that target managers stay longer
 with the firm after the acquisition when earnouts are included primarily
 to retain target managers. Finally, we demonstrate that earnout fair value
 adjustments required by SFAS 141(R) provide valuable information to market
 participants and are negatively associated with the likelihood of
 contemporaneous and future goodwill impairments.

Title: Private Interaction Between Firm Management and Sell-Side Analysts 
Author-Name: EUGENE SOLTES  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Although sell-side
 analysts often privately interact with managers of publicly traded firms,
 the private nature of this contact has historically obscured direction
 examination. By examining a set of proprietary records compiled by a
 large-cap NYSE-traded firm, I offer insights into which analysts privately
 meet with management, when analysts privately interact with management,
 and why these interactions occur. I also compare private interaction to
 public interaction between analysts and managers on conference calls. The
 evidence suggests that private interaction with management is an important
 communication channel for analysts for reasons other than firm-specific
 forecasting news.

Title: Political Connections and the Cost of Bank Loans 
Author-Name: JOEL F. HOUSTON  
Author-Name: LIANGLIANG JIANG

Author-Name: YUE MA  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper analyzes
 whether the political connections of listed firms in the United States
 affect the cost and terms of loan contracts. Using a hand-collected data
 set of the political connections of S&P 500 companies over the 2003–2008
 time period, we find that the cost of bank loans is significantly lower
 for companies that have board members with political ties. We consider two
 possible explanations for these findings: a Borrower Channel in which
 lenders charge lower rates because they recognize that connections enhance
 the borrower's credit worthiness and a Bank Channel in which banks assign
 greater value to connected loans to enhance their own relationships with
 key politicians. After employing a series of tests to distinguish between
 these two channels, we find strong support for the Borrower Channel but no
 direct evidence supporting the Bank Channel. Finally, we demonstrate that
 political connections reduce the likelihood of a capital expenditure
 restriction or liquidity requirement commanded by banks at the origination
 of the loan. Taken together, our results suggest that political
 connections increase the value of U.S. companies and reduce monitoring
 costs and credit risk faced by banks, which, in turn, reduces the
 borrower's cost of debt.

Title: When the Use of Positive Language Backfires: The Joint Effect of Tone, Readability, and Investor Sophistication on Earnings Judgments 
Author-Name: HUN-TONG TAN  
Author-Name: ELAINE YING WANG  
Author-Name: BO ZHOU  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Recent studies
 document that market participants react positively to the positive
 language sentiment or tone embedded in financial disclosures, and that
 investors’ reactions to negative news are more muted with poor disclosure
 readability. However, while language sentiment and readability co-occur in
 practice, their joint effects remain largely unexplored. In an experiment
 with MBA students as participants, we investigate how the effect of
 language sentiment varies with readability and investor sophistication
 level. We find that language sentiment influences investors’ judgments
 when readability is low, but not when readability is high. Specifically,
 when readability is low, disclosures couched in positive language lead to
 higher earnings judgments for less sophisticated investors, but lower
 earnings judgments for more sophisticated investors. These findings show
 that the main effects of readability and language sentiment documented in
 prior studies have boundary effects, and may reverse when both variables
 are jointly considered along with investor sophistication.
