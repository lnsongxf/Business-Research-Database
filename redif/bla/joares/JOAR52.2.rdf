Title: Do Declines in Bank Health Affect Borrowers’ Voluntary Disclosures? Evidence from International Propagation of Banking Shocks 
Author-Name: ALVIS K. LO  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>I examine whether
 declines in banks’ financial health affect their borrowers’ disclosures.
 Prior studies indicate that, in relationship lending, banks and borrowers
 rely on private communication, rather than public disclosures, to resolve
 information asymmetries. When banking relationships are threatened,
 borrowers must turn to new funding sources, inducing them to reconsider
 their disclosure policies. This paper predicts that borrowers, whose
 banking relationships are threatened by declining bank health, change
 their public disclosures of forward-looking information. Using the
 emerging-market financial crises in the late 1990s as shocks to the health
 of certain U.S. banks, I find that affected banks’ U.S. borrowers increase
 both the quantity and informativeness of their management forecasts
 following these shocks compared to borrowers of unaffected banks. The
 results are similar using conference calls or the length of the
 Management's Discussion and Analysis section as alternative proxies for
 voluntary disclosure. Overall, these results provide new insights into the
 impact of availability of relationship lending on firms’ disclosure
 choices.

Title: Uninvited U.S. Investors? Economic Consequences of Involuntary Cross-Listings 
Author-Name: PETER ILIEV

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We study the economic
 consequences of a recent Securities and Exchange Commission securities
 regulation change that grants foreign firms trading on the U.S.
 over-the-counter (OTC) market an automatic exemption from the reporting
 requirements of the 1934 Securities Act. We document that the number of
 voluntary (sponsored) OTC cross-listings did not increase following the
 regulation change, suggesting that it did not achieve its intended purpose
 of increasing voluntary OTC cross-listings through a reduction in
 compliance costs. We do find that the design of the regulation allowed
 financial intermediaries to create an unprecedented number of involuntary
 (unsponsored) OTC ADRs: 1,700 unsponsored ADR programs for 920 firms were
 created for companies that had previously chosen not to cross-list in the
 United States. Our difference-in-differences analysis based on a matched
 sample approach documents that foreign firms forced into the U.S. capital
 markets experience a significant decrease in firm value, and we further
 show that the decrease in firm value is related to an increase in U.S.
 litigation risk. We also find that depositary banks’ propensity to
 involuntarily cross-list firms is positively related to banks’ expected
 fee revenue, and that banks chose firms that incur high costs when
 involuntarily cross-listed. Our results provide evidence that securities
 regulation can be exploited for private gain and result in costly
 unintended consequences.

Title: Dividend Payouts and Information Shocks 
Author-Name: LUZI HAIL

Author-Name: CLARE WANG  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We examine changes in
 firms’ dividend payouts following an exogenous shock to the information
 asymmetry problem between managers and investors. Agency theories predict
 a decrease in dividend payments to the extent that improved public
 information lowers managers’ need to convey their commitment to avoid
 overinvestment via costly dividend payouts. Conversely, dividends could
 increase if minority investors are in a better position to extract cash
 dividends. We test these predictions by analyzing the dividend payment
 behavior of a global sample of firms around the mandatory adoption of IFRS
 and the initial enforcement of new insider trading laws. Both events serve
 as proxies for a general improvement of the information environment and,
 hence, the corporate governance structure in the economy. We find that,
 following the two events, firms are less likely to pay (increase)
 dividends, but more likely to cut (stop) such payments. The changes occur
 around the time of the informational shock, and only in countries and for
 firms subject to the regulatory change. They are more pronounced when the
 inherent agency issues or the informational shocks are stronger. We
 further find that the information content of dividends decreases after the
 events. The results highlight the importance of the agency costs of free
 cash flows (and changes therein) for shaping firms’ payout policies.

Title: Public Equity and Audit Pricing in the United States

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>To what degree are
 audit fees for U.S. firms with publicly traded equity higher than fees for
 otherwise similar firms with private equity? The answer is potentially
 important for evaluating regulatory regime design efficiency and for
 understanding audit demand and production economics. For U.S. firms with
 publicly traded debt, we hold constant the regulatory regime, including
 mandated issuer reporting and auditor responsibilities. We vary equity
 ownership and thus public securities market contextual factors, including
 any related public firm audit fees from increased audit effort to reduce
 audit litigation risk and/or pure litigation risk premium (litigation
 channel effects). In cross-section, we find that audit fees for public
 equity firms are 20–22% higher than fees for otherwise similar private
 equity firms. Time-series comparisons for firms that change ownership
 status yield larger percentage fee increases (decreases) for those going
 public (private). Results are consistent with litigation channel effects
 giving rise to substantial incremental audit fees for U.S. firms with
 public equity ownership.

Title: How Frequent Financial Reporting Can Cause Managerial Short-Termism: An Analysis of the Costs and Benefits of Increasing Reporting Frequency 
Author-Name: FRANK GIGLER

Author-Name: RAGHU VENUGOPALAN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We develop a
 cost–benefit tradeoff that provides new insights into the frequency with
 which firms should be required to report the results of their operations
 to the capital market. The benefit to increasing the frequency of
 financial reporting is that it causes market prices to better deter
 investments in negative net present value projects. The cost of increased
 frequency is that it increases the probability of inducing managerial
 short-termism. We analyze the tradeoff between these costs and benefits
 and develop conditions under which greater reporting frequency is
 desirable and conditions under which it is not.
