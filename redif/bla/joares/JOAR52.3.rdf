Title: A Glimpse Behind a Closed Door: The Long-Term Investment Value of Buy-Side Research and Its Effect on Fund Trades and Performance 
Author-Name: MICHAEL REBELLO  
Author-Name: KELSEY D. WEI  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We examine
 proprietary research produced by buy-side analysts working for a large
 fund management company. We find that the buy-side research has investment
 value for a one-year horizon, and the analysts producing this research
 exhibit differential ability that tends to persist over time. The buy-side
 research strongly influences trades made by the company's funds,
 especially when it coveys information that is independent of the fund
 managers' own information, when it is produced by buy-side analysts with
 good track records, and when the underlying stocks have little sell-side
 coverage. The influence of sell-side research is concentrated primarily in
 stocks not followed by buy-side analysts and in funds with low overall
 buy-side coverage. The company's funds that rely more heavily on buy-side
 research generate superior performance.

Title: Options in Compensation: Promises and Pitfalls 
Author-Name: CHRISTIAN RIIS FLOR

Author-Name: CLAUS MUNK  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We derive the optimal
 compensation contract in a principal–agent setting in which outcome is
 used to provide incentives for both effort and risky investments. To
 motivate investment, optimal compensation entails rewards for high as well
 as low outcomes, and it is increasing at the mean outcome to motivate
 effort. If rewarding low outcomes is infeasible, compensation consisting
 of stocks and options is a near-efficient means of overcoming the
 manager's induced aversion to undertaking risky investments, whereas stock
 compensation is not. However, stock plus option compensation may induce
 excessively risky investments, and capping pay can be important in curbing
 such behavior.

Title: Changes in Cash: Persistence and Pricing Implications 
Author-Name: JEFF ZEYUN CHEN  
Author-Name: PHILIP B. SHANE  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper decomposes
 the cash component of earnings and analyzes persistence characteristics
 and pricing implications of various subcomponents, with particular
 attention to changes in cash. Changes in underlying fundamentals might
 dictate changes in cash to new optimal levels. Alternatively, suboptimal
 changes in cash might result from agency costs allowing managers’ actions
 to diverge from the best interests of shareholders. We predict and find
 that both suboptimal increases and decreases in cash bode poorly for
 future earnings. In fact, we find that suboptimal increases (decreases) in
 cash have less (greater) persistence than any of the earnings components
 we study, including accruals and net distributions to both shareholders
 and debt holders. Market efficiency tests indicate that the market
 severely punishes firms with suboptimal decreases in cash, but we find no
 evidence to support the hubris hypothesis that the market overreacts to
 the earnings implications of unwarranted increases in cash.

Title: Did Regulation Fair Disclosure, SOX, and Other Analyst Regulations Reduce Security Mispricing? 
Author-Name: EDWARD LEE  
Author-Name: NORMAN STRONG  
Author-Name: ZHENMEI (JUDY) ZHU  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Between 2000 and 2003
 a series of disclosure and analyst regulations curbing abusive financial
 reporting and analyst behavior were enacted to strengthen the information
 environment of U.S. capital markets. We investigate whether these
 regulations reduced security mispricing and increased stock market
 efficiency. After the regulations, we find a significant reduction in
 short-term stock price continuation following analyst forecast revisions
 and earnings announcements. The effect was more pronounced among higher
 information uncertainty firms, where we expect security valuation to be
 most sensitive to regulation. Analyst forecast accuracy also improved in
 these firms, consistent with reduced mispricing being due to an improved
 corporate information environment following the regulations. Our findings
 are robust to controls for time trends, trading activity, the financial
 crisis, analyst coverage, delistings, and changes in information
 uncertainty proxies. We find no concurrent effect among European firms and
 a regression discontinuity design supports our identification of a
 regulatory effect.

Title: The Effects of Public Information with Asymmetrically Informed Short-Horizon Investors 
Author-Name: QI CHEN

Author-Name: YUN ZHANG  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper analyzes
 the effects of public information in a perfect competition trading model
 populated by asymmetrically informed short-horizon investors with
 different levels of private information precision. We first show that
 information asymmetry reduces the amount of private information revealed
 by price in equilibrium (i.e., price informativeness) and can lead to
 multiple linear equilibria. We then demonstrate that the presence of both
 information asymmetry and short horizons provides a channel through which
 public information influences price informativeness and equilibrium
 uniqueness. We identify conditions under which public information
 increases or decreases price informativeness, and when multiple equilibria
 may arise. Our analysis shows that public information not only directly
 endows prices with more (public) information, it can also have an
 important indirect effect on the degree to which prices reveal private
 information.

Title: The Impact of Recognition Versus Disclosure on Financial Information: A Preparer's Perspective 
Author-Name: SHANA M. CLOR-PROELL  
Author-Name: LAUREEN A. MAINES  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We investigate
 whether recognition on the face of the financial statements versus
 disclosure in the footnotes influences the amount that financial managers
 report for a contingent liability. Using an experiment with corporate
 controllers and chief financial officers, we find that financial managers
 in public companies expend more cognitive effort and exhibit less
 strategic bias under recognition than disclosure. This difference appears
 to be associated with capital market pressures experienced by public
 company managers as we find that both the cognitive effort and bias
 exhibited by private company managers are unaffected by placement. As a
 result, public company managers make higher liability estimates for
 recognized versus disclosed liabilities. Their liability estimates are
 similar to those of private company managers for recognition but lower
 than private company managers’ estimates for disclosure. Our results have
 implications for auditors and financial statement users in evaluating
 recognized versus disclosed information for public and private companies.
