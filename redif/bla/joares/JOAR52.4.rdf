Title: Advantageous Comparison and Rationalization of Earnings Management 
Author-Name: TIMOTHY J. BROWN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper proposes
 that psychological factors can change managers' beliefs about earnings
 management when they choose to engage in it. I show that, under certain
 circumstances, engaging in a small amount of earnings management alters a
 manager's beliefs about the appropriateness of the act, which may increase
 the likelihood of further earnings management. Specifically, I predict and
 find in two experiments that participants who initially choose to manage
 earnings are motivated to rationalize their behavior. Participants who are
 exposed to an egregious example of earnings management (commonly the focus
 of enforcement actions and press reports) have the opportunity to
 rationalize their behavior through a mechanism called “advantageous
 comparison,” where participants compare their behavior against the
 egregious example and conclude that what they did was relatively innocuous
 and appropriate. My analysis also indicates that presenting participants
 with an example of earnings management that is similar to the initial
 decision they made mitigates advantageous comparison. These results have
 implications for academics interested in how earnings management, and
 perhaps fraud, can accrete over time and for regulators and practitioners
 who are interested in preventing it.

Title: Accounting Standards Harmonization and Financial Statement Comparability: Evidence from Transnational Information Transfer 
Author-Name: CLARE WANG  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper
 investigates whether accounting standards harmonization enhances the
 comparability of financial information across countries. I hypothesize
 that a firm yet to announce earnings reacts more strongly to the earnings
 announcement of a foreign firm when both report under the same rather than
 different accounting standards. My analysis of abnormal price reactions
 for a global sample of firms supports the prediction. Next, in an attempt
 to control for the underlying economic comparability and the effects of
 changes in reporting quality, I use a difference-in-differences design
 around the mandatory introduction of International Financial Reporting
 Standards. I find that mandatory adopters experience a significant
 increase in market reactions to the release of earnings by voluntary
 adopters compared to the period preceding mandatory adoption. This
 increase is not observed for nonadopters. Taken together, the results show
 that accounting standards harmonization facilitates transnational
 information transfer and suggest financial statement comparability as a
 direct mechanism.

Title: Are Trade Size-Based Inferences About Traders Reliable? Evidence from Institutional Earnings-Related Trading 
Author-Name: WILLIAM CREADY

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>The use of observed
 transaction sizes to differentiate between “small” and “large” investor
 trading patterns is widespread. A significant concern in such studies is
 spurious effects attributable to misclassification of transactions,
 particularly those originating from large investors. Such effects can
 arise unintentionally, strategically, or endogenously. We examine
 comprehensive records of a sample of institutional investors (i.e.,
 “large” traders), including their order sizes and overall position
 changes, to assess the degree to which such misclassifications give rise
 to spurious inferences about “small” and “large” investor trading
 activities. Our analysis shows that these institutions are heavily
 involved in small transaction activity. It also shows that they increase
 their order sizes substantially in announcement periods relative to
 nonannouncement periods, presumably as an endogenous response to earnings
 news. In the immediate earnings announcement period, transaction
 size-based inferences about directional trading are quite
 misleading—producing spurious “small trader” effects and, more
 surprisingly, erroneous inferences about “large trader” activity.

Title: Sell-Side Analyst Research and Stock Comovement 
Author-Name: VOLKAN MUSLU  
Author-Name: MICHAEL REBELLO  
Author-Name: YEXIAO XU  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We document that a
 stock's price around a recommendation or forecast covaries with prices of
 other stocks the issuing analyst covers. The effect of shared analyst
 coverage on stock price comovement extends beyond analyst activity days. A
 stock's daily returns covary with the returns of other stocks with which
 it shares analyst coverage. These links between stock price comovement and
 shared analyst coverage are consistent with the coverage-specific
 information we find in earnings forecasts; analysts who cover both stocks
 in a pair expect future earnings of the stocks to be more highly
 correlated than do analysts who cover only one stock from the pair.
 Collectively, our evidence indicates that analyst research produces
 coverage-specific spillovers that raise price comovement among stocks that
 share analyst coverage. The strength of these spillovers is comparable to
 spillovers from broad industry and market information in analyst research.

Title: Optimal Contracts with Performance Manipulation 
Author-Name: ANNE BEYER  
Author-Name: ILAN GUTTMAN  
Author-Name: IVÁN MARINOVIC  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We study optimal
 compensation contracts that (1) are designed to address a joint moral
 hazard and adverse selection problem and that (2) are based on performance
 measures, which may be manipulated by the agent at a cost. In the model, a
 manager is privately informed about his productivity prior to being hired
 by a firm. In order to incentivize the manager to exert productive effort,
 the firm designs a compensation contract that is based on reported
 earnings, which can be manipulated by the manager. Our model predicts that
 (1) the optimal compensation contract is convex in reported earnings; (2)
 the optimal contract is less sensitive to reported earnings than it would
 be absent the manager's ability to manipulate earnings; and (3) higher
 costs of manipulating reported earnings (e.g., due to higher governance
 quality) are associated with higher firm value, lower expected level of
 earnings management, and higher output.
