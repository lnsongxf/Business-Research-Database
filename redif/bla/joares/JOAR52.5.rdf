Title: The Effects of Uncertainty and Disclosure on Auditors' Fair Value Materiality Decisions 
Author-Name: JEREMY B. GRIFFIN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Financial accounting
 standards increasingly require fair value measurements. I experimentally
 examine how uncertainty affects auditors’ adjustment decisions when
 evaluating fair values. I manipulate two types of uncertainty, input
 subjectivity and outcome imprecision, and one reporting choice,
 supplemental disclosure. I find that auditors are most likely to require
 adjustments when fair values contain both more input subjectivity and more
 outcome imprecision, but that this likelihood diminishes when clients
 supplement recognized fair values with additional disclosure. Thus,
 consistent with moral licensing, I find that auditors tolerate greater
 potential misstatement in the financial statements when clients provide
 disclosure, suggesting that the SEC's preference for supplemental
 disclosure may have the unintended consequence of affecting fair values
 recognized in the body of the financial statements. I also provide
 evidence that auditors determine adjustment size by comparing recorded
 fair value to the nearest bound, rather than the midpoint, of the
 auditors’ own range estimate, consistent with strict application of
 auditing standards.

Title: Do Joint Audits Improve or Impair Audit Quality?

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Conventional wisdom
 holds that joint audits would improve audit quality by enhancing audit
 evidence precision because “Two heads are better than one.” Our paper
 challenges this wisdom. We show that joint audits by one big firm and one
 small firm may impair audit quality, because, in that situation, joint
 audits induce a free-riding problem between audit firms and reduce audit
 evidence precision. We further derive a set of empirically testable
 predictions comparing audit evidence precision and audit fees under joint
 and single audits. This paper, the first theoretical study of joint
 audits, contributes to a better understanding of the economic consequences
 of joint audits on audit quality.

Title: Why Do Countries Mandate Accrual Accounting for Tax Purposes? 
Author-Name: IGOR GONCHAROV  
Author-Name: MARTIN JACOB  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This study
 investigates why countries mandate accruals in the definition of corporate
 taxable income. Accruals alleviate timing and matching problems in cash
 flows, which smoothes taxable income and thus better aligns it with
 underlying economic performance. These accrual properties can be desirable
 in the tax setting as tax authorities seek more predictable corporate tax
 revenues. However, they can also make tax revenues procyclical by
 increasing the correlation between aggregate corporate tax revenues and
 aggregate economic activity. We argue that accruals shape the distribution
 of corporate tax revenues, which leads regulators to incorporate accruals
 into the definition of taxable income to balance the portfolio of
 government revenues and expenditures. Using a sample of 26 OECD countries,
 we find support for several theoretically motivated factors explaining the
 use of accruals in tax codes. We first provide evidence that corporate tax
 revenues are less volatile in high accrual countries, but high accrual
 countries collect relatively higher (lower) tax revenues when the
 corporate sector grows (contracts). Critically, we then show that accruals
 and smoother tax revenues are favored by countries with higher levels of
 government spending on public services and uncertain future expenditures,
 while countries with procyclical other tax collections favor cash rules
 and lower procyclicality of corporate tax revenues.

Title: Debtholders’ Demand for Conservatism: Evidence from Changes in Directors’ Fiduciary Duties 
Author-Name: JAGADISON K. AIER  
Author-Name: LONG CHEN  
Author-Name: MIKHAIL PEVZNER  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Debtholders’ demand
 has been widely discussed as a key determinant of conservatism but clear
 causal evidence is not yet established. Using a natural experiment
 setting, wherein a Delaware court ruled that the fiduciary duties of
 directors in near insolvent Delaware companies extend to creditors, we
 predict and find that firms subject to the ruling significantly increased
 their accounting conservatism. In addition, our results suggest that the
 increase in conservatism is more pronounced in near insolvent Delaware
 firms with stronger boards, confirming that the court ruling takes effect
 through the channel of the board of directors. Our results are robust to
 using alternative measures of conservatism and near insolvency status, and
 controlling for potential confounding factors and other stakeholders’
 demand for conservatism. Overall, our study provides empirical evidence to
 support the causal relation between debtholders’ demand and accounting
 conservatism previously suggested in the literature, and offers some
 insights into the role of the board of directors in financial reporting.

Title: Trust and Financial Reporting Quality 
Author-Name: JACE GARRETT  
Author-Name: RANI HOITASH  
Author-Name: DOUGLAS F. PRAWITT  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Using unique survey
 data from Great Place to Work® Institute, we investigate the association
 of intraorganizational trust (i.e., employees’ trust in management) with
 three aspects of financial reporting: accruals quality, misstatements, and
 internal control quality. We find that trust is associated with better
 accrual quality, lower likelihood of financial statement misstatements,
 and lower likelihood of internal control material weakness disclosures.
 However, these effects are not uniform across all companies. Consistent
 with trust improving financial reporting quality through improved
 information production and information sharing, we find that trust is
 significantly associated with financial reporting quality in relatively
 decentralized firms, but not in firms that are relatively centralized. Our
 results are robust to several analyses that attempt to control for
 potential alternative explanations.

Title: Are Auditors Professionally Skeptical? Evidence from Auditors’ Going-Concern Opinions and Management Earnings Forecasts 
Author-Name: MEI FENG  
Author-Name: CHAN LI  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We examine whether
 auditors exercise professional skepticism about management earnings
 forecasts when making going-concern decisions. Using publicly issued
 management earnings forecasts as a proxy for earnings forecasts provided
 by managers to auditors, we find that management earnings forecasts are
 negatively associated with both auditors’ going-concern opinions and
 subsequent bankruptcy. The weight auditors put on management forecasts in
 the going-concern decision is not significantly different from the weight
 implied in the bankruptcy prediction model. Moreover, compared with the
 bankruptcy model, auditors assign a lower weight to management forecasts
 they perceive as being less credible, including those (1) issued by
 managers who issued optimistic forecasts in the previous two years, and
 (2) predicting high earnings increases or high earnings. Taken together,
 our evidence is consistent with auditors being professionally skeptical
 about management earnings forecasts when making going-concern decisions.

Title: Masculinity, Testosterone, and Financial Misreporting 
Author-Name: YUPING JIA  
Author-Name: LAURENCE VAN LENT  
Author-Name: YACHANG ZENG  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We examine the
 relation between a measure of male CEOs’ facial masculinity and financial
 misreporting. Facial masculinity is associated with a complex of masculine
 behaviors (including aggression, egocentrism, riskseeking, and maintenance
 of social status) in males. One possible mechanism for this relation is
 that the hormone testosterone influences both behavior and the development
 of the face shape. We document a positive association between CEO facial
 masculinity and various misreporting proxies in a broad sample of S&P1500
 firms during 1996–2010. We complement this evidence by documenting that a
 CEO's facial masculinity predicts his firm's likelihood of being subject
 to an SEC enforcement action. We also show that an executive's facial
 masculinity is associated with the likelihood of the SEC naming him as a
 perpetrator. We find that facial masculinity is not a measure of
 overconfidence. Finally, we demonstrate that facial masculinity also
 predicts the incidence of insider trading and option backdating.
