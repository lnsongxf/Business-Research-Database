Title: Auditor Mindsets and Audits of Complex Estimates

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Auditors experience
 significant problems auditing complex accounting estimates, and this
 increasingly puts financial reporting quality at risk. Based on analyses
 of the specific errors that auditors commit, we propose that auditors need
 to be able to think more broadly and incorporate information from a
 variety of sources in order to improve audit quality for these important
 accounts. We experimentally demonstrate that a deliberative mindset
 intervention improves auditors’ ability to identify unreasonable estimates
 by improving their ability to identify and incorporate into their analyses
 contradictory information from diverse parts of the audit and improving
 their ability to think critically about the evidence. We perform
 additional analyses to demonstrate that our intervention improves auditor
 performance by causing them to think differently rather than simply to
 work harder. We demonstrate that critical thinking can improve the
 identification of unreasonable estimates and, in doing so, we provide new
 directions for addressing audit quality issues.

Title: Inside the “Black Box” of Sell-Side Financial Analysts

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Our objective is to
 penetrate the “black box” of sell-side financial analysts by providing new
 insights into the inputs analysts use and the incentives they face. We
 survey 365 analysts and conduct 18 follow-up interviews covering a wide
 range of topics, including the inputs to analysts’ earnings forecasts and
 stock recommendations, the value of their industry knowledge, the
 determinants of their compensation, the career benefits of Institutional
 Investor All-Star status, and the factors they consider indicative of
 high-quality earnings. One important finding is that private communication
 with management is a more useful input to analysts’ earnings forecasts and
 stock recommendations than their own primary research, recent earnings
 performance, and recent 10-K and 10-Q reports. Another notable finding is
 that issuing earnings forecasts and stock recommendations that are well
 below the consensus often leads to an increase in analysts’ credibility
 with their investing clients. We conduct cross-sectional analyses that
 highlight the impact of analyst and brokerage characteristics on analysts’
 inputs and incentives. Our findings are relevant to investors, managers,
 analysts, and academic researchers.

Title: Short Selling Pressure, Stock Price Behavior, and Management Forecast Precision: Evidence from a Natural Experiment 
Author-Name: YINGHUA LI  
Author-Name: LIANDONG ZHANG  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Using a natural
 experiment (Regulation SHO), we show that short selling pressure and
 consequent stock price behavior have a causal effect on managers’
 voluntary disclosure choices. Specifically, we find that managers respond
 to a positive exogenous shock to short selling pressure and price
 sensitivity to bad news by reducing the precision of bad news forecasts.
 This finding on management forecasts appears to be generalizable to other
 corporate disclosures. In particular, we find that, in response to
 increased short selling pressure, managers also reduce the readability (or
 increase the fuzziness) of bad news annual reports. Overall, our results
 suggest that maintaining the current level of stock prices is an important
 consideration in managers’ strategic disclosure decisions.

Title: Analyst Reputation, Communication, and Information Acquisition 
Author-Name: XIAOJING MENG  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Earlier studies have
 shown that reputational concerns tend to reduce agents' opportunistic
 behavior. However, a recent study by Morris argued that analysts'
 (experts') reputational concerns may discourage truthful communication
 when they try to avoid being perceived as being misaligned with investors.
 In this paper, I examine the effect of reputational concerns on
 communication in a setting where analysts can choose their precision
 endogenously. Because both misaligned and aligned analysts want investors
 to trust their reports in the future, both will aim to build a reputation
 for being aligned. In equilibrium, aligned analysts will acquire more
 information than misaligned analysts. As a result, investors may favorably
 update their beliefs about the analysts' type when the report is proven to
 be accurate. Therefore, both types of analysts will have reputational
 incentives to communicate truthfully. The paper also derives conditions
 under which the analysts' reputational concerns have a nonmonotonic impact
 on aligned analysts' equilibrium precision choices and investors' welfare.

Title: Unsophisticated Arbitrageurs and Market Efficiency: Overreacting to a History of Underreaction? 
Author-Name: JONATHAN A. MILIAN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Prior research has
 documented that arbitrage activity significantly reduces or eliminates
 stock market anomalies. However, if anomalies arise due to unsophisticated
 investors’ behavioral biases, then these same biases can also apply to
 unsophisticated arbitrageurs and thereby disrupt the arbitrage process.
 Consistent with a disruption in the arbitrage process for the
 post-earnings announcement drift anomaly, I document that the historically
 positive autocorrelation in firms’ earnings announcement news has become
 significantly negative for firms with active exchange-traded options. For
 these easy-to-arbitrage firms, the firms in the highest decile of prior
 earnings announcement abnormal return (prior earnings surprise), on
 average, underperform the firms in the lowest decile by 1.59% (1.43%) at
 their next earnings announcement. Additional analyses are consistent with
 investors learning about the post-earnings announcement drift anomaly and
 overcompensating. This study suggests that unsophisticated attempts to
 profit from a well-known anomaly can significantly reverse a previously
 documented stock return pattern.
