Title: Political Incentives to Suppress Negative Information: Evidence from Chinese Listed Firms 
Author-Name: JOSEPH D. PIOTROSKI

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper tests the
 proposition that politicians and their affiliated firms (i.e., firms
 operating in their province) temporarily suppress negative information in
 response to political incentives. We examine the stock price behavior of
 Chinese listed firms around two visible political events—meetings of the
 National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and promotions of
 high-level provincial politicians—that are expected to asymmetrically
 increase the costs of releasing bad news. The costs create an incentive
 for local politicians and their affiliated firms to temporarily restrict
 the flow of negative information about the companies. The result will be
 fewer stock price crashes for the affiliated firms during these event
 windows, followed by an increase in crashes after the event. Consistent
 with these predictions, we find that the affiliated firms experience a
 reduction (an increase) in negative stock return skewness before (after)
 the event. These effects are strongest in the three-month period directly
 preceding the event, among firms that are more politically connected, and
 when the province is dominated by faction politics and cronyism.
 Additional tests document a significant reduction in published newspaper
 articles about affected firms in advance of these political events,
 suggestive of a link between our observed stock price behavior and
 temporary shifts in the listed firms’ information environment.

Title: The Structure of Voluntary Disclosure Narratives: Evidence from Tone Dispersion 
Author-Name: KRISTIAN D. ALLEE  
Author-Name: MATTHEW D. DEANGELIS  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We examine tone
 dispersion, or the degree to which tone words are spread evenly within a
 narrative, to evaluate whether narrative structure provides insight into
 managers’ voluntary disclosures and users’ responses to those disclosures.
 We find that tone dispersion is associated with current aggregate and
 disaggregated performance and future performance, managers’ financial
 reporting decisions, and managers’ incentives and actions to manage
 perceptions. Furthermore, we find that tone dispersion is associated with
 analysts’ and investors’ responses to conference call narratives. Our
 results suggest that tone dispersion both reflects and affects the
 information that managers convey through their narratives.

Title: The Governance Effect of the Media's News Dissemination Role: Evidence from Insider Trading 
Author-Name: LILI DAI  
Author-Name: JERRY T. PARWADA  
Author-Name: BOHUI ZHANG  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We investigate
 whether the media plays a role in corporate governance by disseminating
 news. Using a comprehensive data set of corporate and insider news
 coverage for the 2001–2012 period, we show that the media reduces
 insiders’ future trading profits by disseminating news on prior insiders’
 trades available from regulatory filings. We find support for three
 economic mechanisms underlying the disciplining effect of news
 dissemination: the reduction of information asymmetry, concerns regarding
 litigation risk, and the impact on insiders’ personal wealth and
 reputation. Our findings provide new insights into the real effect of news
 dissemination.

Title: The Role of Social Media in the Capital Market: Evidence from Consumer Product Recalls 
Author-Name: LIAN FEN LEE  
Author-Name: AMY P. HUTTON  
Author-Name: SUSAN SHU  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We examine how
 corporate social media affects the capital market consequences of firms’
 disclosure in the context of consumer product recalls. Product recalls
 constitute a “product crisis” exposing the firm to reputational damage,
 loss of future sales, and legal liability. During such a crisis it is
 crucial for the firm to quickly and directly communicate its intended
 message to a wide network of stakeholders, which, in turn, renders
 corporate social media a potentially useful channel of disclosure. While
 we document that corporate social media, on average, attenuates the
 negative price reaction to recall announcements, the attenuation benefits
 of corporate social media vary with the level of control the firm has over
 its social media content. In particular, with the arrival of Facebook and
 Twitter, firms relinquished complete control over their social media
 content, and the attenuation benefits of corporate social media, while
 still significant, lessened. Detailed Twitter analysis confirms that the
 moderating effect of social media varies with the level of firm
 involvement and with the amount of control exerted by other users: the
 negative price reaction to a recall is attenuated by the frequency of
 tweets by the firm, while exacerbated by the frequency of tweets by other
 users.

Title: The Evolving Disclosure Landscape: How Changes in Technology, the Media, and Capital Markets Are Affecting Disclosure 
Author-Name: GREGORY S. MILLER  
Author-Name: DOUGLAS J. SKINNER  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Recent changes in
 technology and the media are causing significant changes in how capital
 markets assimilate and respond to information. We identify important
 themes in the disclosure literature and use this as a framework to discuss
 the conference papers that appear in this volume. These papers examine how
 managers’ disclosure practices are being affected by changes in
 technology, the media, and capital markets. While this work makes
 important progress, we discuss how continuing technological change and the
 emergence of new forms of media offer further opportunities for research
 on the role of disclosure in capital markets.

Title: Mobile Communication and Local Information Flow: Evidence from Distracted Driving Laws 
Author-Name: NERISSA C. BROWN  
Author-Name: HAN STICE  
Author-Name: ROGER M. WHITE  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We examine the
 influence of mobile communication on local information flow and local
 investor activity using the enforcement of statewide distracted driving
 restrictions, which are exogenous events that constrain mobile
 communication while driving. By restricting mobile communication across a
 potentially sizable set of local individuals, these restrictions could
 inhibit local information flow and, in turn, the market activity of stocks
 headquartered in enforcement states. We first document a decline in Google
 search activity for local stocks when restrictions take effect, suggesting
 that constraints on mobile communication significantly affect individuals’
 information search activity. We further find significant declines in local
 trading volume when restrictions are enforced. This drop in liquidity is
 (1) attenuated when laws provide substitutive means of mobile
 communication and (2) magnified when locals have long car commutes and
 when their daily commutes overlap with regular exchange hours. Moreover,
 trading volume suffers the most for local stocks with lower institutional
 ownership, less analyst coverage, and more intangible information.
 Additional analyses show lower intraday volume during local commute times
 when mobile connectivity is constrained. Together, our results suggest
 that local information and local investors matter in stock markets and
 that mobile communication is an important mechanism through which these
 elements operate to affect liquidity and price discovery.
