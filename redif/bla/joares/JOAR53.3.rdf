Title: Foreign Institutional Ownership and the Global Convergence of Financial Reporting Practices

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper
 investigates whether foreign institutional investors affect the global
 convergence of financial reporting practices. Using several measures of
 reporting convergence, we show that U.S. institutional ownership is
 positively associated with subsequent changes in emerging market firms’
 accounting comparability to their U.S. industry peers. We identify this
 association using an instrumental variable approach that exploits
 exogenous variation in U.S. institutional investment generated by the
 JGTRRA Act of 2003. Further, we provide evidence of a specific
 mechanism—the switch to a Big Four audit firm—through which U.S.
 institutional investors affect reporting convergence. Finally, we show
 that, for emerging market firms, an increase in comparability to U.S.
 firms is associated with an improvement in the properties of foreign
 analysts’ forecasts.

Title: Audit Firm Tenure, Non-Audit Services, and Internal Assessments of Audit Quality 
Author-Name: TIMOTHY B. BELL

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We use data from
 internal assessments of audit quality in a Big 4 firm to investigate the
 impact of audit firm tenure and auditor-provided non-audit services (NAS)
 on audit quality. We find that first-year audits receive lower assessments
 of audit quality and that quality improves shortly thereafter and then
 declines as tenure becomes very long. Partitioning our sample between SEC
 registrants and private clients, we find that the decline in audit quality
 in the long tenure range is attributable to audits of private clients. For
 audits of SEC registrants, the probability of a high quality audit reaches
 its maximum with very long tenure. We also find that audit fees are
 discounted for first-year audits but auditor effort is higher than in
 subsequent years. We find no association, on average, between total NAS
 fees and audit quality in the full sample but observe that total NAS fees
 are positively associated with quality for SEC registrants and negatively
 associated with quality for privately held clients. Our findings are
 important for regulatory policies related to audit firm tenure and
 auditor-provided NAS.

Title: Delayed Expected Loss Recognition and the Risk Profile of Banks 
Author-Name: ROBERT M. BUSHMAN  
Author-Name: CHRISTOPHER D. WILLIAMS  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper
 investigates the extent to which delayed expected loan loss recognition
 (DELR) is associated with greater vulnerability of banks to three distinct
 dimensions of risk: (1) stock market liquidity risk, (2) downside tail
 risk of individual banks, and (3) codependence of downside tail risk among
 banks. We hypothesize that DELR increases vulnerability to downside risk
 by creating expected loss overhangs that threaten future capital adequacy
 and by degrading bank transparency, which increases financing frictions
 and opportunities for risk-shifting. We find that DELR is associated with
 higher correlations between bank-level illiquidity and both aggregate
 banking sector illiquidity and market returns (i.e., higher liquidity
 risks) during recessions, suggesting that high DELR banks as a group may
 simultaneously face elevated financing frictions and enhanced
 opportunities for risk-shifting behavior in crisis periods. With respect
 to downside risk, we find that during recessions DELR is associated with
 significantly higher risk of individual banks suffering severe drops in
 their equity values, where this association is magnified for banks with
 low capital levels. Consistent with increased systemic risk, we find that
 DELR is associated with significantly higher codependence between downside
 risk of individual banks and downside risk of the banking sector. We
 theorize that downside risk vulnerability at the individual bank level can
 translate into systemic risk by virtue of DELR creating a common source of
 risk vulnerability across high DELR banks simultaneously, which leads to
 risk codependence among banks and systemic effects from banks acting as
 part of a herd.

Title: Earnings Metrics, Information Processing, and Price Efficiency in Laboratory Markets 
Author-Name: W. BROOKE ELLIOTT

Author-Name: BRIAN J. WHITE  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>An enduring issue in
 financial reporting is whether and how salient summary measures of firm
 performance (“earnings metrics”) affect market price efficiency. In
 laboratory markets, we test the effects of salient earnings metrics, which
 vary in how they combine persistent and transitory elements, on investor
 information search, beliefs about value, offers to trade, and market price
 efficiency. We find that including transitory elements in salient earnings
 metrics causes traders to search unnecessarily for further information
 about these elements and to overestimate their effect on fundamental value
 relative to a rational benchmark. In contrast, separately displaying
 persistent elements in earnings increases the accuracy of traders’ value
 estimates. Prices generally reflect traders’ beliefs about value, and
 prices are most efficient when transitory elements are excluded from
 earnings metrics entirely. Our study contributes to research on salience
 effects in financial reporting by showing that including transitory
 elements in salient earnings metrics causes inefficient information search
 and biased beliefs about value that can aggregate to affect market prices.
 We also contribute to research in experimental markets by showing that
 redundant disclosure is not always beneficial; redundant disclosure of
 transitory earnings elements, in particular, appears to have negative
 consequences for investor behavior and market efficiency.
