Title: Taxes and Financial Constraints: Evidence from Linguistic Cues 
Author-Name: KELVIN K. F. LAW  
Author-Name: LILLIAN F. MILLS  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Using a new measure
 of financial constraints based on firms’ qualitative disclosures, we find
 that financially constrained firms—firms that use more negative words in
 their annual reports—pursue more aggressive tax planning strategies as
 evidenced by: (1) higher current and future unrecognized tax benefits, (2)
 lower short- and long-run current and future effective tax rates, (3)
 increase in tax haven usage for their material operations, and (4) higher
 proposed audit adjustments from the Internal Revenue Service. We exploit
 the unexpected closures of local banks as exogenous liquidity shocks to
 show that firms’ external financial constraints affect their tax avoidance
 strategies. Overall, the linguistic cues in firms’ qualitative disclosures
 provide incremental information beyond traditional accounting variables or
 commonly used effective tax rates to reveal and predict tax
 aggressiveness, both contemporaneously and in the future.

Title: Do Improvements in the Information Environment Enhance Insiders’ Ability to Learn from Outsiders? 
Author-Name: GILBERTO LOUREIRO  
Author-Name: ALVARO G. TABOADA  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We examine whether
 and how an exogenous shock to the information environment changes
 insiders’ ability to learn from outsiders. We document three main
 findings. First, we find an increase in investment-to-price sensitivity
 following the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards
 (IFRS). Second, we show that the relation between the market reaction to
 M&A deal announcements and the likelihood of deal completion becomes
 stronger after IFRS adoption. Third, we find significant improvements in
 post-acquisition operating and stock return performance post-IFRS
 adoption. These results are more pronounced for firms that experienced
 significant increases in foreign institutional ownership around IFRS
 adoption, especially when these foreign investors are from countries that
 matter for the firm’s growth opportunities. Taken together, our findings
 suggest that insiders’ ability to learn from outsiders improves post-IFRS,
 and this improved ability to learn from outsiders leads to real economic
 gains.

Title: Do Analyst Stock Recommendations Piggyback on Recent Corporate News? An Analysis of Regular-Hour and After-Hours Revisions 
Author-Name: EDWARD XUEJUN LI

Author-Name: JOANNA SHUANG WU  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Analysts often update
 their recommendations following corporate news. Questions have been raised
 regarding analysts’ ability to generate new information beyond recent
 corporate events. Employing a comprehensive database on corporate news, we
 show that only a small minority, or 27.9%, of all recommendation revisions
 directionally confirm the information in the preceding corporate events
 and even these “confirming revisions” facilitate the information discovery
 of corporate events and thus cannot simply be dismissed as “piggybacking.”
 Our analysis further shows that analysts not only facilitate price
 discovery to corporate news through issuing trending revisions but also
 help reverse prevailing market sentiments following corporate news by
 issuing contrarian revisions. Our study is the first to investigate
 short-window intraday market reactions to revisions issued after hours,
 which account for 70% of all recommendation revisions in our sample
 period. Analysts’ incentives to issue revisions after hours appear to
 reflect demands from large institutional clients, who dominate after-hours
 trading. More importantly, we show that the after-hours revisions are
 associated with significantly greater price reactions and different price
 reaction patterns than revisions issued during regular trading hours.
 Collectively, our evidence indicates that analysts are a significant
 source of new information beyond recent corporate news and they also help
 shape the market's assessment of corporate disclosures.

Title: Competition in the Audit Market: Policy Implications 
Author-Name: JOSEPH GERAKOS  
Author-Name: CHAD SYVERSON  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>The audit market's
 unique combination of features—its role in capital market transparency,
 mandated demand, and concentrated supply—means it receives considerable
 attention from policy makers. We explore the effects of two market
 scenarios that have been the focus of policy discussions: mandatory audit
 firm rotation and further supply concentration due to the exit of a “Big
 4” audit firm. To do so, we first estimate publicly traded firms' demand
 for auditing services, allowing the services provided by each of the Big 4
 to be differentiated products. We then use those estimates to calculate
 how each scenario would affect client firms' consumer surplus. We estimate
 that, for U.S. publicly trade firms, mandatory audit firm rotation would
 induce consumer surplus losses of approximately $2.7 billion if rotation
 were required after 10 years and $4.7–5.0 billion if after only four
 years. We find similarly that exit by one of the Big 4 would reduce client
 firms' surplus by $1.4–1.8 billion. These estimates reflect only the value
 of firms' lost options to hire the exiting audit firm; they do not include
 likely fee increases resulting from less competition among audit firms.
 The latter could result in audit fee increases between $0.75–1.3 billion
 per year for mandatory rotation and $0.47–0.58 billion per year for the
 disappearance of a Big 4 audit firm. Such losses are substantial; by
 comparison, total audit fees for public firms were $11 billion in 2010.

Title: Segment Disclosure Transparency and Internal Capital Market Efficiency: Evidence from SFAS No. 131 
Author-Name: YOUNG JUN CHO  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Using the adoption of
 SFAS 131, I examine the effect of segment disclosure transparency on
 internal capital market efficiency. SFAS 131 requires firms to define
 segments as internally viewed by managers, thereby improving the
 transparency of managerial actions in internal capital allocation. I find
 that diversified firms that improved segment disclosure transparency by
 changing segment definitions upon adoption of SFAS 131 experienced an
 improvement in capital allocation efficiency in internal capital markets
 after the adoption of SFAS 131. In addition, I find that the improvement
 in internal capital market efficiency was greater for firms that suffered
 more severe agency problems before the adoption of SFAS 131 and also for
 firms whose managers faced stronger incentives to improve efficiency after
 the adoption of SFAS 131. My results suggest that more transparent segment
 information can help resolve agency conflicts in the internal capital
 markets of diversified firms, thus improving investment efficiency.

Title: Are Employee Selection and Incentive Contracts Complements or Substitutes? 
Author-Name: MARGARET A. ABERNETHY  
Author-Name: HENRI C. DEKKER  
Author-Name: AXEL K-D. SCHULZ  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>There is a debate in
 the literature as to whether employee selection is a substitute or
 complement to incentive contracting. We argue that incentive contracts and
 selection can be both complements and substitutes conditional on the
 contracting difficulty faced by the firm. We examine these control choices
 in a setting where contracting difficulties arise due to the firm's choice
 of strategy and from the volatility created by the firm's external
 environment. We select a firm's commitment to organizational learning (OL)
 as our strategic choice variable as this provides a useful proxy for
 identifying settings where explicit incentive contracting is difficult.
 The results show that, as firms become increasingly committed to OL,
 incentive contracts and employee selection operate as complements.
 However, with a high commitment to OL and an increasing level of external
 volatility, contracting on performance measures will become less
 effective. In this context, our results indicate that there is a
 substitution effect toward employee selection.
