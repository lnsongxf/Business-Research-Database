Title: Issuer Operating Performance and IPO Price Formation 
Author-Name: MICHAEL WILLENBORG

Author-Name: YANHUA SUNNY YANG  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We study the relation
 between issuer operating performance and initial public offering (IPO)
 price formation from the initial price range to the offer price to the
 closing price on the first trading day. For a post-bubble sample of
 2001–2013 IPOs, we find that pre-IPO net income and, in particular,
 operating cash flow are strongly, positively associated with the revision
 from the mid-point of the initial price range to the offer price and that
 the “partial adjustment phenomenon” concentrates among issuers with the
 strongest operating performance. As for why publicly observable
 information helps predict changes in valuation from when the initial price
 range is set to when the offer price is set, our findings suggest that
 strong-performing issuers, especially those offering small slices of
 ownership, have lower bargaining incentives and are susceptible to the
 underwriter(s) low-balling the price range. Overall, our results suggest
 an important role for accounting information in understanding the pricing
 of book-built IPOs and are consistent with the presence of agency problems
 between issuers and underwriters. <p>  </p>

Title: The Moderating Effect of Relative Performance Evaluation on the Risk Incentive Properties of Executives’ Equity Portfolios 
Author-Name: HYUNGSHIN PARK  
Author-Name: DIMITRIS VRETTOS  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We offer evidence
 that the use of relative performance evaluation (RPE) in CEOs’ incentive
 contracts influences the effect of risk-taking incentives on both the
 magnitude and composition of firm risk. We find that, when the incentive
 design lacks RPE features, the incentive portfolio vega motivates CEOs to
 increase total risk through the systematic component because it can be
 hedged. In contrast, when the incentive design includes RPE features, CEOs
 prefer idiosyncratic risk because RPE filters out the systematic component
 of firm performance. We also document that the use of RPE reinforces the
 incentive portfolio vega's effect on the total risk.

Title: Think Twice Before Going for Incentives: Social Norms and the Principal's Decision on Compensation Contracts 
Author-Name: EDDY CARDINAELS  
Author-Name: HUAXIANG YIN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Principals make
 decisions on various issues, ranging from contract design to control
 system implementation. Few studies examine the principal's active role in
 these decisions. We experimentally investigate this role by studying how a
 principal's choice of an incentive contract that may discourage
 misrepresentation, compared to a fixed-salary contract, affects the
 honesty of his or her agents’ cost reporting. Results show that, besides
 an incentive effect and a principal trust effect, the active choice for
 incentives produces a negative “information leakage” effect. When
 principals use incentives, their choices not only incentivize truthful
 reporting and signal distrust, but they also leak important information
 about the social norm, namely, that other agents are likely to report
 dishonestly. Agents conform to this social norm by misrepresenting cost
 information more. Our results have important practical implications.
 Managers must recognize that their decisions can leak information to their
 agents, which may produce unanticipated consequences for the social norms
 of the organization.

Title: A New Measure of Disclosure Quality: The Level of Disaggregation of Accounting Data in Annual Reports 
Author-Name: SHUPING CHEN  
Author-Name: BIN MIAO  
Author-Name: TERRY SHEVLIN  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We construct a new,
 parsimonious, measure of disclosure quality—disaggregation quality
 (DQ)—and offer validation tests. DQ captures the level of disaggregation
 of accounting data through a count of nonmissing Compustat line items, and
 reflects the extent of details in firms’ annual reports. Conceptually, DQ
 differs from existing disclosure measures in that it captures the
 “fineness” of data and is based on a comprehensive set of accounting line
 items in annual reports. Unlike existing measures, which are usually
 applicable for a subset of firms or are based on a subset of information
 items, DQ can be generated for the universe of Compustat industrial firms.
 We conduct three sets of validation tests by examining DQ's association
 with variables predicted by prior literature to be associated with
 information quality. DQ is negatively (positively) associated with analyst
 forecast dispersion (accuracy) and negatively associated with bid-ask
 spreads and cost of equity. These associations continue to hold after we
 control for firm fundamentals. Taken together, results from this battery
 of validation tests are consistent with our measure capturing disclosure
 quality.

Title: Contractibility and Transparency of Financial Statement Information Prepared Under IFRS: Evidence from Debt Contracts Around IFRS Adoption 
Author-Name: RAY BALL  
Author-Name: XI LI  
Author-Name: LAKSHMANAN SHIVAKUMAR  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We outline several
 properties of IFRS that potentially affect the contractibility or the
 transparency of financial statement information, and hence the use of that
 information in debt contracts. Those properties include the increased
 choice among accounting rules IFRS gives to managers, enhanced rule-making
 uncertainty, and increased emphasis on fair value accounting. Consistent
 with reduced contractibility of IFRS financial statement information, we
 find a significant reduction in accounting-based debt covenants following
 mandatory IFRS adoption. The reduction in accounting covenant use is
 associated with measures of the difference between prior domestic
 standards and IFRS. Because IFRS adoption changed financial reporting in
 many ways simultaneously, it is difficult to trace the decline in
 accounting covenant use to individual IFRS properties, though we report
 larger declines in accounting covenant use in banks, which have a higher
 proportion of assets and liabilities that are fair-valued. Our findings
 are better explained by reduced contractibility than by increased
 transparency, which would predict reduced nonaccounting covenant use as
 well, whereas we observe increases. Overall, we conclude that IFRS rules
 sacrifice debt contracting usefulness to achieve other objectives, such as
 provision of accounting information relevant to valuation.

Title: Asset Measurement in Imperfect Credit Markets 
Author-Name: JEREMY BERTOMEU  
Author-Name: EDWIGE CHEYNEL  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>How should a firm
 measure a productive asset used as collateral? To answer this question, we
 develop a model in which firms borrow funds subject to collateral
 constraints. We characterize the qualities of optimal asset measurements
 and analyze their interactions with financing needs, collateral
 constraints, and interest rates. Because of real effects, complete
 transparency would reduce contracting efficiency and, hence, the
 measurement must be suitably adapted to credit conditions. The optimal
 measurement is asymmetric and reports precise information about high
 collateral values if credit frictions are low, but the reverse if credit
 frictions are high. Tighter credit market conditions may lead to more
 opaque measurements and increased investment, in the form of inefficient
 continuations.
