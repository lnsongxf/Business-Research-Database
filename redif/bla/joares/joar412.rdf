Title: The Impact of SFAS No. 131 on Information and Monitoring 
Abstract:
 We investigate the effect of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's
 (FASB) new segment reporting standard on the information and monitoring
 environment. We compare hand-collected, restated SFAS 131 segment data for
 the final SFAS 14 fiscal year with the historical SFAS 14 data. We find
 that SFAS 131 increased the number of reported segments and provided more
 disaggregated information. Analysts and the market had access to a portion
 of the new segment information before it was made public, but analyst and
 market expectations were still altered by the mandated release of the new
 data. By increasing information disaggregation, the new standard induced
 firms to reveal previously "hidden" information about their
 diversification strategies. The newly revealed information affected market
 valuations and lead to changes in firm behavior consistent with improved
 monitoring following adoption of SFAS 131. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2003.

Title: Disclosure Practices, Enforcement of Accounting Standards, and Analysts' Forecast Accuracy: An International Study 
Abstract:
 Using a sample from 22 countries, I investigate the relations between the
 accuracy of analysts' earnings forecasts and the level of annual report
 disclosure, and between forecast accuracy and the degree of enforcement of
 accounting standards. I document that firm-level disclosures are
 positively related to forecast accuracy, suggesting that such disclosures
 provide useful information to analysts. I construct a comprehensive
 measure of enforcement and find that strong enforcement is associated with
 higher forecast accuracy. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis
 that enforcement encourages managers to follow prescribed accounting
 rules, which, in turn, reduces analysts' uncertainty about future
 earnings. I also find evidence consistent with disclosures being more
 important when analyst following is low and with enforcement being more
 important when more choice among accounting methods is allowed. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2003.

Title: Privacy in E-Commerce: Development of Reporting Standards, Disclosure, and Assurance Services in an Unregulated Market 
Abstract:
 Government regulation of financial reporting by publicly listed firms,
 coupled with a punitive regime for violation of generally accepted
 accounting principles (GAAP), has been in place in the United States for
 seven decades. Whether this regime is effective or useful is an open
 question, especially in the absence of data on the behavior of unregulated
 economies. Privacy disclosure in e-commerce is essentially an unregulated
 environment with some parallels to financial disclosure. A study of
 privacy standards, disclosures practices, and demand for audits can help
 accountants and security regulators project the consequences of a
 competitive regime sans regulation for accounting standards, disclosure
 and audit practices. In this article we set up a framework for such a
 study, gather data from the field, and analyze privacy standards, privacy
 disclosure practices, and the effectiveness of opt-out practices of 100
 high-traffic e-commerce Web sites. We observe four diverse sets of privacy
 standards (TRUSTe, BBB Online, WebTrust, and PWC Privacy) competing in
 this market, attracting clienteles of their own as reflected in privacy
 policies and the disclosure of such policies. With a few exceptions,
 actual disclosure and opt-out practices correspond reasonably well to
 stated policies in e-commerce. There is little evidence that the
 prevailing competitive regime induces a race to the bottom with respect to
 privacy standards and disclosures. We explore the implications of these
 results for the consequences of a competitive regime for regulation of
 financial reporting. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2003.

Title: ADRs, Analysts, and Accuracy: Does Cross Listing in the United States Improve a Firm's Information Environment and Increase Market Value? 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the relation between cross listing in the United
 States and the information environment of non-U.S. firms. We find that
 firms that cross list on U.S. exchanges have greater analyst coverage and
 increased forecast accuracy than firms that are not cross listed. A
 time-series analysis shows that a change in analyst coverage and forecast
 accuracy occurs around cross listing. We also document that firms that
 have more analyst coverage and higher forecast accuracy have higher
 valuations. Furthermore, the change in firm value around cross listing is
 correlated with changes in analyst following and forecast accuracy,
 suggesting that cross listing enhances firm value through its effect on
 the firm's information environment. Our findings support the hypothesis
 that cross-listed firms have better information environments, which are
 associated with higher market valuations. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2003.

Title: Discussion of ADRs, Analysts, and Accuracy: Does Cross-Listing in the United States Improve a Firm's Information Environment and Increase Market Value? 
Abstract:
 Lang, Lins, and Miller [2002] investigate the relation between
 cross-listing in the United States and information intermediation by
 analysts. The results suggest that cross-listing in the United States
 increases analyst following and forecast accuracy and that both variables
 are associated with Tobin's "Q". These findings are interesting and
 advance the cross-listing literature in several ways. This discussion
 raises two issues. First, I highlight that the sources of cross-listing
 effects are not obvious and are difficult to disentangle. To illustrate
 this point, I replicate the analysis using cross-listed Canadian firms,
 for which mandated disclosures are held constant. Thus, if disclosure
 effects are important for documented cross-listing effects, I expect to
 find no relation in the Canadian sample. The findings for forecast
 accuracy are consistent with this hypothesis. However, analyst following
 continues to be significantly higher for cross-listed Canadian firms.
 These findings suggest that the sources of cross-listing effects differ
 for analyst coverage and forecast accuracy. Second, I discuss the link
 between analyst variables, firm value, and cost of capital. As they are
 only tenuously related, I draw attention to some unresolved questions and
 areas for future research. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2003.

Title: How Representative Are Firms That Are Cross-Listed in the United States? An Analysis of Accounting Quality 
Abstract:
 We provide evidence on the characteristics of local generally accepted
 accounting principles (GAAP) earnings for firms cross-listing on U.S.
 exchanges relative to a matched sample of foreign firms currently not
 cross-listing in the United States to investigate whether U.S. listing is
 associated with differences in accounting data reported in local markets.
 We find that cross-listed firms differ in terms of the time-series
 properties of earnings and accruals, and the degree of association between
 accounting data and share prices. Cross-listed firms appear to be less
 aggressive in terms of earnings management and report accounting data that
 are more conservative, take account of bad news in a more timely manner,
 and are more strongly associated with share price. Furthermore, the
 differences appear to result partially from changes around cross-listing
 and partially from differences in accounting quality before listing. We do
 not observe a similar pattern for firms cross-listed on other non-U.S.
 exchanges or on the U.S. over-the-counter market, suggesting a unique
 quality to cross-listing on U.S. exchanges. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2003.

Title: Enforceable Accounting Rules and Income Measurement by Early 20th Century Railroads 
Abstract:
 We investigate the extent to which income measurement by major early
 20th-century U.S. railroads shows evidence of lower income smoothness and
 increased conservatism following new fixed asset accounting rules issued
 by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1907 and 1908 and
 concurrent rate regulation regime shifts. Accounting rules promulgated by
 the ICC after the Hepburn Act of 1906 are the first accounting rules in
 U.S. history in which regulators could enforce such rules under federal
 law to increase compliance. Our samplewide results are more consistent
 with increased conservatism than with income smoothing. Additional tests
 indicate these effects are more pronounced for firms subject to more
 intense rate regulation by the ICC, which suggests that the tie-in between
 accounting regulation and product/service market regulation influences how
 managers respond to new accounting rules. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2003.
