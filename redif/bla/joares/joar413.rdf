Title: IAS Versus U.S. GAAP: Information Asymmetry-Based Evidence from Germany's New Market 
Abstract:
 Motivated by the debate about globally uniform accounting standards, this
 study investigates whether firms using U.S. generally accepted accounting
 principles (GAAP) vis-à-vis international accounting standards (IAS)
 exhibit differences in several proxies for information asymmetry. It
 exploits a unique setting in which the two sets of standards are put on a
 level playing field. Firms trading in Germany's New Market must choose
 between IAS and U.S. GAAP for financial reporting, but face the same
 regulatory environment otherwise. Thus, institutional factors such as
 listing requirements, market microstructure, and standards enforcement are
 held constant. In this setting, differences in the bid-ask spread and
 share turnover between IAS and U.S. GAAP firms are statistically
 insignificant and economically small. Subsequent analyses of analysts'
 forecast dispersion, initial public offering underpricing, and firms'
 standard choices corroborate these findings. Thus, at least for New Market
 firms, the choice between IAS and U.S. GAAP appears to be of little
 consequence for information asymmetry and market liquidity. These findings
 do not support widespread claims that U.S. GAAP produce financial
 statements of higher informational quality than IAS. Copyright 2003 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago..

Title: Activity-Based Pricing in a Monopoly 
Abstract:
 In this article, I study the interaction between cost accounting systems
 and pricing decisions in a setting where a monopolist sells a base product
 and related support services to customers whose preference for support
 services is known only to them. I consider two pricing
 mechanisms-activity-based pricing (ABP) and traditional pricing-and two
 cost-accounting systems-activity-based costing (ABC) and traditional
 costing, for support services. Under traditional pricing, only the base
 product is priced, whereas support services are provided free because
 detailed cost-driver volume information on the consumption of support
 services by each customer is unavailable. Under ABP, customers pay based
 on the quantities consumed of both the base product and the support
 services because detailed cost-driver volume information is available for
 each customer. Likewise, under traditional costing for support services
 the firm makes pricing decisions on cost signals that are noisier than
 they are under ABC. I compare the equilibrium quantities of the base
 product and support services sold, the information rent paid to the
 customers, and the expected profits of the monopolist under all four
 combinations of cost-driver volume and cost-driver rate information. Copyright 2003 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago..

Title: Confidence and Investors' Reliance on Disciplined Trading Strategies 
Abstract:
 Researchers and practitioners in accounting and finance often investigate
 or advocate particular disciplined trading strategies, but little work
 investigates the determinants of individual investors' trading-strategy
 reliance. We report two experiments, which provide evidence that the
 dual-source model of overconfidence (Sniezek and Buckley [1991]) predicts
 the circumstances in which investors are more likely to rely on
 disciplined trading strategies. Our results indicate that reliance is more
 likely when investors trade portfolios of securities rather than trading
 on a case-by-case basis, particularly when investors have received
 feedback that their previous (unaided) trading decisions have been
 unprofitable. These results are driven by the number of shares that
 investors transact rather than by investors' directional agreement with
 the recommendations of the trading strategy, suggesting that the effects
 of a portfolio approach and trading experience occur by mitigating
 investors' overconfidence. The effects violate an aspect of economic
 rationality because our experiments ensure that investors in all
 conditions trade the same set of securities based on the same set of
 information. Copyright 2003 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago..

Title: The Relation Between Insider-Trading Restrictions and Executive Compensation 
Abstract:
 In this study I investigate the relation between firm-level
 insider-trading restrictions and executive compensation. Using a
 trading-window proxy for the existence of such restrictions, I test
 predictions that insiders will demand compensation for these restrictions
 and that firms will need to increase incentives to restricted insiders. I
 find that firms that restrict insider trading pay a premium in total
 compensation relative to firms not restricting insider trading, after
 controlling for economic determinants of pay. Furthermore, these firms use
 more incentive-based compensation and their insiders hold larger equity
 incentives relative to firms that do not restrict insider trading. These
 results hold after controlling for the endogenous decision to restrict
 insiders and are consistent with the notion that insider trading plays a
 role in rewarding and motivating executives. Copyright 2003 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago..

Title: Financial Reporting Environments and International Capital Mobility 
Abstract:
 We examine whether differences in international capital mobility across
 countries are related to country-specific differences in financial
 reporting environments. We hypothesize that countries where financial
 accounting environments lead to greater disclosure of value-relevant
 accounting information are more likely to have higher international
 capital mobility. The results of empirical tests are consistent with our
 hypothesis. Copyright 2003 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago..
