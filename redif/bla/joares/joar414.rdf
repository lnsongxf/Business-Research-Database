Title: Market Effects of Recognition and Disclosure 
Abstract:
 Our recognition and disclosure model reveals that price informativeness is
 determined by the interaction of the qualities of three information
 sources-the recognized amount, the disclosed information, and the
 information revealed by price-and accounting expertise acquisition. It
 also reveals that recognition of an accounting amount alters each of
 these, thereby affecting price informativeness. Perhaps surprisingly, we
 find that recognition of a highly unreliable accounting amount, rather
 than simply disclosing it, can result in greater price informativeness.
 Likewise, recognition of a highly reliable amount can result in lower
 price informativeness. Our findings suggest that, because of the effects
 of aggregation, basing recognition decisions on reliability alone is too
 simplistic. Reliability relative to relevance is key, not reliability per
 se. We also find that recognition and disclosure affect the coefficients
 in a regression of price on accounting amounts. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2003.

Title: Capital Gains Taxes and Equity Trading: Empirical Evidence 
Abstract:
 Individual investors have an incentive to defer selling appreciated stock
 until it qualifies for tax-favored, long-term capital gains treatment.
 Shackelford and Verrecchia [2002] show that these incentives can affect
 equity trading around public disclosures. This article provides some
 empirical support for their theory with evidence of price increases and
 equity constrictions around announcements of quarterly earnings and
 additions to the S&P 500 index. We find share returns rise and trading
 volume falls with the incremental taxes saved by deferring the sale of
 appreciated property. The price increases, however, are temporary,
 reversing in subsequent trading days. The results are consistent with
 buyers believing the compensation to sell before long-term qualification
 (through higher prices) is less costly than holding an inappropriately
 weighted portfolio. This finding-that personal capital gains taxes affect
 equity trading-adds to a growing literature that challenges longstanding
 assumptions that firm value is independent of shareholders and their
 taxes. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2003.

Title: Confirming Management Earnings Forecasts, Earnings Uncertainty, and Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 In this study we examine the association among confirming management
 forecasts, stock prices, and analyst expectations. Confirming management
 forecasts are voluntary disclosures by management that corroborate
 existing market expectations about future earnings. This study provides
 evidence that these voluntary disclosures affect stock prices and the
 dispersion of analyst expectations. Specifically, we find that the
 market's reaction to confirming forecasts is significantly positive,
 indicating that benefits accrue to firms that disclose such forecasts. In
 addition, although we find no significant change in the mean consensus
 forecasts (a proxy for earnings expectations) around the confirming
 forecast date, evidence indicates a significant reduction in the mean and
 median consensus analyst dispersion (a proxy for earnings uncertainty).
 Finally, we document a positive association between the reduction of
 dispersion of analysts' forecasts and the magnitude of the stock market
 response. Overall, the evidence suggests that confirming forecasts reduce
 uncertainty about future earnings and that investors price this reduction
 of uncertainty. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2003.

Title: Do Expert Informational Intermediaries Add Value? Evidence from Auditors in Microcap Initial Public Offerings 
Abstract:
 Do expert informational intermediaries add value? We address this question
 by examining the informativeness of the audit report contained in the
 prospectus associated with a firm's initial public offering (IPO). At the
 time of the IPO, there is a relative lack of information to facilitate the
 establishment of equity values, suggesting that the information provided
 by outside "experts" (e.g., auditors, underwriters) is particularly
 important. In this article we study small, non-venture-backed IPOs, a
 segment of the market with the poorest long-run performance and where the
 prestigious audit firm is often the sole (if any) expert present. We find
 that the pre-IPO opinions of larger auditors are more predictive of
 post-IPO negative stock delistings. Of particular note, the opinions of
 the national-tiered firms are comparably predictive to those of the Big 6,
 though this finding emerges only after we consider the selectivity-based
 differences in the clients that hire these national firms. Our findings
 also indicate that, for larger auditors the presence of a pre-IPO
 going-concern opinion is more strongly associated with first-year stock
 returns and that larger auditors are more likely to give such opinions to
 their distressed clients. Overall, we address a deficiency in the
 literature relating to "the paucity of evidence on the value of auditor
 opinions to investors" (Healy and Palepu [ 2001 p. 415]). Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2003.

Title: Evidence on the Joint Determination of Audit and Non-Audit Fees 
Abstract:
 In this study we investigate whether the characteristics of clients,
 auditors, and the auditor-client relationship simultaneously determine
 audit and non-audit fees. As done in prior studies, we maintain that fees
 proxy for the level of service provided and follow the physical flow of
 knowledge. Estimating single-equation models of audit and non-audit fee
 models, we confirm prior findings of an association between audit and
 non-audit fees. Studies conclude that such evidence is consistent with
 knowledge spillovers between the two services. However, we document
 empirically that audit and non-audit fees are simultaneously determined.
 Because the data indicate audit and non-audit fees are jointly determined,
 we then investigate whether previously documented associations between
 audit and non-audit fees are the result of biased estimation induced by
 using endogenous variables in single-equation models. In contrast to
 results from single-equation estimations, we find no association between
 audit and non-audit fees using a simultaneous specification of the fee
 system, suggesting that single-equation estimations suffer from
 simultaneous-equations bias. In sum, the findings are not consistent with
 the existence of economies of scope from the joint performance of audit
 and non-audit services after controlling for the joint behavior of audit
 and non-audit fees. Given the ongoing debate over the level of allowed
 non-audit services by auditors, the argument for the joint provision of
 audit and non-audit services is less justified than if joint-supply
 benefits had been documented. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2003.
