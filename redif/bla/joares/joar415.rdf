Title: What's My Line? A Comparison of Industry Classification Schemes for Capital Market Research 
Abstract:
 This study compares four broadly available industry classification schemes
 in a variety of applications common to capital market research. Standard
 Industrial Classification (SIC) codes have been available since 1939 but
 are being replaced by North American Industry Classification System
 (NAICS) codes. The Global Industry Classifications Standard
 (GICS)-super-SM system, jointly developed by Standard & Poor's and Morgan
 Stanley Capital International (MSCI), is popular among financial
 practitioners, whereas the Fama and French [1997] algorithm is used
 primarily by academics. Our results show that GICS classifications are
 significantly better at explaining stock return comovements, as well as
 cross-sectional variations in valuation multiples, forecasted and realized
 growth rates, research and development expenditures, and various key
 financial ratios. The GICS advantage is consistent from year to year and
 is most pronounced among large firms. The other three methods differ
 little from each other in most applications. Copyright 2003 Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.

Title: Cooperation in the Budgeting Process 
Abstract:
 In this article I analyze the role of cooperation between firm divisions
 in the budgeting process. I study a setting in which cooperation is a
 necessary condition for information sharing among division managers, which
 in turn benefits the principal. The results in this article can help
 reconcile the differing views between practitioners and academic
 researchers on the desirability of cooperation in the budgeting process.
 The results also have implications for some common budgeting processes
 observed in practice, including bundling budgeting and bottom-up
 budgeting. Copyright 2003 Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.

Title: Does Greater Firm-Specific Return Variation Mean More or Less Informed Stock Pricing? 
Abstract:
 Roll [1988] observes low "R"-super-2 statistics for common asset pricing
 models due to vigorous firm-specific return variation not associated with
 public information. He concludes that this implies "either private
 information or else occasional frenzy unrelated to concrete
 information"[p. 56]. We show that firms and industries with lower market
 model "R"-super-2 statistics exhibit higher association between current
 returns and future earnings, indicating more information about future
 earnings in current stock returns. This supports Roll's first
 interpretation: higher firm-specific return variation as a fraction of
 total variation signals more information-laden stock prices and,
 therefore, more efficient stock markets. Copyright 2003 Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.

Title: Leading Indicator Variables, Performance Measurement, and Long-Term Versus Short-Term Contracts 
Abstract:
 In this article we develop a multiperiod agency model to study the role of
 leading indicator variables in managerial performance measures. In
 addition to the familiar moral hazard problem, the principal faces the
 task of motivating a manager to undertake "soft" investments. These
 investments are not directly contractible, but the principal can instead
 rely on leading indicator variables that provide a noisy forecast of the
 investment returns to be received in future periods. Our analysis relates
 the role of leading indicator variables to the duration of the manager's
 incentive contract. With short-term contracts, leading indicator variables
 are essential in mitigating a holdup problem resulting from the fact that
 investments are sunk at the end of the first period. With long-term
 contracts, leading indicator variables will be valuable if the manager's
 compensation schemes are not stationary over time. The leading indicator
 variables then become an instrument for matching the future investment
 return with the current investment expenditure. We identify conditions
 under which the optimal long-term contract induces larger investments and
 less reliance on the leading indicator variables as compared with
 short-term contracts. Under certain conditions, though, the principal does
 better with a sequence of one-period contracts than with a long-term
 contract. Copyright 2003 Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.

Title: The Role of Supplementary Statements with Management Earnings Forecasts 
Abstract:
 We investigate managers' decisions to supplement their firms' management
 earnings forecasts. We classify these supplementary disclosures as
 qualitative "soft talk" disclosures or verifiable forward-looking
 statements. We find that managers provide soft talk disclosures with
 similar frequency for good and bad news forecasts but are more likely to
 supplement good news forecasts with verifiable forward-looking statements.
 We examine the market response to these forecasts and find that bad news
 earnings forecasts are always informative but that good news forecasts are
 informative only when supplemented by verifiable forward-looking
 statements, supporting our argument that these statements bolster the
 credibility of good news forecasts. Copyright 2003 Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.
