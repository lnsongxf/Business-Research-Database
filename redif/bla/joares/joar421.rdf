Title: Why Do Managers Explain Their Earnings Forecasts? 
Abstract:
 Managers often explain their earnings forecasts by linking forecasted
 performance to their internal actions and the actions of parties external
 to the firm. These attributions potentially aid investors in the
 interpretation of management forecasts by confirming known relationships
 between attributions and profitability or by identifying additional causes
 that investors should consider when forecasting earnings. We investigate
 why managers choose to provide attributions with their forecasts and
 whether the attributions are related to security price reactions to
 management earnings forecasts. Using a sample of 951 management earnings
 forecasts issued from 1993 to 1996, we find that attributions are more
 likely for larger firms, less likely for firms in regulated industries,
 less likely for forecasts issued over longer horizons, more likely for bad
 news forecasts, and more likely for forecasts that are maximum type.
 Furthermore, attributions are associated with greater absolute price
 reactions to management forecasts, more negative price reactions to
 management forecasts (forecast news held constant), and a greater price
 reaction per dollar of unexpected earnings. Our findings hold after
 control for the aforementioned determinants of attributions and after
 control for other firm- and forecast-specific variables that are often
 associated with security prices. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.

Title: Efficient Manipulation in a Repeated Setting 
Abstract:
 We analyze the optimal behavior of an organization when its employees can
 manipulate the organization's accounting system to their private
 advantage. We find that the organization may benefit by helping its
 employees manipulate the system. This help can reduce the employees'
 private returns from devoting effort to further manipulation of the
 accounting system, which reduces the cost of motivating the employees to
 devote their effort to improving the real (rather than the measured)
 performance of the organization. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.

Title: Reliability-Relevance Trade-Offs and the Efficiency of Aggregation 
Abstract:
 This paper studies how an accountant's method of aggregating information
 in a financial report is affected by differences in the reliability and
 relevance of components of the report. We study a firm that hires an
 accountant to produce a report that reveals information to investors
 regarding the returns to the firm's past investments. In constructing the
 report, the accountant must combine information elicited from the firm's
 manager with other information directly observable to the accountant. The
 manager's information is assumed to be directly observable only by the
 manager and to be of superior quality to the other information available
 to the accountant. Reliability-relevance trade-offs arise because as the
 accountant places more weight on the manager's report, potentially more
 useful information gets included in the report, at the cost of encouraging
 the manager to distort his or her information to a greater extent. Capital
 market participants anticipate this behavior and price the firm
 accordingly. We show how the market's price response to the release of the
 firm's aggregate report, the efficiency of the firm's investment
 decisions, and the manager's incentives to manipulate the soft information
 under his or her control are all affected by-and affect-the aggregation
 procedure the accountant adopts. In addition, we identify a broad range of
 circumstances under which aggregated reports are strictly more efficient
 than disaggregated reports because aggregation tempers the manager's
 misreporting incentives. We also demonstrate that, as any given component
 of the aggregated accounting report becomes softer, the equilibrium level
 of the firm's investment diminishes and the market places greater weight
 on the remaining components of the report. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.

Title: Should Intangibles Be Measured: What Are the Economic Trade-Offs? 
Abstract:
 We investigate whether a firm's intangible investments should be measured
 and separated from operating expenses. We find that the information
 extracted from accounting reports of investments and earnings is different
 when intangibles are measured and identified separately from operating
 expenses than when intangibles are left commingled with operating
 expenses. This difference in the market's information causes a change in
 the behavior of market prices, inducing changes in the firm's investments
 and cash flows. Thus, from a "real effects" perspective, measuring
 intangibles is not unambiguously desirable. We identify the conditions
 under which providing information on intangibles may be desirable. This
 study also shows the inadequacy of statistical associations between
 accounting numbers and prices as a basis for evaluating the desirability
 of measuring intangible investments. We show that the measurement of
 intangibles alters the very distribution of cash flows about which the
 measurement regime is seeking to provide information. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.
