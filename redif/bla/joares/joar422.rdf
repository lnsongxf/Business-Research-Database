Title: Firms' Voluntary Recognition of Stock-Based Compensation Expense 
Abstract:
 We investigate factors associated with firms' decisions in 2002 and early
 2003 to recognize stock-based compensation expense under Statement of
 Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123. We find that the likelihood
 of SFAS 123 expense recognition is significantly related to the extent of
 the firm's participation in capital markets, the private incentives of top
 management and members of the board of directors, the level of information
 asymmetry, and political costs. Although recognizing firms have
 significantly smaller SFAS 123 expense, we find no significant incremental
 relation between recognition likelihood and SFAS 123 expense magnitude
 after controlling for other factors that we expect explain the recognition
 decision. We also find positive and significant announcement returns for
 earlier announcing firms, particularly those stating that increased
 earnings transparency motivates their decision. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.

Title: Information Transparency and Coordination Failure: Theory and Experiment 
Abstract:
 We examine the effect of higher order beliefs on the ability of
 decentralized decision makers to coordinate and take advantage of
 improvements in information transparency that can increase welfare.
 Theories that address this question have not been empirically explored. We
 study coordination in a laboratory experiment with privately informed
 decision makers. Economic outcomes in the setting depend both on agents'
 rational beliefs regarding economic fundamentals and on their rational
 beliefs regarding the beliefs of other agents. Increasing information
 transparency mitigates uncertainty about economic fundamentals but may
 increase strategic uncertainty, precipitating multiple equilibria and less
 efficient group outcomes. We provide evidence that sometimes the
 equilibrium attained by creditors is inferior from a welfare perspective
 to other available equilibria. Risk dominance appears to determine
 equilibrium selection in our setting. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.

Title: What Determines Corporate Transparency? 
Abstract:
 We investigate corporate transparency, defined as the availability of
 firm-specific information to those outside publicly traded firms. We
 conceptualize corporate transparency within a country as output from a
 multifaceted system whose components collectively produce, gather,
 validate, and disseminate information. We factor analyze a range of
 measures capturing countries' firm-specific information environments,
 isolating two distinct factors. The first factor, interpreted as financial
 transparency, captures the intensity and timeliness of financial
 disclosures, and their interpretation and dissemination by analysts and
 the media. The second factor, interpreted as governance transparency,
 captures the intensity of governance disclosures used by outside investors
 to hold officers and directors accountable. We investigate whether these
 factors vary with countries' legal/judicial regimes and political
 economies. Our main multivariate result is that the governance
 transparency factor is primarily related to a country's legal/judicial
 regime, whereas the financial transparency factor is primarily related to
 political economy. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.

Title: Investor Protection and Corporate Governance: Evidence from Worldwide CEO Turnover 
Abstract:
 Recent research asserts that an essential feature of good corporate
 governance is strong investor protection, where investor protection is
 defined as the extent of the "laws" that protect investors' rights and the
 strength of the legal institutions that facilitate "law enforcement". The
 purpose of this study is to test this assertion by investigating whether
 these measures of investor protection are associated with an important
 role of good corporate governance: identifying and terminating poorly
 performing CEOs. Our tests indicate that "strong law enforcement
 institutions" significantly improve the association between CEO turnover
 and poor performance, whereas "extensive investor protection laws" do not.
 In addition, we find that in countries with strong law enforcement, CEO
 turnover is more likely to be associated with poor stock returns when
 stock prices are more informative. Finding that strong law enforcement
 institutions are associated with improved CEO turnover-performance
 sensitivity is consistent with good corporate governance requiring law
 enforcement institutions capable of protecting shareholders' property
 rights (i.e., protecting shareholders from expropriation by insiders).
 Finding that investor	protection laws are not associated with improved
 CEO turnover-performance sensitivity is open to several explanations. For
 example, investor protection laws may not be as important as strong law
 enforcement in fostering good governance, the set of laws we examine may
 not be the set that are most important in promoting good governance, or
 measurement error in our surrogate for extensive investor protection laws
 may reduce the power of our test of this variable. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.

Title: Competitive Costs of Disclosure by Biotech IPOs 
Abstract:
 This study empirically examines the impact of various competitive cost
 proxies on the extent of product-related information disclosed by biotech
 initial public offerings (IPOs) in their prospectuses. The choice of
 biotech companies, which operate in a fiercely competitive environment,
 crystalizes the importance of competitive disclosure costs. The focus on
 product-related information is aimed at a disclosure set for which
 potential competitive harm is a priori substantial. Our empirical analyses
 establish three disclosure determinants: the stage of product development,
 availability of patent protection, and venture capital backing.
 Additionally, we find the relative size of ownership retained by pre-IPO
 owners to be negatively related to the extent of disclosure, as predicted
 by signaling models. We also document the expected inverse relation
 between the extent of information conveyed by the biotech IPOs and widely
 used measures of information asymmetry: the bid-ask spread and quoted
 depth, as well as stock return volatility. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.

Title: Underwater Options and the Dynamics of Executive Pay-to-Performance Sensitivities 
Abstract:
 We empirically analyze the dynamics of executives' pay-to-performance
 sensitivities. Option pay-to-performance sensitivities become weaker as
 options fall underwater, often leading to pressures to reprice options or
 restore pay-to-performance sensitivity in other ways. Building a detailed
 data set on executives' portfolios of stock and options, we find that the
 responsiveness of pay-to-performance sensitivities (created by all
 executive holdings of stock and options) to changes in stock price is
 large. The elasticity of pay-to-performance sensitivities with respect to
 stock price decreases is about 0.7 and is larger for high-option
 executives and for executives with high percentages of options already
 underwater. The dominant mechanism through which companies offset declines
 in option pay-to-performance sensitivities is larger option grants
 following stock price declines; on average, these larger grants restore
 approximately 40% of the stock-price-induced pay-to-performance
 sensitivity declines. Option repricings are inconsequential in this
 regard, despite the attention they have attracted. In looking at positive
 returns, we find the reverse: higher returns both directly increase
 pay-to-performance sensitivities and lead to larger option grants, which
 raise pay-to-performance sensitivities further. Thus, option grants to
 executives tend to be largest following large stock price increases or
 large stock price decreases. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.

Title: Ultimate Ownership, Income Management, and Legal and Extra-Legal Institutions 
Abstract:
 This study provides evidence of the role of both legal and extra-legal
 institutions in limiting the income management induced by the detachment
 of control rights from the cash flow rights of ultimate owners. The tests
 use a unique, comprehensive data set for firm-level control and ownership
 structures from 9 East Asian and 13 Western European countries. Univariate
 regressions show that income management that is induced by the wedge
 between control rights and cash flow rights is significantly limited in
 countries with high statutory protection of minority rights (proxied by
 legal tradition, minority rights protection, the efficiency of the
 judicial system, or disclosure standards) and effective extra-legal
 institutions (proxied by the effectiveness of competition laws, diffusion
 of the press, and tax compliance). Furthermore, multiple regression
 results show that a common law tradition and an efficient judicial system
 subsume the effects of the other legal institutions, and that a high rate
 of tax compliance subsumes the effects of the other extra-legal
 institutions in curbing insider income management. It is surprising that a
 high rate of tax compliance ultimately has a greater effect than legal
 tradition and the efficiency of the judicial system. Although this finding
 is unexpected, given prior evidence on the dominant roles of legal
 institutions in macroeconomic issues and corporate policies, it is
 consistent with the recent argument that effective tax enforcement is like
 a public good in that it can reduce insiders' private control benefits. An
 implication of this finding is that closer attention to extra-legal
 institutions has the potential to enhance our understanding of the
 institutional reforms needed to limit insider private control benefits. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.

Title: Disclosure Practices of Foreign Companies Interacting with U.S. Markets 
Abstract:
 We analyze the disclosure practices of companies as a function of their
 interaction with U.S. markets for a group of 794 firms from 24 countries
 in the Asia-Pacific and Europe. Our analysis uses the Transparency and
 Disclosure scores developed recently by Standard & Poor's. These scores
 rate the disclosure of companies from around the world using U.S.
 disclosure practices as an implicit benchmark. Results show a positive
 association between these disclosure scores and a variety of market
 interaction measures, including U.S. listing, U.S. investment flows,
 exports to, and operations in the United States. Trade with the United
 States at the country level, however, has an insignificant relationship
 with the disclosure scores. Our empirical analysis controls for the
 previously documented association between disclosure and firm size,
 performance, and country legal origin. Our results are broadly consistent
 with the hypothesis that cross-border economic interactions are associated
 with similarities in disclosure and governance practices. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.
