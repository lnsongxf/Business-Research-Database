Title: Audit Firm Portfolio Management Decisions 
Abstract:
 We examine client acceptance and client continuance decisions of a large
 audit firm to provide empirical evidence on the extent and nature of risk
 avoidance that the firm uses to purposefully manage its client portfolio.
 Our results support several key new inferences regarding audit firm
 portfolio management decisions. First, the results show that this firm is
 shedding the riskier clients in its portfolio, consistent with the risk
 avoidance theory of audit firm portfolio management. Second, the results
 show that the firm's newly accepted clients are less risky than its
 continuing clients. Although results of both the client continuance and
 client acceptance decisions imply a less risky portfolio emerging over
 time, there are greater differences in risk between continuing and
 discontinued clients than between continuing and newly accepted clients.
 Third, we find that audit risk factors are more important in audit firm
 portfolio management decisions than are financial risk factors. Finally,
 we find no evidence that audit pricing affects the client acceptance and
 continuance decisions of this firm, controlling for risk and other client
 characteristics. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.

Title: Disclosure Quality and the Excess Value of Diversification 
Abstract:
 For a sample of U.S. firm years from 1980 through 1996 we document a
 positive association between the excess value of diversification as
 defined by Berger and Ofek [1995] and security analyst ratings of
 voluntary disclosure as developed by the Association for Investment
 Management and Research. We also examine an alternative proxy for
 disclosure quality that captures the degree of segment disaggregation and
 document a positive association between this measure and excess value. Our
 results are robust to controls for firm performance and information
 environment. Taken together, these phenomena suggest that disclosure plays
 a monitoring role in disciplining management's investment decisions.
 However, tests of the association between disclosure and the value of
 firms' investment spending yield mixed results. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.

Title: Valuation and Accounting for Inflation and Foreign Exchange 
Abstract:
 Inflation and foreign exchange raise new issues with respect to accounting
 representations of equity value. For example, inflation creates an
 earnings illusion as an artifact of the mismatching of expenses based on
 allocations of historical costs with current revenues in determining
 earnings. This mismatching distorts mappings of aggregate earnings and
 book values into equity value such that value-relevant information is
 lost. In this article we consider the consequences of inflation and
 foreign exchange accounting policies, including those contained in
 accounting standards, on the value relevance of bottom-line accounting
 numbers. Policies are identified that achieve efficient accounting in the
 sense that aggregate (comprehensive) earnings and book values are
 sufficient for an accounting representation of equity value. The linear
 relations that emerge provide predictions on capitalization coefficients
 that help explain results of empirical inquiries. As well, our analysis
 provides a theoretical foundation for policies contained in accounting
 standards that contributes to the resolution of controversies such as that
 concerning foreign exchange accounting. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.

Title: Does Auditor Quality and Tenure Matter to Investors? Evidence from the Bond Market 
Abstract:
 We examine the relation between auditor characteristics (quality and
 tenure) and the cost of debt financing. Consistent with the hypothesis
 that audit characteristics are important to the capital markets, we find
 that (1) auditor quality and tenure are negatively and significantly
 related to the cost of debt financing, (2) the relation between auditor
 characteristics and the cost of debt is most pronounced in firms with debt
 that is noninvestment grade, and (3) both the insurance and information
 role of audits are economically significant to the cost of debt. Overall,
 our results suggest that, through their dual roles of providing
 information and insurance, auditor quality and tenure matter to capital
 market participants. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.
