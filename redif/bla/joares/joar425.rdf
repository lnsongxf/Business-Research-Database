Title: Accounting Choice, Home Bias, and U.S. Investment in Non-U.S. Firms 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the relation between accounting choice and U.S.
 institutional investor ownership in non-U.S. firms. We predict that U.S.
 investors exhibit home bias in their preference for accounting methods
 conforming to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) because
 such methods are more familiar, reduce information processing costs, and
 are perceived as higher quality. We find that firms exhibiting higher
 levels (changes) of U.S. GAAP conformity have greater levels (changes) of
 U.S. institutional ownership. Lead-lag regressions suggest that increases
 in U.S. GAAP conformity precede increases in U.S. investment, but changes
 in U.S. institutional holdings do not precede changes in accounting
 methods. We also find that the positive relation between U.S. GAAP
 conformity and U.S. investment holds regardless of a firm's visibility to
 U.S. investors (e.g., American Depositary Receipt listing, stock index
 membership, analyst following, firm size). However, we find that U.S. GAAP
 conformity has a significantly greater impact among firms already visible
 to U.S. investors. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.

Title: Effect of Investor Speculation on Earnings Management 
Abstract:
 This paper considers how the presence of a speculative investor, who bets
 on a firm's future earnings report, affects how the firm's management
 manipulates that report. We examine the influence of the speculator's
 information on earnings management behavior, quality of reported earnings,
 and stock price efficiency. We also provide predictions for, and
 interpretations of, short-window event studies and long-window association
 studies. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.

Title: On the Value of Transparency in Agencies with Renegotiation 
Abstract:
 In this paper we study when it is advantageous to improve corporate
 transparency by allowing shareholders direct access to corporate
 information and when it is preferable to rely on a reporting system in
 which shareholders only gain access to information that management chooses
 to disclose. We show that in an agency model that allows for contract
 renegotiation, the desirability of a fully transparent reporting regime
 hinges on the stewardship properties of the information in question.
 Specifically, information that is mainly useful for predicting future
 events and of little use for evaluating past actions should only be made
 available to the public through management's self-interested disclosures.
 Only if the information is useful for making inference about managerial
 actions can it be optimal to have full corporate transparency, so that
 outsiders have independent access to the same information as management. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.

Title: How Informed Are Actively Trading Institutional Investors? Evidence from Their Trading Behavior before a Break in a String of Consecutive Earnings Increases 
Abstract:
 We examine whether transient institutional investors (i.e., institutions
 that trade actively to maximize short-term profits) have information that
 allows them to predict a break in a string of consecutive quarterly
 earnings increases and thereby avoid the economically significant negative
 stock price response associated with the break announcement. We show that
 transient institutions predict the break at least one quarter in advance
 of the break quarter. We also provide evidence that is consistent with
 transient institutions obtaining information regarding the impending break
 from private communications with management. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2004.
