Title: Do Insiders Manipulate Earnings When They Sell Their Shares in an Initial Public Offering? 
Abstract:
 In this article we examine whether insider share selling in an initial
 public offering (IPO) influences R&D expenditures. Insiders (managers and
 venture capitalists) who sell their pre-offering shareholdings might try
 to increase the IPO offer price (1) by overinvesting in R&D to signal the
 firm's prospects (the signaling hypothesis) or (2) by underinvesting in
 R&D to increase current reported earnings (the earnings fixation
 hypothesis). We find that, for a sample of 243 IPOs from 1986 to 1990,
 change in R&D spending in the year of the IPO is negatively related to
 managerial selling. Because reductions in R&D spending increase current
 earnings at the expense of future earnings, our evidence suggests that
 managers believe that investors place more emphasis on current earnings
 and less emphasis on R&D and therefore spend less on R&D. We also document
 a positive association between discretionary current accruals in the
 offering year and managerial selling, suggesting that selling managers
 manipulate accruals as well. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2005.

Title: Do External Auditors Perform a Corporate Governance Role in Emerging Markets? Evidence from East Asia 
Abstract:
 In emerging markets, the agency conflicts between controlling owners and
 the minority shareholders are difficult to mitigate through conventional
 corporate control mechanisms such as boards of directors and takeovers. We
 examine whether external independent auditors are employed as monitors or
 as bonding mechanisms, or both, to alleviate the agency problems. Using a
 broad sample from eight East Asian economies, we document that firms with
 agency problems embedded in the ownership structures are more likely to
 employ Big 5 auditors. This relation is evident among firms that raise
 equity capital frequently. Consistently, firms hiring Big 5 auditors
 receive smaller share price discounts associated with the agency
 conflicts. Also, we find that Big 5 auditors take into consideration their
 clients' agency problems when making audit fee and audit report decisions.
 Taken together, these results suggest that Big 5 auditors do have a
 corporate governance role in emerging markets. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2005.

Title: Enforced Standards Versus Evolution by General Acceptance: A Comparative Study of E-Commerce Privacy Disclosure and Practice in the United States and the United Kingdom 
Abstract:
 We present data on privacy practices in e-commerce under the European
 Union's formal regulatory regime prevailing in the United Kingdom and
 compare it with the data from a previous study of U.S. practices that
 evolved in the absence of government laws or enforcement. The codification
 by the E.U. law, and the enforcement by the U.K. government, improves
 neither the disclosure nor the practice of e-commerce privacy relative to
 the United States. Regulation in the United Kingdom also appears to stifle
 development of a market for Web assurance services. Both U.S. and U.K.
 consumers continue to be vulnerable to a small number of e-commerce Web
 sites that spam their customers, ignoring the latter's expressed or
 implied preferences. These results raise important questions about finding
 a balance between enforced standards and conventions in financial
 reporting. In the second half of the 20th century, financial reporting has
 been characterized by both a preference for legislated standards and a
 lack of faith in its evolution as a body of social conventions. Evidence
 on whether this faith in standards over conventions is justified remains
 to be marshaled. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2005.

Title: Employee Stock Options, Equity Valuation, and the Valuation of Option Grants Using a Warrant-Pricing Model 
Abstract:
 We investigate the use of a warrant-pricing approach to incorporate
 employee stock options (ESOs) into equity valuation and to account for the
 dilutive effect of ESOs in the valuation of option grants for financial
 reporting purposes. Our valuation approach accounts for the jointly
 determined nature of ESO and shareholder values. The empirical results
 show that our stock price estimate exhibits lower prediction errors and
 higher explanatory powers for actual share price than does the traditional
 stock price estimate. We use our valuation approach to assess the
 implications of dilution on the fair-value estimates of ESO grants. We
 find that the fair value is overstated by 6% if we ignore the dilutive
 feature of ESOs. Furthermore, this bias is larger for firms that are heavy
 users of ESOs, small, and R&D intensive, and for firms that have a
 broad-based ESO compensation plan. Copyright 2005 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.

Title: The Importance of Business Risk in Setting Audit Fees: Evidence from Cases of Client Misconduct 
Abstract:
 Previous research provides evidence that, for the clients of a large audit
 firm, audit clients with higher perceived business risk bear the expected
 costs of this risk with higher audit fees. We extend the literature, which
 focuses on the relation between litigation risk and audit fees, by
 examining alleged client misconduct that is not illegal but possibly
 increases business risk. In particular, we examine the relation between
 audit fees and business risk for audit clients doing business in
 developing countries where bribery of top government officials has been an
 accepted business practice. We hypothesize that bribery-paying clients are
 riskier because of both client business risk and audit business risk.
 Using data collected from Securities and Exchange Commission filings and
 audit fee data in the 1970s, before the passage of the Foreign Corrupt
 Practices Act, we provide evidence that audit fees were higher for clients
 that disclosed paying bribes. This evidence is consistent with an audit
 market where auditors assess business risk at the client level, then pass
 their expected costs to the client in the form of higher audit fees. Copyright 2005 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.
