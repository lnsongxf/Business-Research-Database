Title: Does the Market Value Financial Expertise on Audit Committees of Boards of Directors? 
Abstract:
 We examine three-day cumulative abnormal returns around the announcement
 of 702 newly appointed outside directors assigned to audit committees
 during a period before implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX).
 Motivated by the SOX requirement that public companies disclose whether
 they have a financial expert on their audit committee, we test whether the
 market reacts favorably to the appointment of directors with financial
 expertise to the audit committee. In addition, because it is controversial
 whether SOX should define financial experts narrowly to include primarily
 "accounting" financial experts (as initially proposed) or more broadly to
 include "nonaccounting" financial experts (as ultimately passed), we
 separately examine appointments of each type of expert. We find a positive
 market reaction to the appointment of "accounting" financial experts
 assigned to audit committees but no reaction to "nonaccounting" financial
 experts assigned to audit committees, consistent with accounting-based
 financial skills, but not broader financial skills, improving the audit
 committee's ability to ensure high-quality financial reporting. In
 addition, we find that this positive reaction is concentrated among firms
 with relatively strong corporate governance, consistent with "accounting"
 financial expertise complementing strong governance, possibly because
 strong governance helps channel the expertise toward enhancing shareholder
 value. Together, these findings are consistent with financial expertise on
 audit committees improving corporate governance but only when both the
 expert and the appointing firm possess characteristics that facilitate the
 effective use of the expertise. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2005.

Title: Earnings Management through Transaction Structuring: Contingent Convertible Debt and Diluted Earnings per Share 
Abstract:
 In this article we examine whether firms structure their convertible bond
 transactions to manage diluted earnings per share (EPS). We find that the
 likelihood of firms issuing contingent convertible bonds (COCOs), which
 are often excluded from diluted EPS calculations under Statement of
 Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 128, is significantly associated with
 the reduction that would occur in diluted EPS if the bonds were
 traditionally structured. We also document that firms' use of EPS-based
 compensation contracts significantly affects the likelihood of COCO
 issuance and find weak evidence that reputation costs, measured using
 earnings restatement data, play a role in the structuring decision. These
 results are robust to controlling for alternative motivations for issuing
 COCOs, including tax and dilution arguments. In addition, an examination
 of announcement returns reveals that investors view the net benefits and
 costs of COCOs as offsetting one another. Our results contribute to the
 literature on earnings management, diluted EPS, financial reporting costs,
 and financial innovation. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2005.

Title: Firms' Off-Balance Sheet and Hybrid Debt Financing: Evidence from Their Book-Tax Reporting Differences 
Abstract:
 We match large U.S. corporations' tax returns during 1989-2001 to their
 financial statements to construct a firm-level proxy of firms' use of
 off-balance sheet and hybrid debt financing. We find that firms with less
 favorable prior-period Standard & Poor's (S&P) bond ratings or higher
 leverage ratios in comparison to their industry report greater amounts of
 interest expense on their tax returns than to investors and creditors on
 their financial statements. These between-firm results are consistent with
 credit-constrained firms using more structured financing arrangements. Our
 within-firm tests also suggest that firms use more structured financing
 arrangements when they enter into contractual loan agreements that provide
 incentives to manage debt ratings. Specifically, we find that after
 controlling for S&P bond rating and industry-adjusted leverage, our sample
 firms report greater amounts of interest expenses for tax than for
 financial statement purposes when they enter into performance pricing
 contracts that use senior debt rating covenants to set interest rates.
 Furthermore, we find that the greatest book-tax reporting changes occur
 when firms become closer to violating these debt rating covenants. These
 latter findings are consistent with firms' contractual debt covenants
 influencing their use of off-balance sheet and hybrid debt financing. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2005.

Title: Consequences of Financial Reporting Failure for Outside Directors: Evidence from Accounting Restatements and Audit Committee Members 
Abstract:
 I use a sample of 409 companies that restated their earnings from 1997 to
 2001 to examine penalties for outside directors, particularly audit
 committee members, when their companies experience accounting
 restatements. Penalties from lawsuits and Securities and Exchange
 Commission (SEC) actions are limited. However, directors experience
 significant labor market penalties. In the three years after the
 restatement, director turnover is 48% for firms that restate earnings
 downward, 33% for a performance-matched sample, 28% for firms that restate
 upward, and only 18% for technical restatement firms. For firms that
 overstate earnings, the likelihood of director departure increases in
 restatement severity, particularly for audit committee directors. In
 addition, directors of these firms are no longer present in 25% of their
 positions on other boards. This loss is greater for audit committee
 members and for more severe restatements. A matched-sample analysis
 confirms this result. Overall, the evidence is consistent with outside
 directors, especially audit committee members, bearing reputational costs
 for financial reporting failure. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2005.
