Title: The Association between Outside Directors, Institutional Investors and the Properties of Management Earnings Forecasts 
Abstract:
 We investigate the relation of the board of directors and institutional
 ownership with the properties of management earnings forecasts. We find
 that firms with more outside directors and greater institutional ownership
 are more likely to issue a forecast and are inclined to forecast more
 frequently. In addition, these forecasts tend to be more specific,
 accurate and less optimistically biased. These results are robust to
 changes specification, Granger causality tests, and simultaneous equation
 analyses. The results are similar in the pre- and post-Regulation Fair
 Disclosure (Reg FD) eras. Additional analysis suggests that concentrated
 institutional ownership is negatively associated with forecast properties.
 This association is less negative in the post-Reg FD environment, which is
 consistent with Reg FD reducing the ability of firms to privately
 communicate information to select audiences. Copyright 2005 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.

Title: Domestic and Foreign Earnings, Stock Return Variability, and the Impact of Investor Sophistication 
Abstract:
 We examine the importance of foreign earnings relative to domestic
 earnings for a sample of U.S. multinationals using variance decomposition.
 Our methodology represents an alternative and complementary approach over
 the prior literature, which is based on traditional regressions and
 earnings response coefficients. We document that domestic earnings are
 more important in explaining the variance of unexpected returns than are
 foreign earnings and that the relative importance of domestic earnings is
 a decreasing function of investor sophistication. Last, we classify
 institutional investors as either short- or long-term oriented following
 Bushee [1998]. We find that the variance contribution of foreign earnings
 increases with the level of investment by long-term investors. In
 contrast, there is no significant relation between the degree of ownership
 by short-term (or transient) investors and the variance contribution of
 domestic and foreign earnings. Overall, our results are consistent with
 Thomas's [1999] finding that investors on average underestimate the
 persistence of foreign earnings. Copyright 2005 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.

Title: A Reexamination of the Persistence of Accruals and Cash Flows 
Abstract:
 We reexamine prior studies' conclusion that accruals are less persistent
 than cash, focusing on two aspects of persistence that are crucial to
 determining its properties. The first (time specificity) refers to the
 fact that persistence describes how "current-period" shocks to income
 translate into next-period income. Traditional measures of accruals are,
 however, functions of current- "and" non-current-period transactions. We
 show that the inclusion of non-current-period transactions leads to a
 downward (upward) bias on the persistence of accruals (cash flows). We
 develop alternative measures of accruals and cash flows that are not
 misaligned and show that the differential persistence of cash flows over
 accruals is more than 70% smaller using these measures. The second aspect
 of persistence is firm-specificity. Specifically, we evaluate persistence
 using firm-specific estimations and find that more than 85% of firms show
 no evidence that accruals are less persistent than cash flows. Copyright 2005 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.

Title: The Association between Corporate Boards, Audit Committees, and Management Earnings Forecasts: An Empirical Analysis 
Abstract:
 We study how corporate boards and audit committees are associated with
 voluntary financial disclosure practices, proxied here by management
 earnings forecasts. We find that in firms with more effective board and
 audit committee structures, managers are more likely to make or update an
 earnings forecast, and their forecast is less likely to be precise, it is
 more accurate, and it elicits a more favorable market response. Together,
 our empirical evidence is broadly consistent with the notion that
 effective corporate governance is associated with higher financial
 disclosure quality. Copyright 2005 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.

Title: Imprecision in Accounting Measurement: Can It Be Value Enhancing? 
Abstract:
 Accounting measurements of firms' investments are usually imprecise. We
 study the economic consequences of such imprecision when it interacts with
 information asymmetry regarding an investment project's ex ante
 profitability, known only by the firm's managers. Absent agency and
 risk-sharing considerations, we find that some degree of accounting
 imprecision could actually be value enhancing. We characterize the optimal
 degree of imprecision and identify its key determinants. The greater the
 information asymmetry regarding the project's profitability, the greater
 is the imprecision that should be tolerated in the measurement of the
 firm's investment. Copyright 2005 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.
