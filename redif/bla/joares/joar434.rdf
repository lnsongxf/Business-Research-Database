Title: Inflation Illusion and Post-Earnings-Announcement Drift 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the cross-sectional implications of the inflation
 illusion hypothesis for the post-earnings-announcement drift. The
 inflation illusion hypothesis suggests that stock market investors fail to
 incorporate inflation in forecasting future earnings growth rates, and
 this causes firms whose earnings growths are positively (negatively)
 related to inflation to be undervalued (overvalued). We argue and show
 that the sensitivity of earnings growth to inflation varies monotonically
 across stocks sorted on standardized unexpected earnings (SUE) and,
 consistent with the inflation illusion hypothesis, show that lagged
 inflation predicts future earnings growth, abnormal returns, and earnings
 announcement returns of SUE-sorted stocks. Interestingly, controlling for
 the return predictive ability of inflation weakens the ability of lagged
 SUE to predict future returns of SUE-sorted stocks. Copyright 2005 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.

Title: Earnings Management? The Shapes of the Frequency Distributions of Earnings Metrics Are Not Evidence Ipso Facto 
Abstract:
 We provide evidence that the shapes (particularly around zero) of the
 frequency distributions of earnings metrics examined in the extant
 earnings management literature are affected by (1) deflation (using, for
 example, price or market capitalization), (2) sample selection criteria
 that lead to differential inclusion/exclusion of observations to the left
 of zero versus observations to the right of zero (implicit in studies
 focusing on firms followed by I/B/E/S and explicit in studies partitioning
 on a variable differing between loss observations and profit
 observations), (3) differences between the characteristics of observations
 to the left of zero and observations to the right of zero (such as market
 pricing and analyst optimism/pessimism), or (4) a combination of these
 factors. Since the shapes of the frequency distributions of earnings
 metrics at zero are likely due to one of the above effects, we conclude
 that the shapes cannot be used as ipso facto evidence of earnings
 management. Copyright 2005 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.

Title: The Nature of the Interaction between Mandatory and Voluntary Disclosures 
Abstract:
 This paper demonstrates the crucial role that firms' mandatory disclosures
 play in determining their voluntary disclosure strategies. It also shows
 how a firm's propensity for providing voluntary disclosures relates to
 various features of the mandatory disclosure environment and disclosure
 regulation. The special case of choosing between aggregated and
 disaggregated disclosures serves as an illustration of the model's
 applicability. Copyright 2005 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.

Title: Analyst Impartiality and Investment Banking Relationships 
Abstract:
 This study examines whether investment banking ties influence the speed
 with which analysts convey unfavorable news. We hypothesize that
 affiliated analysts have incentives to respond promptly to good news but
 prefer not to issue bad news about client companies. Using duration models
 of the time between an equity issue and the first downgrade, we find
 affiliated analysts are slower to downgrade from Buy and Hold
 recommendations and significantly faster to upgrade from Hold
 recommendations, in both within-analyst and within-issuer tests. We also
 find affiliated analysts issue recommendations sooner and more frequently
 after an offering than unaffiliated analysts, and that unaffiliated
 analysts are more likely than affiliated analysts to drop coverage of
 sample firms. Our findings indicate that banking ties increase analysts'
 reluctance to reveal negative news, and that reform efforts must carefully
 consider the incentives of affiliated and unaffiliated analysts to
 initiate coverage and convey the results of their research. Copyright 2005 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.
