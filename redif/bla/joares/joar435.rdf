Title: Earnings Quality, Insider Trading, and Cost of Capital 
Abstract:
 Previous research argues that earnings quality, measured as the unsigned
 abnormal accruals, proxies for information asymmetries that affect cost of
 capital. We examine this argument directly in two stages. In the first
 stage, we estimate firms' exposure to an earnings quality factor in the
 context of a Fama-French three-factor model augmented by the return on a
 factor-mimicking portfolio that is long in low earnings quality firms and
 short in high earnings quality firms. In the second stage, we examine
 whether the earnings quality factor is priced and whether insider trading
 is more profitable for firms with higher exposure to that factor.
 Generally speaking, we find evidence consistent with pricing of the
 earnings quality factor and insiders trading more profitably in firms with
 higher exposure to that factor. Copyright 2005 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.

Title: Dividend Taxes and Implied Cost of Equity Capital 
Abstract:
 We estimate firm-level implied cost of equity capital based on recent
 advances in accounting and finance research and examine the effect of
 dividend taxes on the cost of equity capital. We investigate whether
 dividend taxes affect firms' cost of capital by testing the relation
 between the implied cost of equity capital and a measure of the
 tax-penalized portion of dividend yield, which we define as the product of
 dividend yield and the dividend tax penalty. The results generally support
 the dividend tax capitalization hypothesis. We find a positive relation
 between the implied cost of equity capital and the tax-penalized portion
 of dividend yield that is decreasing in aggregate institutional ownership,
 our proxy for tax-advantaged investors. The evidence in this study adds to
 the understanding of the effect of investor-level taxes on equity value. Copyright 2005 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.

Title: Carrot or Stick? Contract Frame and Use of Decision-Influencing Information in a Principal-Agent Setting 
Abstract:
 A fundamental management accounting issue is how to incorporate
 decision-influencing information (e.g., an ex post state signal) into
 employment contracts. Our experiment examines the effects of contract
 framing on such information use in a principal-agent setting. In each of
 40 rounds, participants (as employer and worker) negotiate a contract that
 specifies pay depending on an ex post state signal. State-signal pay is
 framed as either a bonus or a penalty over two groups. The results show
 that the bonus frame facilitates information use, because of worker loss
 aversion. Although both groups initially underweigh the state signal, the
 bonus group quickly converges toward the optimal weight, whereas the
 penalty group persistently underweighs the state signal. Copyright 2005 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.
