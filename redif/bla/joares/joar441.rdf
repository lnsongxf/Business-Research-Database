Title: External and Internal Pricing in Multidivisional Firms 
Abstract:
 Multidivisional firms frequently rely on external market prices in order
 to value internal transactions across profit centers. This paper examines
 market-based transfer pricing when an upstream division has monopoly power
 in selling a proprietary component both to a downstream division within
 the same firm and to external customers. When internal transfers are
 valued at the prevailing market price, the resulting transactions are
 distorted by double marginalization. The imposition of intracompany
 discounts will always improve overall firm profits provided the supplying
 division is capacity constrained. Under certain conditions it is then
 possible to design discount rules so that the resulting prices and sales
 quantities are efficient from the corporate perspective. In contrast, the
 impact of intracompany discounts remains ambiguous when the capacity of
 the selling division is essentially unlimited. It is then generally
 impossible to achieve fully efficient outcomes by means of market-based
 transfer pricing unless the external market for the component is
 sufficiently large relative to the internal market. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: An Analysis of the Relation between the Stewardship and Valuation Roles of Earnings 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we seek a deeper understanding of how accounting
 information is used for valuation and incentive contracting purposes. We
 explore linkages between weights on earnings in compensation contracts and
 in stock price formation. A distinction between the valuation and
 incentive contracting roles of earnings in Paul [1992] produces the null
 hypothesis that valuation earnings coefficients ("VEC"s) and compensation
 earnings coefficients ("CEC"s) are unrelated. Our empirical analyses of
 the relations between earnings and both stock prices and executive
 compensation data at the firm and industry levels over the period
 1971-2000 rejects Paul's [1992] hypothesis of no relation. We also
 document an increasing weight over time on other public performance
 information captured by stock returns in the determination of cash
 compensation. Specifically, we find that the incentive coefficient on
 returns is significantly higher in the second of two equal sample
 subperiods relative to the incentive coefficient on earnings. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: Volume, Opinion Divergence, and Returns: A Study of Post-Earnings Announcement Drift 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the relationship between post-earnings announcement
 returns and different measures of volume at the earnings date. We find
 that post-event returns are strictly increasing in the component of volume
 that is unexplained by prior trading activity. We interpret unexplained
 volume as an indicator of opinion divergence among investors and conclude
 that post-event returns are increasing in ex ante opinion divergence. Our
 evidence is consistent with Varian [1985], who suggests that opinion
 divergence may be treated as an additional risk factor affecting asset
 prices. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: Is There a Link between Executive Equity Incentives and Accounting Fraud? 
Abstract:
 We compare executive equity incentives of firms accused of accounting
 fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) during the period
 1996-2003 with two samples of firms not accused of fraud. We measure
 equity incentives in a variety of ways and employ a battery of empirical
 tests. We find no consistent evidence that executive equity incentives are
 associated with fraud. These results stand in contrast to assertions by
 policy makers that incentives from stock-based compensation and the
 resulting equity holdings increase the likelihood of accounting fraud. Copyright 2006 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.

Title: Accounting Treatment of Inherent versus Incentive Uncertainties and the Capital Structure of the Firm 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the accounting treatment of uncertainty and how it
 affects a firm's capital structure. We distinguish two sources of
 uncertainty that raise reliability concerns: inherent uncertainty and
 incentive uncertainty. By inherent uncertainty, we refer to uncertainty
 about the quality of raw information regarding future cash flows. By
 incentive uncertainty, we refer to uncertainty about the quality of
 accounting numbers conveying the raw information. We explore features of
 accounting that can effectively deal with these two types of uncertainties
 in order to aid in the debt-equity decision of the firm. To handle
 inherent uncertainty, preferable accounting involves flexible
 revenue/expense recognition rules that recognize more profit when the
 uncertainty level is low. To deal with incentive uncertainty, a stringent
 revenue/expense recognition rule may be desirable to fend off management's
 opportunistic reporting behavior. Inflexible accounting rules cause a
 firm's financing choices to deviate from what would hold with complete
 information. Given any accounting rule, an information environment with a
 lower (higher) uncertainty regarding future cash inflows leads to higher
 (lower) expected debt financing. This is because assessed default risk is
 increasing in the uncertainty of future cash inflows, holding the
 uncertainty of the outflows constant. Copyright 2006 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.

Title: Comparing the Post-Earnings Announcement Drift for Surprises Calculated from Analyst and Time Series Forecasts 
Abstract:
 Post-earnings announcement drift is the tendency for a stock's cumulative
 abnormal returns to drift in the direction of an earnings surprise for
 several weeks following an earnings announcement. We show that the drift
 is significantly larger when defining the earnings surprise using
 analysts' forecasts and actual earnings from I/B/E/S than when using a
 time series model based on Compustat earnings data. Neither Compustat's
 policy of restating earnings nor the inclusion of "special items" in
 reported earnings contribute significantly to the disparity in drift
 magnitudes. Rather, our results suggest that this disparity is
 attributable to differences between analyst forecasts and those of
 time-series models-or at least to factors correlated with these
 differences. Further, we document that analyst forecasts lead to return
 patterns around future earnings announcements that differ from those
 observed when using time-series models, suggesting that the two types of
 surprises may capture somewhat different forms of mispricing. Copyright 2006 The Institute of Professional Accounting, University of Chicago.

Title: Effects of Multiple Clients on the Reliability of Audit Reports 
Abstract:
 This paper demonstrates the existence of two different kinds of
 externalities induced by an auditor servicing multiple clients at the same
 time. First, we show that the capital market price for a client can
 increase in the number of qualified reports that his auditor issues to his
 other clients, thus producing a stock price externality. Second, when the
 audit firm has limited wealth, an additional client can actually decrease
 the audit quality and increase the average likelihood of audit failure
 relative to a single-client setting because of reporting externalities.
 Our analysis also demonstrates how requiring a more effective audit
 oversight mechanism can actually produce unintended consequences such as
 an increased likelihood of audit failures. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.
