Title: The Role of Accruals in Asymmetrically Timely Gain and Loss Recognition 
Abstract:
 We investigate the role of accrual accounting in the asymmetrically timely
 recognition (incorporation in reported earnings) of gains and losses.
 Timely recognition requires accruals when it precedes complete realization
 of the gains and losses in cash. We show that nonlinear accruals models
 incorporating the asymmetry in gain and loss recognition (timelier loss
 recognition, or conditional conservatism) offer a substantial
 specification improvement, explaining substantially more variation in
 accruals than equivalent linear specifications. Conversely, conventional
 linear accruals models, by omitting the loss recognition asymmetry,
 exhibit substantial attenuation bias and offer a comparatively poor
 specification of the accounting accrual process. Linear specifications
 also understate the ability of current earnings to predict future cash
 flows. These findings have implications for our understanding of accrual
 accounting and conservatism, as well as for researchers estimating
 discretionary accruals, earnings management, and earnings quality. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: Accounting Discretion in Fair Value Estimates: An Examination of SFAS 142 Goodwill Impairments 
Abstract:
 This study examines Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 142
 adoption decisions, focusing on the trade-off between recording certain
 current goodwill impairment charges below the line and uncertain future
 impairment charges included in income from continuing operations. We
 examine several potentially important economic incentives that firms face
 when making this accounting choice. We find evidence suggesting that
 firms' equity market concerns affect their preference for above-the-line
 vs. below-the-line accounting treatment, and firms' debt contracting,
 bonus, turnover, and exchange delisting incentives affect their decisions
 to accelerate or delay expense recognition. Our study contributes to the
 accounting choice literature by examining managers' use of discretion when
 adopting a mandatory accounting change and by developing and testing
 explicit cross-sectional hypotheses of the determinants of firms'
 preferences for immediate below-the-line versus delayed above-the-line
 expense recognition. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: Discussion of Accounting Discretion in Fair Value Estimates: An Examination of SFAS 142 Goodwill Impairments 
Abstract:
 Beatty and Weber examine an accounting choice that managers made upon
 adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 142: whether to
 record a goodwill asset impairment as a cumulative effect of an accounting
 change at the time of adoption or delay the recognition of such an
 impairment to the future (perhaps indefinitely) when they would be
 recorded as expenses in earnings from continuing operations. The authors
 consider several factors that might influence management's reporting of
 transition effects, including contracting, equity market incentives, and
 regulatory forces. Participants at the 2005 Journal of Accounting Research
 Conference questioned whether such a complex accounting decision can be
 captured with simple linear models and noisy proxy variables, while also
 speculating upon whether the results would generalize to other settings.
 In this discussion, I summarize Beatty and Weber's research, highlight its
 contribution to the accounting literature, and provide a record of the
 main issues raised by the conference participants. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: An Analysis of the Theories and Explanations Offered for the Mispricing of Accruals and Accrual Components 
Abstract:
 Numerous accounting studies claim that investors fail to rationally price
 accrual-related information and that investors are functionally fixated.
 This study documents the importance of performing robustness tests when
 testing economic or behavioral explanations for apparent
 accounting-related security mispricing. We find that performing robustness
 tests that exclude a small number of firm-year observations (approximately
 200 firm-year observations or about 1% of the entire sample) reveals an
 inverted U-shaped relation between buy-and-hold abnormal returns and total
 accruals. An inverted U-shaped relation is inconsistent with the
 functional fixation (earnings fixation) hypothesis. We conduct similar
 robustness tests for the abnormal accrual anomaly and the net operating
 assets anomaly proposed by other investigators, and also find an inverted
 U-shaped relation between buy-and-hold abnormal returns and abnormal
 accruals and net operating assets. These findings are inconsistent with
 the explanations put forth by those investigators. Such evidence leads us
 to conclude that the accrual-related anomalies are unlikely to be due to
 investors' inability to process accounting information, as suggested by
 the functional fixation hypotheses tested. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: Disclosure Risk and Price Drift 
Abstract:
 Disclosures play an apparently critical role in the empirical regularity
 of the short-run momentum and long-run reversal in stock returns.
 Motivated by this evidence, this paper integrates an analysis of
 disclosures within an asset pricing model to arrive at a framework in
 which disclosures and asset returns are jointly determined. Disclosures
 resolve uncertainty, but the increased information flow also raises the
 risks during the disclosure period. When disclosures and asset returns are
 modeled jointly, apparently good news is associated with the upward
 revision of future disclosure risks. The model generates predictions that
 have the outward appearance of short-run momentum and long-run reversal. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: Why Do Managers Voluntarily Issue Cash Flow Forecasts? 
Abstract:
 We study a relatively recent change in voluntary disclosure practices by
 management, namely, the issuance of cash flow forecasts. We predict and
 find that management issues cash flow forecasts to signal good news in
 cash flow, to meet investor demand for cash flow information, and to
 precommit to a certain composition of earnings in terms of cash flow
 versus accruals, thus reducing the degree of freedom in earnings
 management. Our results also suggest that management discloses good news
 in cash flow to mitigate the negative impact of bad news in earnings, to
 lend credibility to good news in earnings, and to signal economic
 viability when the firm is young. Our finding that management cash flow
 forecasts primarily convey good news is in contrast to the generally
 negative nature of management "earnings" guidance and suggests that
 different incentives drive firms' disclosure of different financial
 information. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.
