Title: Stock Exchange Disclosure and Market Development: An Analysis of 50 International Exchanges 
Abstract:
 This study examines associations between measures of stock exchange
 disclosure and market development at 50 of the member stock exchanges of
 the World Federation of Exchanges. We focus on stock exchange disclosure
 systems (rather than actual company disclosures) because this approach
 links stock exchange policy with desired outcomes related to market
 development (such as liquidity, trading activity, and market size relative
 to gross domestic product). We find strong support for the hypothesis that
 the strength of the disclosure system (disclosure rules, monitoring, and
 enforcement) is positively associated with market development, after
 controlling for legal system, legal protection of investors, market size,
 and several other potentially relevant explanatory variables. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: International Differences in the Cost of Equity Capital: Do Legal Institutions and Securities Regulation Matter? 
Abstract:
 This paper examines international differences in firms' cost of equity
 capital across 40 countries. We analyze whether the effectiveness of a
 country's legal institutions and securities regulation is systematically
 related to cross-country differences in the cost of equity capital. We
 employ several models to estimate firms' implied or ex ante cost of
 capital. Our results support the conclusion that firms from countries with
 more extensive disclosure requirements, stronger securities regulation,
 and stricter enforcement mechanisms have a significantly lower cost of
 capital. We perform extensive sensitivity analyses to assess the
 potentially confounding influence of countries' long-run growth
 differences on our results. We also show that, consistent with theory, the
 cost of capital effects of strong legal institutions become substantially
 smaller and, in many cases, statistically insignificant as capital markets
 become globally more integrated. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: Recognition v. Disclosure, Auditor Tolerance for Misstatement, and the Reliability of Stock-Compensation and Lease Information 
Abstract:
 We examine whether information in footnotes might lack reliability because
 auditors permit more misstatement in disclosed, as opposed to recognized,
 amounts. In both the stock-compensation and lease settings, audit partners
 require greater correction of misstatements in recognized amounts than in
 the equivalent disclosed amounts. Debriefing questions indicate that the
 partners make these decisions knowingly, even though they expect greater
 client resistance to correcting recognized amounts, because they view
 recognized amounts as more material. Partners also spend more time on
 correction decisions for recognized information. While prior literature
 suggests that amounts are often relegated to footnotes because they are
 less reliable, our results suggest that the actual choice to disclose
 versus recognize can also reduce information reliability. These results
 have implications for the interpretation of prior research on the
 reliability of recognized and disclosed numbers, for financial-accounting
 standard setters who may want to consider the reliability effects of their
 recognition versus disclosure decisions, and for auditing standard setters
 who may wish to clarify auditors' responsibilities for preventing
 misstatements in disclosed amounts. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: Does Opinion Shopping Impair Auditor Independence and Audit Quality? 
Abstract:
 This study investigates how companies' threats to dismiss auditors and
 their engagement in opinion shopping influence auditor independence and
 audit quality, which in turn affect misstatements in financial statements.
 It also examines how outsiders' reactions to auditor switching influence
 opinion shopping. The results indicate that neither the predecessor
 auditor's nor the successor auditor's independence is compromised by
 dismissal threats and opinion shopping. Further, the successor auditor's
 audit quality exceeds the predecessor auditor's audit quality. In
 addition, auditor switching decreases potential understatements and
 increases potential overstatements in financial statements, and the
 capital market's and the successor auditor's reactions to auditor
 switching reduce the benefits of opinion shopping to companies.
 Additionally, the study sheds some light on the potential effects of both
 the Sarbanes-Oxley's restriction on non-audit services and mandatory
 auditor rotation or retention. The paper also derives a rich set of
 empirical implications. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: Subjective Performance Indicators and Discretionary Bonus Pools 
Abstract:
 Key indicators of managerial performance are frequently subjective, that
 is, they are difficult to specify and/or verify for contracting purposes.
 When a principal must rely on subjective information to create incentives
 for a group of agents, discretionary bonus pools are shown to be optimal
 mechanisms. Despite their optimality, however, discretionary bonus pools
 entail an additional agency cost relative to the benchmark of optimal
 contracts based on objective and verifiable information. Our analysis
 identifies circumstances under which this additional agency cost is small,
 for example, the subjective information signals are precise, or the number
 of agents participating in the bonus pool increases. When incentive
 schemes can be based on both objective and subjective performance
 indicators, the relative weights to be placed on alternative signals are
 shown to differ from the ones predicted by models with objective signals
 only. We also demonstrate that correlation in measurement errors has a
 different impact on the structure of optimal incentive schemes when the
 performance indicators are merely subjective. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: Founding Family Ownership and Earnings Quality 
Abstract:
 This study investigates the relation between founding family ownership and
 earnings quality using data from the Standard & Poor's 500 companies.
 Existing literature has documented that financial reporting is of higher
 quality when firms have stronger corporate governance mechanisms and when
 there is greater demand for quality financial reporting. I provide two
 competing theories of the effect of founding family ownership on the
 demand and supply of earnings quality: the entrenchment effect and the
 alignment effect. The empirical results show that, on average, founding
 family ownership is associated with higher earnings quality. In
 particular, I find consistent evidence that founding family ownership is
 associated with lower abnormal accruals, greater earnings informativeness,
 and less persistence of transitory loss components in earnings. In
 addition, the results suggest a nonlinear relation between family
 ownership and earnings quality. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.
