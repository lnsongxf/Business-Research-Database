Title: Taxes, Leverage, and the Cost of Equity Capital 
Abstract:
 We examine the associations among leverage, corporate and investor level
 taxes, and the firm's implied cost of equity capital. Expanding on
 Modigliani and Miller [1958, 1963], the cost of equity capital can be
 expressed as a function of leverage and corporate and investor level
 taxes. Based on this expression, we predict that the cost of equity is
 increasing in leverage, and that corporate taxes mitigate this
 leverage-related risk premium, while the personal tax disadvantage of debt
 increases this premium. We empirically test these predictions using
 implied cost of equity estimates and proxies for the firm's corporate tax
 rate and the personal tax disadvantage of debt. Our results suggest that
 the equity risk premium associated with leverage is decreasing in the
 corporate tax benefit from debt. We find some evidence that the equity
 risk premium from leverage is increasing in the personal tax penalty
 associated with debt. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: Predictability in Financial Analyst Forecast Errors: Learning or Irrationality? 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we propose a rational learning-based explanation for the
 predictability in financial analysts' earnings forecast errors documented
 in prior literature. In particular, we argue that the serial correlation
 pattern in analysts' quarterly earnings forecast errors is consistent with
 an environment in which analysts face parameter uncertainty and learn
 rationally about the parameters over time. Using simulations and real
 data, we show that the predictability evidence is more consistent with
 rational learning than with irrationality (fixation on a seasonal random
 walk model or some other dogmatic belief). Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: Redacted Disclosure 
Abstract:
 In this paper we investigate a firm's decision to redact proprietary
 information from its material contract filings. Information redaction
 results when the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) grants a firm's
 request to withhold information from investors in its material contract
 filings, presumably because the information is proprietary. We hypothesize
 that when firms redact information, measures of adverse selection
 deteriorate. That is, the redaction of proprietary information from
 material contracts should be associated with: a larger adverse selection
 component of the bid-ask spread, reductions in market depth, and lower
 market turnover. In addition, we conjecture that the decision to redact
 depends on whether the firm plans on raising capital, the competitiveness
 of the firm's industry, and the performance of the firm. Overall the
 results of our analysis generally support our predictions. We find that
 when firms redact information, contemporaneous measures of the adverse
 selection component of the bid-ask spread rise, and market depth and share
 turnover deteriorate; this suggests an increase in adverse selection. We
 also find firms are less likely to redact when they issue long-term debt
 and are more likely to redact when they are in a competitive industry or
 experience losses. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: Favorable versus Unfavorable Recommendations: The Impact on Analyst Access to Management-Provided Information 
Abstract:
 This study examines recent regulatory and practitioner concerns that
 managers provide more (less) information to analysts with more (less)
 favorable stock recommendations. We examine the relative forecast accuracy
 of analysts before and after a recommendation issuance under the
 assumption that increases (decreases) in management-provided information
 will increase (decrease) analysts' relative forecast accuracy. We find
 that analysts issuing more favorable recommendations experience a greater
 increase in their relative forecast accuracy compared with analysts with
 less favorable recommendations. Additional tests on the change in
 frequency with which analysts issue forecasts independent of or in
 conjunction with other analysts after their recommendation change yield
 corroborating results. In addition, we find that the greater increase in
 relative accuracy for analysts with more favorable recommendations exists
 prior to the passage of Regulation FD but not after. The combined results
 are consistent with analysts receiving relatively more management-provided
 information following the issuance of more favorable recommendations. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: Conservatism and Cross-Sectional Variation in the Post-Earnings Announcement Drift 
Abstract:
 Accounting conservatism allows me to identify a previously undocumented
 source of "predictable" cross-sectional variation in Standardized
 Unexpected Earnings' autocorrelations viz. the sign of the most recent
 earnings realization and present evidence that the market ignores this
 variation ("loss effect"). It is possible to earn returns higher than from
 the Bernard and Thomas (1990) strategy by incorporating this feature.
 Additionally, the paper shows that the "loss effect" is different from the
 "cross quarter" effect shown by Rangan and Sloan (1998) and it is possible
 to combine the two effects to earn returns higher than either strategy
 alone. Thus, the paper corroborates the Bernard and Thomas finding that
 stock prices fail to reflect the extent to which quarterly earnings series
 differ from a seasonal random walk and extends it by showing that the
 market systematically underestimates time-series properties resulting from
 accounting conservatism. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.
