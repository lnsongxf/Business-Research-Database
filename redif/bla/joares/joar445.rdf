Title: Ownership Concentration in Privatized Firms: The Role of Disclosure Standards, Auditor Choice, and Auditing Infrastructure 
Abstract:
 We rely on a unique data set to estimate the impact of disclosure
 standards and auditor-related characteristics on ownership concentration
 in 190 privatized firms from 31 countries. Accounting transparency can
 help alleviate the agency conflict between minority investors and
 controlling shareholders, which is evident in the extent of ownership
 concentration, since the expropriation of corporate resources hinges on
 these private benefits remaining hidden. After controlling for other
 country-level and firm-level determinants, we find weak (no) evidence that
 extensive disclosure standards (auditor choice) reduce ownership
 concentration. In contrast, we report strong, robust evidence that
 ownership concentration is lower in countries with securities laws that
 specify a lower burden of proof in civil and criminal litigation against
 auditors, consistent with Ball's [2001] predictions. Collectively, our
 research implies that minority investors worldwide value legal
 institutions that discipline auditors in the event of financial reporting
 failure over both the presence of a Big 5 auditor and better disclosure
 standards. Re-estimating our regressions on a broad sample of western
 European public firms provides similar evidence on all of our predictions. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: Auditors' Response to Political Connections and Cronyism in Malaysia 
Abstract:
 This paper extends the literature on the role of political economy in
 financial reporting and auditing by testing two hypotheses. The first
 hypothesis predicts that there will be a greater increase in audit effort
 and audit fees for Malaysian firms with political connections, as a result
 of the Asian financial crisis, than for non-politically connected firms
 because these firms have a higher risk of financial misstatements. The
 second hypothesis predicts that the audit fees of politically connected
 firms will decline when capital controls are introduced by the government
 as a ploy to financially assist politically connected firms to rebound
 from the crisis, and thus reduces the risk of financial misstatements. The
 results show that there is a greater increase in audit fees for firms with
 political connections than for non-politically connected firms as a result
 of the Asian financial crisis. However, there is a decline in audit fees
 for politically connected firms after the capital controls are
 implemented. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: The Effect of Issuing Biased Earnings Forecasts on Analysts' Access to Management and Survival 
Abstract:
 This study offers evidence on the earnings forecast bias analysts use to
 please firm management and the associated benefits they obtain from
 issuing such biased forecasts in the years prior to Regulation Fair
 Disclosure. Analysts who issue initial optimistic earnings forecasts
 followed by pessimistic earnings forecasts before the earnings
 announcement produce more accurate earnings forecasts and are less likely
 to be fired by their employers. The effect of such biased earnings
 forecasts on forecast accuracy and firing is stronger for analysts who
 follow firms with heavy insider selling and hard-to-predict earnings. The
 above results hold regardless of whether a brokerage firm has investment
 banking business or not. These results are consistent with the hypothesis
 that analysts use biased earnings forecasts to curry favor with firm
 management in order to obtain better access to management's private
 information. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: Insider Trading and Voluntary Disclosures 
Abstract:
 We hypothesize that insiders strategically choose disclosure policies and
 the timing of their equity trades to maximize trading profits, subject to
 the litigation costs associated with disclosure and insider trading.
 Accounting for endogeneity between disclosures and trading, we find that
 when managers plan to purchase shares, they increase the number of bad
 news forecasts to reduce the purchase price. In addition, this relation is
 stronger for trades initiated by chief executive officers than for those
 initiated by other executives. Confirming this strategic behavior, we find
 that managers successfully time their trades around bad news forecasts,
 buying fewer shares beforehand and more afterwards. We do not find that
 managers adjust their forecasting activity when they are selling shares,
 consistent with higher litigation concerns associated with insider sales.
 Overall, our evidence suggests that insiders do exploit voluntary
 disclosure opportunities for personal gain, but only selectively, when
 litigation risk is sufficiently low. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: The Extreme Future Stock Returns Following I/B/E/S Earnings Surprises 
Abstract:
 We investigate the stock returns subsequent to quarterly earnings
 surprises, where the benchmark for an earnings surprise is the consensus
 analyst forecast. By defining the surprise relative to an analyst forecast
 rather than a time-series model of expected earnings, we document returns
 subsequent to earnings announcements that are much larger, persist for
 much longer, and are more heavily concentrated in the long portion of the
 hedge portfolio than shown in previous studies. We show that our results
 hold after controlling for risk and previously documented anomalies, and
 are positive for every quarter between 1988 and 2000. Finally, we explore
 the financial results and information environment of firms with extreme
 earnings surprises and find that they tend to be "neglected" stocks with
 relatively high book-to-market ratios, low analyst coverage, and high
 analyst forecast dispersion. In the three subsequent years, firms with
 extreme positive earnings surprises tend to have persistent earnings
 surprises in the same direction, strong growth in cash flows and earnings,
 and large increases in analyst coverage, relative to firms with extreme
 negative earnings surprises. We also show that the returns to the earnings
 surprise strategy are highest in the quartile of firms where transaction
 costs are highest and institutional investor interest is lowest,
 consistent with the idea that market inefficiencies are more prevalent
 when frictions make it difficult for large, sophisticated investors to
 exploit the inefficiencies. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.

Title: The Press as a Watchdog for Accounting Fraud 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the press's role as a monitor or "watchdog" for
 accounting fraud. I find that the press fulfills this role by
 rebroadcasting information from other information intermediaries
 (analysts, auditors, and lawsuits) and by undertaking original
 investigation and analysis. Articles based on original analysis provide
 new information to the markets while those that rebroadcast allegations
 from other intermediaries do not. Consistent with a dual role for the
 press, I find that business-oriented press is more likely to undertake
 original analysis while nonbusiness periodicals focus primarily on
 rebroadcasting. I also investigate the determinates of press coverage,
 finding systematic biases in the types of firms and frauds for which
 articles are published. In general, the press covers firms and frauds that
 will be of interest to a broad set of readers and situations that are
 lower cost to identify and investigate. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2006.
