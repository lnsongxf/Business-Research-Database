Title: Does the Pricing of Financial Reporting Quality Change Around Dividend Changes? 
Abstract:
We examine whether accrual earnings
 quality is a priced information risk factor in a dividend change setting.
 We define information risk as the probability that firm-specific financial
 statement information pertinent to investor pricing decisions is of low
 precision, and use the factor-mimicking portfolio returns formed on the
 Dechow-Dichev [2002] accrual quality (AQ) metric to proxy for the
 information risk (IR) factor returns. We augment the Fama-French
 three-factor model with this IR factor, and find that dividend initiation
 and increase firms exhibit a decrease in the factor loadings on the IR
 factor while dividend decrease firms exhibit an increase in the
 corresponding factor loadings, but such changes in the factor loadings
 occur months prior to the dividend change announcements. The results are
 robust to further controls for operating risk and using an alternative
 measure of information risk. Further analysis on changes in information
 characteristics such as AQ, the probability of informed trading score
 (PIN), forecast dispersion, and return volatility surrounding dividend
 change events are consistent with the asset pricing results. Overall, we
 interpret our results as being consistent with investors treating the
 information risk associated with the precision of financial statement
 information as a priced risk factor, with both the precision and pricing
 changing in predictable directions around dividend changes. However, while
 we attempt to control for operating risk changes in additional tests, we
 cannot completely rule out changes in operating risk as a competing
 alternative explanation for our observed results. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: Home Bias, Foreign Mutual Fund Holdings, and the Voluntary Adoption of International Accounting Standards 
Abstract:
We test the assertion that a
 consequence of voluntarily adopting International Accounting Standards
 (IAS) is the enhanced ability to attract foreign capital. Using a unique
 database that reports firm-level holdings of over 25,000 mutual funds from
 around the world, our multivariate tests find that average foreign mutual
 fund ownership is significantly higher among IAS adopters. We also find
 that IAS adopters in "poorer information environments" and with "lower
 visibility" have higher levels of foreign investment, consistent with
 firms using IAS adoption to provide more information and/or information in
 a more familiar form to foreign investors. Taken together, our findings
 are consistent with voluntary IAS adoption reducing home bias among
 foreign investors and thereby improving capital allocation efficiency. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: Accounting Measurement Basis, Market Mispricing, and Firm Investment Efficiency 
Abstract:
In this paper, we investigate how the
 accounting measurement basis affects the capital market pricing of a
 firm's shares, which, in turn, affects the efficiency of the firm's
 investment decisions. We distinguish two broad bases for accounting
 measurements: input-based and output-based accounting. We argue that the
 structural difference in the two measurement bases leads to a systematic
 difference in the efficiency of the investment decisions. In particular,
 we show that an output-based measure has a natural advantage in aligning
 investment incentives because of its comprehensiveness. The (first-)best
 investment is achieved when the output-based measure is noiseless and
 manipulation free. In addition, under an output-based measure, more
 accounting noise/manipulation always leads to more inefficient investment
 choices. Therefore, if an output-based accounting measure is highly noisy
 and easy to manipulate in practice, the induced investment efficiency can
 be quite low. On the other hand, an input-based accounting measure, while
 not as comprehensive, may induce more efficient investment decisions than
 an output-based measure if some noise is unavoidable in either measure.
 The reason is twofold. First, input-based measures may be associated with
 less noise and limited manipulation in practice. Second, and more
 importantly, we show that under an input-based measure, a slight increase
 in accounting noise/manipulation may lead to more efficient investment
 choices. In fact, the (first-)best result is achieved when the
 noise/manipulability is small but positive. In other words, for an
 input-based measure, being less comprehensive makes small but positive
 accounting noise/manipulability desirable. Two extensions of the basic
 model are also explored. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: Wealth Transfer Effects of Analysts' Misleading Behavior 
Abstract:
We investigate a sample of 50
 firm-events, identified in the "Global Research Analysts Settlement", in
 which analysts were discovered to have acted misleadingly ex post. In this
 setting, analysts' incentives caused them to issue public disclosures that
 differed from their private beliefs. We document that these firms'
 institutional holdings decline significantly during the period in which
 the analysts issued misleading disclosures. During this period daily
 small-size trades (a proxy for individual investors) are dominated by buy
 orders while daily large-size trades (a proxy for institutional investors)
 are dominated by sell orders. Short interest increases during the event
 period, consistent with the idea that sophisticated investors are selling.
 Our estimates of investors' trading losses show that individual investors
 lost about two and a half times the amount lost by institutions. Overall,
 the results suggest a wealth transfer from individuals to institutions
 that is likely attributable to analysts' misleading behavior. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: Disclosure of Intended Use of Proceeds and Underpricing in Initial Public Offerings 
Abstract:
We use the context of a company's
 initial public offering (IPO) of equity securities as a capital-markets
 setting to empirically study the economic consequences of endogenous
 disclosure. In particular, we examine the relation between the extent of
 dollar detail an IPO issuer provides regarding their intended use of
 proceeds and first-day underpricing. We document substantial variation in
 the specificity of this disclosure and find that an increase in such
 specificity is associated with lower IPO underpricing. Overall, our
 results suggest that IPOs that provide specific use-of-proceeds
 disclosures have less ex ante uncertainty, in the sense that these
 disclosures help investors estimate the dispersion of secondary market
 values. Our paper contributes to the empirical accounting literature by
 documenting an association between voluntary disclosure and what is
 arguably the foremost cost of raising initial equity capital (i.e., IPO
 underpricing). Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: Understanding Stock Price Volatility: The Role of Earnings 
Abstract:
In an efficient capital market, asset
 prices vary when investors change their expectations about cash flows,
 discount rates, or both. Using dividends to measure cash flows, previous
 research shows that the aggregate dividend-price ratio varies due to
 changes in expected discount rates (returns) rather than expected cash
 flows. In contrast, using accounting earnings instead of dividends as a
 measure of cash flows, this paper shows that as much as 70% of the
 variation in the dividend-price ratio can be explained by changes in
 expected earnings. Moreover, the paper documents a significant negative
 correlation between expected returns and expected earnings, suggesting
 that variations in a common factor to both may generate significant price
 volatility. The results are consistent with the dividend-policy
 irrelevance hypothesis. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.
