Title: Market Transparency and the Accounting Regime 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We model the interaction of financial
 market transparency and different accounting regimes. This paper provides
 a theoretical rationale for the recently proposed shift in accounting
 standards from historic cost accounting to marking to market. The paper
 shows that marking to market can provide investors with an early warning
 mechanism while historical cost gives management a "veil" under which they
 can potentially mask a firm's true economic performance. The model
 provides new explanations for several empirical findings and has some
 novel implications. We show that greater opacity in financial markets
 leads to more frequent and more severe crashes in asset prices (under a
 historic-cost-accounting regime). Moreover, our model indicates that
 historic cost accounting can make the financial market more rather than
 less volatile, which runs counter to conventional wisdom. The mechanism
 shown in the model also sheds light on the cause of many financial
 scandals in recent years. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: Assessing the Information Content of Mark-to-Market Accounting with Mixed Attributes: The Case of Cash Flow Hedges 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We examine how outsiders rationally
 interpret a reported loss on derivatives when the application of
 mark-to-market accounting to cash flow hedges creates a mixed attribute
 problem. We find that because of the mixed attribute problem, the
 information content of mark-to-market accounting is related to the
 information content of historical cost accounting in a very specific way.
 This relationship allows us to identify the circumstances under which
 mark-to-market accounting facilitates and when it detracts from the
 objective of providing an early warning of potential financial distress.
 We show that the reporting of an impending derivative loss by a distressed
 firm can actually lead outsiders to infer that the firm is in a better
 financial position than what they would have inferred under the silence
 associated with historical cost accounting. Without the mixed attribute
 problem, mark-to-market accounting would always yield more accurate
 assessments of the firm's financial position. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: Which Institutional Investors Trade Based on Private Information About Earnings and Returns? 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Recent work suggests that institutional
 investors execute profitable trades based on private information about
 earnings and returns. We provide new evidence on the prevalence and
 sources of such informed trading by (1) testing for the creation "and"
 liquidation of positions based on private information, (2) introducing
 private information proxies that reflect the size and nature of an
 institution's position in each portfolio firm, and (3) using a methodology
 that examines multiple investor characteristics simultaneously at the
 institution-firm level. We find that changes in ownership by institutions
 with large positions in a firm are consistent with informed trading.
 However, other previously documented proxies for private information
 produce results more consistent with risk-based trading (e.g., investment
 style) or insignificant in the presence of other proxies (e.g., fiduciary
 type). We also find that informed trading is more prevalent in small firms
 and when the large positions are taken by investment advisers and large
 institutions. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: IPO Failure Risk 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We explore the factors associated with
 historical IPO failures by developing an IPO failure prediction model that
 includes accounting information as well as proxies for the role of
 information intermediaries and other IPO deal-related characteristics. We
 document statistically significant differences in failure models
 applicable to nontech versus high tech IPOs, and these structural
 differences are largely driven by accounting-based proxies for firms'
 investments in intangible assets, operating performance, and financial
 leverage. We also develop parsimonious, predominantly accounting-based,
 strictly out-of-sample (i.e., no hindsight) IPO failure forecasting models
 for each of the two sectors. We find that our forecasts are negatively
 associated with one-year post-IPO abnormal returns. A pseudo-hedge
 strategy of going short (long) in high (low) failure risk portfolios
 yields returns of economically significant magnitudes over the one-year
 horizon, and is robust to alternative returns methodologies. Further
 results suggest that IPO long-run returns anomalies may persist, but they
 take different forms for high-tech and nontech IPOs. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: Accounting Information, Disclosure, and the Cost of Capital 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>In this paper we examine whether and
 how accounting information about a firm manifests in its cost of capital,
 despite the forces of diversification. We build a model that is consistent
 with the Capital Asset Pricing Model and explicitly allows for multiple
 securities whose cash flows are correlated. We demonstrate that the
 quality of accounting information can influence the cost of capital, both
 directly and indirectly. The direct effect occurs because higher quality
 disclosures affect the firm's assessed covariances with other firms' cash
 flows, which is nondiversifiable. The indirect effect occurs because
 higher quality disclosures affect a firm's real decisions, which likely
 changes the firm's ratio of the expected future cash flows to the
 covariance of these cash flows with the sum of all the cash flows in the
 market. We show that this effect can go in either direction, but also
 derive conditions under which an increase in information quality leads to
 an unambiguous decline in the cost of capital. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: The Book-to-Price Effect in Stock Returns: Accounting for Leverage 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper lays out a decomposition of
 book-to-price (B/P) that derives from the accounting for book value and
 that articulates precisely how B/P "absorbs" leverage. The B/P ratio can
 be decomposed into an enterprise book-to-price (that pertains to
 operations and potentially reflects operating risk) and a leverage
 component (that reflects financing risk). The empirical analysis shows
 that the enterprise book-to-price ratio is positively related to
 subsequent stock returns but, conditional upon the enterprise
 book-to-price, the leverage component of B/P is "negatively" associated
 with future stock returns. Further, both enterprise book-to-price and
 leverage explain returns over those associated with Fama and French
 nominated factors-including the book-to-price factor-albeit negatively so
 for leverage. The seemingly perverse finding with respect to the leverage
 component of B/P survives under controls for size, estimated beta, return
 volatility, momentum, and default risk. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.
