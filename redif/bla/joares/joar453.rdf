Title: What Makes a Stock Risky? Evidence from Sell-Side Analysts' Risk Ratings 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We examine the determinants and the
 informativeness of financial analysts' risk ratings using a large sample
 of research reports issued by Salomon Smith Barney, now Citigroup, over
 the period 1997-2003. We find that the cross-sectional variation in risk
 ratings is largely explained by variables commonly viewed as measures of
 risk, such as idiosyncratic risk, size, book-to-market, and leverage. In
 addition, earnings-based measures of risk, such as earnings quality and
 accounting losses, also contribute to explaining the cross-sectional
 variation in the risk ratings. Finally, we document that the risk ratings
 can be used to predict future return volatility after controlling for
 other predictors of future volatility. We conclude that analysts play an
 important role as providers of information about investment risk. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: On the Relation between Conservatism in Accounting Standards and Incentives for Earnings Management 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper studies the role of
 conservative accounting standards in alleviating rational yet
 dysfunctional unobservable earnings manipulation. We show that when
 accounting numbers serve both the valuation role (in which potential
 investors use accounting reports to assess a firm's expected future
 payoff) and the stewardship role (in which current shareholders rely on
 the same reports to monitor their risk-averse manager), current firm
 owners have incentives to engage in earnings management. Such manipulation
 reduces accounting numbers' stewardship value and leads to inferior risk
 sharing. We then show that risk sharing, and hence contract efficiency,
 can be improved under a conservative accounting standard where, absent
 earnings management, accounting earnings represent true economic earnings
 with a downward bias, compared with under an unbiased standard where,
 absent earnings management, accounting earnings represent true economic
 earnings without bias. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: Measure for Measure: The Relation between Forecast Accuracy and Recommendation Profitability of Analysts 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We examine the contemporaneous relation
 between earnings forecast accuracy and recommendation profitability to
 assess the effectiveness with which analysts translate forecasts into
 profitable recommendations. We find that, after controlling for expertise,
 more accurate analysts make more profitable recommendations, albeit only
 for firms with value-relevant earnings. Next, we show that conflicts of
 interest from investment banking activities affect the relation between
 accuracy and profitability. In the case of buy recommendations, more
 accurate forecasts are associated with more profitable recommendations
 only for the nonconflicted analysts. For hold recommendations, higher
 levels of accuracy are associated with higher levels of profitability for
 conflicted analysts, provided these recommendations are treated as sells.
 Finally, we find that regulatory reforms aimed at mitigating analyst
 conflicts of interest appear to have improved the relation between
 accuracy and profitability. Specifically, the integrity of buy and hold
 recommendations has improved and the change is more pronounced for
 analysts expected to be most conflicted. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: Investor Reaction to Celebrity Analysts: The Case of Earnings Forecast Revisions 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We examine the effects of analysts'
 celebrity on investor reaction to earnings forecast revisions. We measure
 celebrity as the quantity of media coverage analysts receive in sources
 included in the Dow Jones Interactive database, and find that media
 coverage is positively related to investor reaction to forecast revisions.
 The effect of celebrity on the reaction to forecast revisions remains
 significant after controlling for forecast performance variables examined
 in prior studies (ex post forecast accuracy, ex ante accuracy, award
 status, and other variables shown to be related to forecast accuracy).
 While these results are consistent with the familiarity of the analyst's
 name affecting the market reaction, we cannot rule out that our measure of
 celebrity is correlated with error in the performance measures we examine
 and/or correlated with other unexamined dimensions of forecast
 performance. A content analysis of a random subsample of the media
 coverage of our sample analysts suggests that our findings likely are not
 due to the increased availability of forecast revisions. Finally, an
 investigation of the excess returns around the quarterly earnings
 announcement date suggests that market participants react too strongly to
 forecast revisions issued by analysts with high levels of media coverage.
 Taken together, these findings suggest that an analyst's level of media
 coverage can affect the initial market reaction to his forecast revisions. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: Performance Measure Congruity and the Balanced Scorecard 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper studies the incentive
 effects of a balanced scorecard within a multitask agency framework under
 both formal and relational contracts. First, the main characteristics of
 the balanced scorecard are analyzed with respect to performance measure
 congruity. It is shown that under complete verifiability, a properly
 designed balanced scorecard is capable of perfectly aligning the interests
 of owners and employees by means of an explicit contract. I then
 investigate whether subjective performance evaluation is beneficial when
 not all the scorecard measures are contractible. It emerges that congruity
 of the contractible scorecard measures constrains a purely implicit
 incentive contract, but the first-best solution may still be obtained
 through a combination of formal and relational contracts. Furthermore, a
 purely explicit contract in most cases can be improved by incorporating
 subjective rewards. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: Directional Preferences, Information Processing, and Investors' Forecasts of Earnings 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper investigates the effects of
 preferences on judgments in an investing context, where investors should
 be motivated to interpret information objectively, yet have clear
 preferences with respect to what the information they are evaluating
 conveys (i.e., a gain or a loss on their investment). The results of the
 experiment are consistent with theories of motivated reasoning that
 predict when and in what manner directional preferences affect how
 information is processed. Specifically, investors are motivated to agree
 unthinkingly with information that suggests they might make money on their
 investment, but disagree with information that suggests they might lose
 money. In disagreeing, long investors expect earnings to be relatively
 high and short investors expect earnings to be relatively low. These
 results have implications not only for understanding investor behavior,
 but also for understanding the biased behavior of market participants who
 face conflicts of interest, such as analysts, managers, and auditors, by
 providing direct evidence that such behavior can arise for purely
 psychological reasons. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.
