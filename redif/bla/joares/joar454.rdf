Title: Accounting Standards, Implementation Guidance, and Example-Based Reasoning 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper examines interpretation of
 accounting standards that provide implementation guidance via affirmative
 or counter examples. Based on prior psychology research, we predict that
 practitioners engage in "example-based reasoning" such that they are more
 likely to conclude that their case qualifies for the same treatment as the
 example. We test our predictions in two experiments in which participants
 judge the appropriateness of income-statement recognition. Experiment 1
 uses Masters of Business Administration (MBA) students and varies example
 type (affirmative, counter) and case (revenue recognition, expense
 recognition) in a 2 &times; 2 design. Experiment 1 supports our
 predictions. Experiment 2 uses more experienced practitioners, and varies
 example type (affirmative, counter, both) in a 1 &times; 3 design.
 Experiment 2 supports the use of example-based reasoning, and indicates
 that practitioners in the "both" condition respond as if they had only
 received an affirmative example. These results have implications for
 understanding how guidance that accompanies accounting standards can
 result in aggressive or conservative application of standards. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: The Allocational Effects of the Precision of Accounting Estimates 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper studies the allocational
 effects associated with the precision of accounting estimates when the
 precision of estimates is a choice variable for firms. One part of the
 paper considers the effects of the observability of precision choices. We
 show that, generally, making precision choices private increases firms'
 equilibrium precision choices and also, as a by-product, their equilibrium
 investment choices. We further show that, when firms' precision choices
 are private, there may be a "disclosure trap," in which, unless investors
 conjecture the owner has chosen an estimate with the highest possible
 precision, the owner will respond to investors' conjecture by choosing an
 estimate whose precision is higher than investors' conjecture. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: The Credibility of Voluntary Disclosure and Insider Stock Transactions 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We examine stock price reaction to
 voluntary disclosure of innovation strategy by high-tech firms and its
 relation with insider stock transactions before the disclosure. We find
 that, despite the qualitative and subjective nature of strategy-related
 disclosure, there is positive stock price reaction to the disclosure. The
 evidence suggests that investors view the disclosure as credible good
 news. We also find that the disclosure is associated with more positive
 stock price reaction when it is preceded by insider purchase transactions.
 This evidence is consistent with insider purchase enhancing the
 credibility of the disclosure. The credibility-enhancing effect is found
 to be stronger for firms with higher degrees of information asymmetry
 (younger firms, firms with lower analyst following, loss firms, and firms
 with higher research and development (R&D) intensity). Our evidence also
 indicates that predisclosure insider purchase is associated with greater
 future abnormal returns, suggesting that managers are privy to good news
 shortly before the disclosure. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: Assessing the Performance of Business Unit Managers 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Using a sample of 140 managers, we
 investigate the use of various performance metrics in determining the
 periodic assessment, bonus decisions, and career paths of business unit
 managers. We show that the weight on accounting return measures is
 associated with the authority of these managers, and we document that both
 disaggregated measures (expenses and revenues), and nonfinancial measures
 play a greater role as interdependencies between business units increase.
 The results suggest separate and distinct roles for different types of
 performance measures. Accounting return measures are used to create the
 proper incentives for managers with greater authority, while disaggregated
 and nonfinancial measures are employed in response to interdependencies. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: How Disaggregation Enhances the Credibility of Management Earnings Forecasts 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>An important problem facing managers is
 how to enhance the credibility, or believability, of their earnings
 forecasts. In this paper, we experimentally test whether a characteristic
 of a management earnings forecast-namely, whether it is disaggregated-can
 affect its credibility. We also test whether disaggregation moderates the
 relation between managerial incentives and forecast credibility.
 Disaggregated forecasts include an earnings forecast as well as forecasts
 of other key line items comprising that earnings forecast. Our results
 indicate that disaggregated forecasts are judged to be more credible than
 aggregated ones and that disaggregation works to counteract the effect of
 high incentives. We also develop and test an original model that explains
 "how" disaggregation positively impacts three factors that, in turn,
 influence forecast credibility: perceived precision of management's
 beliefs, perceived clarity of the forecast, and perceived financial
 reporting quality. We show that forecast disaggregation works to remedy
 incentive problems only via its effect on perceived financial reporting
 quality. Overall, our study adds to our understanding of how managers can
 credibly communicate their expectations about the future to market
 participants. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: Performance Evaluations and Efficient Sorting 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Much of the production in firms takes
 place over time. This paper seeks to understand the value of interim
 performance information on long projects. In particular, the model
 explores the sorting effects of performance evaluations. Conducting an
 interim performance evaluation increases efficiency by providing the
 option to end projects with low early returns. The main result: It is
 efficient to allocate more resources towards the end of a project. This
 result holds under a variety of scenarios: when the worker has unknown
 ability, when the outside options vary with output, and even under an
 agency framework with a risk-averse agent. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.
