Title: Resource Allocation Auctions within Firms 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>There is growing interest in the use of
 markets within firms. Proponents have noted that markets are a simple and
 efficient mechanism for allocating resources in economies in which
 information is dispersed. In contrast to the use of markets in the broader
 economy, the efficiency of an "internal market" is determined in large
 part by the "endogenous" contractual incentives provided to the
 participating, privately informed agents. In this paper, we study the
 optimal design of managerial incentives when resources are allocated by an
 internal auction market, as well as the efficiency of the resulting
 resource allocations. We show that the internal auction market can achieve
 first-best resource allocations and decisions, but only at an excessive
 cost in compensation payments. We then identify conditions under which the
 internal auction market and associated optimal incentive contracts achieve
 the benchmark second-best outcome as determined using a direct revelation
 mechanism. The advantage of the auction is that it is easier to implement
 than the direct revelation mechanism. When the internal auction mechanism
 is unable to achieve second-best, we characterize the factors that
 determine the magnitude of the shortfall. Overall, our results speak to
 the robust performance of relatively simple market mechanisms and
 associated incentive systems in resolving resource allocation problems
 within firms. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: To What Extent Does the Financial Reporting Process Curb Earnings Surprise Games? 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Managers play earnings surprise games
 to avoid negative earnings surprises by managing earnings upward or by
 managing analysts' earnings expectations downward. We investigate the
 effectiveness of the financial reporting process at restraining earnings
 surprise games. Because the annual reporting process is subject to an
 independent audit and more rigorous expense recognition rules than interim
 reporting, it provides managers with fewer opportunities to manage
 earnings upward. We document that, relative to interim reporting, annual
 reporting reduces the likelihood of income-increasing earnings management
 and, to a lesser extent, of negative surprise avoidance, but increases the
 magnitude of downward expectations management. Our findings suggest that
 regulatory attempts to monitor corporations' internal checks and balances
 are likely to be more effective at curbing upward earnings management than
 at mitigating negative surprise avoidance. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: Effect of Analysts' Optimism on Estimates of the Expected Rate of Return Implied by Earnings Forecasts 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Recent literature has used analysts'
 earnings forecasts, which are known to be optimistic, to estimate implied
 expected rates of return, yielding upwardly biased estimates. We estimate
 that the bias, computed as the difference between the estimates of the
 implied expected rate of return based on analysts' earnings forecasts and
 estimates based on current earnings realizations, is 2.84%. The importance
 of this bias is illustrated by the fact that several extant studies
 estimate an equity premium in the vicinity of 3%, which would be
 eliminated by the removal of the bias. We illustrate the point that
 cross-sample differences in the bias may lead to the erroneous conclusion
 that cost of capital differs across these samples by showing that
 analysts' optimism, and hence, bias in the implied estimates of the
 expected rate of return, differs with firm size and with analysts'
 recommendation. As an important aside, we show that the bias in a
 value-weighted estimate of the implied equity premium is 1.60% and that
 the unbiased value-weighted estimate of this premium is 4.43%. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: Financial Reporting and Supplemental Voluntary Disclosures 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>A standard result in the voluntary
 disclosure literature is that when the manager's private information is a
 signal correlated with the firm's liquidation value, mandatory disclosures
 substitute for voluntary disclosures. In this paper, we assume that the
 manager's private information complements the mandatory disclosure and
 show that the content and likelihood of a voluntary disclosure depend on
 whether the mandatory reports contain good or bad news. This different
 information asymmetry produces new, testable implications regarding the
 probability of and market reaction to voluntary disclosures. We also show
 that changes in mandatory disclosure regulations can have unintended
 consequences due to their effects on the manager's willingness to
 voluntarily provide supplemental disclosures. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: The Use of Unsigned Earnings Quality Measures in Tests of Earnings Management 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper examines the implications of
 using the absolute value of discretionary accruals when testing for
 earnings management. First, we analytically develop the mean and variance
 of the distribution of absolute discretionary accruals, and show that the
 expected value is an increasing function of the variance in the underlying
 error term from the first-stage discretionary accrual estimation model.
 Second, we highlight several firm characteristics that are related to the
 error variance in discretionary accrual estimation models. Using
 simulations, we show that correlation between the earnings management
 partitioning variable and these firm characteristics leads to an
 overrejection of the null hypothesis of no earnings management. Third, we
 provide research design suggestions to help researchers mitigate the
 potential bias arising from the use of unsigned measures of earnings
 management. Using these suggestions, we replicate a recent study, and
 demonstrate that the inferences change after controlling for operating
 volatility. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: An Analysis of Insiders' Use of Prepaid Variable Forward Transactions 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This study examines firm performance
 surrounding insiders' prepaid variable forward (PVF) transactions to infer
 insiders' information when they enter these off-market contracts. PVFs
 allow insiders to hedge downside risk, share performance gains, and obtain
 immediate large-sum cash payments for investment or consumption. On
 average, PVF transactions cover 30% of a sample insider's firm-specific
 wealth ($22 million), which is substantially larger than a typical
 open-market sale. PVFs systematically follow strong firm performance and
 precede degraded stock and earnings performance. PVFs also precede periods
 of negative abnormal returns relative to potential alternative
 investments. The documented association between PVFs and performance
 declines does not appear to result from the market's response to
 transaction disclosure, participant self-selection, or general price
 reversals. Thus, evidence suggests that insiders use PVFs to diversify
 firm-specific holdings in anticipation of performance declines. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.

Title: Regression-Based Tests of the Market Pricing of Accounting Numbers: The Mishkin Test and Ordinary Least Squares 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>The test developed in Mishkin [1983]
 (hereafter, MT) is widely used to test the rational pricing of accounting
 numbers. However, contrary to the perception in the accounting literature,
 the exclusion of variables from the MT's forecasting and pricing equations
 leads to an omitted variables problem that affects inferences about the
 rational pricing of accounting variables. Only if the omitted variables
 are rationally priced is their exclusion irrelevant. Failure to recognize
 this issue leads accounting researchers to employ the MT without
 appreciating how omitted variables affect the inferences they draw. We
 demonstrate that when additional explanatory variables are included in the
 MT, the rational pricing of accruals is not rejected. That is, the accrual
 anomaly documented in Sloan [1996] vanishes when additional explanatory
 variables are incorporated into the MT. We also show that in accounting
 research settings, where samples are large, ordinary least squares (OLS)
 is equivalent to the MT. As a result, accounting researchers should
 consider using OLS or be more explicit about the exact advantages of the
 MT over OLS in their research setting. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2007.
