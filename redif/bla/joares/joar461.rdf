Title: Do Mutual Funds Profit from the Accruals Anomaly? 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Using data on both fund stockholdings
 and fund returns, we examine whether actively managed equity mutual funds
 trade on and profit from the accruals anomaly. We find that few, if any,
 mutual funds trade on the anomaly. The top 10% of mutual funds that have
 the highest portfolio weights in low-accruals stocks have a greater, but
 still relatively small, exposure to low-accruals stocks. Nonetheless,
 these funds make significant profit net of "actual" transaction costs,
 exhibiting an average Fama-French three-factor alpha of 2.83% per year. We
 also find that these funds are smaller, less diversified, and exhibit
 higher fund return volatility and higher fund flow volatility. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: A Reexamination of the Tradeoff between the Future Benefit and Riskiness of R&D Increases 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Many previous studies document a
 positive relation between research and development (R&D) and equity value.
 Though R&D can increase equity value by increasing firm value, it can also
 increase equity value at the expense of bondholder wealth through an
 increase in firm risk because equity is analogous to a call option on the
 underlying firm value. Shi [2003] tests this hypothesis by examining the
 relation between a firm's R&D intensity and its bond ratings and risk
 premiums at issuance. His results show that the net effect of R&D is
 negative for bondholders. We reexamine Shi's [2003] findings and in so
 doing make three contributions to the literature. First, we find that
 Shi's [2003] results are sensitive to the method of measuring R&D
 intensity. When we use what we argue is a better measure of R&D intensity,
 we find that the net effect of R&D is positive for bondholders. Second,
 when we use tests that Shi [2003] recognizes are even better than the ones
 that he uses, we find even stronger evidence of the positive effect of R&D
 on bondholders. Third, we examine cross-sectional differences in the
 effect of R&D on debtholders. Consistent with our main finding, we
 document a negative relation between R&D increases and default risk. The
 default risk reduction is also more pronounced for firms with higher
 initial default scores (where the debtholders have more to gain from an
 R&D increase) and for firms with more bank debt (where the debtholders
 have greater covenant protection from the possible detriments associated
 with R&D increases). Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Relationship Incentives and the Optimistic/Pessimistic Pattern in Analysts' Forecasts 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We examine whether analysts' incentives
 to maintain good relationships with management contribute to the
 optimistic/pessimistic within-period time trend in analysts' forecasts. In
 our experiments, 81 experienced sell-side analysts from two brokerage
 firms predict earnings based on historical information and management
 guidance. Analysts' forecasts exhibit an optimistic/pessimistic pattern
 across the two timing conditions (early and late in the quarter), and the
 effect is significantly stronger when the analysts have a good
 relationship with management than when their only incentive is to be
 accurate. Debriefing results indicate that analysts are aware of this
 pattern of forecasts, and believe that this benefits their future
 relationships with management and with brokerage clients. The analysts
 most frequently cite favored conference call participation and information
 access when describing benefits from maintaining good relationships with
 management. Our results suggest the following: The optimistic/pessimistic
 pattern in forecasts is in part a conscious response to relationship
 incentives, information access is perceived to be a major benefit of
 management relationships, and recent regulatory changes may have lessened
 but have not eliminated this conflict of interest source. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Non-audit Service Fees and Audit Quality: The Impact of Auditor Specialization 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We posit that the effect of non-audit
 fees on audit quality is conditional on auditor industry specialization.
 Industry specialist auditors are more likely than nonspecialists to be
 concerned about reputation losses and litigation exposure, and to benefit
 from knowledge spillovers from the provision of non-audit services. We
 find evidence that audit quality measured by increased propensity to issue
 going-concern opinion, increased propensity to miss analysts' forecasts,
 as well as higher earnings-response coefficients increases with the level
 of non-audit services acquired from industry specialist auditors compared
 to nonspecialist auditors. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Voluntary Disclosure, Earnings Quality, and Cost of Capital 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We investigate the relations among
 voluntary disclosure, earnings quality, and cost of capital. We find that
 firms with good earnings quality have more expansive voluntary disclosures
 (as proxied by a self-constructed index of coded items found in 677 firms'
 annual reports and 10-K filings in fiscal 2001) than firms with poor
 earnings quality. In unconditional tests, we find that more voluntary
 disclosure is associated with a lower cost of capital. However, consistent
 with the complementary association between disclosure and earnings
 quality, we find that the disclosure effect on cost of capital is
 substantially reduced or disappears completely (depending on the cost of
 capital proxy) once we condition on earnings quality. Extensions probing
 alternative proxies show that our findings are robust to measures of
 earnings quality and cost of capital, but not to other measures of
 voluntary disclosure. In particular, we find opposite relations for
 voluntary disclosure measures based on management forecasts and conference
 calls, and we find no relations for a press release based measure. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Managerial Ownership and Accounting Conservatism 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>In this paper we examine the effect of
 managerial ownership on financial reporting conservatism. Separation of
 ownership and control gives rise to agency problems between managers and
 shareholders. Financial reporting conservatism is one potential mechanism
 to address these agency problems. We hypothesize that, as managerial
 ownership declines, the severity of agency problem increases, increasing
 the demand for conservatism. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that
 conservatism as measured by the asymmetric timeliness of earnings declines
 with managerial ownership. The negative association between managerial
 ownership and asymmetric timeliness of earnings is robust to various
 controls, in particular, for the investment opportunity set. We thus
 provide evidence of a demand for conservatism from the firm's
 shareholders. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Board Independence and CEO Turnover 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper analyzes how board
 independence affects the CEO's ability to extract rents from the firm. The
 CEO is assumed to possess private information about his ability, which the
 board needs in order to decide whether to replace him. If the board is
 more active in removing low quality CEOs, the incumbent is better able to
 use his information advantage to extract rents. Since the board cannot
 commit not to renegotiate the contract, a board that is fully independent
 from the CEO is more active than is efficient ex ante. For this reason,
 shareholders are better off if the board of directors lacks some
 independence. The model predicts that a trend toward greater board
 independence is associated with subsequent trends toward higher CEO
 turnover, more generous severance packages, and larger stock option
 grants. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.
