Title: The Debt-Contracting Value of Accounting Information and Loan Syndicate Structure 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We investigate how both the ownership
 structure and explicit contractual structure of syndicated loan deals are
 shaped by the debt-contracting value (DCV) of borrowers' accounting
 information. DCV captures the inherent ability of firms' accounting
 numbers to capture credit quality deterioration in a timely fashion. We
 hypothesize and document that when a borrower's accounting information
 possesses higher DCV, information asymmetry between the lead arranger and
 other syndicate participants is lower, allowing lead arrangers to hold a
 smaller proportion of new loan deals. Further, we document that the
 influence of DCV on the proportion of the loan retained is conditional on
 the lead arranger's reputation, the existence of a credit rating, and the
 lead arranger's previous relationships with the same borrower. Finally, we
 find that when loans include performance pricing provisions, the
 likelihood that the single performance measure used is an accounting
 ratio, rather than a credit rating, is increasing in DCV. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Nonfinancial Performance Measures and Promotion-Based Incentives 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>In this paper, I examine the
 sensitivity of promotion and demotion decisions for lower-level managers
 to financial and nonfinancial measures of their performance and
 investigate the extent to which the behavior of lower-level managers
 reflects promotion-based incentives. Additionally, I test for learning
 versus effort-allocation effects of promotion-based incentives. I find
 that promotion and demotion decisions for store managers of a major
 U.S.-based fast-food retailer (QSR) are sensitive to nonfinancial
 performance measures of service quality and employee retention after
 controlling for financial performance. The likelihood of demotion in this
 organization is also sensitive to nonfinancial performance on the
 dimension of service quality, while the probability of exit is primarily
 sensitive to financial performance measures rather than nonfinancial
 performance measures. I also find evidence that the behavior of
 lower-level managers is consistent with the incentives created by the
 weighting of nonfinancial performance measures in promotion decisions.
 Managers in locations where there is a higher ex ante probability of
 promotion and a higher potential reward upon promotion demonstrate
 significantly higher levels and rates of performance improvement in
 service quality. Finally, consistent with promotion-based incentives
 inducing both effort-allocation and learning effects, I find that
 performance-improvement rates for service quality: (1) are higher in
 prepromotion periods in markets where promotions occur, (2) decrease
 immediately after the occurrence of a promotion in the same market area,
 and (3) remain higher than in markets where promotions do not occur. These
 findings provide some of the first empirical evidence on an alternative to
 the explicit weighting of nonfinancial metrics in compensation contracts
 as a mechanism for generating improvements in nonfinancial dimensions of
 performance. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Measuring and Motivating Quantity, Creativity, or Both 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We examine how worker productivity
 differs when compensation is based on quantity, creativity, or the product
 of both measures. In an experiment in which participants design "rebus
 puzzles," we find that combining quantity and creativity measures in a
 creativity-weighted pay scheme results in creativity-weighted productivity
 scores that are significantly lower than those generated by participants
 with quantity incentives alone. Follow-up analysis indicates that relative
 to participants in the quantity-only condition, participants in the
 creativity-weighted condition produce approximately the same number of
 high-creativity puzzles, but produce significantly fewer puzzles overall.
 Thus, while participants rewarded for creativity-weighted output tend to
 restrict their production to high-creativity efforts, they are unable to
 translate this focus into a greater volume of high-creativity output.
 Implications address a possible explanation for firms' reluctance to
 incorporate creativity measures within multidimensional performance
 measurement systems, notwithstanding published suggestions to do so. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Regulation and Bonding: The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Flow of International Listings 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>In this paper, we examine the economic
 impact of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) by analyzing foreign listing
 behavior onto U.S. and U.K. stock exchanges before and after the enactment
 of SOX in 2002. Using a sample of all listing events onto U.S. and U.K.
 exchanges from 1995-2006, we develop an exchange choice model that
 captures firm-level, industry-level, exchange-level, and country-level
 listing incentives, and test whether these listing preferences changed
 following the enactment of SOX. After controlling for firm characteristics
 and other economic determinants of these firms' exchange choice, we find
 that the listing preferences of large foreign firms choosing between U.S.
 exchanges and the London Stock Exchange's (LSE) Main Market did not change
 following the enactment of SOX. In contrast, we find that the likelihood
 of a U.S. listing among small foreign firms choosing between the NASDAQ
 and LSE's Alternative Investment Market decreased following the enactment
 of SOX. The negative effect among small firms is consistent with these
 marginal companies being less able to absorb the incremental costs
 associated with SOX compliance. The screening of smaller firms with weaker
 governance attributes from U.S. exchanges is consistent with the
 heightened governance costs imposed by SOX increasing the bonding-related
 benefits of a U.S. listing. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Marking-to-Market: Panacea or Pandora's Box? 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Financial institutions have been at the
 forefront of the debate on the controversial shift in international
 standards from historical cost accounting to mark-to-market accounting. We
 show that the trade-offs at stake in this debate are far from one-sided.
 While the historical cost regime leads to some inefficiencies,
 marking-to-market may lead to other types of inefficiencies by injecting
 artificial risk that degrades the information value of prices, and induces
 suboptimal real decisions. We construct a framework that can weigh the
 pros and cons. We find that the damage done by marking-to-market is
 greatest when claims are (1) long-lived, (2) illiquid, and (3) senior.
 These are precisely the attributes of the key balance sheet items of banks
 and insurance companies. Our results therefore shed light on why banks and
 insurance companies have been the most vocal opponents of the shift to
 marking-to-market. Copyright University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.
