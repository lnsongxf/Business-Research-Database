Title: The Persistence and Pricing of the Cash Component of Earnings 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Prior research shows that the cash
 component of earnings is more persistent than the accrual component. We
 decompose the cash component into: (1) the change in the cash balance, (2)
 issuances/distributions to debt, and (3) issuances/distributions to
 equity. We find that the higher persistence of the cash component is
 entirely due to the subcomponent related to equity. The other
 subcomponents have persistence levels almost identical to accruals. We
 investigate whether investors understand the implications of the
 differential persistence of the three subcomponents. Our results suggest
 that investors correctly price debt and equity issuances/distributions but
 misprice the change in the cash balance in a similar manner to accruals.
 Our tests enable us to empirically distinguish the "accrual" and "external
 financing" anomalies with results implying that the accrual anomaly
 subsumes the external financing anomaly. Our results also suggest that
 naive fixation on earnings is unlikely to be a complete explanation for
 the accrual anomaly. Our findings are more consistent with investors
 misunderstanding diminishing returns to new investments. Copyright (c)University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Intertemporal Dynamics of Corporate Voluntary Disclosures 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>While empirical evidence alludes to the
 intertemporal nature of corporate voluntary disclosures, most of the
 existing theory analyzes firms' voluntary disclosure decisions within
 single-period settings. Introducing a repeated, multiperiod, disclosure
 setting, we study the extent to which firms' strategic disclosure behavior
 in the past affects their prosperity to provide voluntary disclosures in
 the future. Our analysis demonstrates that by voluntarily disclosing
 private information firms make an implicit commitment to provide similar
 disclosures in the future, and therefore are less willing to voluntarily
 disclose information in the first place. This effect is expected to be of
 larger magnitude for firms (1) with a long history of absence of voluntary
 disclosures and an impressive past operating performance, or (2) that
 operate in a relatively stable and predictable business and information
 environment, or (3) whose managers have a long time horizon and a high
 degree of risk aversion. Copyright (c)University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Evidence of Management Discrimination Among Analysts during Earnings Conference Calls 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper considers the potential for
 public information disclosures to complement the existing private
 information of financial analysts. In such a setting, analysts allowed to
 participate during earnings conference calls by asking questions receive
 public signals that can facilitate the generation of new and valuable
 private information for the asking analyst. Realizing these public signals
 are valuable for the asking analyst, managers can use their discretion to
 discriminate among analysts by granting more participation to more
 favorable analysts. I use post-Regulation Fair Disclosure conference call
 transcripts to document that the probability of an analyst asking a
 question during an earnings conference call is increasing in the
 favorableness of the analyst's outstanding stock recommendation. I also
 find that downgrades are associated with decreases in access to management
 during the conference call relative to other recommendation change
 activity. Analyst prestige moderates these effects. Favorable and
 prestigious analysts have higher participation probabilities than
 favorable and unprestigious analysts. Further, downgrades result in
 participation decreases only for unprestigious analysts. These findings
 are consistent with practitioner and regulatory concerns that managers
 discriminate among analysts by allowing more management access to more
 favorable analysts. Copyright (c)University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Regulation Fair Disclosure and the Cost of Adverse Selection 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD),
 imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in October 2000, was
 designed to prohibit disclosure of material private information to
 selected market participants. The informational advantage such select
 participants gain is unclear. If multiple "insiders" receive identical
 information, private information is immediately incorporated in price and
 each insider has zero expected profit. If, on the other hand, Regulation
 FD has curtailed the flow of information from firms, private information
 becomes longer-lived and more valuable. Hence, market makers will demand
 increased compensation by widening the adverse selection component of the
 bid-ask spread. We identify the cost components of the bid-ask spread for
 a sample of NASDAQ stocks surrounding the implementation of Regulation FD.
 Controlling for other factors affecting the spread, we find that adverse
 selection costs increase approximately 36% after Regulation FD. We
 interpret our finding as Regulation FD failing to achieve one of its
 desired objectives. Copyright (c)University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: International Accounting Standards and Accounting Quality 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We examine whether application of
 International Accounting Standards (IAS) is associated with higher
 accounting quality. The application of IAS reflects combined effects of
 features of the financial reporting system, including standards, their
 interpretation, enforcement, and litigation. We find that firms applying
 IAS from 21 countries generally evidence less earnings management, more
 timely loss recognition, and more value relevance of accounting amounts
 than do matched sample firms applying non-U.S. domestic standards.
 Differences in accounting quality between the two groups of firms in the
 period before the IAS firms adopt IAS do not account for the postadoption
 differences. Firms applying IAS generally evidence an improvement in
 accounting quality between the pre- and postadoption periods. Although we
 cannot be sure our findings are attributable to the change in the
 financial reporting system rather than to changes in firms' incentives and
 the economic environment, we include research design features to mitigate
 effects of both. Copyright (c)University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Do Family Firms Provide More or Less Voluntary Disclosure? 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We examine the voluntary disclosure
 practices of family firms. We find that, compared to nonfamily firms,
 family firms provide fewer earnings forecasts and conference calls, but
 more earnings warnings. Whereas the former is consistent with family
 owners having a longer investment horizon, better monitoring of
 management, and lower information asymmetry between owners and managers,
 the higher likelihood of earnings warnings is consistent with family
 owners having greater litigation and reputation cost concerns. We also
 document that family ownership dominates nonfamily insider ownership and
 concentrated institutional ownership in explaining the likelihood of
 voluntary disclosure. Using alternative proxies for the founding family's
 presence in the firm leads to similar results. Copyright (c)University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Managerial Empire Building and Firm Disclosure 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This study tests the agency cost
 hypothesis in the context of geographic earnings disclosures. The agency
 cost hypothesis predicts that managers, when not monitored by
 shareholders, make self-maximizing decisions that may not necessarily be
 in the best interest of shareholders. These decisions include aggressively
 growing the firm, which reduces profitability and destroys firm value.
 Geographic earnings disclosures provide an interesting context to examine
 this issue. Beginning with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
 131 (SFAS 131), most U.S. multinational firms are no longer required to
 disclose earnings by geographic area (e.g., net income in Mexico or net
 income in East Asia). Such nondisclosure potentially reduces the ability
 of shareholders to monitor managers' decisions related to foreign
 operations. Using a sample of U.S. multinationals with substantial foreign
 operations, we find that nondisclosing firms, relative to firms that
 continue to disclose geographic earnings, experience greater expansion of
 foreign sales, produce lower foreign profit margins, and have lower firm
 value in the post-SFAS 131 period. Our conclusions are strengthened by the
 fact that these differences do not exist in the pre-SFAS 131 period and do
 not relate to domestic operations. We find differences in the predicted
 direction only for foreign operations and only after adoption of SFAS 131.
 Our results are robust to the inclusion of an extensive set of control
 variables related to alternative corporate governance mechanisms,
 operating performance, and the firm's information environment. Overall,
 the results are consistent with the agency cost hypothesis and the
 important role of financial disclosures in monitoring managers. Copyright (c)University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Implications of Transaction Costs for the Post-Earnings Announcement Drift 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper examines the effect of
 transaction costs on the post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD). Using
 standard market microstructure features we show that transaction costs
 constrain the informed trades that are necessary to incorporate earnings
 information into price. This implies weaker return responses at the time
 of the earnings announcement and higher subsequent returns drift for firms
 with higher transaction costs. Consistent with this prediction, we find
 that earnings response coefficients are lower for firms with higher
 transaction costs. Using portfolio analyses, we find that the profits of
 implementing the PEAD trading strategy are significantly reduced by
 transaction costs. In addition, we show, using a combination of portfolio
 and regression analyses, that firms with higher transaction costs are the
 ones that provide the higher abnormal returns for the PEAD strategy. Our
 results indicate that transaction costs can provide an explanation not
 only for the persistence but also for the existence of PEAD. Copyright (c)University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.
