Title: Audit Labor Usage and Fees under Business Risk Auditing 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>The adoption of business risk audit
 (BRA) approaches during the 1990s by several leading audit firms has been
 the subject of considerable scrutiny and commentary. Under BRA, the
 auditor responds to the increasing complexity of auditee financial reports
 by acquiring a deep and comprehensive understanding of the auditee's
 industry, strategy, business models, and processes-tasks best accomplished
 by higher-ranked labor-and by employing this understanding to make audit
 labor allocations. Using proprietary data for 165 audits conducted in
 2002, we investigate three propositions about audit labor use under BRA.
 First, relative to pre-BRA benchmarks for the same auditor, we expect BRA
 audits to use a greater "proportion" of higher-ranked labor. Second, we
 expect engagements with high assessed auditor business risk (ABR), a
 summary risk assessment that reflects the BRA auditor's rich understanding
 of the auditee, to be allocated more labor "and" more higher-ranked labor
 than pre-BRA benchmarks. Third, at all ranks of labor, we expect a
 positive association between assessed ABR and levels of labor use. We find
 empirical evidence consistent with these propositions. We also find that
 total labor use in our sample is only modestly lower than pre-BRA norms.
 Analysis of fee data from these engagements suggests that audit fees in
 2002 are substantially less than would be expected under pre-BRA
 benchmarks. After controlling for audit labor use, both total fees and
 fees per hour increase with assessed ABR for first-year auditees but not
 for continuing auditees. Overall, our results provide evidence on the
 impact of the BRA audit regime and speak to the likely impact of BRA on
 audit effectiveness and efficiency. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Competitive Pricing in Markets with Different Overhead Costs: Concealment or Leakage of Cost Information? 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper experimentally investigates
 how leaders and followers in a duopoly set prices for two product markets
 that have different overhead costs. In a fully crossed two-by-two design,
 we manipulate the participants' private cost report quality as either low
 or high, representing the extent to which these reports reveal that
 product markets have different overhead costs. We show that when only the
 leader is given a high-quality cost report, private cost information of
 higher quality is better incorporated into market prices (that are
 observable to participants). Both the leader and follower improve in
 profits and their prices better reflect the differences in overhead costs
 because the follower infers information from the leader's prices
 (information leakage). In contrast, when only the follower receives a
 high-quality cost report, the leader's profits and prices do not improve.
 This occurs because the follower conceals cost information when the leader
 has a low-quality cost report. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Earnings Volatility, Cash Flow Volatility, and Informed Trading 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>I examine whether earnings that are
 smoother or more volatile than cash flows provide or garble information.
 Consistent with theories that predict more informed trading when public
 information is less informative, I find that bid-ask spreads and the
 probability of informed trading are higher both when earnings are smoother
 than cash flows and also when earnings are more volatile than cash flows.
 Additional tests suggest that managers' discretionary choices that lead to
 smoother or more volatile earnings than cash flows garble information, on
 average. However, I find that informed trading is attenuated in settings
 in which theory suggests that discretionary smoothing or volatizing of
 earnings is likely to be informative. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Overreaction to Intra-industry Information Transfers? 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Prior research has documented that
 earnings announcements provide information not only about the announcing
 firm but also about other firms in the same industry. We document a stock
 market anomaly associated with this phenomenon of intra-industry
 information transfers by showing that the stock price movements of late
 announcers in response to earnings reported by early announcers are
 negatively related to subsequent price responses of late announcers to
 their own earnings reports. Apparently, the stock market overestimates the
 intra-industry implications of early announcers' earnings for late
 announcers' earnings, and that overestimation is corrected when late
 announcers disclose their earnings. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Keynesian Beauty Contest, Accounting Disclosure, and Market Efficiency 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper examines the market
 efficiency consequences of accounting disclosure in the context of stock
 markets as a Keynesian beauty contest, an influential metaphor originally
 proposed by Keynes [1936] and recently formalized by Allen, Morris, and
 Shin [2006]. In such markets, public information plays an additional
 commonality role, biasing stock prices away from the consensus fundamental
 value toward public information. Despite this bias, I demonstrate that
 provisions of public information always drive stock prices closer to the
 fundamental value. Hence, as a main source of public information,
 accounting disclosure enhances market efficiency, and transparency should
 not be compromised on grounds of the Keynesian-beauty-contest effect. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: The Effect of Regulation FD on Transient Institutional Investors' Trading Behavior 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We assess the impact of Regulation Fair
 Disclosure (Reg FD) on the trading behavior of transient institutional
 investors in the quarter prior to a bad news break in a string of
 consecutive earnings increases. Bad news breaks are defined as breaks that
 are by growth firms, preceded by longer strings of consecutive earnings
 increases, followed by longer strings of consecutive earnings decreases,
 and associated with larger declines in earnings. Pre-Reg FD transient
 institutions have abnormal selling of stocks in the quarter immediately
 preceding a bad news break. This abnormal selling is confined to firms
 that hold conference calls in the pre-Reg FD period. However, in the
 post-Reg FD period transient institutions do not exhibit similar abnormal
 selling of stocks in the quarter before a bad news break. Furthermore,
 after Reg FD transient institutions allocate less of their stock
 portfolios to conference call firms relative to non-conference call firms
 in the quarters prior to a bad news break. These results demonstrate that
 Reg FD has had an impact on management's selective disclosure behavior and
 significantly changed the trading behavior of transient institutions. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Positive and Negative Information Transfers from Management Forecasts 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We examine positive and negative
 information transfers associated with management earnings and revenue
 forecasts. Positive information transfers are due to industry
 commonalities whereas negative information transfers are caused by
 competitive shifts. We argue that positive and negative intra-industry
 information transfers offset each other and lead to an overall finding of
 no information transfers even though they exist. We also conjecture that
 the type of information transfers from the same management forecast can be
 positive or negative based on the characteristics of the information
 receiver. We hypothesize positive information transfers to nonrival firms
 and negative information transfers to rivals. Consistent with our
 prediction, we find negative (positive) information transfers between
 forecasting firms and nonforecasting rival (nonrival) firms in the same
 industry. Through analyses using competitors identified by "Hoover's" and
 10-K reports, we show more general evidence of negative information
 transfers to rival firms. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Does Auditor Reputation Matter? The Case of KPMG Germany and ComROAD AG 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We study the stock and audit market
 effects associated with a widely publicized accounting scandal involving a
 public company (ComROAD AG) and a large, reputable audit firm (KPMG) in a
 country (Germany) that has long provided auditors with substantial
 protection from shareholder legal liability. We use this event to study
 whether an auditor's reputation helps to ensure audit quality, a rationale
 for which recent literature and events provide scant support. Given the
 absence of a strong insurance rationale for audit quality, Germany permits
 a relatively clean test of whether auditor reputation matters. We find
 that KPMG's clients sustain negative abnormal returns of 3% at events
 pertaining to ComROAD, and that these returns are more negative for
 companies that are likely to have higher demands for audit quality. We
 also find an increase in the number of clients that drop KPMG in the year
 of the ComROAD scandal (mostly smaller, recently public companies that are
 similar to ComROAD). Overall, our results provide support for the
 reputation rationale for audit quality. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.
