Title: How Much New Information Is There in Earnings? 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We quantify the relative importance of
 earnings announcements in providing new information to the share market,
 using the "R"-super-2 in a regression of securities' calendar-year returns
 on their four quarterly earnings-announcement "window" returns. The
 "R"-super-2, which averages approximately 5% to 9%, measures the
 proportion of total information incorporated in share prices annually that
 is associated with earnings announcements. We conclude that the average
 quarterly announcement is associated with approximately 1% to 2% of total
 annual information, thus providing a modest but not overwhelming amount of
 incremental information to the market. The results are consistent with the
 view that the primary economic role of reported earnings is not to provide
 timely new information to the share market. By inference, that role lies
 elsewhere, for example, in settling debt and compensation contracts and in
 disciplining prior information, including more timely managerial
 disclosures of information originating in the firm's accounting system.
 The relative informativeness of earnings announcements is a concave
 function of size. Increased information during earnings-announcement
 windows in recent years is due only in part to increased concurrent
 releases of management forecasts. There is no evidence of abnormal
 information arrival in the weeks surrounding earnings announcements.
 Substantial information is released in management forecasts and in analyst
 forecast revisions prior (but not subsequent) to earnings announcements. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Altering Investment Decisions to Manage Financial Reporting Outcomes: Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Conduits and FIN 46 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We evaluate the manner in which
 sponsors of highly leveraged asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits
 responded to Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46
 (FIN 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an Interpretation
 of ARB No. 51", and its Canadian counterpart Accounting Standards Board of
 Accounting Guideline 15 (AcG-15), "Consolidation of Variable Interest
 Entities". By matching commercial paper investors with corporations
 seeking liquidity, ABCP sponsors facilitate a significant amount of
 short-term, securitized financing in the United States. FIN 46 and AcG-15
 require sponsors to consolidate their ABCP conduits with their financial
 statements. We demonstrate that the volume of ABCP began to decline when
 FIN 46 was first proposed, and that this decline is primarily attributable
 to a reduction in North American banks' sponsorship of ABCP. We also
 demonstrate that North American banks entered into costly restructuring
 arrangements to avoid having to consolidate their conduits per the new
 accounting standards. Our results suggest that, in certain settings,
 accounting standards appear to have real effects on investment activity
 and product-market competition. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Corporate Governance and Agency Conflicts 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>I investigate whether corporate
 governance is associated with the level of agency conflicts in firms. I
 employ exploratory principal components analysis on 22 individual
 governance variables to obtain seven factors that represent the different
 dimensions of governance for a firm. I measure the level of agency
 conflicts in firms based on seven proxies for agency conflicts used in the
 literature. I find that firms with greater agency conflicts have better
 governance mechanisms in place, particularly those related to the board,
 audit committee, and auditor. I also find that the composition and
 functioning of the board, the independence of the auditor, and the
 equity-based compensation of directors are significantly associated with
 firm performance, but primarily for firms with high agency conflicts.
 Overall, the results support the theory that the existence and role of
 various governance mechanisms in a firm are a function of the level of
 agency conflicts in the firm. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Client Characteristics and the Negotiation Tactics of Auditors: Implications for Financial Reporting 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Although the financial statements of an
 organization are considered a product of management, prior research
 suggests that a company's financial statements may be affected by the
 negotiation strategy employed by the auditor when resolving audit
 differences with management. However, little subsequent research discusses
 the potential strategies that auditors may employ during the negotiation
 process. Our study extends the literature by investigating, in a
 post-Sarbanes-Oxley environment, whether auditors will employ a
 reciprocity-based strategy for the resolution of audit differences and
 what client characteristics (client management's negotiating style and
 client retention risk) increase the extent to which it is utilized.
 Further, we explore the potential effect of a reciprocity-based strategy
 on the quality of the financial statements. Such a strategy involves
 bringing inconsequential items to management and subsequently waiving
 these items in an effort to encourage management to be more cooperative in
 the posting of significant income-decreasing adjustments. The results of
 experiment 1 indicate that client management's negotiating style and
 retention risk have an interactive effect on auditors' use of a
 reciprocity-based strategy. Specifically, auditors are more likely to
 utilize a reciprocity-based strategy when management's negotiating style
 is competitive and client retention risk is high. Experiment 2 findings
 suggest that the auditor's use of reciprocity during negotiation can
 actually result in more conservative financial statements by helping the
 auditor manage perceived client pressures to waive or reduce proposed
 adjustments. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: On the Optimal Relation between the Properties of Managerial and Financial Reporting Systems 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We develop a theoretical model of the
 firm that links properties (stewardship vs. valuation focus) of financial
 reporting regimes with the informational properties of optimal managerial
 accounting systems. We show that, contrary to the standard textbook
 proposition, properties of management and financial accounting systems are
 "not" independent. Significantly, we provide an explicit connection
 between exogenous and observable properties of a firm's financial
 reporting system and the quality of the managerial accounting system on
 which manager(s) base real economic decisions. As the quality of those
 economic decisions can also be inferred from publicly available data, our
 theory generates new opportunities for empirical managerial accounting
 research on large nonproprietary samples. Further, by being able to
 identify enhanced performance due to improved managerial accounting
 information, our theory provides opportunities to gain a better
 understanding of the link between "particular" managerial accounting
 practices and the quality of the information produced. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Investor Sentiment and Corporate Disclosure 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper investigates how firms react
 strategically to investor sentiment via their disclosure policies in an
 attempt to influence the sentiment-induced biases in expectations.
 Proxying for sentiment using the Michigan Consumer Confidence Index, we
 show that during low-sentiment periods, managers increase forecasts to
 "walk up" current estimates of future earnings over long horizons. In
 contrast, during periods of high sentiment, managers reduce their
 long-horizon forecasting activity. Further, while there is an association
 between sentiment and the biases in analysts' estimates of future
 earnings, management disclosures vary with sentiment even after
 controlling for analyst pessimism, indicating that managers attempt to
 communicate with investors at large, and not just analysts. Our study
 provides evidence that firms' long-horizon disclosure choices reflect
 managers' desire to maintain optimistic earnings valuations. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Mandatory IFRS Reporting around the World: Early Evidence on the Economic Consequences 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper examines the economic
 consequences of mandatory International Financial Reporting Standards
 (IFRS) reporting around the world. We analyze the effects on market
 liquidity, cost of capital, and Tobin's "q" in 26 countries using a large
 sample of firms that are mandated to adopt IFRS. We find that, on average,
 market liquidity increases around the time of the introduction of IFRS. We
 also document a decrease in firms' cost of capital and an increase in
 equity valuations, but only if we account for the possibility that the
 effects occur prior to the official adoption date. Partitioning our
 sample, we find that the capital-market benefits occur "only" in countries
 where firms have incentives to be transparent and where legal enforcement
 is strong, underscoring the central importance of firms' reporting
 incentives and countries' enforcement regimes for the quality of financial
 reporting. Comparing mandatory and voluntary adopters, we find that the
 capital market effects are most pronounced for firms that voluntarily
 switch to IFRS, both in the year when they switch and again later, when
 IFRS become mandatory. While the former result is likely due to
 self-selection, the latter result cautions us to attribute the
 capital-market effects for mandatory adopters solely or even primarily to
 the IFRS mandate. Many adopting countries make concurrent efforts to
 improve enforcement and governance regimes, which likely play into our
 findings. Consistent with this interpretation, the estimated liquidity
 improvements are smaller in magnitude when we analyze them on a monthly
 basis, which is more likely to isolate IFRS reporting effects. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Can Audit Partners Predict Subordinates' Ability to Detect Errors? 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This study examines audit partners'
 predictions of the ability of managers and seniors to detect financial
 statement errors. If partners are unable to predict the ability of their
 subordinates to detect errors, audit effectiveness may be affected. Audit
 partners are asked to predict which members of the audit team (managers or
 seniors) are able to detect specific types of errors. These predictions
 are then compared to errors detected by managers and seniors that are
 seeded in working papers. The results show that partners (1) exhibit
 significant overconfidence in the ability of subordinates to detect
 errors, (2) are more accurate in predicting managers' performance than
 seniors, (3) are more accurate at predicting subordinates' ability to
 detect mechanical (simple) errors than conceptual (complex) errors, and
 (4) are not better at predicting subordinates' ability to detect more
 frequent and more important errors than less frequent and less important
 errors. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Disclosure Quality and Management Trading Incentives 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This study examines whether managers
 strategically alter disclosure "quality" in response to personal
 incentives, specifically those derived from trading on their own account.
 Using changes in market liquidity to proxy for disclosure quality, I find
 that trading incentives are associated with disclosure quality choices.
 Tests are performed across three disclosure samples: management forecasts,
 conference calls, and press releases. Consistent with a desire to reduce
 the probability of litigation, I find evidence that managers provide
 "higher quality" disclosures before selling shares than they provide in
 the absence of trading. Consistent with a desire to maintain their
 information advantage, I find some, albeit weaker, evidence that managers
 provide "lower quality" disclosures prior to purchasing shares than they
 provide in the absence of trading. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"

 generations model where investors trade in a firm's stock. Investment risk
 is partly determined by the volatility of the stock price at which current

 shown that asymmetric reporting of good and bad news is value relevant as
 it affects the allocation of risk among future generations of
