Title: Analysts' Incentives and Street Earnings 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We examine whether analysts' incentives
 are associated with street earnings. Because prior research argues that
 analysts' incentives to promote stocks increase in the extent to which the
 stock exhibits glamour characteristics, we predict that analysts are more
 likely to make income-increasing adjustments in determining street
 earnings for glamour stocks than for value stocks. We find that analysts
 are more likely to exclude expense items from street earnings for glamour
 stocks than for value stocks and that excluded expense items help predict
 future earnings for glamour stocks but not for value stocks. Overall, our
 results suggest that analysts' self-interest influences street earnings
 and this self-interest leads to street earnings that are less useful in
 predicting future earnings for glamour stocks. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Event Day 0? After-Hours Earnings Announcements 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>In recent years, the proportion of
 after-hours earnings announcements has increased to more than 40%. For
 after-hours announcements, earnings-related volume and price changes are
 not observed on the Compustat or I/B/E/S earnings announcement date, but
 one trading day later. This study demonstrates the importance of
 accounting for after-hours announcements for event studies around earnings
 announcements. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Do Industry-Level Analyses Improve Forecasts of Financial Performance? 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Prior research documents mean reversion
 in firm profitability and growth under the implicit assumption that
 profitability and growth of all firms revert to a common benchmark at the
 same rate. However, a large body of academic research suggests that there
 are systematic interindustry differences (e.g., industry barriers to
 entry) that differentially affect firm performance based on industry
 membership. We evaluate the relative forecast accuracy of mean reverting
 models at the industry and economywide levels and find that
 industry-specific models are generally more accurate in predicting firm
 growth but not profitability. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Inco Ltd.: Market Value, Fair Value, and Management Discretion 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We examine management discretion to
 decide when and how much to write down an asset, in a unique case where a
 tracking stock provides an observable market value for the asset. We find
 that, despite market evidence that Inco Ltd.'s financial statements
 substantially overvalued the Voisey's Bay nickel mine throughout 1997 to
 2000, management chose not to write down the mine until 2002. Inco
 management used an independent fairness opinion to justify its December
 2000 redemption of the tracking stock at 25% of its initial value,
 indicating almost surely that Inco management was aware of the generally
 accepted accounting principles (GAAP) impairment. This case illustrates
 that GAAP's reliance on undiscounted cash flows for impairment decisions
 allows huge unrecorded disparities between book and market value. The
 management discretion exercised in this case provides a concrete example
 of the subjectivity inherent in fair valuation. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: The Effect of SOX Internal Control Deficiencies on Firm Risk and Cost of Equity 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) mandates
 management evaluation and independent audits of internal control
 effectiveness. The mandate is costly to firms but may yield benefits
 through lower information risk that translates into lower cost of equity.
 We use unaudited pre-SOX 404 disclosures and SOX 404 audit opinions to
 assess how changes in internal control quality affect firm risk and cost
 of equity. After controlling for other risk factors, we find that firms
 with internal control deficiencies have significantly higher idiosyncratic
 risk, systematic risk, and cost of equity. Our change analyses document
 that auditor-confirmed changes in internal control effectiveness
 (including remediation of previously disclosed internal control
 deficiencies) are followed by significant changes in the cost of equity
 that range from 50 to 150 basis points. Overall, our cross-sectional and
 intertemporal change test results are consistent with internal control
 reports affecting investors' risk assessments and firms' cost of equity. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Accelerated Vesting of Employee Stock Options in Anticipation of FAS 123-R 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>In December 2004, the Financial
 Accounting Standards Board (FASB) mandated the use of a fair value-based
 measurement attribute to value employee stock options (ESOs) via Financial
 Accounting Standard (FAS) 123-R. In anticipation of FAS 123-R, between
 March 2004 and November 2005, several firms accelerate the vesting of ESOs
 to avoid recognizing existing unvested ESO grants at fair value in future
 financial statements. We find that the likelihood of accelerated vesting
 is higher if (1) acceleration has a greater effect on future ESO
 compensation expense, especially related to underwater options, and (2)
 firms suffer greater agency problems, proxied by fewer blockholders, lower
 pension fund ownership, and top five officers holding a greater share of
 ESOs. We also find a negative stock price reaction around the announcement
 of the acceleration decision. Furthermore, stock returns are significantly
 negative before the new vesting dates and positive afterward, suggesting
 that vesting dates could have been backdated. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: The Going-Concern Market Anomaly 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We explore the market response to
 announcements of first-time going-concern (GC) audit opinions and, for a
 subset of these cases, their subsequent withdrawal, from 1993 to 2005. We
 find that the market fully responds to GC withdrawal announcements but
 underreacts to the GC announcements themselves, resulting in a downward
 drift of  - 14% over the one-year period subsequent to the GC opinion.
 This result is robust to alternative explanations documented in prior
 literature. However, after adjusting for transactions costs, the
 opportunity to earn profits by trading on this market anomaly is limited.
 We demonstrate that despite such clear adverse signals about the firm's
 continuing financial viability, this information is not being fully
 impounded by the market on a timely basis. Our findings differ from those
 of others who suggest that there is no pricing anomaly associated with GC
 opinions in the United States. We show that this is likely due to
 important issues with their research methods. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.

Title: Do Managers Withhold Bad News? 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>In this study, we examine whether
 managers delay disclosure of bad news relative to good news. If managers
 accumulate and withhold bad news up to a certain threshold, but leak and
 immediately reveal good news to investors, then we expect the magnitude of
 the negative stock price reaction to bad news disclosures to be greater
 than the magnitude of the positive stock price reaction to good news
 disclosures. We present evidence consistent with this prediction. Our
 analysis suggests that management, "on average", delays the release of bad
 news to investors. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2008.
