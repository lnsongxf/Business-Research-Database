Title: Unintended Consequences of Granting Small Firms Exemptions from Securities Regulation: Evidence from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
Abstract:
This paper provides evidence about the
 unintended consequences arising when small companies are exempted from
 costly regulations-these firms have incentives to stay small. Between 2003
 and 2008, the SEC postponed compliance with Section 404 of the
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) for "non-accelerated filers" (firms with
 public float less than $75 million). We hypothesize and find that some of
 these firms had an incentive to remain below this bright line threshold.
 Moreover, we document that these firms remained small by undertaking less
 investment, making more cash payouts to shareholders, reducing the number
 of shares held by non-affiliates, making more bad news disclosures, and
 reporting lower earnings than control firms. Finally, there is no evidence
 that firms remaining small are doing so to maintain insiders' private
 control benefits. These findings have implications beyond SOX because
 numerous federal and state regulations exempt small firms via bright line
 size thresholds. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2009.

Title: A Lobbying Approach to Evaluating the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
Abstract:
We evaluate the impact of the
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) on shareholders by studying the lobbying behavior
 of investors and corporate insiders in order to affect the final
 implemented rules under SOX. Investors lobbied overwhelmingly in favor of
 strict implementation of SOX, while corporate insiders and business groups
 lobbied against strict implementation. We identify firms most affected by
 the law as those whose insiders lobbied against strict implementation.
 Such firms appear to be characterized by agency problems, rather than
 motivated by concerns over compliance costs. Cumulative stock returns
 during the five and a half months leading up to SOX passage were
 approximately 7% higher for corporations whose insiders lobbied against
 SOX disclosure-related provisions than for similar non-lobbying firms,
 consistent with an expectation that SOX would reduce agency problems.
 Analysis of returns in the post-passage implementation period suggests
 that investors' positive expectations with regards to the effects of these
 provisions were warranted. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2009.

Title: Financial Globalization, Governance, and the Evolution of the Home Bias 
Abstract:
We merge portfolio theories of home
 bias with corporate finance theories of insider ownership to create the
 optimal corporate ownership theory of the home bias. The theory has two
 components: (1) foreign portfolio investors exhibit a large home bias
 against countries with poor governance because their investment is limited
 by high optimal ownership by insiders (the "direct effect" of poor
 governance) and domestic monitoring shareholders (the "indirect effect")
 in response to the governance and (2) foreign direct investors from "good
 governance" countries have a comparative advantage as insider monitors in
 "poor governance" countries, so that the relative importance of foreign
 direct investment is negatively related to the quality of governance.
 Using both country-level data on U.S. investors' foreign investment
 allocations and Korean firm-level data, we find empirical evidence
 supporting our optimal corporate ownership theory of the home bias. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2009.

Title: Market and Political/Regulatory Perspectives on the Recent Accounting Scandals 
Abstract:
Not surprisingly, the recent accounting
 scandals look different when viewed from the perspectives of the
 political/regulatory process and of the market for corporate governance
 and financial reporting. We do not have the opportunity to observe a world
 in which either market or political/regulatory processes operate
 independently, and the events are recent and not well researched, so
 untangling their separate effects is somewhat conjectural. This paper
 offers conjectures on issues such as: What caused the scandalous behavior?
 Why was there such a rash of accounting scandals at one time? Who killed
 Arthur Andersen-the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the market? Did
 fraudulent accounting kill Enron, or just keep it alive for too long? What
 is the social cost of financial reporting fraud? Does the United States in
 fact operate a "principles-based" or a "rules-based" accounting system?
 Was there market failure? Or was there regulatory failure? Or both? Was
 the Sarbanes-Oxley Act a political and regulatory overreaction? Does the
 United States follow an ineffective regulatory model? Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2009.

Title: Securities Laws, Disclosure, and National Capital Markets in the Age of Financial Globalization 
Abstract:
As barriers to international investment
 fall and technology improves, the cost advantages for a firm's securities
 to trade publicly in the country in which that firm is located and for
 that country to have a market for publicly traded securities distinct from
 the capital markets of other countries will progressively disappear.
 Securities laws remain an important determinant of whether and where
 securities are issued, how they are valued, who owns them, and where they
 trade. I show that there is a demand from entrepreneurs for mechanisms
 that allow them to commit to credible disclosure because disclosure helps
 reduce agency costs. Under some circumstances, mandatory disclosure
 through securities laws can help satisfy that demand, but only provided
 investors or the state can act on the information disclosed and the laws
 cannot be weakened ex post too much through lobbying by corporate
 insiders. With financial globalization, national disclosure laws can have
 wide-ranging effects on a country's welfare, on firms and on investor
 portfolios, including the extent to which share holdings reveal a home
 bias. In equilibrium, if firms can choose the securities laws they are
 subject to when they go public, some firms will choose stronger securities
 laws than those of the country in which they are located and some firms
 will do the opposite. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2009.

Title: The Future of Securities Regulation 
Abstract:
The U.S. system of securities law was
 designed more than 70 years ago to regain investors' trust after a major
 financial crisis. Today we face a similar problem. But while in the 1930s
 the prevailing perception was that investors had been defrauded by
 offerings of dubious quality securities, in the new millennium, investors'
 perception is that they have been defrauded by managers who are not
 accountable to anyone. For this reason, I propose a series of reforms that
 center around corporate governance, while shifting the focus from the
 protection of unsophisticated investors in the purchasing of new
 securities issues to the investment in mutual funds, pension funds, and
 other forms of asset management. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2009.
