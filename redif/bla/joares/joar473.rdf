Title: Corporate Investments: Learning from Restatements 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This study analyzes the information
 conveyed by the restatements of financial reports. We argue that
 restatements contain news about the investment projects of the restating
 firms' competitors. This news causes competitors to revise their beliefs
 about the projects' value, and to modify their subsequent investment
 decisions. Accordingly, we hypothesize that changes in competitors'
 investments after restatement announcements are related to news in the
 restatements. Consistent with our prediction, we find that changes in
 competitors' investments following restatement announcements are
 significantly related to various proxies for news in the restatements,
 such as competitors' and restating firms' abnormal returns at the
 restatement announcements. We conclude that restatements convey
 information about the investment projects of restating firms' competitors. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2009.

Title: Initial Evidence on the Role of Accounting Earnings in the Bond Market 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We document that: (1) the incidence of
 bond trade increases during the days surrounding earnings announcements,
 (2) there is a bond-price reaction to the announcement of earnings, and
 (3) there is a positive association between annual bond returns and both
 annual changes in earnings and annual analysts' forecast errors. All of
 these effects are larger when earnings convey bad news or when the
 underlying bond is more risky. Taken together, our results suggest that
 the nonlinear payoff structure of bond securities affects the role of
 accounting earnings in the bond market. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2009.

Title: Depreciation Rules and the Relation between Marginal and Historical Cost 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>The reported cost of a product
 frequently contains historical cost components that reflect past
 investments in productive capacity. We examine a setting wherein a firm
 makes a sequence of overlapping capacity investments. Earlier research has
 identified particular accrual accounting (depreciation) rules with the
 property that, on a per unit basis, the historical cost of a product
 captures precisely its marginal cost. Relative to this benchmark, we
 investigate and characterize the direction and magnitude of the bias in
 reported historical cost that results from alternative depreciation rules,
 including in particular straight-line depreciation in conjunction with
 partial direct expensing. In addition, we demonstrate that for a
 reasonable range of parameter specifications the resulting bias is rather
 small. Finally, we apply our framework to two specific settings. First, in
 a regulatory context, we establish the extent to which the accounting
 profit margin is indicative of a firm's pricing power in the product
 market. Second, we model an internal control scenario in which a manager's
 performance is evaluated using residual income, and identify the
 distortions in investment levels that result from the use of alternative
 depreciation rules. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2009.

Title: Incentive Contracting and Value Relevance of Earnings and Cash Flows 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Accounting performance measures such as
 earnings and cash flows are useful for both valuation and performance
 evaluation purposes. However, little evidence exists on whether there is
 any association between these two roles. In this study, we provide large
 sample empirical evidence that the value relevance of earnings explains a
 significant amount of the cross-sectional variation in the pay-sensitivity
 of earnings and the incremental value relevance of cash flows explains
 variation in the marginal pay-sensitivity of cash flows. We document that
 while both value relevance and compensation weight on earnings decline
 from the subperiod of 1993 to 1997 to the subperiod of 1998 to 2003, both
 value relevance and compensation weight on cash flows increase from the
 earlier subperiod to the later subperiod. Overall, our results provide
 additional evidence that value relevance of a performance measure plays a
 significant role in its use for performance evaluation. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2009.

Title: Accounting Conservatism and the Efficiency of Debt Contracts 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>In this paper we examine how accounting
 conservatism affects the efficiency of debt contracting. We develop the
 statistical and informational properties of accounting reports under
 varying degrees of conditional and unconditional accounting conservatism,
 consistent with Basu's [1997] description of differential verifiability
 standards. Optimal debt covenants and interest rates on debt are derived
 from a natural tension between debt holders and equity claimants. We show
 how optimal covenants vary with the degree of conservatism and derive an
 efficiency metric that depends on the degree of conservatism. We find that
 accounting conservatism actually "decreases" the efficiency of debt
 contracts, contrary to the suggestions of Watts [2003] and contrary to the
 hypothesis in numerous empirical studies. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2009.

Title: The Predictive Content of Aggregate Analyst Recommendations 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Using more than 350,000 sell-side
 analyst recommendations from January 1994 to August 2006, this paper
 examines the predictive content of aggregate analyst recommendations. We
 find that changes in aggregate analyst recommendations forecast future
 market excess returns after controlling for macroeconomic variables that
 have been shown to influence market returns. Similarly, changes in
 industry-aggregated analyst recommendations predict future industry
 returns. Changes in aggregate analyst recommendations also predict
 one-quarter-ahead aggregate earnings growth. Overall, our results suggest
 that analyst recommendations contain market- and industry-level
 information about future returns and earnings. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Institute of Professional Accounting, 2009.
