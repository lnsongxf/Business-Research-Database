Title: On the Structure of Analyst Research Portfolios and Forecast Accuracy 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This study provides insights into the
 forces and constraints that shape analyst research coverage along country
 and sector dimensions and the impact of the structure of an analyst's
 portfolio on forecast accuracy. We find that analyst specialization by
 country and sector is sensitive to the extent to which
 firms&ensp;"within"&ensp;a country or sector and
 firms&ensp;"across"&ensp;country-sectors are exposed to common economic
 forces, the potential for revenue generation, and broker culture. Our
 tests indicate that existing research on the relation between analyst
 portfolio structure and forecast accuracy may suffer from an endogeneity
 bias. We use our analysis of analyst specialization to develop controls
 for this bias. Once we employ these controls, we find that country
 diversification is associated with superior forecast accuracy. However,
 the relation between sector diversification and forecast accuracy is
 context-specific. Specifically, sector diversification enhances forecast
 accuracy in an international context, while it detracts from forecast
 accuracy in a domestic U.S. context. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: Delegation to Encourage Communication of Problems 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We study a principal's choice to
 centralize or delegate decisions to an agent when delegation can be used
 to encourage the agent to communicate potential problems. We find that the
 principal may choose centralization either to exercise better control over
 the agent's actions or to provide stronger incentives. Delegation emerges
 in equilibrium only if the costs of effort to acquire information for both
 the principal and the agent are sufficiently high. We find that increases
 in the principal's penalties for an incorrect decision may increase the
 principal's expected payoff, owing to optimal organizational responses. In
 addition, catastrophic risk, the risk of incorrectly accepting a defective
 audit (or product), may be greater under centralization than under
 delegation. Furthermore, catastrophic risk can be increased by
 well-intentioned legislative efforts to decrease such risk by, for
 example, increasing the agent's penalties for failing to take a corrective
 action, because the organizational structure may change. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: Does Corporate Transparency Contribute to Efficient Resource Allocation? 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper examines whether a country's
 corporate transparency environment, which includes the quality of
 accounting information, contributes to efficient resource allocation.
 Based on a cross-country study of 37 manufacturing industries in 37
 countries, we provide three pieces of related evidence. First, we find the
 contemporaneous correlations in industry growth rates across country pairs
 are higher when there is a greater level of corporate transparency in the
 country pairs, after controlling for country-level economic and financial
 development. Second, we find the influence of transparency on these
 correlations is stronger when country pairs are at similar levels of
 economic development (GDP). Finally, when we control for the level of
 transparency explained by a country's institutions in place, we find that
 residual transparency (unexplained by country-level factors) is associated
 with industry-specific growth rates. Taken together, the results are
 consistent with corporate transparency facilitating the allocation of
 resources across industry sectors. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: The Incentive Value of Inventory and Cross-training in Modern Manufacturing 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper shows that major components
 of modern manufacturing processes, such as inventory management and
 cross-training, play a significant control role. In our model, workers
 possess information that is critical to efficient ongoing operations. An
 organizational design that motivates workers to optimally apply this
 information leverages both the production schedule and worker-management
 communication. Management's use of these controls results in
 work-in-process (WIP) inventory that appears excessive from a pure
 job-scheduling perspective, but is optimal when control issues are
 considered. Empirical work testing pure job-scheduling theories of modern
 manufacturing practices has yielded mixed results. We provide
 control-related interpretations for these empirical findings, and also
 provide novel predictions regarding the link between inventory levels and
 the nature of operational information asymmetries. Overall, our model
 highlights the importance of recognizing both control and scheduling
 issues when analyzing production processes. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: Bringing It Home: A Study of the Incentives Surrounding the Repatriation of Foreign Earnings Under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
 (the Act) creates a temporary tax holiday that effectively reduces the
 U.S. tax rate on repatriations from foreign subsidiaries from 35% to
 5.25%. Firms receive the reduced tax rate by electing to take an 85%
 dividends received deduction on repatriations in 2004 or 2005. This paper
 investigates the characteristics of firms that repatriate under the Act
 and how they use the repatriated funds. We find that firms that repatriate
 under the Act have lower investment opportunities and higher free cash
 flows than nonrepatriating firms. Further, we find that repatriating firms
 increase share repurchases during 2005 by approximately $60 billion more
 than nonrepatriating firms, an amount that cannot be explained by
 differences in earnings between the two groups of firms. This increase
 represents about 20% of the $291.6 billion repatriated by our sample firms
 under the Act. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: CFO Fiduciary Responsibilities and Annual Bonus Incentives 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We examine how firms design bonus plans
 of their CFOs. CFOs participate in decision making much like other
 executives, but they also have significant fiduciary responsibilities for
 reporting firms' financial results. Responsibility for financial reporting
 raises the question of whether it is appropriate to pay CFOs annual
 bonuses contingent on self-reported financial performance. In this paper,
 we provide a framework that characterizes CFO bonuses as a tradeoff
 between CFOs' decision-making responsibilities and their fiduciary duties
 over financial reporting. This framework yields a number of implications
 that we examine empirically using a proprietary survey of CFO compensation
 practices of public and private firms. Our main finding shows that from
 2003 to 2007 public entities (relative to private entities) reduced the
 percentage of CFO bonuses contingent on financial performance. We
 interpret this result as evidence that firms mitigate misreporting
 practices in part by deemphasizing CFO incentive compensation. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.
