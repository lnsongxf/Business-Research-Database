Title: Measuring Investors' Opinion Divergence 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Numerous proxies for divergence of
 investors' opinions have been suggested in the empirical accounting and
 finance literatures. I offer a new proxy constructed from proprietary
 limit order and market order data. This allows me to
 capture&ensp;"additional"&ensp;information on
 investors'&ensp;"private"&ensp;valuations. Proxies from the extant
 literature, based on publicly available data, do not contain such
 information. Given my new measure, I ask which of the extant proxies
 correlates best with it. In my regression analysis, unexplained volume is
 the best proxy for opinion divergence. Conditioning on various
 firm-specific and order-specific characteristics generally does not change
 this conclusion. The main exception is the sample of firms without IBES
 forecast dispersion data, for which bid-ask spread is the best proxy for
 opinion divergence. Factor analysis also suggests that unexplained volume
 is the preferred proxy for opinion divergence. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: Do IFRS Reconciliations Convey Information? The Effect of Debt Contracting 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We examine whether earnings
 reconciliation from U.K. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
 to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) convey information.
 As a result of debt contracting, mandatory accounting changes are expected
 to affect the likelihood of violating existing covenants based on rolling
 GAAP, leading to a redistribution of wealth between shareholders and
 lenders. Consistent with this prediction, we find significant market
 reactions to IFRS reconciliation announcements. These market reactions are
 more pronounced among firms that face a greater likelihood and costs of
 covenant violation and early announcements. While the association between
 later announcements and weaker market reactions is consistent with
 contractual implications of technical changes to earnings, which investors
 quickly learn to predict, it is inconsistent with IFRS forcing all firms
 in the sample to reveal firm-specific information through accruals. Thus,
 by showing that mandatory IFRS also affects debt contracting, we expand on
 existing IFRS research that focuses on how accounting quality and cost of
 capital are impacted. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: Using Financial Accounting Data to Examine the Effect of Foreign Operations Located in Tax Havens and Other Countries on U.S. Multinational Firms' Tax Rates 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper investigates the effect tax
 havens and other foreign jurisdictions have on the income tax rates of
 multinational firms based in the United States. We develop a new
 regression methodology using financial accounting data to estimate the
 average worldwide, federal, and foreign tax rates on worldwide, federal,
 and foreign pretax book income for a large sample of U.S. firms with and
 without tax haven operations. We find that on average U.S. firms that
 disclosed material operations in at least one tax haven country have a
 worldwide tax burden on worldwide income that is approximately 1.5
 percentage points lower than firms without operations in at least one tax
 haven country. Our results also show that U.S. firms face a 4.4% current
 federal tax rate on foreign income whether or not they have tax haven
 operations. Finally, we find that U.S. firms with operations in some tax
 haven countries have higher federal tax rates on foreign income than other
 firms. This result suggests that in some cases, tax haven operations may
 increase U.S. tax collections at the expense of foreign country tax
 collections. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: Earnings Management? Erroneous Inferences Based on Earnings Frequency Distributions 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>A vast literature following Hayn [1995]
 and Burgstahler and Dichev [1997] attributed the so-called
 "discontinuities" in earnings distributions around zero to earnings
 management. Despite recent evidence that these discontinuities are likely
 caused by other factors, researchers and teachers continue to point to the
 shapes of these distributions as evidence of earnings management. We
 provide three sets of further evidence that these discontinuities are
 likely caused by factors other than earnings management: (1) we provide,
 as an example, a detailed analysis of the severe effects of sample
 selection in a recent study; this study erroneously concludes that the
 shape of an earnings distribution is evidence of earnings management, (2)
 we provide a simple explanation for the shape of the earnings distribution
 that is most often cited as evidence of earnings management; the relation
 between earnings and prices differs with the magnitude and the sign of
 earnings, and (3) we provide further examples that support the main point
 of our paper; evidence beyond the mere shape of a distribution must be
 brought to bear before researchers can draw conclusions regarding the
 presence/absence of earnings management. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: The Informational Role of Bond Analysts 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This study uses a large sample of
 sell-side bond analysts' reports to examine the properties of
 recommendations provided by bond analysts and the impact of these
 recommendations on bond securities. First, we document that the
 distribution of bond analysts' buy, hold, and sell recommendations is
 skewed positively, but less so than the distribution of equity analysts'
 recommendations. The positive skewness in bond analysts' recommendations
 is greater for low than for high credit quality bonds. Second, we find
 that bond analysts' reports generate bond trading and return reactions
 that are both economically significant and greater for low credit quality
 bonds. The bond market reaction is greater for bond analysts' reports than
 for equity analysts' reports. Finally, while both bond and equity analysts
 lead rating agency announcements, we find no evidence of a difference in
 timeliness between bond and equity analysts' reports. Overall, our results
 are consistent with bond analysts issuing more negative reports than
 equity analysts and providing more information about low credit quality
 bonds as a result of the asymmetric demand for negative information by
 bond investors. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: Using Nonfinancial Measures to Assess Fraud Risk 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This study examines whether auditors
 can effectively use nonfinancial measures (NFMs) to assess the
 reasonableness of financial performance and, thereby, help detect
 financial statement fraud (hereafter, fraud). If auditors or other
 interested parties (e.g., directors, lenders, investors, or regulators)
 can identify NFMs (e.g., facilities growth) that are correlated with
 financial measures (e.g., revenue growth), inconsistent patterns between
 the NFMs and financial measures can be used to detect firms with high
 fraud risk. We find that the&ensp;"difference"&ensp;between financial and
 nonfinancial performance is significantly greater for firms that committed
 fraud than for their nonfraud competitors. We also find that this
 difference is a significant fraud indicator when included in a model
 containing variables that have previously been linked to the likelihood of
 fraud. Overall, our results provide empirical evidence suggesting that
 NFMs can be effectively used to assess fraud risk. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: Aggregate Earnings and Asset Prices 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>A principal-components analysis
 demonstrates that common earnings factors explain a substantial portion of
 firm-level earnings variation, implying earnings shocks have substantial
 systematic components and are not almost fully diversifiable as prior
 literature has concluded. Furthermore, the principal components of
 earnings and returns are highly correlated, implying aggregate earnings
 risks and return risks are related. In contrast to previous studies, the
 correlation we report between the systematic components of earnings and
 returns is stable over time. We also show that the earnings factors are
 priced, in the sense that the sensitivities of securities' returns to the
 earnings factors explain a significant portion of the cross-sectional
 variation in returns, even controlling for return risk. This suggests
 earnings performance is an underlying source of priced risk. Our evidence
 that the information sets of returns and earnings are jointly determined
 implies cash flow risk and return risk are not fully separable, and raises
 the possibility that it is the common variation of earnings and returns
 that is priced. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.
