Title: Investors' Reactions to Management Earnings Guidance: The Joint Effect of Investment Position, News Valence, and Guidance Form 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We report the results of an experiment
 that shows that investors' earnings- and investment-related judgments are
 jointly influenced by their investment position (long versus short), the
 news valence of guidance issued by management, and the amount of ambiguity
 in the guidance. Prior research indicates that guidance form (point versus
 range) has no effect on investors' earnings estimates made in reaction to
 management guidance. We extend this research by showing that guidance form
 matters, conditional on investment position and news valence. Similarly,
 prior research indicates that investors who hold long (short) positions in
 a stock are more optimistic (pessimistic) about the company's prospects.
 We extend this research by showing that the effect of investment position
 documented in prior studies is conditional on news valence and guidance
 form. We contribute to prior literature on the effects of investment
 position and guidance form by delineating boundary conditions for each of
 these effects. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: Implicit Employment Contracts: The Limits of Management Reputation for Promoting Firm Productivity 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Implicit employment contracts are a
 common way to motivate firm productivity but also require that employees
 trust management to be fair when allocating postproduction firm resources
 between employees and owners. We use an experiment to study the problem of
 motivating firm productivity, which depends on levels of owner investment
 and employee productive effort, when managers have an incentive to favor
 the owner's interests over those of the employee. Drawing on research in
 psychology and behavioral economics, we argue that reputation concerns can
 more effectively promote firm productivity when manager compensation is
 relatively insensitive to how much the owner is allocated after production
 occurs. Consistent with our predictions, we find that reputation concerns
 lead to greater firm productivity and higher payoffs for all firm members,
 but only when manager pay is relatively insensitive to the owner's ex post
 allocation. In addition to offering testable empirical implications, our
 theory and results are important because they can help explain why
 executive compensation is, in practice, surprisingly insensitive to owner
 returns. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: The&ensp;"q"-Theory Approach to Understanding the Accrual Anomaly 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Interpreting accruals as working
 capital investment, we hypothesize based on&ensp;"q"-theory that firms
 optimally adjust their accruals in response to discount rate changes. A
 higher discount rate means less profitable investments and lower accruals,
 and a lower discount rate means more profitable investments and higher
 accruals. Our evidence supports this optimal investment hypothesis: (1)
 adding an investment factor into standard factor regressions substantially
 reduces the magnitude of the accrual anomaly, often to insignificant
 levels; (2) accruals covary negatively with discount rate estimates from
 the dividend discounting model, and for the most part, with estimates from
 the residual income model; (3) accruals with low accounting reliability
 covary more with capital investment than accruals with high accounting
 reliability; and (iv) expected returns to accruals-based trading
 strategies are time-varying, suggesting that the deterioration of the
 accrual effect in recent years might be temporary and likely to
 mean-revert in the near future. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: Does the Stock Market See a Zero or Small Positive Earnings Surprise as a Red Flag? 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This study shows that firms
 collectively incur a cost for managing earnings and analyst expectations
 to meet earnings forecasts. We compare the coefficient in the regression
 of abnormal stock returns on earnings surprise (the earnings response
 coefficient [ERC]) across ranges of earnings surprises. The ERC for
 earnings surprises in the range [0, 1&cent;] is significantly lower than
 ERCs for earnings surprises in adjacent ranges for firm-quarters in the
 early and mid 2000s, but not for those in the 1990s. The results are
 robust to controlling for the sign of estimated discretionary accruals and
 the trajectory of analyst earnings forecasts. We further find that
 investors are right to be skeptical about earnings surprises in the range
 [0, 1&cent;]. The relation of future earnings surprise with current
 earnings surprise is more negative for current earnings surprises in that
 range than for those in any other range. Evidence also suggests analysts
 react negatively to earnings surprises in that range. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: The Role of the Business Press as an Information Intermediary 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper investigates whether the
 business press serves as an information intermediary. The press
 potentially shapes firms' information environments by packaging and
 disseminating information, as well as by creating new information through
 journalism activities. We find that greater press coverage reduces
 information asymmetry (i.e., lower spreads and greater depth) around
 earnings announcements, with broad dissemination of information having a
 bigger impact than the quantity or quality of press-generated information.
 These results are robust to controlling for firm-initiated disclosures,
 market reactions to the announcement, and other information
 intermediaries. Our findings suggest that the press helps reduce
 information problems around earnings announcements. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: Political Cost Incentives for Managing the Property-Liability Insurer Loss Reserve 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper examines the effect of rate
 regulation on the management of the property-liability insurer loss
 reserve. The political cost hypothesis predicts that managers make
 accounting choices to reduce wealth transfers resulting from the
 regulatory process. Managers may under-state reserves to justify lower
 rates to regulators. Alternatively, managers may have an incentive to
 report loss inflating discretionary reserves to reduce the cost of
 regulatory rate suppression. We find insurers over-state reserves in the
 presence of stringent rate regulation. Investigating the impact along the
 conditional reserve error distribution, we discover that a majority of the
 response occurs from under-reserving firms under-reserving less because of
 stringent rate regulation. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: Debt Covenants and Accounting Conservatism 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Using a sample of over 5,000 debt
 issues, I test whether firms with more extensive use of covenants in their
 public debt contracts exhibit timelier recognition of economic losses in
 accounting earnings. Covenants govern the transfer of decision-making and
 control rights from shareholders to bondholders when a company approaches
 financial distress and thereby limit managers' abilities to expropriate
 bondholder wealth. Covenants are expected to constrain managerial
 opportunism, however, only if the accounting system recognizes economic
 losses in earnings in a timely fashion. Thus, the demand for timely loss
 recognition should increase with a contract's reliance on covenants.
 Consistent with this conjecture, I find evidence that reliance on
 covenants in public debt contracts is positively associated with the
 degree of timely loss recognition. I also find evidence that the presence
 of prior private debt mitigates this relationship. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.
