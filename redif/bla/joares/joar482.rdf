Title: Chief Executive Officer Equity Incentives and Accounting Irregularities 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This study examines whether Chief
 Executive Officer (CEO) equity-based holdings and compensation provide
 incentives to manipulate accounting reports. While several prior studies
 have examined this important question, the empirical evidence is mixed and
 the existence of a link between CEO equity incentives and accounting
 irregularities remains an open question. Because inferences from prior
 studies may be confounded by assumptions inherent in research design
 choices, we use propensity-score matching and assess hidden (omitted
 variable) bias within a broader sample. In contrast to most prior
 research, we do not find evidence of a positive association between CEO
 equity incentives and accounting irregularities after matching CEOs on the
 observable characteristics of their contracting environments. Instead, we
 find some evidence that accounting irregularities occur less frequently at
 firms where CEOs have relatively higher levels of equity incentives. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: Self-Selection and the Forecasting Abilities of Female Equity Analysts 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper investigates whether there
 are systematic differences between the forecasting style and abilities of
 female and male analysts, and whether market participants recognize these
 differences. My key conjecture is that only female analysts with superior
 forecasting abilities enter the profession due to a perception of
 discrimination in the analyst labor market. Consistent with this
 conjecture, I find that female analysts issue bolder and more accurate
 forecasts and their accuracy is higher in market segments in which their
 concentration is lower. Further, the stock market participants are aware
 of the male-female skill differences. They respond more strongly to the
 forecast revisions by female analysts even though those analysts get less
 media coverage. The short-term market reaction is incomplete, however,
 because it is followed by a strong post-revision drift. The perception of
 abilities is similar in the analyst labor market, where female analysts
 are more likely to move up to high-status brokerage firms, while their
 downward career mobility is lower. Collectively, these results indicate
 that female analysts have better-than-average skill due to self-selection
 and market participants are at least partially able to recognize their
 superior abilities. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: Aggregate Market Reaction to Earnings Announcements 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This analysis identifies a distinct
 immediate announcement period negative relation between earnings
 announcement surprises and aggregate market returns. Such a relation
 implies that market participants use earnings information in forming
 expectations about expected aggregate discount rates and, specifically,
 that good earnings news is associated with a positive shock to required
 returns. Consistent with this interpretation we find that Treasury bond
 rates and implied future inflation expectations respond directly to
 earnings news. We also find some evidence that the negative relation
 between earnings news and market return persists beyond the immediate
 announcement period, suggesting that market participants do not
 immediately fully impound these future market return implications of
 aggregate earnings news. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2010.

Title: Expected Mispricing: The Joint Influence of Accounting Transparency and Investor Base 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>&emsp;We examine how accounting
 transparency and investor base jointly affect financial analysts'
 expectations of mispricing (i.e., expectations of stock price deviations
 from fundamental value). Within a range of transparency, these two factors
 interactively amplify analysts' expectations of mispricing-analysts expect
 a larger positive deviation when a firm's
 disclosures&ensp;"more"&ensp;transparently reveal income-increasing
 earnings management and the firm's most important investors are described
 as transient institutional investors with a shorter-term horizon (low
 concentration in holdings, high portfolio turnover, and frequent momentum
 trading) rather than dedicated institutional investors with a longer-term
 horizon (high concentration in holdings, low portfolio turnover, and
 little momentum trading). Results are consistent with analysts
 anticipating that transient institutional investors are more likely than
 dedicated institutional investors to adjust their trading strategies for
 near-term factors affecting stock mispricings. Our theory and findings
 extend the accounting disclosure literature by identifying a boundary
 condition to the common supposition that disclosure transparency
 necessarily mitigates expected mispricing, and by providing evidence that
 analysts' pricing judgments are influenced by
 their&ensp;"anticipation"&ensp;of different investors' reactions to firm
 disclosures. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2010.

Title: Elections and Discretionary Accruals: Evidence from 2004 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We examine the accrual choices of
 outsourcing firms with links to U.S. congressional candidates during the
 2004 elections, when corporate outsourcing was a major campaign issue. We
 find that politically connected firms with more extensive outsourcing
 activities have more income-decreasing discretionary accruals. Further,
 relative to adjacent periods, the evidence is concentrated in the two
 calendar quarters immediately preceding the 2004 election, consistent with
 heightened incentives for firms to manage earnings during the election
 season. The incentives can be attributed to donor firms' concerns about
 the potentially negative consequences of scrutiny over outsourcing for
 themselves and for their affiliated candidates. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2010.
