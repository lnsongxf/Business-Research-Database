Title: Voluntary Disclosures and Analyst Feedback 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We study the resource allocation role
 of voluntary disclosures when feedback from financial markets is
 potentially useful to managers in undertaking value maximizing actions.
 Managers weigh the short-term price implications of disclosure against the
 long-term efficiency gains due to feedback while financial analysts
 strategically produce information. The model can explain why managers
 disclose&ensp;"bad"&ensp;information (e.g., grim outlook),
 that&ensp;"reduces"&ensp;the stock price, and why prices respond more
 strongly to bad news relative to good news. We find that not all firms
 enjoy the same quality of feedback, and that feedback, by itself, does not
 induce more disclosure but&ensp;"less". Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: National and Office-Specific Measures of Auditor Industry Expertise and Effects on Audit Quality 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Our paper examines whether audit
 quality is higher for industry audit specialists at the national and
 city-office levels using the framework developed in Ferguson et al. [2003]
 and Francis et al. [2005]. We find that auditors who are both national and
 city-specific industry specialists have clients with the lowest abnormal
 accruals, suggesting that joint national and city-specific industry
 specialists have the highest audit quality. In addition, we find some
 evidence that abnormal accruals of firms audited by city-industry
 specialists alone (without also being national specific industry
 specialists) are lower than those audited by nonindustry specialists.
 Using alternative measures of audit quality, we find that when the auditor
 is both a national and a city-specific industry specialist, its clients
 are less likely to meet or beat analysts' earnings forecasts by one penny
 per share and more likely to be issued a going-concern audit opinion.
 Together these results provide consistent evidence that audit quality is
 higher when the auditor is both a national and city-specific industry
 specialist, suggesting that auditors' national positive network synergies
 and the individual auditors' deep industry knowledge at the office level
 are jointly important factors in delivering higher audit quality. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: The Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts, Conservatism, and Earnings Management 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We study the interrelation between
 conservatism and earnings management by examining the allowance for
 uncollectible accounts and its income statement counterpart, bad debt
 expense. We find that the allowance is conservative and that it has become
 more conservative over time. Conservatism may, however, facilitate
 earnings management. We find that firms manage bad debt expense downward
 (and even record&ensp;"income-increasing"&ensp;bad debt expense) to meet
 or beat analysts' earnings forecasts and that conservatism accentuates the
 extent to which firms manage bad debt expense. Further, we find that firms
 manage bad debt expense downward by drawing down previously recorded
 over-accruals of bad debt expense that have accumulated on the balance
 sheet. An implication of our study is that tighter limits on the amount by
 which firms are permitted to understate net assets may reduce their
 ability to manage earnings. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009.

Title: Does Silence Speak? An Empirical Analysis of Disclosure Choices During Conference Calls 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>In this paper, we exploit the open
 nature of conference calls to explore whether managers withhold
 information from the investing public. Our evidence suggests that managers
 regularly leave participants on the conference call in the dark by not
 answering their questions. We find that the best predictors of such an
 event are firm size, a CEO's stock price-based incentives, company age,
 firm performance, litigation risk, and whether analysts are actively
 involved during the call's Q&A section. Finally, we document strong
 support for the assumption maintained in the literature that investors
 interpret silence negatively. That is, investors seem to interpret no news
 as bad news. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2010.

Title: Evidence Complexity and Information Search in the Decision to Restate Prior-Period Financial Statements 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Framed in the decision to restate
 financial statements, this study addresses whether behavior predicted by
 competing theories depends on the complexity of evidence. Two experiments
 observe the information-search behavior of auditors responsible for
 investigating their firm's prior opinion. Experiment 1 shows that auditors
 confronted with few (many)&ensp;"summarized statements"&ensp;that
 replicate in form the materials used in prior research prefer to first
 search statements that are inconsistent (consistent) with the prior-period
 accounting. This result generally corroborates research in accounting and
 confirms the predictions of information-quantity theory in psychology. In
 contrast, experiment 1 also shows that, when materials mimic the detailed
 documents common in practice, the results are different: Auditors
 confronted either with few or with many&ensp;"detailed
 documents"&ensp;prefer to search inconsistent documents first. This result
 confirms the predictions of evidence-complexity theory in psychology and
 shows that, compared to the materials on which prior research relies,
 detailed documents, such as memos, emails, letters, and analyses, drive
 information search toward inconsistent evidence. Experiment 2 probes
 further and finds that auditors evaluate documents bearing notes inscribed
 after the documents were prepared to be more inconsistent with the
 prior-period accounting, and that the dispersion in search behavior may be
 reliably conditional on the presence of notes. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2010.

Title: Disclosure "Bunching" 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper studies managers'
 preferences among information acquisition and disclosure policies when
 their firms are required to engage in "real-time" or "continuous"
 financial reporting. The paper predicts that for many, but not all,
 processes describing the distribution of their firms' cash flows, when
 subject to such reporting requirements, managers will engage in disclosure
 "bunching," that is, they will bunch the discretionary component of the
 information they acquire and disclose into a single point in time rather
 than spread the acquisition and disclosure of that information over time.
 We show that managers' preferred bunching period depends on managers'
 strategy for trading in their firms' shares, managers' risk aversion, the
 risk premium the capital market attaches to firms' shares, and the size of
 managers' initial ownership stakes in their firms. We also study and
 characterize how the equilibrium prices of firms' shares vary over time
 and also how managers' optimal trading strategies vary with their most
 preferred "bunching" strategies. Several extensions confirm the robustness
 of the optimality of disclosure "bunching." Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2010.

Title: The Relation Between Voluntary Disclosure and Financial Reporting: Evidence from Synthetic Leases 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>I investigate how the use and voluntary
 disclosure of synthetic leases is affected by incentives to defer cash
 outflows and manage the financial statements by keeping debt off the
 balance sheet. I find that managers of cash-constrained firms with
 incentives to defer cash payments are more likely to finance asset
 purchases with synthetic leases. The mandated reporting for synthetic
 leases allows managers to avoid disclosing the financial consequences of
 these transactions. Managers of firms with incentives to use
 off-balance-sheet financing do not provide transparent disclosure about
 their synthetic leases. However, managers of cash-constrained firms, which
 are less likely to use synthetic leases for financial reporting reasons,
 do voluntarily disclose the existence and financial consequences of these
 contracts. Alternative tests around FIN 46 adoption corroborate these
 findings. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2010.
