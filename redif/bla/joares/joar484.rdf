Title: Earnings Trend and Performance Relative to Benchmarks: How Consistency Influences Their Joint Use 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Archival research shows that the market
 reacts to earnings trend as well as to earnings performance relative to
 analysts' forecasts (i.e., benchmark performance). We conduct four
 experiments to investigate&ensp;"how"&ensp;and&ensp;"why"&ensp;investors
 react to these two measures when&ensp;"both"&ensp;are available over
 multiple time periods. Our results show that investors rely on an earnings
 measure only when it is consistent over time. When both measures are
 consistent over time, investors use them in an additive fashion,
 suggesting that they view them as providing different information about
 the firm. Further tests show that investors believe that earnings trend
 and benchmark performance both provide information about a firm's future
 prospects and management's credibility. Although judged future prospects
 fully explain the effect of earnings trend on investor judgments, neither
 judged future prospects nor management credibility completely explains the
 effect of benchmark performance. Our study has implications for firm
 managers and researchers. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2010.

Title: Increased Disclosure Requirements and Corporate Governance Decisions: Evidence from Chief Financial Officers in the Pre- and Post-Sarbanes-Oxley Periods 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>I study how increased internal control
 disclosure requirements mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) affect
 annual corporate governance decisions regarding CFOs. Using non-CEO,
 non-COO executive officers as a control group, I find that CFOs of firms
 with weak internal controls receive lower compensation and experience
 higher forced turnover rates after the passage of SOX. In contrast, CFOs
 of firms with strong internal controls receive higher compensation and do
 not experience significant changes in forced turnover rates. These results
 are consistent with the "disclosure of type" hypothesis, which suggests
 that the mandatory internal control disclosures under SOX are a credible
 mechanism that effectively distinguishes good CFOs from bad ones by
 revealing the firm's internal control quality. The empirical evidence thus
 supports the notion that mandated increases in disclosure reduce
 information asymmetry in the executive labor market. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2010.

Title: Predicting Stock Market Returns with Aggregate Discretionary Accruals 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We find that the positive relation
 between aggregate accruals and one-year-ahead market returns documented in
 Hirshleifer, Hou, and Teoh [2009] is driven by discretionary accruals but
 not normal accruals. The return forecasting power of aggregate
 discretionary accruals is robust to choices of sample periods, return
 measurements, estimation methods, business condition and risk premium
 proxies, and accrual models used to isolate discretionary accruals. Our
 extensive analysis shows that aggregate discretionary accruals, in sharp
 contrast to aggregate normal accruals, contain little information about
 overall business conditions or aggregate cash flows and display little
 co-movement with ICAPM-motivated risk premium proxies. Our findings imply
 that aggregate discretionary accruals likely reflect aggregate
 fluctuations in earnings management, thereby favoring the behavioral
 explanation that managers time aggregate equity markets to report
 earnings. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2010.

Title: The Regulation of Public Company Auditing: Evidence from the Transition to AS5 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>The replacement of Auditing Standard
 No. 2 (AS2) by Auditing Standard No. 5 (AS5) creates a natural experiment
 that sheds light on (1) potential inefficiencies caused by regulatory
 responses to a political crisis and (2) audit efficiency and effectiveness
 improvements resulting from the risk-based approach embodied in AS5. We
 study these effects by examining the impact of AS5 on audit fees. We find
 that AS5 audit fees are aligned with auditee fraud risk, but not AS2 audit
 fees. Second, relative to AS2 benchmark levels, AS5 audit fees are, on
 average, lower for all auditees. Third, relative to AS2 benchmarks, AS5
 fees are lower for lower-fraud-risk auditees but greater for
 higher-fraud-risk auditees. Overall, the evidence is consistent with (1)
 initial overregulation (via AS2) followed by reform (via AS5) and (2)
 auditors deploying a risk-based audit approach to obtain both efficiency
 and potential effectiveness gains in audit production. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2010.

Title: The Influence of Institutional Constraints on Outsourcing 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Drawing on transaction cost economics
 and institutional theory we argue that the effects of institutional
 constraints on the transaction costs of outsourcing vary systematically
 with the type of service outsourced and the ownership structure of the
 outsourcing firm. Using data from hospitals, we demonstrate that these
 effects lead to a higher extent of outsourcing of nonclinical compared to
 clinical services, and larger outsourcing response of nonclinical services
 to cost pressures from managed care. Further, the effects of ownership
 structure and associated governance mechanisms on institutional
 constraints are reflected in the empirical results as cross-sectional
 variations in the extent to which outsourcing is invoked as a response to
 cost pressures by hospitals of different ownership. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2010.
