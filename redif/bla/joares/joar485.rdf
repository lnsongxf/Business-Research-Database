Title: The Information Content of Forward-Looking Statements in Corporate Filings-A Naïve Bayesian Machine Learning Approach 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper examines the information
 content of the forward-looking statements (FLS) in the Management
 Discussion and Analysis section (MD&A) of 10-K and 10-Q filings using a
 Naïve Bayesian machine learning algorithm. I find that firms with better
 current performance, lower accruals, smaller size, lower market-to-book
 ratio, less return volatility, lower MD&A Fog index, and longer history
 tend to have more positive FLSs. The average tone of the FLS is positively
 associated with future earnings even after controlling for other
 determinants of future performance. The results also show that, despite
 increased regulations aimed at strengthening MD&A disclosures, there is no
 systematic change in the information content of MD&As over time. In
 addition, the tone in MD&As seems to mitigate the mispricing of accruals.
 When managers "warn" about the future performance implications of accruals
 (i.e., the MD&A tone is positive (negative) when accruals are negative
 (positive)), accruals are not associated with future returns. The tone
 measures based on three commonly used dictionaries (Diction, General
 Inquirer, and the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) do not positively
 predict future performance. This result suggests that these dictionaries
 might not work well for analyzing corporate filings. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2010.

Title: CEO Turnover and Retention Light: Retaining Former CEOs on the Board 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>Prior CEO turnover literature
 characterizes the board's decision as a choice between retaining versus
 replacing the CEO. We focus instead on the CEO's decision rights and
 introduce a third option in which the incumbent CEO is removed but
 retained on the board for an extended period, which we call Retention
 Light. Firms may benefit from Retention Light because former CEOs possess
 unique monitoring and advising abilities, but the former CEO could also
 exploit available decision rights for personal benefit. A Retention Light
 CEO's decision rights generally exceed those of CEOs who exit the firm
 entirely but fall short of the rights of a retained CEO. We find that when
 prior firm performance is better, the former CEO is more likely to be
 retained on the board (Retention Light) than to exit the firm. However,
 this relation is weaker when the CEO reaches normal retirement age at
 which time CEO power becomes more important. We also provide evidence on
 how the nature of the CEO's bargaining power varies with his personal
 attributes and board characteristics in its influence on the Retention
 Light decision. Retention Light firms are more likely than CEO-exit firms
 to select a successor CEO with relatively weaker bargaining power.
 Finally, Retention Light involving a nonfounder CEO is negatively
 associated with the firm's postturnover financial performance. Overall,
 Retention Light is a distinct CEO turnover option that has important
 consequences for board decisions and firm performance. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2010.

Title: Price Discovery and Dissemination of Private Information by Loan Syndicate Participants 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We delineate key channels through which
 flows of confidential information to loan syndicate participants impact
 the dynamics of information arrival in prices. We isolate the timing of
 private information flows by estimating the speed of price discovery over
 quarterly earnings cycles in both secondary syndicated loan and equity
 markets. We identify borrowers disseminating private information to
 lenders relatively early in the cycle with firms exhibiting relatively
 early price discovery in the secondary loan market, documenting that price
 discovery is faster for loans subject to financial covenants, particularly
 earnings-based covenants; for borrowers who experience covenant
 violations; for borrowers with high credit risk; and for loans syndicated
 by relationship-based lenders or highly reputable lead arrangers. We then
 ask whether early access to private information in the loan market
 accelerates the speed of information arrival in stock prices. We document
 that the stock returns of firms identified with earlier private
 information dissemination to lenders indeed exhibit faster price discovery
 in the stock market,&ensp;"but only"&ensp;when institutional investors are
 involved in the firm's syndicated loans. Further, the positive relation
 between institutional lending and the speed of stock price discovery is
 more pronounced in relatively weak public disclosure environments. These
 results are consistent with institutional lenders systematically
 exploiting confidential syndicate information via trading in the equity
 market. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2010.

Title: Association Between Borrower and Lender State Ownership and Accounting Conservatism 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>We examine the association between
 borrower (firm) and lender (bank) state ownership and accounting
 conservatism for a sample of Chinese firms. We hypothesize that
 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) adopt less conservative accounting than
 non-state-owned enterprises (NSOEs) because lenders are less concerned
 with downside risk for SOEs than for NSOEs. We also hypothesize a negative
 relation between conservatism and the fraction of total loans a firm
 borrows from state-owned banks (SBs) because SBs have weaker demand for
 assurance of sufficient net assets to cover loan repayments than
 non-state-owned banks (NSBs). We find support for both hypotheses. Further
 analyses reveal that: (1) firms that borrow from commercial SBs exhibit
 more conservative accounting than firms that borrow from policy SBs and
 (2) firms adopt more conservative accounting as they get more loans from
 banks with foreign ownership or exclusively foreign banks. However, the
 results of these additional analyses are to some extent sensitive to
 alternative measures of accounting conservatism. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2010.

Title: Negotiated Measurement Rules in Debt Contracts 
Abstract:
 <heading id="h1" level="1" implicit="yes"
 format="display">ABSTRACT</heading>This paper investigates contractual
 definitions of net income and net worth and the cross-sectional variation
 in definitions of net income in a large sample of private debt contracts
 to shed light on the debt contracting demand for accounting numbers. The
 descriptive evidence indicates that removing transitory earnings is one
 principal concern in the measurement of earnings but not in the
 measurement of net worth. In the extreme, contracts are never written on
 comprehensive income as an earnings concept, whereas accumulated other
 comprehensive income is included in net worth in most contracts. In
 contrast, conservative adjustment, in the sense of including certain types
 of negative earnings but not the corresponding positive earnings, does not
 seem to be a primary consideration in measuring net income and net worth.
 Cross-sectionally, I find that net income is more likely to be defined
 differently from the GAAP when net income plays a more important role in a
 contract, when the loan maturity is longer, and when transitory earnings
 are less useful for debt contracting. Collectively, the evidence shows
 that debt contracting parties choose contracting variables in a manner
 consistent with efficient contracting, and that transitory earnings are
 relatively less useful in measuring firm performance for debt contracting. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2010.
