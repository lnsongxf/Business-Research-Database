Title: Emotional Dynamics and Strategizing Processes: A Study of Strategic Conversations in Top Team Meetings 
Author-Name: Feng Liu  
Author-Name: Sally Maitlis  
Abstract:
  An important but largely unexplored issue in the study of
 strategy-as-discourse is how emotion affects the discursive processes
 through which strategy is constructed. To address this question, this
 paper investigates displayed emotions in strategic conversations and
 explores how the emotional dynamics generated through these displays shape
 a top management team's strategizing. Using microethnography, we analyse
 conversations about ten strategic issues raised across seven top
 management team meetings and identify five different kinds of emotional
 dynamic, each associated with a different type of strategizing process.
 The emotional dynamics vary in the sorts of emotions displayed, their
 sequencing and overall form. The strategizing processes vary in how issues
 are proposed, discussed, and evaluated, and whether decisions are taken or
 postponed. We identify team relationship dynamics as a key mechanism
 linking emotional dynamics and strategizing processes, and issue urgency
 as another important influence.

Title: The Double Edge of Ambiguity in Strategic Planning 
Author-Name: Chahrazad Abdallah  
Author-Name: Ann Langley  
Abstract:
  While the communications and strategy literatures have suggested that
 ambiguity embedded in texts such as strategic plans many enable the
 accommodation of divergent perspectives and contribute to building
 consensus and commitment, little is known about the consequences of such
 ambiguity for the consumption of strategy discourse or for the enactment
 of planned strategy. In a case study of strategic planning in a cultural
 organization, we identify three forms of ambiguity embedded in the
 strategy text, and show how these features generate different forms of
 consumption among organization members. We find that strategic ambiguity
 initially plays an enabling role as participants engage in enacting their
 respective interpretations of strategy. However, over time, the mobilizing
 effects of strategic ambiguity lead to internal contradiction and
 overextension. The study contributes by exploring empirically the
 double-edged nature of strategic ambiguity, and by identifying the
 underlying mechanisms by which its paradoxical consequences emerge. We
 show that while ambiguous strategy discourse enables strategic development
 and change, it may contain the seeds of its own dissolution contributing
 to cyclical patterns of strategy development and reorientation.

Title: Strategy, Discourse and Practice: The Intensification of Power 
Author-Name: Cynthia Hardy  
Author-Name: Robyn Thomas  
Abstract:
  We adopt a Foucauldian approach to discourse to show how power relations
 shape the constitution of strategy. By exploring two particular discourses
 associated with the strategy of a global telecommunications company, our
 study shows how the power effects of discourses are intensified through
 particular discursive and material practices, leading to the production of
 objects and subjects that are clearly aligned with the strategy. In this
 way, our study contributes to understanding: the mechanisms whereby
 discourse bears down on strategy through intensification practices;
 different forms of resistance; and the way in which strategy objects and
 subjects reproduce (or undermine) discourse.

Title: Micro-Level Discursive Strategies for Constructing Shared Views around Strategic Issues in Team Meetings 
Author-Name: Winston Kwon  
Author-Name: Ian Clarke  
Author-Name: Ruth Wodak  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">Abstract </title> <p>Management scholars
 have explored how certain actors in meetings – especially leaders – shape
 social processes of interaction and use different linguistic devices, as
 methods, to affect how sense is made of strategic issues. Less attention
 has been paid to interactions between members of the team as a whole and
 the repertoire of discursive strategies, or goal-directed behaviours, that
 they deploy to create shared views around issues. We analyse rare
 empirical episodes of team discussions of strategic issues in board
 meetings to inductively conceptualize how this is achieved. To do this we
 use the Discourse-Historical Approach (DHA) to critical discourse analysis
 (CDA). We reveal five discursive strategies teams use to develop shared
 views around strategic issues (Re/defining, Equalizing, Simplifying,
 Legitimating, and Reconciling) and demonstrate how they are skilfully
 operationalized through a range of linguistic devices or means.

Title: Placing Strategy Discourse in Context: Sociomateriality, Sensemaking, and Power 
Author-Name: Julia Balogun  
Author-Name: Claus Jacobs

Author-Name: Saku Mantere  
Author-Name: Eero Vaara  
Abstract:
  There has been increasing interest in the discursive aspects of strategy
 over the last two decades. In this paper we review the existing
 literature, focusing on six major bodies of discursive scholarship:
 post-structural, critical discourse analysis, narrative, rhetoric,
 conversation analysis, and metaphor. Our review reveals the significant
 contributions of research on strategy and discourse, but also the
 potential to advance research in this area by bringing together research
 on discursive practices and research on other practices we know to be
 important in strategy work. We explore the potential of discursive
 scholarship in integrating between significant theoretical domains
 (sensemaking, power, and sociomateriality), and realms of analysis
 (institutional, organizational, and the episodic), relevant to strategy
 scholarship. This allows us to place the papers published in this special
 issue on Strategy as Discourse: Its Significance, Challenges, and Future
 Directions among the body of knowledge accumulated thus far, and to
 suggest a way forward for future scholarship.

Title: The Discursive Construction of Strategists' Subjectivities: Towards a Paradox Lens on Strategy 
Author-Name: Stéphanie Dameron  
Author-Name: Christophe Torset  
Abstract:
  Until recently, the field of strategy has neglected the question of what
 it means to be a strategist. Based on an analysis of 68 interviews with
 strategy practitioners, our results highlight four main tensions that
 emerge from strategists' discourses on strategizing work: the social
 tension, the cognitive tension, the focus tension, and the time tension.
 This tension-based representation of strategy enables us to differentiate
 between three forms of strategists' subjectivities, i.e. the ways by which
 strategists discursively cope with tensions as a means of constituting
 their identity and legitimacy: the mythicizing subjectivity, the
 concretizing subjectivity, and the dialogizing subjectivity. Such results
 shed light on what a strategist is, suggesting that strategizing can be
 conceptualized as the art of balancing tensions and that multiple
 strategists' subjectivities within a paradox lens on strategy may in fact
 co-exist.
