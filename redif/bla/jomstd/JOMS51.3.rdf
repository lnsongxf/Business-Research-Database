Title: From Hot Cakes to Cold Feet: A Contingent Perspective on the Relationship between Market Uncertainty and Status Homophily in the Formation of Alliances 
Author-Name: Francois Collet  
Author-Name: Déborah Philippe  
Abstract:
  In this study, we reconsider the classical positive association between
 the level of market uncertainty and an organization's propensity to form
 ties with organizations of similar status. Although prior research argues
 that the greater the uncertainty, the higher the level of status
 homophily, we suggest that this relationship is contingent upon framing
 that affects positive or negative valence towards uncertainty. In an up
 market, organizations tend to frame uncertainty as upside risk, and thus
 will subsequently favour explorative uncertainty-mitigation devices;
 whereas, in a down market, organizations primarily frame uncertainty as
 downward risk, and thus will rely on more conservative
 uncertainty-mitigation mechanisms. We therefore predict that a greater
 number of status-heterophilous ties will be formed in an up market than in
 a down market. We discuss the implications of our results for status
 theory and more broadly for research on strategic decision making under
 uncertainty.

Title: Framing and Interorganizational Knowledge Transfer: A Process Study of Collaborative Innovation in the Aircraft Industry 
Author-Name: Elco Burg  
Author-Name: Hans Berends  
Author-Name: Erik M. Raaij  
Abstract:
  This article explains how and why organizational actors' decisions about
 interorganizational knowledge transfer might change over time. We find
 that organizational actors' framing of future innovation developments, as
 either an opportunity or a threat, motivates them to engage or disengage
 in interorganizational knowledge transfer activities. Shifts in framing
 lead organizational actors to leverage their relational context and
 knowledge base in new ways, thereby emphasizing the role of agency in
 drawing upon these structures. These findings are incorporated into a
 process model that explains discontinuous change in interorganizational
 knowledge transfer.

Title: Gender in Academic Networking: The Role of Gatekeepers in Professorial Recruitment 
Author-Name: Marieke Brink  
Author-Name: Yvonne Benschop  
Abstract:
  The aim of this study is to build a theoretical framework to understand
 how gendered networking practices produce or counter inequalities in
 organizations. We introduce a practice approach combined with a feminist
 perspective in organization network studies. The notions of gender and
 networking as social practices allow better insights into what people say
 and do in networks, and the ways that networking produces or counters
 gender inequalities. We draw on empirical material about professorial
 appointments in Dutch academia and analyse the accounts of gatekeepers
 illuminating their networking practices. The accounts show which
 networking practices gatekeepers routinely use in recruitment and how
 these networking practices are intertwined with gender practices. We use
 the notion of mobilizing masculinities to understand the self-evident
 identification of men gatekeepers with men in their networks, and to
 understand how both men and women gatekeepers prefer the male candidates
 that resemble the proven masculine success model. Furthermore, this study
 provides the first empirical insights in mobilizing femininities in which
 women search for and support women candidates. We show how the gender
 practice of mobilizing femininities is a more precarious and marked
 practice than mobilizing masculinities. Mobilizing femininities in
 networking is intended to counter gender inequalities, but is only
 partially successful. Through constructions of ‘who you can trust’ or ‘who
 is a risk’, gatekeepers exercise the power of inclusion and exclusion and
 contribute to the persistence of structural gender inequalities.

Title: Passion Isn't Always a Good Thing: Examining Entrepreneurs' Network Centrality and Financial Performance with a Dualistic Model of Passion 
Author-Name: Violet T. Ho  
Author-Name: Jeffrey M. Pollack  
Abstract:
  We propose a conceptual model that links entrepreneurs' passion, network
 centrality, and financial performance, and test this model with small
 business managers in formal business networking groups. Drawing on the
 dualistic model of passion, we explore the relationships that harmonious
 and obsessive passion have with financial performance, mediated by network
 centrality. Results indicate that harmoniously passionate entrepreneurs
 had higher out-degree centrality in their networking group (i.e., they
 were more inclined to seek out members to discuss work issues), which
 increased the income they received from peer referrals and, ultimately,
 business income. Obsessively passionate entrepreneurs had lower in-degree
 centrality (i.e., they were less likely to be approached by peers), and in
 turn received less income from referrals and less business income. These
 findings highlight that entrepreneurial passion does not always result in
 positive financial outcomes – the type of passion makes a difference.
 Implications for research and practice are discussed.

Title: Contracts, Negotiation, and Learning: An Examination of Termination Provisions 
Author-Name: Africa Ariño  
Author-Name: Jeffrey J. Reuer  
Author-Name: Kyle J. Mayer  
Author-Name: Juan Jané  
Abstract:
  Taking a temporal view of learning in partnerships, we argue that
 learning to contract from prior relationships can be manifested not only
 in an increase in the level of contractual detail but also in a decrease
 in negotiation time for a given level of contractual detail. We analyse
 the influence that the length of prior relationships and the detail of
 termination provisions have on negotiation time, or the time period that
 it takes for partners to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. We find
 that: (1) the length of prior relationships has a curvilinear, U-shaped
 effect on negotiation time, suggesting the possibility of diverse learning
 mechanisms as the relationship unfolds; (2) the impact of the detail of
 termination provisions on negotiation time varies across different types
 of termination provisions; and (3) it takes a shorter time to negotiate
 certain types of termination provisions when partners have longer prior
 relationships. Beyond suggesting the need to investigate the consequences
 of contractual provisions for collaborators, our study proposes
 negotiation time as an additional indicator of a learning-to-contract
 effect that complements existing ones.
