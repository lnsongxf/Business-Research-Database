Title: Opportunity Evaluation as Rule-Based Decision Making 
Author-Name: Matthew S. Wood  
Author-Name: David W. Williams  
Abstract:
  We draw from cognitive science literature on rule-based thinking to
 develop and empirically test a theoretical framework of entrepreneurial
 opportunity evaluation. We argue that entrepreneurs make use of socially
 constructed rules to discern the attractiveness of an opportunity, for
 them, specifically. Using conjoint analysis data of 498 decisions made by
 62 entrepreneurs, we find that entrepreneurs' use of rules regarding
 opportunity novelty, resource efficiency, and worst-case scenario
 significantly influences entrepreneurs' evaluations of opportunities and
 that individual differences in opportunity market and technology knowledge
 augment the effect of the rules on opportunity attractiveness.
 Additionally, we document that the worst-case scenario diminishes the
 positive effect of other rule criteria (e.g. novelty, resource efficiency)
 on opportunity evaluation and that market and technology knowledge further
 influence the negative effects of the worst-case scenario.

Title: How Does Project Termination Impact Project Team Members? Rapid Termination, ‘Creeping Death’, and Learning from Failure 
Author-Name: Dean A. Shepherd  
Author-Name: Holger Patzelt  
Author-Name: Trenton A. Williams  
Author-Name: Dennis Warnecke  
Abstract:
  Although extant studies have increased our understanding of the decision
 of when to terminate a project and its organizational implications, they
 do not explore the contextual mechanisms underlying the link between the
 speed at which a project is terminated and the learning of those directly
 working on the project. This is surprising because perceptions of project
 failure likely differ between those who own the option (i.e., the decision
 maker) and those who are the option (i.e., project team members). In this
 multiple case study, we explored research and development (R&D)
 subsidiaries within a large multinational parent organization and
 generated several new insights: (1) rather than alleviate negative
 emotions, delayed termination was perceived as creeping death, thwarting
 new career opportunities and generating negative emotions; (2) rather than
 obstructing learning from project experience, negative emotions motivated
 sensemaking efforts; and (3) rather than emphasizing learning after
 project termination, in the context of rapid redeployment of team members
 after project termination, delayed termination provided employees the time
 to reflect on, articulate, and codify lessons learned. We discuss the
 implications of these findings.

Title: Legitimacy-as-Feeling: How Affect Leads to Vertical Legitimacy Spillovers in Transnational Governance 
Author-Name: Patrick Haack  
Author-Name: Michael D. Pfarrer  
Author-Name: Andreas Georg Scherer  
Abstract:
  Transnational governance schemes (TGSs) are interorganizational networks
 of public and/or private actors that jointly regulate global public policy
 issues, such as the prevention of human rights violations and the
 protection of ecosystems. Considering that TGSs mainly address issues of
 public concern, the general public represents a major source of legitimacy
 in transnational governance. We theorize how members of the general
 public, whom we conceptualize as intuiters, apply heuristics to bestow
 legitimacy on TGSs. Given the difficulty of assessing TGSs, we argue that
 intuiters draw on affect-based responses towards a TGS's better-known
 network affiliates, such as participating business firms, to judge the
 legitimacy of the TGS as a whole. This substitution produces a ‘vertical’
 legitimacy spillover. More specifically, we examine the heuristic process
 of judgment underlying vertical spillovers in TGSs and derive implications
 for the legitimacy construct and the analysis of spillover phenomena.

Title: ‘Thinking Before Acting’ or ‘Acting Before Thinking’: Antecedents of Individual Action Propensity in Work Situations 
Author-Name: Dusya Vera  
Author-Name: Mary Crossan  
Author-Name: Claus Rerup  
Author-Name: Steve Werner  
Abstract:
  We introduce the concept of ‘individual action propensity’ to examine the
 approach of individuals towards solving situations for which they lack
 knowledge and/or experience about what to do. We focus on a naturally
 contrasting pair of responses: ‘thinking before acting’ or ‘acting before
 thinking’, and associate low action propensity with thinking one's way
 into understanding how to act, and high action propensity with acting
 one's way into understanding such situations. We build on regulatory mode
 theory – with its dimensions of locomotion and assessment and the
 trade-off between speed and accuracy – to examine individual
 characteristics as predictors of individual action propensity. We find
 that individual action propensity is associated with being a woman, having
 fewer years of formal education, not relying on help-seeking behaviours,
 and having a positive attitude towards spontaneity. Our findings shed
 light on why individuals take action, or not, and provide implications for
 research on organizational action propensity.

Title: When do Non-Family CEOs Outperform in Family Firms? Agency and Behavioural Agency Perspectives 
Author-Name: Danny Miller  
Author-Name: Isabelle Le Breton-Miller  
Author-Name: Alessandro Minichilli  
Author-Name: Guido Corbetta  
Author-Name: Daniel Pittino  
Abstract:
  Family firms represent a globally dominant form of organization, yet they
 confront a steep challenge of finding and managing competent leaders.
 Sometimes, these leaders cannot be found within the owning family. To date
 we know little about the governance contexts under which non-family
 leaders thrive or founder. Guided by concepts from agency theory and
 behavioural agency theory, we examine the conditions of ownership and
 leadership that promote superior performance among non-family CEOs of
 family firms. Our analysis of 893 Italian family firms demonstrates that
 these leaders outperform when they are monitored by multiple major family
 owners as opposed to a single owner; they also outperform when they are
 not required to share power with co-CEOs who are family members, and who
 may be motivated by parochial family socioemotional priorities.

Title: Legitimation of New Ventures: A Review and Research Programme 
Author-Name: Florian Überbacher  
Abstract:
  Research on how new ventures (NVs) achieve legitimacy is fragmented and
 rests on taken-for-granted assumptions that require problematization.
 Following a systematic literature review, I identify five distinct
 perspectives on NV legitimation: an institutional perspective, a cultural
 entrepreneurship perspective, an ecological perspective, an impression
 management perspective, and a social movement perspective. After comparing
 and contrasting these perspectives, I synthesize them into a generative
 and integrative typology. Based on this typology, I develop a new research
 programme. The programme widens the extant scholarship agenda by
 challenging its shared assumptions and contributes to further integration
 of the literature by building bridges between perspectives.
