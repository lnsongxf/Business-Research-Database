Title: So, What Am I Supposed to Do? A Multilevel Examination of Role Clarity 
Author-Name: Olli-Pekka Kauppila  
Abstract:
  Although prior research generally holds that role clarity is affected by
 both individual characteristics and organizational contexts, current
 conceptual or empirical models do not reflect the multilevel nature of
 these antecedents. A more complete understanding of how role clarity
 emanates from different organizational levels is necessary to help prevent
 poor job performance and other harmful consequences of ambiguous role
 expectations. To address this, I begin this research by investigating the
 effects of internal work locus of control, general self-efficacy, and
 leader–member exchange on role clarity. With respect to the cross-level
 effects, I focus on the roles of a manager's control style and the
 organization's strategy-making pattern. Analyses of a multi-industry,
 multilevel dataset collected from 724 employees and 124 managers in 25
 organizations in Finland suggest that all of the individual-level
 independent variables and a deliberate strategy-making pattern improve
 role clarity. However, a deliberate strategy-making pattern negatively
 moderates the relationship between general self-efficacy and role clarity.
 Finally, even though an outcome-based control system causes role ambiguity
 among employees in most functional areas, it may be an effective driver of
 role clarity among employees in sales jobs.

Title: Playing on Two Chessboards: Reputation Effects between Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate Political Activity (CPA) 
Author-Name: Frank Hond

Abstract:
  It has recently been argued that corporate social responsibility (CSR) is
 ‘political’. It has been neglected however, that firms also operate
 politically in a traditional sense, in seeking to secure favourable
 political conditions for their businesses. We argue that there are
 potential synergies between CSR and corporate political activity (CPA)
 that are often overlooked by firms and that recognition of these synergies
 will stimulate firms to align their CSR and CPA. We develop a conceptual
 model that specifies how various configurations of a firm's CSR and CPA –
 alignment, misalignment, and non-alignment – affect the firm's reputation
 beyond the separate reputation effects of CSR and CPA. This model has
 important implications for understanding how and why firms should pay
 attention to their CPA and CSR configurations, and thereby contributes to
 the broader issue of why firms should make sure that they are consistent
 in terms of responding to stakeholder concerns.

Title: The Contraction of Meaning: The Combined Effect of Communication, Emotions, and Materiality on Sensemaking in the Stockwell Shooting 
Author-Name: Joep P. Cornelissen  
Author-Name: Saku Mantere  
Author-Name: Eero Vaara  
Abstract:
  In this paper, we seek to understand how individuals, as part of a
 collective, commit themselves to a single, and possibly erroneous, frame,
 as a basis for sensemaking and coordinated actions. Using real-time data
 from an anti-terrorist police operation that led to the accidental
 shooting of an innocent civilian, we analyse how individual actors framed
 their circumstances in communication with one another and how this
 affected their subsequent interpretations and actions as events unfolded.
 Our analysis reveals, first, how the collective commitment to a framing of
 a civilian as a terrorist suicide bomber was built up and reinforced
 across episodes of collective sensemaking. Second, we elaborate on how the
 interaction between verbal communication, expressed and felt emotions, and
 material cues led to a contraction of meaning. This contraction stabilized
 and reinforced the overall framing at the exclusion of alternative
 interpretations. With our study we extend prior sensemaking research on
 environmental enactment and the escalation of commitment and elaborate on
 the role of emotions and materiality as part of sensemaking.

Title: Centres and Peripheries: Research Styles and Publication Patterns in ‘Top’ US Journals and their European Alternatives, 1960–2010 
Author-Name: Behlül Üsdiken  
Abstract:
  In view of recent literature, suggesting a growing international
 ascendancy of US-style scholarship but also a decreasing US dominance in
 journal publications, I ask two questions with regard to management and
 organization studies: (1) whether there has been an increasing convergence
 towards US-style research; and (2) whether the purported decline in the
 relative amount of US publications has been uniform across leading
 journals based in the USA and Europe. In addressing these questions, I
 take a historical perspective and draw upon the centre–periphery model of
 international scholarship, arguing that convergence or fragmentation in
 styles of research and variations in publication patterns have evolved
 through the interplay between processes of influence by the centre (i.e.,
 the USA) and imitative or competitive responses by the periphery.
 Empirically, the study spans the period 1960–2010 and is confined to ‘top’
 US-based journals and their main European alternatives. The findings
 answer the first question with a ‘no, other than a greater tendency
 towards the US-style when educational or collaborative ties to the USA are
 involved and by the recently emerging parts of the periphery’. The second
 question again is answered with a ‘no, the decline has been much less in
 “top” US journals relative to the ones based in Europe’.

Title: Service on a Stigmatized Board, Social Capital, and Change in Number of Directorships 
Author-Name: Kurt A. Wurthmann  
Abstract:
  This article seeks to develop a nuanced understanding about the
 relationship between service on a stigmatized board and reduced
 opportunities for future directorships on other boards by examining the
 moderating effects of different dimensions of director social capital on
 this relationship. Evidence based on a unique sample of firms with boards
 that were viewed as being stigmatized by a group of corporate governance
 experts suggests that while serving on a stigmatized board is related to a
 reduction in future number of directorships held, this relationship is
 significantly mitigated for directors of upper-class origins. However,
 social capital related to affiliations with other elite institutions does
 not appear to mitigate reduction in future number of directorships held by
 outside directors who serve on a stigmatized board. Implications and
 future directions in research on class-based influence in the corporate
 community and stigmatization and devaluation of elites associated with
 corporate failures are discussed.
