Title: Adaptation to Temporal Shocks: Influences of Strategic Interpretation and Spatial Distance 
Author-Name: Liliana Pérez-Nordtvedt

Author-Name: Jeffrey E. McGee  
Abstract:
  Even when shocks in a firm's environment are predictable, their
 consequences are not. Using the relocation of the Dallas Cowboys Stadium
 as a rich case of such a disruption, we investigate how combinations of
 strategic interpretation and spatial distance influence incumbent business
 owners' decisions to pursue temporal adaptation as a response. Temporal
 adaptation (TA) comprises timing rather than content changes by the firm
 seeking to adjust to the reconfigured environment. Survey data from 168
 business owners show that strategic interpretation directly influences TA
 decisions. However, the effect of strategic interpretation on the TA
 decision is moderated by the spatial (geographic) distance of the
 incumbent firm from the locus of the disruption. Furthermore, results
 suggest that through strategic interpretation, spatial distance also
 indirectly affects the business owners' decisions to make temporal
 changes. Data collected 1.5 and 4 years later suggest that TA responses
 are related to performance and may be indicative of a particular type of
 TA, organizational entrainment (OE), which concerns the synchronization of
 organizational activity cycles with cycles in the environment.

Title: The Financial Effects of Uniform and Mixed Corporate Social Performance 
Author-Name: Ioannis Oikonomou  
Author-Name: Chris Brooks  
Author-Name: Stephen Pavelin  
Abstract:
  Firms typically present a mixed picture of corporate social performance
 (CSP), with positive and negative indicators exhibited by the same firm.
 Thus, stakeholders' judgments of corporate social responsibility (CSR)
 typically evaluate positives in the context of negatives, and vice versa.
 Building on social judgment theory, we present two alternative accounts of
 how stakeholders respond to such complexity, which provide differing
 implications for the financial effects of CSP: reciprocal dampening and
 rewarding uniformity. Echoing notable findings on strategic consistency,
 our US panel study finds that firms that exhibit uniformly positive or
 uniformly negative indicators in particular dimensions of CSP outperform
 firms that exhibit a mixed picture of positives and negatives, which
 supports the notion that stakeholders' judgments of CSR reward uniformity.

Title: Moving Forward: Developing Theoretical Contributions in Management Studies 
Author-Name: Joep P. Cornelissen  
Author-Name: Rodolphe Durand  
Abstract:
  How do we, as management researchers, develop novel theoretical
 contributions and, thereby, potentially break new ground in management
 studies? To address this question, we review previous methodological work
 on theorizing and advance a typology of the reasoning processes that
 underlie theoretical contributions and significant advances in management
 studies. This typology consists of various types of analogical and
 counterfactual reasoning, ranging from focused thought experiments aimed
 at prodding existing theory in the direction of alternative assumptions,
 constructs, and hypotheses to more expansive efforts for inducing new
 theoretical models and alternative explanations. Applying this typology,
 we detail the mechanisms behind the formation of novel theoretical
 contributions and illustrate the currency of our typology through a review
 of 24 major theoretical breakthroughs in management studies. We conclude
 the paper by discussing the implications of this typology for our
 collective efforts in building, elaborating, and expanding theory in
 management studies.

Title: Dreaming of Flying When Grounded: Occupational Identity and Occupational Fantasies of Furloughed Airline Pilots 
Author-Name: Amy L. Fraher  
Author-Name: Yiannis Gabriel  
Abstract:
  This article analyses the effects of job loss on the occupational
 identities of a group of United States pilots, laid off (or ‘furloughed’)
 twice by their employer in the decade following 9/11. Using a narrative
 methodology, the paper examines how the childhood dream of flying,
 referred to as the Phaëthon dream, serves as an identity anchor that
 sustained their occupational identities. When the circumstances of the
 aviation industry (restructuring, outsourcing, and downsizing) led to
 extensive lay-offs, this identity anchor functioned in two contrasting
 ways. Some pilots moved on to retrain and start new careers, without
 abandoning their occupational identities or relinquishing the dream of
 flying. Another group of pilots, however, were stuck in occupational limbo
 waiting to be recalled by their employer, unwilling to forsake this dream
 and refusing to contemplate a move that would decisively take them out of
 their pilot seats. The paper's contribution lies in theorizing how a dream
 originating in childhood, linked to a long-standing archetype of flying
 and subsequently hardened into a shared occupational fantasy, acts as an
 identity anchor and how this shapes responses to the trauma of job loss.
 The paper concludes by linking the Phaëthon dream to its mythological
 counterpart in order to highlight its enduring, shared, and unconscious
 character.

Title: Local Venturing as Compassion Organizing in the Aftermath of a Natural Disaster: The Role of Localness and Community in Reducing Suffering 
Author-Name: Dean A. Shepherd  
Author-Name: Trenton A. Williams  
Abstract:
  In contrast to models of compassion within existing organizations, this
 grounded theory study examines how ventures emerge relying on localness
 and community in direct response to ‘opportunities’ to alleviate suffering
 in the aftermath of a natural disaster. While a natural disaster is a
 surprising disruptive event devastating a local community, that local
 community is nested within a broader community, which can be a source of
 abundant resources. Ventures created in the aftermath of a natural
 disaster, given local knowledge and unencumbered by pre-existing systems,
 procedures, and capabilities, are highly effective at connecting the
 broader community with the local community through customizing resources
 to meet victims' needs and to quickly delivering these resources to
 alleviate suffering.

Title: Antecedents and Employee Outcomes of Line Managers' Perceptions of Enabling HR Practices 
Author-Name: Bård Kuvaas  
Author-Name: Anders Dysvik  
Author-Name: Robert Buch  
Abstract:
  To learn more about the role of line managers in the implementation of HR
 practices, we propose and test a model of line managers' perceptions of
 enabling HR practices on the one hand and employee outcomes on the other.
 In a field study of 89 line managers and 631 employees, we observed that
 the relationship between line managers' perceptions of enabling HR
 practices and employees' intrinsic motivation, affective organizational
 commitment, and turnover intention was mediated by employees' perceived
 supervisor support. Line managers' perceptions of enabling HR practices,
 in turn, were predicted by line managers' perceived quality of the HR
 training they received. Theoretical and practical implications and
 directions for future research are discussed.
