Title: Rethinking Institutions and Organizations 
Author-Name: Royston Greenwood  
Author-Name: C. R. Hinings  
Author-Name: Dave Whetten  
Abstract:
  In this Point–Counterpoint article we argue that institutional
 scholarship has become overly concerned with explaining institutions and
 institutional processes, notably at the level of the organization field,
 rather than with using them to explain and understand organizations.
 Especially missing is an attempt to gain a coherent, holistic account of
 how organizations are structured and managed. We also argue that when
 institutional theory does give attention to organizations it
 inappropriately treats them as though they are the same, or at least as
 though any differences are irrelevant for purposes of theory. We propose a
 return to the study of organizations with an emphasis upon comparative
 analysis, and suggest the institutional logics perspective as an
 appropriate means for doing so.

Title: The Contingent Effects of Social Network Sparseness and Centrality on Managerial Innovativeness 
Author-Name: Sze-Sze Wong  
Author-Name: Wai Fong Boh  
Abstract:
  Prior research has highlighted that network sparseness and network
 centrality enhance innovativeness through access to information and
 influence, respectively. We advance this perspective by exploring the
 extent to which individual actions are needed to mobilize information and
 influence accessed through social networks, and whether such information
 and influence would mutually reinforce to enhance managerial
 innovativeness. Our findings found partial support for the idea that
 actions are needed to actualize potential resources embedded in social
 networks, as centrally positioned managers enjoy higher innovativeness
 when they engage in ambassador activities. We also found that advice
 network sparseness and advice network centrality had independent, not
 interactive relationships with managerial innovativeness, suggesting that
 they offer distinct routes to achieving managerial innovativeness.
 Overall, our research clarifies the relationships of two important social
 network attributes on managerial innovativeness, and also sheds new light
 on how managerial action matters in realizing social network advantages
 for innovative ends.

Title: Knowledge Spillovers and Alliance Formation 
Author-Name: Anupama Phene  
Author-Name: Stephen Tallman  
Abstract:
  Our study examines the conditions under which firms enter into strategic
 alliances subsequent to knowledge spillovers. We propose that spillovers
 serve as signals of knowledge dependence and potential complementarity,
 encouraging alliance formation to enable better learning and limit
 appropriation. We posit that the likelihood of a knowledge alliance
 subsequent to a spillover is contingent on the specialization of each of
 the firms in the knowledge involved in the spillover. We also hypothesize
 that the effects of such specialization on knowledge alliance formation
 are moderated by technological ties and geographic distance between the
 dyad involved in the spillover. Our results demonstrate significance for
 the effects of specialization, supporting learning and appropriation
 motivations. Technological ties strengthen while geographic distance
 weakens the relationship between specialization and alliance formation.

Title: Does Institutional Theory Need Redirecting? 
Author-Name: Renate E. Meyer  
Author-Name: Markus A. Höllerer  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">Abstract </title> <p>Greenwood, Hinings
 and Whetten (2014) present two major criticisms of current institutional
 scholarship, and see need for a broad redirection: institutional
 organization theory, they argue, has lost sight of the claim to study
 organizations and, with its overwhelming focus on isomorphism and
 similarity, has fallen short on adequately theorizing differences across
 organizations. In our article, we offer support as well as a riposte.
 First, while we agree that the organizing of collective efforts needs to
 be at the core of organization research, we warn that focusing on formal
 organization – a rationalized cultural product itself – may direct
 attention away from studying alternative modes of organizing, and
 underestimates the dynamic developments that have transformed contemporary
 organizations into increasingly complex objects of inquiry. Second, we are
 concerned that, by abandoning the analysis of similarities in favour of
 differences, institutional theory may eventually lose sight of its pivotal
 quest: to study institutions.

Title: Donating Money to Get Money: The Role of Corporate Philanthropy in Stakeholder Reactions to IPOs 
Author-Name: Ming Jia  
Author-Name: Zhe Zhang  
Abstract:
  This study examines how stakeholders' investment time horizons interact
 with information about corporate giving in initial public offering (IPO)
 firms. Specifically, we build a model that explains how corporate
 philanthropy affects IPO performance. We find that at the IPO-preparation
 stage, corporate giving is negatively related to underwriter prestige,
 venture capital investment, and IPO financing costs. We also find that at
 the IPO-issuance stage, negative media coverage of IPOs moderates the
 U-shaped relationship between corporate giving and market premiums. At the
 IPO-trading stage, we find that corporate giving only positively
 influences the market premiums for IPO firms that are the subject of
 negative media reports. Our findings contribute to the signalling theory
 by showing how various stakeholders interpret the same signals
 differently, and they have implications for understanding how the
 relationship between corporate philanthropy and corporate financial
 performance materializes in the IPO markets.

Title: Activism for Corporate Responsibility: Conceptualizing Private Regulation Opportunity Structures 
Author-Name: Sébastien Mena  
Author-Name: Daniel Waeger  
Abstract:
  In this article, we examine how private regulatory initiatives (PRIs) –
 which define standards for corporate responsibility (CR) issues and
 sometimes monitor their application by firms – create opportunities and
 constraints for activist groups aiming to push firms towards more
 stringent CR activities. Drawing on social movement theory, we
 conceptualize how private regulation opportunity structures affect such
 CR-based activist groups' targets and tactics at both the firm and field
 levels. At the field level, we argue that both radical and reformative
 activist groups direct most of their time and resources towards PRIs with
 comparatively more stringent standards. At the firm level, while radical
 activist groups are likely to target firms participating in more stringent
 PRIs, reformative activist groups target firms participating in less
 stringent PRIs, or those that do not participate in PRIs at all. When
 facing unfavourable opportunity structures, CR-based activist groups tend
 either to advocate the creation of new PRIs or to shift their activities
 to pressure other focal points. This article contributes to moving beyond
 extant literature's emphasis of PRIs as settlements of contentious
 firm–activist interactions towards also viewing them as starting points
 for activist groups aiming to push firms towards a more substantive CR
 engagement.

Title: CEO Succession Mechanisms, Organizational Context, and Performance: A Socio-Emotional Wealth Perspective on Family-Controlled Firms 
Author-Name: Alessandro Minichilli  
Author-Name: Mattias Nordqvist  
Author-Name: Guido Corbetta  
Author-Name: Mario Daniele Amore  
Abstract:
  This article extends the literature on CEO succession and financial
 performance by addressing corporate owners' mixed motives and desires to
 protect their interest in being in business. We draw on a Socio-Emotional
 Wealth (SEW) perspective to investigate how the choice of one of three
 succession mechanisms – relay succession, ‘horse races’ among internal CEO
 candidates, and hiring from outside – may effectively balance trade-offs
 between corporate owners' non-financial SEW motives and the firm's
 financial performance. We find that implementing one of these succession
 mechanisms reduces the negative impact that typically characterizes CEO
 transitions in family firms. We also show that family presence on the
 board of directors offsets the benefits of having selected these balancing
 succession mechanisms, in either placing too much emphasis on SEW, or
 creating negative dynamics that make the chosen succession mechanisms less
 effective.

Title: Turnover and Knowledge Loss: An Examination of the Differential Impact of Production Manager and Worker Turnover in Service and Manufacturing Firms 
Author-Name: Rory Eckardt  
Author-Name: Bruce C. Skaggs  
Author-Name: Mark Youndt  
Abstract:
  This research examines the comparative effects of production manager and
 worker turnover in service and manufacturing settings. We suggest that,
 due to the centrality of human action in services and the ability of
 manufacturers to insulate the technical core, service and manufacturing
 companies are differentially dependent on and impacted by the loss of
 production manager and worker knowledge. The results from a survey of 150
 service and manufacturing firms provide partial support for this notion
 and show that turnover impacts these organizations differently. More
 specifically, we find that: (1) the negative impact of production worker
 turnover on firm performance is greater in service settings than in
 manufacturing settings; and (2) the negative impact of production worker
 turnover on firm performance is greater than the impact of production
 manager turnover in service firms. In addition, our findings show that
 organizational capital moderates the turnover–performance relationship for
 production workers in service firms.
