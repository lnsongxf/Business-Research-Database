Title: Workforce Downsizing and Firm Performance: An Organizational Routine Perspective 
Author-Name: Matthias Brauer  
Author-Name: Tomi Laamanen  
Abstract:
  While there is an extensive body of work on how organizational routines
 emerge and evolve over time, there is a scarcity of research on what
 happens when routines are disrupted or disbanded through the elimination
 of key individuals involved in them. This study is the first to theorize
 and empirically examine the relationship between the magnitude of
 workforce downsizing and firm performance applying an organizational
 routine perspective. Consistent with prior research on organizational
 routines, we posit that small-scale downsizing leads to efficiency
 improvements without disrupting the existing routines. While larger
 routine disruptions occur in both medium- and large-scale downsizing, we
 further argue and find that large-scale downsizing tends to be more
 beneficial than medium-scale downsizing. Building on prior research on
 routines, we reason that in medium-scale downsizing employees try to
 salvage the impaired, partially functioning routines, while large-scale
 downsizing requires a more fundamental rethinking and re-creation of
 routines leading to more positive outcomes. Our study contributes to
 downsizing research through the application of the organizational routine
 perspective to explain the financial outcomes of downsizing. In doing so,
 we depart from the widely held assumption in the downsizing literature
 that the relationship between the magnitude of downsizing and firm
 performance is linear. Our study also extends prior research on
 organizational routines by highlighting the usefulness of conceiving
 routines as mindful accomplishments where the pressure to engage in
 path-breaking cognitive effort may lead to better results than
 path-dependent repairing of routines.

Title: Looking Attractive until You Sell: Earnings Management, Lockup Expiration, and Venture Capitalists 
Author-Name: Dae-il Nam  
Author-Name: Haemin Dennis Park  
Author-Name: Jonathan D. Arthurs  
Abstract:
  Earnings management occurs when managerial discretion allows managers to
 influence reported earnings and thus mislead some investors about the
 underlying economic performance and quality of the firm. This study
 considers how potential investors may guard against earnings management by
 observing negative stock price reaction at the lockup expiration period of
 initial public offering (IPO) firms as a negative signal. Findings from a
 sample of 160 newly public firms show that earnings management behaviour
 is stronger in IPO firms backed by venture capitalists (VCs). Moreover, VC
 reputation negatively moderates this relationship such that IPO firms
 backed by reputable VCs are less likely to manage earnings, suggesting
 that reputable VCs serve an auditing function following an IPO. Overall,
 we provide insights into signalling theory by examining negative signals
 arising from the behaviour of multiple agents in an IPO firm.

Title: Signalling Theory and Equilibrium in Strategic Management Research: An Assessment and a Research Agenda 
Author-Name: Donald D. Bergh  
Author-Name: Brian L. Connelly  
Author-Name: David J. Ketchen Jr 
Author-Name: Lu M. Shannon  
Abstract:
  Actors within organizations commonly must make choices armed with
 incomplete and asymmetrically distributed information. Signalling theory
 seeks to explain how individuals are able to do so. This theory's primary
 predictive mechanism is ‘separating equilibrium’, which occurs when a
 signal's expectations are confirmed through experience. A content analysis
 finds that most strategic management signalling theory studies have not
 fully leveraged separating equilibrium. This presents two possible paths
 for future research. First, some researchers may wish to incorporate
 separating equilibrium. We illustrate how doing so can uncover new
 relationships, generate novel insights, and fortify the theory's
 application. Others who want to theorize about signals, but not examine
 separating equilibrium, could integrate ideas from signalling theory with
 other information perspectives. Here a signal becomes one stimulus among
 many that corporate actors interpret and act upon. We provide research
 agendas so strategy scholars can apply signalling theory most effectively
 to meet their research objectives.

Title: A Balancing Act: Emotional Challenges in the HR Role 
Author-Name: Elaine O'Brien  
Author-Name: Carol Linehan  
Abstract:
  Despite much academic work and the development of multiple typologies, we
 are still some way from understanding the HR role. There is a dearth of
 empirical evidence on HR professionals' work and recent models have been
 criticized for not adequately reflecting the challenges of trying to
 balance competing stakeholder interests. We approach this lacuna by
 focusing on an issue that has not been fully considered in relation to HR
 work – emotion. Drawing on the findings of a broader study into emotional
 labour, we highlight the emotive challenges inherent in the day-to-day
 practice of HR. We explore the disjunctions between ‘felt’ emotions and
 those actually displayed to meet differing stakeholders' expectations. We
 show how achieving an appropriate emotion display is a challenging pursuit
 given these competing expectations. Our contribution is to elucidate
 emotional labour in the under-researched ‘backstage’ professional context,
 and through our emotion focus to extend our understanding of the
 complexity of the HR role beyond current prescriptive models.

Title: Co-Worker Exclusion and Employee Outcomes: An Investigation of the Moderating Roles of Perceived Organizational and Social Support 
Author-Name: Kristin L. Scott

Abstract:
  When does social support alleviate or exacerbate the effects of being
 excluded by colleagues in the workplace? This study integrates
 belongingness and social support theories to predict and demonstrate the
 differential effects of work-related support (i.e., perceived
 organizational support; POS) and non-work-related support (i.e., family
 and social support; FSS) on employee reactions to co-worker exclusion.
 Consistent with our predictions, we found that employees reporting high
 levels of co-worker exclusion and high levels of perceived organizational
 support demonstrate higher levels of performance and increased levels of
 self-worth than those reporting low levels of POS. Alternatively, support
 from family or friends intensified the negative relationship between
 co-worker exclusion and self-esteem and the positive relationship between
 co-worker exclusion and job-induced tension. Unexpectedly, FSS did not
 influence the supervisor-rated task performance of excluded workers, nor
 did POS mitigate the relationship between co-worker exclusion and
 job-induced tension. Implications for theory, research, and practice are
 discussed.
