Title: Sources of Selection in Strategy Making 
Author-Name: J. Ignacio Canales  
Abstract:
  This paper elaborates theory inductively by following the evolution of 14
 strategic initiatives from an exploratory case study. The study examines
 the context and character of such initiatives over an 8-year period. Based
 on these initiatives, the paper proposes a two-stage selection mechanism
 for the intra-evolutionary strategy process that explains the long-term
 mutation of organizations. The mechanism operates by selecting according
 to both fit with the strategic intent and feasibility of the initiative.
 These two elements combine into an organizational principle that is
 perceived as permanent in character but mutates through constructive
 confrontation. This principle contributes to the organizational identity
 but, being a low-level element of such identity, it can be modified
 through learning while retaining an attribute of endurance as perceived by
 organizational members.

Title: Formal and Informal Corruption Environments and Multinational Enterprise Social Irresponsibility 
Author-Name: Dawn L. Keig  
Author-Name: Lance Eliot Brouthers  
Author-Name: Victor B. Marshall  
Abstract:
  Using an institutional theory framework we theorize, hypothesize, and
 empirically show that higher levels of formal and informal corruption
 environments found in a firm's operating portfolio are related to higher
 levels of corporate social irresponsibility (CSiR). Failing to consider
 corruption's informal dimension leads to potentially false perceptions
 about a multinational enterprise's (MNE) operating environment,
 particularly when the formal dimension is low but the informal corruption
 dimension is high, as is the case in about one third of our sample.
 Including the informal corruption environment component provides
 additional explanatory power over the formal corruption environment alone
 in predicting CSiR and yields a superior understanding of both the formal
 and informal dimensions of the corruption institutional environment's
 influence on corporate social irresponsibility levels of MNEs. Managerial
 implications and future research directions are discussed.

Title: Organizational Identification during a Merger: The Role of Self-Enhancement and Uncertainty Reduction Motives during a Major Organizational Change

Abstract:
  Past research focuses predominantly on self-enhancement as a motive
 underlying organizational identification even though there have been
 several calls for examining multiple motives of identification. Our
 research explores the interplay of the self-enhancement and the
 uncertainty reduction motives in shaping identification during a major
 organizational change: a merger of a business unit with its parent
 corporation. Based on analysis of survey responses collected from 751
 employees of the merging business unit, we find that the self-enhancement
 motive, measured via attractiveness of perceived organizational identity
 and perceived external prestige, continues to influence identification
 during this merger. However, its effects are diminished when considering
 the effect of the uncertainty reduction motive. In particular, in addition
 to affecting identification directly, this latter motive, measured via
 agreement with projected identity of the business unit and identification
 with a distal target (i.e., the parent corporation), decreases the effect
 of perceived external prestige on business unit identification. Our
 research answers longstanding calls for understanding organizational
 identification motives beyond self-enhancement, and shows how multiple
 identification motives work during a major organizational change: a time
 when identification is strongly needed, yet hard to garner.

Title: Human Capital and CEO Compensation during Institutional Transitions 
Author-Name: Mike W. Peng  
Author-Name: Sunny Li Sun  
Author-Name: Lívia Markóczy  
Abstract:
  Firms appoint CEOs with different types of human capital in order to
 manage resource dependencies. How CEOs are compensated thus can be
 conceptualized as a valuation process of how boards view the value of
 CEOs' human capital. Two types of human capital – international experience
 and political ties – have emerged as potential drivers of CEO compensation
 during institutional transitions. But how they impact CEO compensation has
 remained unclear. We develop a resource dependence-based, contingency
 framework to focus on the external and internal factors that enable or
 constrain human capital to impact CEO compensation. Because of the
 tremendous regional diversity within China, externally, we focus on the
 level of marketization of the region in which firms are headquartered.
 Internally, we pay attention to two corporate governance mechanisms:
 politically connected outside directors and compensation committee. Data
 from 10,329 firm-year observations at 94 per cent of listed firms in China
 largely support our framework. Overall, our study contributes to resource
 dependence research by extending this research to the context of
 institutional transitions with a focus on how human capital impacts CEO
 compensation.

Title: Signifying Williamson's Contribution to the Transaction Cost Approach: An Agent-Based Simulation of Coasean Transaction Costs and Specialization 
Author-Name: Per L. Bylund  
Abstract:
  This article simulates Ronald Coase's transaction cost approach to firm
 organizing using agent-based modelling, and contextualizes and contrasts
 it with a division-of-labour/specialization view of the firm that Coase
 challenged and sought to replace. The simulation tests the firm formation
 process based on the different implications of transaction costs and
 specialization as drivers of integration, focusing especially on Coase's
 rejection of specialization as an explanation for integration in the firm.
 The results show little support for, and suggest an important shortcoming
 to, Coase's transaction cost theory. My findings thereby indicate a
 potential relationship between the specialization theory and Williamson's
 Transaction Cost Economics, especially the latter's emphasis on
 co-specialization through relationship-specific investments, which helps
 shed light on TCE's significant influence in the theory of the firm
 literature.

Title: Changing Routine: Reframing Performance Management within a Multinational

Abstract:
  This paper seeks to extend the literature on how change occurs in
 organizational routines by examining the link between routines and
 schemata and showing the cognitive and motivational factors involved.
 Using an in-depth analysis of a Japanese multinational, we develop an
 account of how a newly-implemented centralized performance management
 routine is interpreted by managers at two subsidiaries. We show how
 different performances of subroutines emerge into a new ostensive pattern
 of a routine, and how the cognitive and motivational aspects of individual
 agency are manifested in this process and how they affect the espoused
 organizational schema.
