Title: Accounting for the Influence of Overall Justice on Job Performance: Integrating Self-Determination and Social Exchange Theories 
Author-Name: Samuel Aryee

Author-Name: Chris W. L. Chu  
Abstract:
  Grounded in self-determination and social exchange theories, this study
 examined two pathways through which overall justice influences job
 performance. Specifically, we hypothesized need satisfaction as a mediator
 of the influence of overall justice on intrinsic motivation and trust in
 organization which, in turn, relate to job performance. Results of
 structural equation modelling using Mplus revealed that need satisfaction
 mediated the overall justice–intrinsic motivation relationship as well as
 the overall justice–trust in organization relationship. We also found that
 intrinsic motivation mediated the respective influence of need
 satisfaction and trust in organization on job performance. We interpret
 our findings as suggesting an integration of need-based theories of
 motivation into explanations of the performance implications of justice.

Title: Celebrating Organization Theory 
Author-Name: Michael Lounsbury  
Author-Name: Christine M. Beckman  
Abstract:
  In this paper, we respond to recent critiques about the state of
 organization theory that have characterized it as being anachronistic,
 overly theoretical, or lacking the right kind of theory. We argue that
 organization theory is extremely vibrant and highlight several areas where
 there are flourishing and generative developments – institutional logics,
 categorization, networks, performance feedback, and strategy-as-practice.
 We also note the growing internationalization of organization theory as
 exemplified in the shifting demography of the Organization and Management
 Theory division at the Academy of Management as well as at the European
 Group on Organization Studies. As engaged organization theory supporters
 and scholars, we additionally argue for a more balanced appreciation of
 not only the weaknesses in the field, but also its strengths, and urge a
 re-engagement in more productive conversations about the important role of
 theory and theorizing.

Title: Celebrating Organization Theory: The After-Party 
Author-Name: Gerald F. Davis  
Abstract:
  Organization and management theory as a field faces criticisms from
 several scholars that it has an unhealthy obsession with ‘theory’, while
 at the same time seeing very little cumulative theoretical progress. Some
 have even accused the field of being mired in the 1970s. Lounsbury and
 Beckman counter with an expansive review of several thriving domains of
 contemporary organizational research that demonstrate the theoretical
 vibrancy of the field. This article responds by seeking to define
 ‘theoretical progress’ in ways that extend beyond just the volume of
 articles produced. It finds that 1970s-era classics have seen a surge of
 citations since the turn of the twenty-first century, consistent with a
 view of limited progress. It concludes by outlining three areas of
 problem-driven research eminently worthy of attention from organizational
 researchers.

Title: Harsh Evaluations of Entrepreneurs Who Fail: The Role of Sexual Orientation, Use of Environmentally Friendly Technologies, and Observers' Perspective Taking 
Author-Name: Dean A. Shepherd  
Author-Name: Holger Patzelt  
Abstract:
  Although there is a pervasive anti-failure bias in society, we
 investigate why some entrepreneurs who fail are evaluated more harshly
 than others. Building on attribution theory and the literatures on
 prejudice, pro-social intentions, and perspective taking, we offer an
 evaluation model of entrepreneurial failure and test this model on 6,784
 assessments made by 212 observers. We find that variance in the harshness
 of failure evaluations depends on both the attributes of the entrepreneur
 and the attributes of the observer, and the interaction between the two.
 Specifically, entrepreneurs who are homosexual are evaluated more harshly
 by some observers and entrepreneurs who use environmentally friendly
 technology are evaluated less harshly. Moreover, observers high in
 perspective taking are more ‘lenient’ in their failure evaluations of
 those who use environmentally friendly technology than those low in
 perspective taking.

Title: Bringing Political Skill into Social Networks: Findings from a Field Study of Entrepreneurs 
Author-Name: Ruolian Fang  
Author-Name: Lei Chi  
Author-Name: Manli Chen  
Author-Name: Robert A. Baron  
Abstract:
  The authors integrate the entrepreneurship literature's sociological and
 behavioural perspectives and examine the processes through which
 entrepreneurs first build social networks and then use the network
 resources for enhancing venture performance. Field interviews of
 entrepreneurs during a six-month period reveal that political skill is an
 important individual-level factor that influences the construction and use
 of social networks. Theoretical and practical implications of the major
 findings are discussed.

Title: Does Familiarity Foster Innovation? The Impact of Alliance Partner Repeatedness on Breakthrough Innovations 
Author-Name: Yanfeng Zheng  
Author-Name: Haibin Yang  
Abstract:
  Does familiarity with alliance partners promote breakthrough innovations?
 This study draws on the literature of interorganizational routines to
 examine the impact of repeated R&D collaborations within a firm's alliance
 portfolio on its breakthrough innovations. Specifically, we contend that
 the benefits and liabilities of interorganizational routines, arising from
 alliance partner repeatedness at a firm's alliance portfolio level, lead
 to an inverted U-shaped relationship between alliance partner repeatedness
 and breakthrough innovations. Further, we build on the recent theoretical
 development of interorganizational routines to propose that technological
 dynamism will make the inverted U-shaped relationship steeper. Analyses of
 approximately 230 firms in the US biopharmaceutical industry from 1983 to
 2002 support our hypotheses. Our findings provide important implications
 for research on alliance portfolio and management of firm innovation.
