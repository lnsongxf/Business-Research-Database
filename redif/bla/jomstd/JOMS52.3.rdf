Title: On the Same Side of the Faultline: Inclusion in the Leader's Subgroup and Employee Performance

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Extending theory on
 faultlines and subgroups, we argue that faultlines splitting a team into
 homogeneous subgroups can have different effects on team members'
 individual performance, depending on different intra-subgroup processes.
 Specifically, we propose that the effect of faultline strength on
 individual performance depends on whether a team member's subgroup
 includes the team leader. Building on the notion of faultline triggers, we
 further propose that organizational crises exacerbate this interaction
 because they make social support by the team leader especially important.
 We tested these assumptions with objective performance data collected over
 a period of four years from 3263 financial consultants (325 teams) while
 controlling for the effects of relational demography. Results showed that
 in teams with strong faultlines, consultants' performance decreased to a
 lesser extent in crisis years if the consultants shared a subgroup with
 their team leader. Thus, faultlines had different effects on team members
 from different subgroups.

Title: The Peripheral Halo Effect: Do Academic Spinoffs Influence Universities' Research Income?

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Extant literature has
 drawn attention to the ‘halo effect’ of the good reputation of a core
 organizational activity on the outcome of a peripheral activity. We
 contribute to the literature on organizational reputation by illustrating
 a halo effect in the opposite direction – from the periphery to the core.
 We show that developing a reputation for a peripheral activity (in our
 context, universities' social impact via spinoffs) may have positive
 spillovers for core organizational activities (in our context, university
 research), a phenomenon we term the ‘peripheral halo effect'. We also show
 that this effect is more prominent for high-status than for low-status
 organizations. Our research also contributes to the
 academic-entrepreneurship literature by revealing that spinoff portfolios
 can generate income for universities not only directly via equity
 positions but also indirectly via reputational benefits.

Title: Why and How Do Employees Break and Bend Confidential Information Protection Rules? 
Author-Name: David R. Hannah  
Author-Name: Kirsten Robertson  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Organizations cannot
 function effectively if their employees do not follow organizational rules
 and policies. In this paper, we explore why and how employees in two
 high-tech organizations often broke or bent rules designed to protect
 their employers' confidential information (CI). The CI protection rules
 sometimes imposed requirements that disrupted employees' work, forcing
 employees to choose between CI rule compliance and doing their work
 effectively and efficiently. Employees in these situations often broke the
 rules or bent them in ways that enabled employees to meet some of the
 rules' requirements, while also satisfying other expectations that they
 faced. We discuss implications of our findings for practice and for future
 organizational scholarship on rule following.

Title: Going Off Script: How Managers Make Sense of the Ending of Their Careers 
Author-Name: Heather C. Vough

Abstract:
  The extant retirement literature primarily focuses on factors that
 influence the decision to retire and the generic retirement
 decision-making process. While these approaches have extended our
 understanding of retirement decision-making, we propose a sensemaking
 perspective that orients our attention towards the subjective meanings
 people attach to the factors that trigger the retirement decision, rather
 than simply the factors themselves. Accordingly, we see the retirement
 decision-making process as bounded by situational constraints and rooted
 in identity work. Based on interviews with 48 retired Canadian executives
 and managers, we use thematic narrative analysis to identify six types of
 end-of-career narratives. Drawing on these narratives, we present a model
 of identity work that distinguishes between retirement decision-making
 factors that are perceived as identity opportunities and those that are
 perceived as identity threats. Our findings contribute to scholarly
 understanding of subjective meanings and identity considerations in the
 process of ending one's career.
