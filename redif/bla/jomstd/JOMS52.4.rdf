Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Imprinting theory
 suggests that founding conditions are ‘stamped’ on organizations, and
 these imprinted routines often resist change. In contrast, strategic
 choice theory suggests that the firm can overcome organizational inertia
 and deliberately choose its future. Both theories offer dramatically
 different explanations behind an organization's capacity for change. IPO
 firms provide a unique context for exploring how imprinting forces
 interact with strategic choice factors to address organizational capacity
 for change as a firm moves from private to public firm status. Juxtaposing
 imprinting and strategic choice perspectives, we employ fuzzy set analysis
 to examine the multi-level determinants of organizational capacity for
 change. Our cross-national data reveal three effective configurations of
 organizational capacity for change within IPOs, and two ineffective
 configurations. Our results suggest that the antecedents of organizational
 capacity for change in entrepreneurial threshold firms are non-linear,
 interdependent, and equifinal.

Title: A Socioemotional Wealth Approach to CEO Career Horizons in Family Firms 
Author-Name: Vanessa M. Strike

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper challenges
 the predominant view that as CEOs near retirement, they forgo risky
 long-term strategic choices and instead focus on decisions that enhance
 their own short-term self-interests. Drawing on the socioemotional wealth
 (SEW) literature, we argue that unlike near-retirement CEOs in widely held
 firms, near-retirement CEOs in family firms are more concerned about
 transgenerational control and the legacy that they pass on to future
 generations. We further contend that the priority of SEW dimensions can
 change within family firms depending on the CEO's time to retirement.
 Consequently, near-retirement CEOs in family firms differ from their
 counterparts in non-family firms in that they are willing to continue to
 engage in international acquisitions as they approach retirement, despite
 the potential short-term risks. We further hypothesize that this effect
 depends on whether the CEO is a family member, whether the CEO is
 succeeded by another family member, and whether the CEO is the founder. In
 analysing 3432 family and non-family firm-year observations from the S&P
 500 for the period between 1997 and 2009, we find support for our
 hypotheses. Subsequent analyses indicate that near retirement, family CEOs
 acquire larger and culturally closer targets than their non-family
 counterparts. Our paper confirms the need to more fully consider the
 characteristics of owners and managers in analyses of the CEO career
 horizon problem.

Title: CEOs' Leadership Styles and Managers' Innovative Behaviour: Investigation of Intervening Effects in an Entrepreneurial Context 
Author-Name: Jae Hyeung Kang

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We examine the
 relationships and intervening mechanisms between founding CEOs'
 transformational/transactional leadership and the innovative behaviour of
 managers. We develop and test our hypotheses on a sample of 39
 participating CEOs and 105 managers with the use of a multilevel
 structural equation model. The results show that both transformational and
 transactional leadership on the part of the CEO relate positively to
 managers' innovative behaviour. We also discover that firm's innovative
 climate mediates the relationship between transformational leadership and
 innovative behaviour. However, we fail to find the mediating effect of
 innovative climate between transactional leadership and innovative
 behaviour. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of how
 founding CEOs' different leadership styles affect employees' innovative
 behaviour in start-ups and to what extent the innovative climate
 influences the relationship.

Title: The Dark Side of Leadership: Towards a Mid-Range Theory of Hubris and Greed in Entrepreneurial Contexts 
Author-Name: Katalin Takacs Haynes

Author-Name: Joanna Tochman Campbell  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Much of the research
 on entrepreneurial behaviour and leadership has emphasized their
 importance and potentially valuable outcomes, along with the challenges
 involved in each. Although entrepreneurial activities are essential in all
 types of organizations, this research focuses on the potential dark side
 of strategic leaders. Specifically, we examine the potential for and the
 outcomes of the display of greed and hubris in different entrepreneurial
 contexts. We present a theoretical model of moderated mediation, focused
 on the effects of greedy and hubristic behaviour by entrepreneurial
 leaders on the firm's human and social capital, and consequently venture
 success. However, the negative relationship manifests differently in the
 presence of certain firm-level characteristics. We examine the
 implications of the dark side of entrepreneurial leadership and recommend
 several avenues for future research. In so doing, this work contributes to
 the development of a mid-range theory of the dark side of entrepreneurial
 leadership.

Title: Strategic Leadership and Leaders in Entrepreneurial Contexts: A Nexus for Innovation and Impact Missed? 
Author-Name: Zeki Simsek

Author-Name: Alejandro Escriba-Esteve  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Research at the nexus
 of strategic leadership and entrepreneurial contexts has been encouraging,
 but some of the more innovative and impactful questions remain
 underexplored. The purpose of the Special Issue was to provide a forum for
 works that build on the constraints, challenges, characteristics, and
 other salient elements of entrepreneurial settings to advance theory and
 testing on strategic leadership effects, as well as enrich our
 understanding of firm behaviour and outcomes in entrepreneurial contexts.
 We first provide an overview and background of the Special Issue. We then
 provide a summary of the process and outcomes, including a synopsis of the
 accepted manuscripts. The discussion finally traces the implications of
 the Special Issue for future research directions on strategic leadership
 and leaders in entrepreneurial contexts.
