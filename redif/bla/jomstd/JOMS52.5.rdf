Title: How Offshore Professionals' Job Dissatisfaction Can Promote Further Offshoring: Organizational Outcomes of Job Crafting 
Author-Name: Elisa Mattarelli  
Author-Name: Maria Rita Tagliaventi  
Abstract:
  This paper investigates the process that leads from job dissatisfaction
 to new business opportunities in organizations that offshore R&D
 activities to emerging countries. Specifically, we investigate a major
 source of job dissatisfaction for offshore professionals: the misalignment
 between the work that they perform and their professional identity. Our
 findings indicate that offshore professionals react against the perception
 of a threat to work-identity integrity through individual and collective
 job crafting. A significant outcome of job crafting is the introduction of
 new markets, industries, and services, which in turn may change a
 professional's job design. The perceptions of the compatibility of
 organizational identity with professional identity and with new idea
 recognition on the one hand, and of distant and local social support on
 the other, act as intervening conditions in the process. We discuss
 theoretical contributions to the evolution of offshoring, job crafting,
 and the interplay between organizational and professional identity,
 together with managerial implications.

Title: Discourse in a Material World 
Author-Name: Cynthia Hardy  
Author-Name: Robyn Thomas  
Abstract:
  We challenge recent assertions that discourse studies cannot de facto
 address materiality. We demonstrate how a Foucauldian theorization of
 discourse provides a way to analyse the co-constitutive nature of
 discursive and material processes, as well as explore the power relations
 implicated in these relationships. To illustrate our argument, we identify
 exemplary studies that have effectively combined a study of discourse and
 different aspects of materiality – bodies, objects, spaces, and practices.
 In doing so, we show how discourse scholars are able to study both
 materiality and power relations.

Title: Exploring Material-Discursive Practices 
Author-Name: Wanda J. Orlikowski  
Author-Name: Susan V. Scott  
Abstract:
  Our intent in this commentary is to support the turn to materiality in
 organizational research, and contribute to it by considering some
 differences in our approach from that proposed by Hardy and Thomas.
 Drawing on agential realism – which theorizes the entanglement of matter
 and meaning – we explore the relation between discourse and materiality in
 terms of the ideas of materialization and performativity as enacted in a
 study of hotel valuation in the hospitality industry. We offer our
 comments in the spirit of constructive engagement and hope that our
 discussion along with others in this Point-Counterpoint will generate
 further explorations.

Title: Unpacking the Dialectic: Alternative Views on the Discourse–Materiality Relationship 
Author-Name: Linda L. Putnam  
Abstract:
  This paper extends the issues raised in this forum by highlighting
 assumptions and characteristics of the discourse–materiality relationship
 that appears in five explanatory frameworks, including the Foucauldian
 approach and the materiality–performativity perspective presented in the
 previous two papers. It argues for preserving the dialectical relationship
 between the two by holding the tensions between them in continual
 interplay. Using a dialectic lens, it overviews how each of the frameworks
 treats the point of entry, nature of the relationship, and management of
 these tensions.

Title: A Temporal Approach to Retrenchment and Successful Turnaround in Declining Firms 
Author-Name: Chanchai Tangpong  
Author-Name: Michael Abebe  
Author-Name: Zonghui Li  
Abstract:
  This study extends current understanding of the retrenchment–turnaround
 relationship in declining firms by introducing a temporal approach and
 arguing that the effectiveness of retrenchment as a strategy is contingent
 on its adoption early in turnaround attempts. Drawing from the two-stage
 turnaround model and insights from the literature on downward spirals in
 organizations, we develop and test a theoretical model that explains how
 temporal considerations in retrenchment influence the likelihood of
 successful turnaround. Using a matched pair sample of 96 US firms, we find
 that declining firms that implement retrenchment actions early have a
 higher likelihood of successful turnaround. The findings also indicate
 that while two specific retrenchment actions, early divestments and early
 geographic market exits, significantly contribute to the likelihood of
 successful turnaround, early layoffs do not. Overall, the findings shed
 some light on the importance of timing strategic actions in organizational
 turnarounds. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

Title: Workplace Dignity: Communicating Inherent, Earned, and Remediated Dignity 
Author-Name: Kristen Lucas  
Abstract:
  Extant research on dignity at work has revealed conditions that
 contribute to indignity, employees’ responses to dignity threats, and ways
 in which employees’ inherent dignity is undermined. But while dignity –
 and specifically indignity – is theorized as a phenomenon subjectively
 experienced and judged by individuals, little research has privileged
 workers’ own perspectives. In this study, working adults reveal how they
 personally experience and understand meanings of dignity at work. I
 describe three core components of workplace dignity and the communicative
 exchanges through which dignity desires commonly are affirmed or denied:
 inherent dignity as recognized by respectful interaction, earned dignity
 as recognized by messages of competence and contribution, and remediated
 dignity as recognized by social interactions and organizational practices
 that conceal the instrumental and unequal nature of work. Based on
 theoretical insights drawn from examining the relationships between these
 components, I argue that workplace dignity is a phenomenon theoretically
 distinct from human dignity.
