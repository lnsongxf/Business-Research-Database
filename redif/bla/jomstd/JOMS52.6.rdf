Title: Effects of Industry- and Region-Specific Acquisition Experience on Value Creation in Cross-Border Acquisitions: The Moderating Role of Cultural Similarity 
Author-Name: Dynah A. Basuil  
Author-Name: Deepak K. Datta  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Based on a sample of
 222 cross-border acquisitions by US firms in the service sector, our study
 examines the effects of acquiring firms' prior cross-border acquisition
 experience in the same industry and geographic region as the acquired firm
 on shareholder value creation. Using the BHAR (buy-and-hold abnormal
 returns) methodology, we find that higher levels of industry-specific and
 region-specific acquisition experience translate into greater shareholder
 value creation for acquiring firms in subsequent acquisitions. In
 addition, our results indicate that the effects of industry-specific
 acquisition experience on acquisition performance are contingent on the
 level of cultural similarity between the acquiring and acquired firm
 countries, with the benefits of prior experience being greater in
 acquisitions undertaken in culturally similar countries. We also find that
 the moderating effects of cultural similarity on the relationship between
 industry-specific acquisition experience and value creation are contingent
 on the level of prior region-specific acquisition experience possessed by
 the acquiring firm.

Title: How Does Ambiguity Influence IPO Underpricing? The Role of the Signalling Environment 
Author-Name: Haemin Dennis Park  
Author-Name: Pankaj C. Patel  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>We explore the
 relationship between ambiguity, or low information clarity, in the IPO
 prospectus of newly public firms and their underpricing. Consistent with
 signalling theory, we find that IPO underpricing is low when the
 prospectus contains less ambiguous information that creates a more
 reliable signal conveying the quality of the IPO firm. However, the
 positive association between ambiguity and IPO underpricing is less
 pronounced when IPO firms display low strategic conformity with other
 firms in the industry, operate in industries with high valuation
 heterogeneity, or are medium-sized. Using a sample of 398 IPOs between
 1998 and 2007, our results support these predictions. This study shows the
 importance of the signalling environment influencing boundedly rational
 signal recipients interpreting ambiguous signals.

Title: Less is More, or Not? On the Interplay between Bundles of Slack Resources, Firm Performance and Firm Survival 
Author-Name: Ine Paeleman  
Author-Name: Tom Vanacker  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Although a
 significant body of research has investigated the independent effects of
 distinct types of slack resources, current theoretical and empirical work
 does not sufficiently clarify how bundles of slack resources affect firm
 outcomes. Drawing on the resource constraints literature and the slack
 literature, we investigate how distinct bundles of financial and human
 resource slack influence firm performance and survival. Using a sample of
 4715 European information and communication technology firms, we show that
 neither parallel resource abundance (having slack in financial and human
 resources) nor parallel resource constraints (lacking slack in financial
 and human resources) are optimal for firm performance and survival.
 However, firms with selective constraints that combine slack in financial
 resources with constraints in human resources exhibit superior performance
 without decreased survival prospects. Taken together, this study extends
 current research by providing a more nuanced view of the relationships
 between slack resources, firm performance, and firm survival.

Title: Reflexive Organizing for Knowledge Sharing: An Ethnomethodological Study of Service Technicians 
Author-Name: Yutaka Yamauchi  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This study examines
 how organizing is done reflexively through practice in the context of
 knowledge sharing. Organizing concerns reduction of equivocality and
 sensemaking so that actions can be interpreted and coordinated.
 Reflexivity refers to the fact that this organizing is done through talk,
 and that talk is an action that requires organizing. To examine how this
 reflexive organizing is accomplished, detailed analysis of video-recorded
 interactions among photocopier service technicians revealed various
 interactional methods to make actions of requesting and offering
 assistance understandable and relevant. To explain these methods,
 Goffman's concept of embedding is applied. By embedding other social
 situations in the current talk, one can project a certain sense of one's
 talk. This reflexive organizing clarifies that organizing is part of, not
 separate from, any practice and that knowledge sharing is accomplished not
 through a retrospective narrative but through reflexive construction of
 the situation in which talk is made possible.

Title: Feelings of Pride and Respect as Drivers of Ongoing Member Activity on Crowdsourcing Platforms 
Author-Name: Mark Boons  
Author-Name: Daan Stam  
Author-Name: Harry G. Barkema  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Crowdsourcing
 platforms are online organizations that organize work by sourcing tasks to
 their members. As participation on crowdsourcing platforms is completely
 voluntary, getting members to actively participate in tasks on an ongoing
 basis is essential for the survival of these online platforms. Why members
 would be active on an ongoing basis, however, is currently not well
 understood. To understand ongoing member activity on crowdsourcing
 platforms, we build on the group engagement model, which postulates that
 feelings of pride and respect influence engagement because they foster
 identification with the group. We argue that, although in general the
 nature of crowdsourcing platforms limits the effects of identification
 processes on member behaviour, feelings of pride and respect will still
 play central roles in such online organizations, because feelings of pride
 and respect can directly drive members’ cooperative behaviors towards the
 platform organization. Moreover, we posit that the way in which platform
 organizations communicate with their members affects these feelings of
 pride and respect. We test these ideas in a longitudinal, multisource
 field study and find that feelings of pride drive ongoing member activity
 on an online crowdsourcing platform directly and that platform management
 can increase members’ feelings of pride and respect by engaging in
 specific organizational communication practices.
