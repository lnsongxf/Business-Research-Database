Title: Responsible Accounting for Stakeholders 
Author-Name: Jeffrey S. Harrison  
Author-Name: Joyce van der Laan Smith  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Through a critique of
 existing financial theory underlying current accounting practices, and
 reapplication of this theory to a broad group of stakeholders, this paper
 lays a normative foundation for a revised perspective on the
 responsibility of the public accounting profession. Specifically, we argue
 that the profession should embrace the development of standards for
 reporting information important to a broader group of stakeholders than
 just investors and creditors. The FASB has recently moved in the opposite
 direction. Nonetheless, an institution around accounting for stakeholders
 continues to grow, backed by a groundswell of support from many sources.
 Based on institutional theory, we predict that this institution and the
 forces supporting it will cause changes in the public accounting
 profession, even if through coercion. We also provide examples of
 stakeholder accounting, building from the premise that a primary
 responsibility of accounting is to provide information to address the risk
 management needs of stakeholders.

Title: Accounting for Stakeholders and Making Accounting Useful 
Author-Name: Paul Andon  
Author-Name: Jane Baxter  
Author-Name: Wai Fong Chua  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>A belief in the
 importance of available and relevant information to managers and
 stakeholders has propelled significant accounting change, motivating the
 development of new forms of reporting argued to provide more useful
 accounting information. However, accounting is not inherently useful.
 Accounting information is a heterogeneous agglomeration that is made
 useful in practice. We overview research, illustrating the experimental,
 emotional, imaginative and complementation stratagems that practitioners
 adopt in making accounting information useful. This research shows that
 diverse stakeholder interests are mobilised in processes making accounting
 information useful. The ethical implications of accounting for
 stakeholders are then considered, particularly the problematic
 consequences of greater transparency. The critical possibilities of
 accounting for stakeholders are outlined next. We conclude by arguing that
 further research problematizing the usefulness of accounting information,
 including the networks of interests accomplishing this, is vital to
 advance debate on accounting for stakeholders.

Title: Who and What Really Counts? Stakeholder Prioritization and Accounting for Social Value 
Author-Name: Matthew Hall  
Author-Name: Yuval Millo  
Author-Name: Emily Barman  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Research in
 stakeholder management has theorized extensively the prioritization of
 stakeholders as a key dynamic of firms’ value creation, but has paid less
 attention to the organizational practices involved in the process of
 deciding ‘who and what really counts.’ We examine changes underpinning
 managers’ prioritization of stakeholders and focus on how managers’
 attention to salient stakeholders is represented and communicated in a
 firm's accounting and reporting system. We study the emergence and
 development of Social Return on Investment (SROI): an accounting
 methodology intended to permit managers both to incorporate stakeholders’
 voices and to communicate the social value created by the firm for those
 stakeholders. We find that the ability of SROI to account for specific
 stakeholders, thus categorizing them as salient for the firm, is shaped by
 managers’ epistemic beliefs and by the organization's material conditions.
 Our findings contribute to stakeholder theory by showing that the
 prioritization of stakeholders is not solely a managerial decision, but
 instead is dependent on the construction of an appropriate accounting and
 reporting system, as shaped by managers’ epistemic beliefs and by the
 organization's material conditions.

Title: Financializing Stakeholder Claims 
Author-Name: Andrew Crane  
Author-Name: Cameron Graham  
Author-Name: Darlene Himick  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>This paper examines
 the role of accounting in assigning financial values to stakeholder
 claims. Stakeholder theorists have called for metrics managers can use to
 coordinate stakeholder claims. We argue that accounting already serves as
 the dominant example of such a tool, and that its role in measuring and
 representing stakeholder claims, and how those representations are used by
 stakeholders and managers, is not well understood. We suggest that
 accounting financializes stakeholder claims along three
 inductively-developed dimensions, namely time, security, and priority. We
 analyse the case of pension accounting at General Electric to theorize
 concerning how these dimensions shape stakeholder claims and are used by
 stakeholders and managers to trade-off claims, demarcate claimants into
 groups, and reconstruct claims during negotiations.

Title: Stakeholder Inclusion and Accounting for Stakeholders 
Author-Name: Ronald K. Mitchell

Author-Name: R. Edward Freeman  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Stakeholder inclusion
 in organizational decision-making, and the resulting issue of value
 creation, is one of the thorny problems that stakeholder theory has sought
 to address. Yet progress has been slow, we suggest, because present
 accounting theory and practice does not address the decision-making needs
 of all stakeholders who are at risk due to the activities of
 organizations. In this paper we develop a transdisciplinary theory of
 value-creation stakeholder accounting (VCSA) based on stakeholder
 risk-sharing as a superior rationale for stakeholder inclusion. We
 introduce value-creation stakeholder partnerships (VCSPs) as a promising
 mechanism for the implementation of VCSA. VCSA is derived from a fusion of
 accounting, value-creation/entrepreneurship, and stakeholder theory, and
 the VCSP mechanism emerges from distinguishing proprietary-convention
 (partnership) from entity-convention (corporate) accounting. Using this
 framing we summarize and situate the articles in this Special Issue on
 Stakeholder Accounting.

Title: Dialogic Accountings for Stakeholders: On Opening Up and Closing Down Participatory Governance 
Author-Name: Judy Brown  
Author-Name: Jesse Dillard  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Interpretivist and
 critical accounting researchers have long challenged the shareholder focus
 of conventional accounting, calling for new approaches that promote
 accountability to stakeholders and participatory governance. One proposal
 is for dialogic accountings that take pluralism seriously and enable
 critical reflection on organizational practices from diverse
 socio-political perspectives. Dialogic accounting aims to counter narrow
 managerialist framings and address constituencies poorly served by
 traditional accounting. However, those favouring pluralist approaches face
 significant challenges in addressing entrenched ideologies and power
 relations. Rather than trying to address these challenges solely from
 within accounting, much can be learned from disciplinary fields that
 demonstrate sustained interest in pluralistic analysis and engagement.
 Here, we focus on the insights science and technology studies (STS)
 provides on opening up and closing down participatory governance,
 understanding knowledge-power dynamics and implications for stakeholder
 value creation.
