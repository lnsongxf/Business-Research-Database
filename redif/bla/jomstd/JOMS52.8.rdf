Title: Fluidity, Identity, and Organizationality: The Communicative Constitution of Anonymous 
Author-Name: Leonhard Dobusch  
Author-Name: Dennis Schoeneborn  
Abstract:
  This paper examines how fluid social collectives, where membership is
 latent, contested, or unclear, achieve ‘organizationality’, that is, how
 they achieve organizational identity and actorhood. Drawing on the
 “communicative constitution of organizations” perspective, we argue that
 the organizationality of a social collective is accomplished through
 ‘identity claims’ – i.e., speech acts that concern what the social
 collective is or does – and negotiations on whether or not these claims
 have been made on the collective's behalf. We empirically examine the case
 of the hacker collective Anonymous and analyse relevant identity claims to
 investigate two critical episodes in which the organizationality of
 Anonymous was contested. Our study contributes to organization studies by
 showing that fluid social collectives are able to temporarily reinstate
 organizational actorhood through the performance of carefully prepared and
 staged identity claims.

Title: Uncovering Micro-Practices and Pathways of Engagement That Scale Up Social-Driven Collaborations: A Practice View of Power 
Author-Name: Sonia Tello-Rozas

Abstract:
  This paper explores how large-scale social-driven collaborations might
 grow in scale and help promote political change. We present the results of
 a qualitative investigation of a complex platform where multiple and
 hybrid collaborations co-exist and where civil society plays a central
 role. Based on a longitudinal comparative case study, we draw a processual
 model describing micro-practices and pathways of engagement. We show that
 the emergence of these collaborations requires a new type of convener, one
 that is able to manage the interplay between the sharing/co-creation of
 abundant resources and the coordinated decentralization of informal
 authority. Our study extends existing debates on the role of resources and
 authority, showing the complementarity between possession and practice
 perspectives of power. Finally, we identified synergies between
 collaboration and social movement literatures, particularly showing that
 large-scale collaborations could be mobilized to refine social movement
 agendas and achieve more purposive collective action.

Title: What Factors Affect the Persistence of an Innovation Advantage? 
Author-Name: Tammy L. Madsen  
Author-Name: Michael J. Leiblein  
Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Factors that affect a
 firm's ability to achieve an advantage may differ from those that affect
 its ability to sustain that advantage. Moreover, if advantage is a
 relative concept then studies that relate resource stocks to ‘absolute’
 outcomes say little about how resources contribute to enduring differences
 among firms. We explore these issues in the global semiconductor industry
 by analyzing how a firm's resource stocks contribute to the persistence of
 an innovation advantage (a relative outcome). The findings demonstrate
 that a firm's own production experience and the experience held by its
 partners contribute to temporary innovation advantages. The results also
 show that a firm's own production experience yields a more durable
 innovation advantage as compared to the experience held by a firm's
 partners and that the experience held by a firm's partners provides a more
 enduring advantage than a firm's patent stock.

Title: Political Tie Heterogeneity and the Impact of Adverse Shocks on Firm Value

Abstract:
  type="main"> <title type="main">ABSTRACT</title> <p>Past research has
 recognized the contingent value of corporate political ties but largely
 neglects their heterogeneity. Drawing on the political embeddedness
 perspective and literature on emerging economy political institutions, we
 develop hypotheses regarding how political networks comprising managerial
 and government ownership ties may have different valuation effects in the
 face of adverse political shocks. Examining stock market responses to an
 unanticipated, high-profile political event in China, we find a negative
 valuation effect of managerial ties to municipal government, but an
 insignificant effect of government ownership ties. Further, companies
 combining managerial and ownership ties experienced less post-shock
 reduction in market value than those holding only managerial political
 ties. These findings shed light on the values of different configurations
 of corporate political ties and inform firms of potential ways to manage
 ubiquitous political hazards in emerging economies.
