Title: Biggart's Lament<note xml:id="joms12185-note-0001"> <p>I am inspired by Lockhart's Lament in which he decries the transformation of mathematics from a creative art to a skill that is formulaic and trivial. Thanks to Tom Beamish, Gina Dokko, Richard Williams and the JMS-Says editors for their comments on an earlier draft.</p></note>, or Getting Out of the Theory Cave<note xml:id="joms12185-note-0002"> <p>Plato has an allegory in which he has Socrates describe a cave in which prisoners are chained to a wall their entire lives. All that they can see are shadows made by a fire behind them and they debate endlessly the shadows’ meanings. The prisoners believe that the shadows are reality and even when given evidence of another reality they stay in the relative comfort of their small and known world.</p></note>
