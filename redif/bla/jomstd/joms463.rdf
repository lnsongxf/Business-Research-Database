Title: Demand- and Supply-Side Agglomerations: Distinguishing between Fundamentally Different Manifestations of Geographic Concentration 
Abstract:
 Agglomeration research investigates the benefits that firms receive from
 locating in close geographic proximity. Despite a substantial surge in
 interest in this topic over the past 20 years, a lack of distinction among
 unique manifestations of spatial concentrations of similar firms threatens
 continuing progress in this stream of research. We argue that
 agglomerations of related firms that draw benefits from the supply-related
 externalities of increased access to specialized labour, specialized
 inputs, and knowledge spillovers are fundamentally different from those
 that draw benefits from heightened demand realized through reduction in
 consumer search costs. Extending agglomeration theory, we explicate the
 differences between these distinct phenomena, discuss how the nature of
 key theoretical relationships varies across these agglomeration types, and
 demonstrate significant implications for research. We discuss how the
 differences affect a host of theoretical relationships and empirical
 research decisions. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Dynamic Capabilities, Government Policies, and Performance in Firms from Emerging Economies: Evidence from India and Pakistan 
Abstract:
 In this study we developed a model of the dynamic capability development
 mechanisms in Emerging Market manufacturing Firms (EMF). We identified
 three dynamic capability development mechanisms: organizational learning,
 reverse engineering, and manufacturing flexibility. We generated
 hypotheses based on this framework, linking these mechanisms with firm
 performance. We also modelled the roles played by managerial use of two
 types of government policies: input supporting policies and marketing
 supporting policies. We tested our hypotheses on a sample of Indian and
 Pakistani manufacturing firms. Results showed that organizational
 learning, reverse engineering and manufacturing flexibility had
 significant impacts on EMF performance. Additionally, organizational
 learning combined with input supporting government policies enhanced
 performance, and the combination of manufacturing flexibility and
 marketing supporting government policies had an insignificant influence on
 performance. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Governance, Negotiations, and Alliance Dynamics: Explaining the Evolution of Relational Practice 
Abstract:
 This paper explores relational practice in strategic alliances. Focusing
 on how governance mechanisms and negotiation strategies evolve and form
 patterns of interaction that are under influence of both recursive and
 adaptive forces, four modes of relational practice are discussed:
 recursively integrative, recursively distributive, adaptive toward
 integrative, and adaptive toward distributive. Three longitudinal cases
 are examined. I find that different contractual conditions enable (or
 restrain) interaction patterns. Negotiation behaviour, in turn, affects
 future contractual conditions and their combination and recombination form
 the evolution of relational practice. As relationships progress, initial
 governance mechanisms are complemented and negotiation behaviours change.
 I explain how perceptions of both process and relational outcomes
 influence relational practice. In addition, I explicate why relational
 practices have both recursive and adaptive characteristics, and identify
 conditions that cause relational practices to move towards more
 integrative or distributive modes. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: The Performance Effects of Business Groups in Russia 
Abstract:
 This study analyses the impact of business group affiliation on firm
 performance during a time when business groups are newly formed, when the
 economic and institutional environment is changing, and when group
 survival is uncertain. Based primarily on a transaction cost approach, we
 develop two hypotheses, concerning profitability and risk sharing
 (redistribution) respectively. The positive profitability hypothesis
 proposes that company affiliation with a business group directly and
 positively affects the profitability of each affiliate. A positive direct
 effect emerges when each affiliate benefits from access to group
 resources. The redistribution hypothesis considers the simultaneous
 possibility that inter-affiliate transfers of resources through internal
 markets are designed to redistribute profits among group members. We argue
 that variance-reducing redistribution from strong to weak group members is
 linked to group survival in times of institutional change. Our empirical
 approach focuses on testing these two linked hypotheses (and their
 alternatives) using a relatively large, contemporary and time varying
 database of Russian firms. We also develop a framework that distinguishes
 among the four possible empirical outcomes associated with the hypotheses.
 Our results provide unambiguous support for the case where the impact of
 group membership on profitability is positive and redistribution is
 variance-reducing. We term this outcome Business Group Robustness, and
 contrast it with other possible empirical outcomes. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: An Opportunity for Me? The Role of Resources in Opportunity Evaluation Decisions 
Abstract:
 We apply the prescriptions of the resource-based perspective to develop a
 model of entrepreneurial opportunity evaluation. We propose that
 opportunity evaluation decision policies are constructed as
 future-oriented, cognitive representations of 'what will be', assuming one
 were to exploit the opportunity under evaluation. These cognitive
 representations incorporate both (1) an evaluation of the existing
 resource endowments (already under the control of the venture), which may
 be employed to exploit the opportunity under evaluation, and at the same
 time (2) an assessment of the future, wealth generating resources that
 must be marshalled (and "subsequently" under the control of the venture)
 in order to exploit the opportunity under evaluation. We empirically test
 this model using conjoint analysis and hierarchical linear modelling
 techniques to decompose more than 2300 opportunity evaluation decisions
 nested in a sample of 73 entrepreneurs. Our findings suggest that
 entrepreneurs are attracted to opportunities that are complementary to
 their existing knowledge resources; however, we also identify a set of
 opportunity-specific and firm-specific conditions that encourage
 entrepreneurs to pursue the acquisition and control of resources that are
 inconsistent with the existing, knowledge-based resources of the venture.
 We identify these conditions and discuss implications for theory,
 practice, and future research. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: The Application of External Knowledge: Organizational Conditions for Exploration and Exploitation 
Abstract:
 A firm's ability to acquire and exploit external knowledge is often
 critical to achieving and sustaining a competitive advantage. In this
 study, we adopt a multi-dimensional view of absorptive capacity and focus
 specifically on the application of external knowledge that has been
 obtained via university-firm collaborations. We examine various
 organizational conditions that we propose influence a firm's ability to
 apply external knowledge for explorative and exploitative innovations. We
 collected data by a survey of firms in industries that frequently work
 with university research centres (URCs) and from publicly available
 sources. Results show that predictors of exploration and exploitation of
 the application of external knowledge differ. Surprisingly, technological
 relatedness, a common measure of absorptive capacity, is negatively
 associated with the application of external knowledge to explorative
 innovations, indicating that knowledge from more distant sources is
 applied more to exploration. Results also indicate that the effects of two
 external learning capabilities (prior experience with URCs and
 technological capability) on knowledge application are moderated in such a
 way by the tacitness of the knowledge transferred that experience is a
 stronger predictor when the knowledge is more explicit and technological
 capability is a stronger predictor when the knowledge is more tacit. We
 discuss the implications of these findings for research on the application
 of external knowledge. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Why the Rigour-Relevance Gap in Management Research Is Unbridgeable 
Abstract:
 In this paper we discuss, on the basis of system theory, the
 rigour-relevance gap in management research and the proposal to overcome
 it. From a system theory perspective, social systems are self-referential
 or autopoietic, which means that communication elements of one system,
 such as science, cannot be authentically integrated into communication of
 other systems, such as the system of a business organization. Social
 systems can only irritate - provoke - each other, i.e. alter conditions in
 such a way that other systems are forced to respond. Because of the
 differences between management science and practice it is impossible to
 assess relevance of research output within the system of science. On the
 basis of our analysis we show that neither action research nor Mode 2
 research nor recent approaches to collaborative research can succeed in
 producing research that is rigorous as well as relevant. Researchers and
 practitioners cannot collaboratively produce research, they can only
 irritate each other. However, sometimes irritations or provocations turn
 out inspiring. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Bridging the Rigour-Relevance Gap in Management Research: It's Already Happening! 
Abstract:
 Kieser and Leiner (2009) maintain that the rigour-relevance gap in
 management research is fundamentally unbridgeable because researchers and
 the researched inhabit separate social systems. They argue that it is
 impossible to assess the relevance of research outputs within the system
 of science and that neither action research nor related approaches to
 collaborative research can succeed in producing research that is rigorous
 as well as relevant. In reply, we show how their analysis is inconsistent
 with available evidence. Drawing on a diversity of management research
 domains, we provide counter-illustrations of work where researchers, in a
 number of cases in collaboration with practitioners, have generated
 knowledge that is both socially useful and academically rigorous. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Management Research and the New Logics of Discovery and Engagement 
Abstract:
 This paper develops an argument that leads to a vision of management
 research as a form of design science. Such an approach to research
 requires an inversion of the relationship between rigour and relevance.
 Giving primacy to the pursuit of rigour, as tends to be the current norm,
 de-emphasizes the importance of relevance and leads to research that
 interests very few beyond the community of management scholars. We argue
 that we should re-imagine relevance as a necessary condition for rigour
 and that this will lead to new forms of engagement with theory and
 practice that have the potential to create a new science of management. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.
