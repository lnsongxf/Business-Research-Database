Title: Combinative Effects of Innovation Types and Organizational Performance: A Longitudinal Study of Service Organizations 
Abstract:
 Innovation research suggests that innovation types have different
 attributes, determinants, and effects. This study focuses on consequences
 of adoption of three types of innovation (service, technological process,
 and administrative process) in service organizations. Its main thesis is
 that the impact of innovation on organizational performance depends on
 compositions of innovation types over time. We examine this proposition by
 analysing innovative activity in a panel of 428 public service
 organizations in the UK over four years. Our findings suggest that focus
 on adopting a specific type of innovation every year is detrimental,
 consistency in adopting the same composition of innovation types over the
 years has no effect, and divergence from the industry norm in adopting
 innovation types could possibly be beneficial to organizational
 performance. We discuss the implications of these findings for theory and
 research on innovation types. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Corporate Board Attributes, Team Effectiveness and Financial Performance 
Abstract:
 Researchers have recently begun to integrate the literatures on corporate
 boards and team effectiveness in an effort to better understand how boards
 function and impact company performance. This study identifies five
 attributes of high-performing teams - knowledge, information, power,
 incentives and opportunity/time - and argues that these attributes will
 promote board effectiveness, which in turn influence corporate financial
 performance. These relationships are investigated using combined survey
 and archival sources of data for 210 "Fortune 1000" companies. Findings
 indicate that most team effectiveness attributes are associated with
 higher levels of board effectiveness as rated by the board directors, and
 that board effectiveness is significantly related to corporate financial
 performance. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Does Reputation Contribute to Reducing Organizational Errors? A Learning Approach 
Abstract:
 In this study I examine the effect of a firm's reputation for product
 quality on its effort in learning to reduce its product defect rate.
 Theoretical ideas on the motivation of learning associated with social
 aspiration levels and the self-serving bias combined with social
 categorization suggest that poor quality reputation firms are more likely
 than their counterparts with a good reputation to attend to potential
 product defects and consequently reduce their defect rate. However, a
 stream of research on the motivation of learning stemming from historical
 aspiration levels and slack search leads to a different argument: a
 reputation for good quality is more likely to provide firms with a
 motivation to avoid product defects. I build upon these two competing
 arguments and hypothesize that stronger motives for learning exist in
 situations where firms have either a weak or strong reputation for product
 quality. My study of product recalls in the US automotive industry
 highlights an inverted U-shaped relationship, indicating the liability of
 an intermediate reputation in reducing product defects. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Supply-Side Innovation and Technology Commercialization 
Abstract:
 The majority of research and practice tends to conceptualize innovation as
 a vertically coupled, intra-organizational process. We expand this
 perspective by conceptualizing innovation as a vertically decoupled,
 inter-organizational process and by studying the role of research
 universities as suppliers of discoveries to this "market for innovation".
 We combined logic from agency and real options theories to explain why the
 outcomes of technology commercialization are a function of licensing
 strategies, the autonomy of technology licensing offices (TLOs), and the
 incentives bestowed on scientists, research departments, and TLO officers.
 We rely on data from licensing surveys, interviews with 128 TLO directors,
 and - for convergent validity - from web-based searches of the TLOs of
 American universities and the US Patent and Trademark Office. Results
 suggest that commercialization outcomes (in this case, revenue and
 start-up creation) are enhanced when TLOs employ diverse licensing
 strategies, TLOs enjoy greater autonomy, universities share revenues with
 scientists' departments, and universities compensate TLOs officers well.
 Results also show that late entrants - typically underperforming
 universities - inflate royalty shares to scientists as a means to rectify
 their commercialization record. We conclude with a discussion of this
 study's contribution to the literature on innovation and technology
 commercialization. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.
