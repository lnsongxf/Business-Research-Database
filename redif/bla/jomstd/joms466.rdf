Title: Negative Emotional Reactions to Project Failure and the Self-Compassion to Learn from the Experience 
Abstract:
 Project failure is likely to generate a negative emotional response for
 those involved in the project. But do all people feel the same way? And
 are some better able to regulate their emotions to learn from the failure
 experience? In this paper we develop an emotion framework of project
 failure that relies on self-determination to explain variance in the
 intensity of the negative emotions triggered by project failure and
 self-compassion to explain variance in learning from project failure. We
 discuss the implications of our model for research on entrepreneurial and
 innovative organizations, employees' psychological ownership, and personal
 engagement at work. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Cognitive Dynamics of Capability Development Paths 
Abstract:
 Recent research on capability dynamics has increasingly turned its
 attention to the cognitive microfoundations of capability development. On
 the basis of a longitudinal case study of the evolution of three network
 security software firms, we find that the effects of managerial cognition
 can be detected at three distinct levels of capability development. At the
 level of operational capabilities, instrumental cognition affects the way
 in which capabilities are developed. At the level of a firm's capability
 portfolio, shifts in management's attention regarding capability
 development cause different evolutionary paths to emerge. Finally, at the
 extended enterprise level, managerial foresight influences the way in
 which a firm's capability constellation morphs over time. Our findings
 provide novel empirical evidence and contribute to an improved
 understanding of the role of managerial cognition in capability
 development. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Heterogeneity in Professional Service Firms 
Abstract:
 Research on professional service firms emphasizes similarities in their
 organization and management and distinctiveness from other types of
 organization. In this paper we take a different tack and focus on the
 differences between professional service firms, that is, on heterogeneity
 across different professional sectors. We argue that differences between
 professions on a number of dimensions affect the nature of professionals'
 work and, in turn, the organization and management of firms across
 different professional sectors. Drawing on the sociology of professions
 literature we focus on three key dimensions of knowledge, jurisdictional
 control and client relationships to compare legal, auditing and
 engineering consulting firms. We consider how differences in these
 dimensions across the three professional services sectors impact upon the
 way firms are organized. We offer a number of propositions explicating how
 differences in the nature of knowledge, jurisdictional control and client
 relationships have implications for organizational form, team-working and
 pricing systems. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Learning and Innovation in International Strategic Alliances: An Empirical Test of the Role of Trust and Tacitness 
Abstract:
 Drawing on knowledge-based, organizational learning, and social capital
 perspectives, we propose and test an integrated framework in which
 knowledge tacitness and trust act as mediating mechanisms in the
 relationship between partner characteristics and alliance outcomes. We
 distinguish between learning and innovation outcomes and suggest that
 while innovation may result from alliance learning, it can also be created
 by combining separate knowledge bases "without" learning from each other.
 We contend that tacitness and trust play differing roles in the pursuit of
 learning and innovation and test this proposition on a sample of 120
 international strategic alliances. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Do Birds of a Feather Flock Higher? The Effects of Partner Similarity on Innovation in Strategic Alliances in Knowledge-Intensive Industries 
Abstract:
 In spite of the consensus on the benefits of strategic alliances for
 learning and innovation, our understanding of the effects of partner
 similarity remains conflicted. This paper develops an integrative
 theoretical framework in which we propose that similar partners in a focal
 firm's alliance portfolio contribute to the firm's innovation up to a
 threshold, beyond which additional similar partners can lead to a decrease
 in innovation because of the trade-offs embedded in collaboration between
 similar partners. In this integrative framework, we also draw on
 organizational ecology and institutional perspectives to propose that the
 effect of partner similarity on innovation is positively moderated by
 organizational aging and the industry norm of collaboration at the firm's
 founding. Results from an analysis of 176 biotechnology firms between 1988
 and 1999 support our arguments. This study contributes to research on
 strategic alliance and innovation by considering both the benefits and
 costs of partner similarity in the context of alliance portfolios and by
 exploring the multilevel contingencies for the effects of partner
 similarity. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Do Firms Learn from Alliance Terminations? An Empirical Examination 
Abstract:
 In this paper, drawing from the learning from failure perspective, we
 argue that firms that have experienced prior terminations are less likely
 to have their future alliance terminated. Our key argument is that prior
 terminations will enable firms to design better alliances and adopt more
 appropriate alliance management strategies to avoid future terminations.
 We also suggest a more nuanced view of learning by hypothesizing that
 termination experience will mediate the relationship between alliance
 formation experience and likelihood of termination. We used the
 case-control methodology to select a sample of 198 alliances (consisting
 of 99 terminations and an equal number of surviving alliances) from the
 global biotechnology industry, and deployed logistic regression analysis
 to test the hypotheses in a multivariate setting. Our analysis strongly
 supports both hypotheses. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Maximizing the Impact of Organization Science: Theory-Building at the Intersection of Disciplines and/or Fields 
Abstract:
 The intersection of academic disciplines and fields provides an important
 forum for creative theory building. In this article, we identify three
 modes of theory building at the intersection and highlight their strengths
 and weaknesses. We position these three modes relative to one another
 using the 'impact wheel', which visually describes their influence on five
 domains: theory, field, discipline, researchers, and external
 stakeholders. Though impact on these domains varies across the three
 modes, maximum impact is created when theory building at the intersection
 uncovers new phenomena that revise the boundaries of existing disciplines
 and fields while giving birth to new ones. Such theorizing is infrequent
 and demands particular skills on the part of researchers to help
 organization science to realize more of its potential. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Theory Building at the Intersection: Recipe for Impact or Road to Nowhere? 
Abstract:
 Zahra and Newey (2009) argue for the importance of creative theory
 building in management research and suggest that this is best to be done
 via interdisciplinary research. We argue that the more management research
 goes down the road of pursuing interdisciplinary research for generating
 novel theories, the more likely it will compromise another worthwhile
 goal, which is to establish the discipline of management as a legitimate
 academic discipline that is distinguishable from other academic
 disciplines in its subject matter and its theoretical and methodological
 approach. We also argue against the implicit premise that the focus of
 management discipline should be on developing new theories. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.
