Title: Institutional Reforms and Investor Reactions to CSR Announcements: Evidence from an Emerging Economy 
Abstract:
 This study contributes to the limited established empirical research on
 the impact and relevance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the
 capital markets of emerging economies. We conducted an event study to
 demonstrate how the timing of CSR announcements by firms that have aligned
 their strategies to newly instituted social regulations in South Africa
 influenced stock prices. Using a unique dataset of publicly listed South
 African enterprises that undertook CSR initiatives during the ten year
 period from 1996 to 2005, we found that investor reactions to CSR
 announcements concluded during the late phase of institutional reforms are
 viewed positively by investors. Furthermore, CSR announcements of
 substantive monetary value result in significantly higher shareholder
 returns. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Stimulating Strategically Aligned Behaviour Among Employees 
Abstract:
 Strategically aligned behaviour (SAB), i.e. employee action that is
 consistent with the company's strategy, is of vital importance to
 companies. This study provides insights into the way managers could
 promote such behaviour among employees (who can be managers as well) by
 stimulating employee motivation, by informing employees, and by
 stimulating the development of their capabilities. The results of surveys
 conducted in three organizations suggest that, first, perceived efforts by
 management aimed at motivating and informing employees (both managers and
 non-managers), and at developing their capabilities, each are related to
 SAB. Second, among the perceived efforts to stimulate motivation among
 employees, providing a rationale for the strategy and an open
 communication climate have a stronger relationship with SAB than
 participation in decision making and supportiveness. Third, the
 perceptions of the different types of managerial effort are related to
 each other. For this reason, the efforts have direct as well as indirect
 relationships to SAB. Fourth, each of the perceived efforts seems to be
 complementary to the others, in the sense that the relationship of one
 type of effort to SAB is stronger when other types of effort are perceived
 to be higher. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: The Impact of Institutional and Human Resource Distance on International Entry Strategies 
Abstract:
 'Distance' between organizational contexts has been a prime concern of
 scholarly research into international business strategies. We extend this
 research by exploring the complementary roles of institutional and human
 resource distances on foreign investors' entry strategies. Combining
 institutional and resource-based theories suggests that: (1) human
 resource differences complement institutional differences; (2) the effects
 of some aspects of distance are curvilinear; and (3) the impact of
 distance differs between first and subsequent entries. We find empirical
 support for these arguments on a unique dataset of foreign direct
 investment in six emerging economies that incorporates multiple host as
 well as multiple home countries. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Relationship Investment and Channel Performance: An Analysis of Mediating Forces 
Abstract:
 This study explores how relationship-specific investment (RSI) enhances
 interfirm cooperation in buyer-supplier partnerships in an emerging
 market. Building upon the logic of economic sociology, we argue that the
 contribution of RSI to the success in buyer-supplier partnerships will be
 mediated by reduced opportunism and reduced conflict and by heightened
 commitment and knowledge sharing. Our survey of 216 paired distributors
 (buyers) and manufacturers (suppliers) in China generally supports this
 argument, leading to a conclusion that RSI is not a direct performance
 propeller but an important builder of relational infrastructure in which
 mid-range processes are nourished. Theoretical implications in strategic
 management and supply chain management research are highlighted. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Professional Competence as Ways of Being: An Existential Ontological Perspective 
Abstract:
 Current theories propose that professional competence is primarily
 constituted by scientific and tacit knowledge, knowing-in-action,
 understanding of work or practice. While providing valuable insights we
 contend that they present a fragmented understanding of professional
 competence. In particular, they do not adequately explain how central
 aspects of practice such as knowledge and understanding are integrated
 into a specific professional competence in work performance. An
 existential ontological perspective is proposed as offering a more
 comprehensive and integrative analysis of professional competence. It is
 explored through an empirical study of corporate lawyers and the findings
 suggest that professional competence should be understood as ways of
 being. The results show that different ways of practising corporate law
 distinguish and integrate a specific understanding of work, a particular
 self-understanding, other people, and tools into distinct forms of
 competence in corporate law. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Regulatory Uncertainty: A Reason to Postpone Investments? Not Necessarily 
Abstract:
 There is a polarity in the literature as to whether companies do or do not
 postpone investment decisions in the light of regulatory uncertainty. In
 the case of flexible regulation characterized by a high degree and
 discontinuous resolution of uncertainty, we show that companies do not
 necessarily postpone investment decisions. We trace this observation back
 to three motivations: securing competitive resources, leveraging
 complementary resources, and alleviating institutional pressure. We
 connect these motivations to fundamental principles of the resource-based
 view and institutional theory and further show the existence of a regime
 where institutionally motivated and resource-based actions are not
 necessarily decoupled. We base our research on a case study covering 80
 per cent of the German power generation industry which faces regulatory
 uncertainty from the European CO<sub>2</sub> Emission Trading Scheme. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.
