Title: Collective Dynamics of Citizenship Behaviour: What Group Characteristics Promote Group-Level Helping? 
Abstract:
 A basic tenet of research on organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) is
 that OCB aggregated across individuals improves organizational
 performance. Departing from the typical focus on individual-level OCB, the
 construct of group-level OCB (GOCB) recently emerged as a critical group
 function that affects various group effectiveness measures. Despite the
 clear link between GOCB and team performance, the existing literature
 provides a limited understanding with regard to the antecedents of GOCB,
 mostly focusing on leadership variables. Establishing helping behaviour (a
 core dimension of OCB) as a collective construct, this study substantially
 expands the antecedents of group-level helping, and empirically tests
 their effects using three different operationalizations of group-level
 helping. The results, based on a sample of 96 work units, show that
 membership diversity in gender and education decreased group-level
 helping, whereas diversity in tenure increased it. Group-level helping was
 also positively related to leadership characteristics (supportive unit
 manager, transformational top management) and perceived competence of unit
 members. In addition, the analysis further indicated that perceived
 competence is a positive predictor of group-level helping only when the
 unit members also believe that others are trustworthy in terms of
 integrity and benevolent motivation. From a methodological standpoint, the
 study provides important insights by comparing different ways of
 operationalizing collective constructs. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: The Impact of Horizontal Mergers on Rivals: Gains to Being Left Outside a Merger 
Abstract:
 It is commonly perceived that firms do not want to be outsiders to a
 merger between competitor firms. We instead argue that it is beneficial to
 be a non-merging rival firm to a large horizontal merger. Using a sample
 of mergers with expert identification of relevant rivals and the
 event-study methodology, we find rivals generally experience positive
 abnormal returns at the merger announcement date. We also find that the
 stock reaction of rivals to merger events is not sensitive to merger
 waves; hence, 'future acquisition probability' does not drive the positive
 abnormal returns of rivals. Further, we find the positive (or
 non-negative) abnormal returns of rivals to be robust when considering
 heterogeneity in merger and rival characteristics. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: The Practice and Process of Delivering Integration through Strategic Planning 
Abstract:
 This paper explains how strategic planning is able to deliver strategic
 integration within organizations. While communication and participation
 within planning processes are perceived to have an integrative effect, we
 argue that these effects are unlikely to arise simply from bringing people
 together. Rather, we suggest that, given the varying interests of actors
 in different business units, integration will only arise from active
 negotiations and compromises between these actors. The paper is based upon
 a case of strategic planning in a multinational that was attempting to
 develop greater strategic integration across Europe. Drawing upon an
 activity theory framework, we examine how a common strategy emerges over
 time through modifications to the planning process and to different
 actors' roles within it. The findings are used to develop a process model
 that shows how different business unit characteristics of planning
 experience and relative power shape different experiences of communication
 and participation activities and different processes for achieving
 integration. The paper concludes with a discussion of how this process
 model contributes to the literature on strategic planning, political
 processes of strategy-making, and strategy-as-practice. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: A Capability-Based Framework for Open Innovation: Complementing Absorptive Capacity 
Abstract:
 We merge research into knowledge management, absorptive capacity, and
 dynamic capabilities to arrive at an integrative perspective, which
 considers knowledge exploration, retention, and exploitation inside and
 outside a firm's boundaries. By complementing the concept of absorptive
 capacity, we advance towards a capability-based framework for open
 innovation processes. We identify the following six 'knowledge capacities'
 as a firm's critical capabilities of managing internal and external
 knowledge in open innovation processes: inventive, absorptive,
 transformative, connective, innovative, and desorptive capacity.
 'Knowledge management capacity' is a dynamic capability, which
 reconfigures and realigns the knowledge capacities. It refers to a firm's
 ability to successfully manage its knowledge base over time. The concept
 may be regarded as a framework for open innovation, as a complement to
 absorptive capacity, and as a move towards understanding dynamic
 capabilities for managing knowledge. On this basis, it contributes to
 explaining interfirm heterogeneity in knowledge and alliance strategies,
 organizational boundaries, and innovation performance. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Decision Comprehensiveness and Corporate Entrepreneurship: The Moderating Role of Managerial Uncertainty Preferences and Environmental Dynamism 
Abstract:
 Although comprehensiveness is considered among the most salient and
 enduring strategic decision-making characteristics in organizations, its
 influence on firm behaviour has remained elusive. As a first step, our
 study builds and tests a model that specifies the influence of
 comprehensiveness on the firm's pursuit of corporate entrepreneurship. Our
 core argument is that while comprehensiveness helps decision-makers gain
 the knowledge needed to escape the ignorance and overcome doubt associated
 with this pursuit, this beneficial influence is conditional upon
 managerial uncertainty preferences, together with the level of dynamism in
 the external environment. Findings from a large sample study of CEOs from
 349 SMEs provide general support for this argument and associated
 hypotheses. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: What is Reflection-In-Action? A Phenomenological Account 
Abstract:
 Building on the work of Donald Schön and phenomenological treatments of
 practice, we propose a phenomenological theory of reflection-in-action
 that develops this concept further, thereby transcending a number of
 limitations we find in his theorizing. Our theory includes: an
 appreciation for the evaluative dimensions built into competent practice
 that encourage, if not require, reflecting; a further theorizing of the
 character of surprise; and a fuller delineation of the character of
 improvisation in relation to practice and its surprises. We begin with a
 phenomenological account of cognition in relation to work, especially in
 its form of professional practice. We reframe Schön's arguments in
 phenomenological, especially Heideggerian, terms and take account of
 relatively recent theorizing about knowledge-based work, illustrating
 these discussions with a vignette drawn from field research in the world
 of practice. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these
 arguments for practitioners as well as for further theorizing. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.
