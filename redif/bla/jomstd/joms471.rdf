Title: Multinational Firm Knowledge, Use of Expatriates, and Foreign Subsidiary Performance 
Abstract:
 The impact of knowledge transfer on foreign subsidiary performance has
 been a major focus of research on knowledge management in multinational
 enterprises (MNEs). By integrating the knowledge-based view and the
 expatriation literature, this study examines the relationship between a
 multinational firm's knowledge (i.e. marketing and technological
 knowledge), its use of expatriates, and the performance of its foreign
 subsidiaries. We conceptualize that expatriates play a contingent role in
 facilitating the transfer and redeployment of a parent firm's knowledge to
 its subsidiary, depending on the location specificity of the
 organizational knowledge being transferred and the time of transfer. Our
 analysis of 1660 foreign subsidiaries of Japanese firms over a 15-year
 period indicates that the number of expatriates relative to the total
 number of subsidiary employees (1) strengthened the effect of a parent
 firm's technological knowledge (with low location specificity) on
 subsidiary performance in the short term, but (2) weakened the impact of
 the parent firm's marketing knowledge (with high location specificity) on
 subsidiary performance in the long term. We also found that the
 expatriates' influence on knowledge transfer eventually disappeared. The
 implications for knowledge transfer research and the expatriate management
 literature are discussed. Copyright (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Extrinsic and Intrinsic Drivers of Corporate Social Performance: Evidence from Foreign and Domestic Firms in Mexico 
Abstract:
 The literature on corporate social performance (CSP) is largely split
 between approaches that consider CSP to be extrinsically driven and those
 that consider it to be intrinsically driven. While the management
 literature has paid attention to drivers of both types, the relationship
 between the two remains largely unstudied, particularly in the
 international setting. Meanwhile, the international business (IB)
 literature has addressed the international dimension of CSP more directly,
 but focuses largely on extrinsic pressures. Our paper links the management
 and IB literatures by addressing intrinsic drivers (management commitment
 to ethics) in conjunction with extrinsic (trade-related) drivers for both
 foreign- and domestically-owned firms in a single-market setting. Using
 survey data from 121 auto parts suppliers in Mexico, we find that
 management commitment to ethics is a dominant driver of CSP among both
 foreign and domestic firms. More importantly, management commitment to
 ethics interacts positively with trade-related pressures in raising CSP
 levels. Copyright (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Florence Nightingale Endures: Legitimizing a New Professional Role Identity 
Abstract:
 We examined the discursive processes through which a new professional role
 identity for registered nurses was legitimized by analysing introductory
 textbooks over time. We theorize five ways of rhetorically legitimizing a
 new professional role identity: naturalizing the past, normalizing new
 meanings, altering identity referents, connecting with the institutional
 environment, and referencing authority. In contrast to previous research
 focused on legitimizing new practices, we contribute to the institutional
 literature by showing that legitimizing a professional role identity
 requires the incremental development of new arguments where the past is
 not delegitimized. Our findings also indicate that instead of a
 progression from moral and pragmatic legitimacy to cognitive legitimacy,
 legitimizing a new role identity may focus only on moral legitimacy.
 Finally, our study highlights the importance of interactions between the
 professional task environment and the wider institutional environment as
 part of the process of legitimizing a professional role identity. Copyright (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: What Wall Street Wants - Exploring the Role of Security Analysts in the Evolution and Spread of Management Concepts 
Abstract:
 This paper discusses the role of security analysts in the dissemination of
 popular management concepts, drawing on neo-institutional and management
 fashion theory. Focusing on the core competence concept, we investigate
 whether security analysts swing with the popularity of a management
 concept or serve as a corrective that secures the rationality of
 managerial actions. Through our analysis, which uses data for US-based
 firms spanning the period 1990-2002, we show that during the 1990s
 analysts systematically overvalued the future earnings of refocusing firms
 that incorporated principles derived from the core competence concept.
 Moreover, we present evidence that their valuations were positively
 influenced by the popularity of the core competence discourse and
 exhibited a systematic bias. Our results suggest a more nuanced
 understanding of the dynamics underlying the popularization processes of
 management concepts. In addition to the classical bandwagon-effects
 discussed in neo-institutional theory, we argue that the mediating role of
 security analysts and their impact on stock-market prices promote the
 diffusion of new management concepts. Copyright (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Keeping the Wheels Turning: The Dynamics of Managing Networks of Practice 
Abstract:
 Intra-organizational networks of practice (NOPs) confront managers with a
 dilemma: they must manage NOPs to reap benefits from integrating
 geographically dispersed knowledge, but the inherently emergent nature of
 NOPs implies that management control may frustrate practice-related
 knowledge to be shared. Based on a case study of 22 NOPs in a
 geographically dispersed development organization ('TDO'), we develop a
 model that disentangles the dynamics underlying this dilemma, helping to
 better understand it. Specifically, four dynamic relationships are
 interrelated and involve four kinds of embeddedness (organizational, in
 practice, relational, and structural) that relate dynamically to knowledge
 sharing in NOPs. Interventions in both the "content" shared in the network
 and the "connections" among network members can influence each of these
 relations. This study contributes to theoretical and practical
 understanding of how to manage NOPs without killing them. Copyright (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Outside Directors on Korean Boards: Governance and Institutions 
Abstract:
 Drawing on institutional theory, this study examines the factors that
 pressured Korean firms to appoint outside directors to their boards. While
 this practice could be considered to be a management innovation in Korea,
 in the Anglo-American corporate governance system it has long been used as
 one of several mechanisms to mitigate agency costs between management and
 shareholders. As such, this response by Korean firms, following the
 1997-98 currency crisis in Asia, could be seen as an example of corporate
 governance convergence on the Anglo-American model, where higher levels of
 outside director representation on the board are the norm. We examine the
 antecedents of having a higher proportion of outside directors on Korean
 boards. Our findings indicate that larger firms that are under stricter
 control by the government have higher representation of outside directors
 on the board. We also find a positive and significant relationship between
 the proportion of outside directors and business group affiliation, poor
 prior firm performance, higher levels of debt and foreign ownership. Copyright (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Firm Experience and Market Entry by Venture Capital Firms (1962-2004) 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we examine a firm's decision to enter new markets as
 related to the depth and breadth of its experience and the relative
 distance of those markets. We situate our discussion and analysis in the
 context of the venture capital (VC) industry, and examine whether and when
 US VC firms enter five high-technology investment markets through first-
 or later-round investments. This setting allows us to observe both the
 firms that chose to enter a new market and those that did not, and analyse
 the antecedents of these decisions. We find that VC firms overall are less
 likely to enter distant markets; those with broader experience are more
 likely to make first-round entries. In addition, VC firms with deeper
 investment experience are more likely to make first-round entries in
 proximate markets and less likely to enter distant markets and make
 later-round entries. These results offer interesting implications for the
 literature on organizational learning and entrepreneurship. Copyright (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.
