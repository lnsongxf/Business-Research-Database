Title: Whither Family Business? 
Abstract:
 The family enterprise is capturing increased interest from scholars around
 the world. Yet research about family business is in its infancy and the
 diversity of theories and perspectives represented in the developing
 literature portray a cluttered and conflicted landscape. In the following,
 we provide background, discuss the state of the field, and place in
 context the articles that are featured in this special issue. Critical
 questions facing the field are also addressed. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Top Management Teams in Family-Controlled Companies: 'Familiness', 'Faultlines', and Their Impact on Financial Performance 
Abstract:
 This article examines the affect of family management on performance of
 the company. We examine how familiness can provide further insights beyond
 the classical demographic measures of top management teams (TMTs) in
 explaining variations in firms' financial performance. We combine
 arguments on the 'bright' and 'dark' side of family involvement in the
 firm; we complement positive predictions on family involvement with
 negative predictions and develop family firm-specific measures of TMTs'
 familiness. Results indicate that while the presence of a family CEO is
 beneficial for firm performance, the coexistence of 'factions' in family
 and non-family managers within the TMT has the potential to create schisms
 among the subgroups and consequently hurt firm performance. We find
 support for a hypothesized U-shaped relationship between the ratio of
 family members in the TMT and firm performance. Additional evidence
 related to interactions between firm listing and CEO type on firm
 performance is then presented and discussed. Copyright (c) 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Diversification Decisions in Family-Controlled Firms 
Abstract:
 This study examines diversification decisions of family firms and suggests
 that on average family firms diversify less both domestically and
 internationally than non-family firms. When they do diversify, family
 firms tend to opt for domestic rather than international diversification,
 and those that go the latter route prefer to choose regions that are
 'culturally close'. Lastly, we find that family firms are more willing to
 diversify as business risk increases. The hypotheses are tested using a
 sample of 360 firms, 160 of them being family-controlled and the rest
 (200) non-family-controlled. Copyright (c) 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Institutions Behind Family Ownership and Control in Large Firms 
Abstract:
 There is a major debate regarding the role of concentrated family
 ownership and control in large firms, with three positions suggesting that
 such concentration is (1) good, (2) bad, or (3) irrelevant for firm value.
 Why are there such differences? We theorize that the impact of family
 ownership and control on firm value is associated with the level of
 shareholder protection embodied in legal and regulatory institutions of a
 country. Data from 634 publicly listed large family firms in seven Asian
 countries (Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan,
 and Thailand) are used to test our hypotheses. Overall, this article
 sketches the contours of a cross-country, institution-based view of
 corporate governance, and leads to a more informed understanding of the
 crucial role of institutions behind family ownership and control in large
 firms. Copyright (c) 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Family Control and Ownership Monitoring in Family-Controlled Firms in Japan 
Abstract:
 This paper focuses on a type of firms that have been traditionally
 neglected in both family business and governance research, namely,
 family-controlled, publicly-listed firms. Although principal-agent
 conflicts may be less prevalent in such firms, family control can
 potentially give rise to principal-principal conflicts, leading to
 expropriation of the wealth of minority owners by family owners. Superior
 firm performance and the willingness to distribute the profits through
 dividend payments would suggest the absence of such expropriation. Based
 on a sample of 210 OTC firms in Japan, we examined the relationships
 between family control and dividend payouts and profitability. Our results
 indicate that family control was positively related to dividend payouts.
 Further, we found that while foreign ownership interacted with family
 control to reduce dividend payouts and increase profitability, bank
 ownership did not have such an effect. Copyright (c) 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Locus of Ownership and Family Involvement in Small Private Firms 
Abstract:
 The relationship between ownership and family involvement in small
 businesses is not altogether clear because empirical studies have not
 distinguished among family ownership, family management, and
 owner-management in composing their samples. In the present study, a large
 sample of small private firms is parsed into sub-samples with distinctly
 different types of owners in order to isolate the effects of locus of
 ownership. The results show that firms with different locus of ownership
 behave differently with respect to the extent of involvement by the CEO's
 relatives as employees, key managers, advisors, and board members.
 Although owner-managers and sole-proprietors would seem to have more
 authority than other CEOs to involve family members in the operations of
 the business, the findings indicate that these self-owned firms have
 significantly less family involvement than firms owned entirely by
 relatives of the CEO. Copyright (c) 2009 The Author. Journal compilation (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: The Effects of Family Firm Specific Sources of TMT Diversity: The Moderating Role of Information Exchange Frequency 
Abstract:
 We examine the relationships among three family firm specific sources of
 top management team (TMT) diversity (the generation in charge of the
 family firm, the number of family employees, and the number of employed
 generations) and family firm performance. By integrating upper-echelons
 and team process research, we hypothesize that these TMT diversity sources
 interact with information exchange frequency among TMT members to affect
 family firm performance. Multisource survey data with lagged performance
 measurement, including CEOs and TMT members from 86 family firms, support
 our hypotheses. We discuss the implications of our findings and develop
 avenues for future research. Copyright (c) 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Harvesting Family Firms' Organizational Social Capital: A Relational Perspective 
Abstract:
 Organizational social capital (OSC), the goodwill and resources companies
 gain from their relationships with other companies, enables family firms
 to assemble the resources (especially knowledge) necessary for successful
 adaptation. Connecting with new ventures, the vanguard of radical change,
 is a priority for family firms seeking to achieve survival, profitability
 and growth. Yet, new ventures are often not well known and their networks
 are poorly structured, making access to them difficult. Using the
 relational perspectives on interorganizational relationships, this study
 proposes that family firms can employ their OSC to reach new ventures.
 Family firms can invest in these ventures, build profitable business
 relationships and alliances with them, as well as assist in governing
 their operations. Data from 779 companies show that family firms are in
 better positions to harvest their large OSC stocks to connect with new
 ventures. The results underscore the value of OSC as an important
 relational resource for family firms. Copyright (c) 2010 The Author. Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.
