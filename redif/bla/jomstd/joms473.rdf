Title: Stages of Organizational Transformation in Transition Economies: A Dynamic Capabilities Approach 
Abstract:
 How do organizations previously dominated by the state develop dynamic
 capabilities that would support their growth in a competitive market
 economy? We develop a theoretical framework of organizational
 transformation that explains the processes by which organizations learn
 and develop dynamic capabilities in transition economies. Specifically,
 the framework theorizes about the importance of, and inter-relationships
 between, leadership, organizational learning, dynamic capabilities, and
 performance over three stages of transformation. Propositions derived from
 this framework explain the pre-conditions enabling organizational
 learning, the linkages between types of learning and functions of dynamic
 capabilities, and the feedback from dynamic capabilities to organizational
 learning that allows firms in transition economies to regain their footing
 and build long-term competitive advantage. We focus on transition
 contexts, where these processes have been magnified and thus offer new
 insights into strategizing in radically altered environments. Copyright (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: The Multiple Effects of Business Planning on New Venture Performance 
Abstract:
 We investigate the multiple effects of writing a business plan prior to
 start-up on new venture performance. We argue that the impact of business
 plans depends on the purpose for and circumstances in which they are being
 used. We offer an empirical methodology which can account for these
 multiple effects while disentangling real impact effects from selection
 effects. We apply this to English data where we find that business plans
 promote employment growth. This is found to be due to the impact of the
 plan and not selection effects. Copyright (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Do Institutionalized Traditions Matter During Crisis? Employee Downsizing in Korean Manufacturing Organizations 
Abstract:
 This study examines the downfall of the permanent employment tradition in
 South Korean manufacturing organizations in the aftermath of the 1997 East
 Asian economic crisis. We explore whether organizations abandon their
 traditional institutionalized practices under discontinuous environmental
 change or despite the change continue these time-honoured practices. We
 examine both the organizational factors that inhibit lay-offs and
 performance indicators that trigger organizations to re-evaluate their
 lifetime employment practices under drastic environmental upheaval. We
 test our hypotheses on 574 Korean manufacturing organizations and find
 that under discontinuous change: (1) economic and institutional factors
 simultaneously apply opposite forces on organizational actions; (2)
 organizational factors such as poor performance on productivity and export
 create a need for headcount reductions while factors such as size,
 domestic ownership, government support, and unionization create social and
 institutional pressures that inhibit downsizing; and (3) prior experience
 with downsizing moderates the relationship between institutional factors
 and further downsizing. Copyright (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Organizational Justice and Individuals' Withdrawal: Unlocking the Influence of Emotional Exhaustion 
Abstract:
 This study examined the relationships between organizational justice and
 withdrawal outcomes and whether emotional exhaustion was a mediator of
 these linkages. Data were obtained from 869 military personnel and civil
 servants; using structural equation modelling techniques, we examined an
 integrative model that combines justice and stress research. Our findings
 suggest that individuals' justice perceptions are related to their
 psychological health. As predicted, emotional exhaustion mediated the
 linkages between distributive and interpersonal (but not procedural and
 informational) justice and individuals' withdrawal reactions. Results
 showed that distributive and interpersonal justice negatively related to
 emotional exhaustion and emotional exhaustion negatively related to
 organizational commitment which, in turn, negatively influenced turnover
 intentions. These findings were observed even when controlling for the
 presence of contingent-reward behaviours provided by supervisors and
 individuals' psychological empowerment. Copyright (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Governing Knowledge Sharing in Organizations: Levels of Analysis, Governance Mechanisms, and Research Directions 
Abstract:
 We discuss and examine recent claims that research on knowledge processes
 has paid insufficient attention to micro (individual) level constructs and
 mechanisms and to the role of formal organization in governing knowledge
 processes. We review knowledge sharing research published in 13 (top
 academic plus top practitioner-oriented) journals in the period 1996-2006
 in relation to these two propositions. The review confirms the claim that
 the knowledge sharing literature is preoccupied with constructs,
 processes, and phenomena defined at a macro (collective, organizational)
 level and pay comparatively little attention to micro level constructs.
 The review provides less support for the proposition that formal
 governance mechanisms have been under-researched in comparison to formal
 organization. Still, the multiple ways in which formal governance
 mechanisms may interact in influencing knowledge sharing outcomes have
 been under-researched, as has the interaction between more informal
 aspects of the firm and formal governance mechanisms. We argue that future
 research on knowledge sharing needs to fill these gaps. Copyright (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Political Skill, Supervisor-Subordinate "Guanxi" and Career Prospects in Chinese Firms 
Abstract:
 The role of political skill was examined in the dynamics of
 supervisor-subordinate relationship in Chinese firms. Data from a survey
 of 343 employees, their 343 direct supervisors, and 662 of their peers
 were applied to test a model proposing that Chinese subordinates employ
 political skill to influence their "guanxi" with their supervisors, and so
 promote their career development. We found that supervisor-subordinate
 "guanxi" mediated the relationship between political skill and career
 development of the subordinates. Implications of the findings were
 discussed. Copyright (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: A Study of the Association between Level of Slack Reduction Following Downsizing and Innovation Output 
Abstract:
 Over the years scholars put forward a number of theories to explain the
 association between slack and innovation. This study extends this body of
 research by focusing on the effects of reduction in slack level following
 downsizing on innovation output. We developed two hypotheses to examine
 the total effects and varied yearly effects. We tested the hypotheses with
 data from a panel of UK firms that downsized between 1997 and 2003. The
 results show that the level of downsizing has only temporary effects on
 innovation output. We discuss the implications of these findings and
 avenues for future research. Copyright (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Reflections on Enacted Sensemaking in the Bhopal Disaster 
Abstract:
 An updated analysis of the Bhopal disaster suggests that problems of
 abduction, awareness, reliability, and certainty were more serious than
 was first thought. Expanded analysis shows that the tight coupling between
 cognition and action, normally associated with enacted sensemaking, broke
 down at Bhopal. The breakdowns included a low standard of plausibility,
 minimal doubt, infrequent updating of both mental models and current
 hunches, and mindless action. The modest enactment that did occur
 prolonged rather than shortened the crisis. Copyright (c) 2010 The Author. Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Sensemaking in Crisis and Change: Inspiration and Insights From Weick (1988) 
Abstract:
 When Karl Weick's seminal article, 'Enacted Sensemaking in Crisis
 Situations', was published in 1988, it caused the field to think very
 differently about how crises unfold in organizations, and how emergent
 crises might be more quickly curtailed. More than 20 years later, we offer
 insights inspired by the central ideas in that article. Beginning with an
 exploration of key sensemaking studies in the crisis and change
 literatures, we reflect on lessons learned about sensemaking in turbulent
 conditions since Weick (1988), and argue for two core themes that underlie
 sensemaking in such contexts: shared meanings and emotion. We examine when
 and how shared meanings and emotion are more and less likely to enable
 more helpful, or adaptive, sensemaking, and conclude with some suggestions
 for future research in the sensemaking field. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.
