Title: Transferring Organizational Practices and the Dynamics of Hybridization: Japanese Retail Multinationals in China 
Abstract:
 Detailed case study research conducted at Japanese multinational retail
 firms in both their home country and their subsidiaries in China is
 undertaken to assess a range of prominent theoretical perspectives that
 have been used to account for the transfer of organizational practices.
 Approaches based upon culturalist, national business systems, industry
 sector, international division of labour, and agency perspectives are
 shown to be inadequate, individually, to account for the complex patterns
 of transfer, local adoption, and adaptation in these multinational
 companies. These findings highlight the value of conceptual bricolage and
 multi-level analysis for developing explanations that can encompass and
 explicate complex patterns of hybridization. The paper also identifies
 important factors in the dynamics of hybridization that have been
 neglected or downplayed in much of the existing literature. These include
 the significance of context specific, firm level perceptions of sources of
 competitive advantage as a key motive encouraging transfer of parent
 company practices. Crucial factors constraining transfer are the practices
 and norms prevalent in local labour markets. Additionally, transfer by
 multinational companies to transitional economies with high levels of
 deinstitutionalization illustrates problematic dimensions for various
 theoretical perspectives, including influential neo-institutionalist
 models. Copyright (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Quality Meets Structure: Generalized Reciprocity and Firm-Level Advantage in Strategic Networks 
Abstract:
 In this paper we extend previous research by combining network structural
 and network process approaches. Specifically, in a six-year, three-wave
 study of 41 firms in two strategic networks, we found that the interaction
 between generalized reciprocity among a focal firm's partners and network
 tie intensity and betweenness centrality improved firm performance. No
 influences were observed for the interaction involving degree centrality
 and generalized reciprocity. Our research suggests that managers in
 strategic networks may need to consider the balance between
 relationship-extensive and relationship-intensive strategies. Copyright (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: The Influence of Technological Knowledge Base and Organizational Structure on Technology Collaboration 
Abstract:
 This study investigates how an incumbent company's internal
 characteristics influence its propensity to form learning alliances. A
 firm may be reluctant to enter a research alliance when it has deep
 knowledge in a certain technological field due to concerns about knowledge
 leakage and the low possibility of being able to learn much from
 collaboration. On the contrary, when the firm has a broad knowledge base,
 it may have high propensity to enter alliances due to more self-confidence
 in its ability to learn fast from partners. In addition, we argue that
 when a firm concentrates its R&D at a central location, this neutralizes
 the positive and negative influences of the two knowledge base features on
 alliance formation. We tested and found support for the hypotheses using a
 database of 1550 alliances undertaken by 78 large incumbent
 pharmaceutical, chemical, and agro-food companies active in the
 biotechnology sector during 1993-2002. Copyright (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Middle Manager Leadership and Frontline Employee Performance: Bypass, Cascading, and Moderating Effects 
Abstract:
 We investigated the relationship between middle managers' transformational
 leadership and the performance of frontline employees who are two levels
 below the middle managers. We identified two pathways through which this
 cross-level influence occurs and tested two moderators operating on these
 two pathways. The first pathway is a direct effect from middle managers to
 employees, bypassing the influence of employees' immediate supervisor (the
 bypass effect). We further hypothesized that the bypass effect is
 moderated by the employees' collectivistic value. The second pathway is a
 cascading of leadership behaviours from middle managers to first-line
 supervisors, whose transformational leadership then enhances employees'
 performance (the cascading effect). We further hypothesized that this
 cascading effect is moderated by the supervisors' power distance value.
 These hypotheses were tested with a sample of 491 frontline employees, 98
 frontline supervisors, and 30 middle managers in three organizations in
 China. The three-level hierarchical linear modelling results supported the
 four hypotheses. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Industry Event Participation and Network Brokerage among Entrepreneurial Ventures 
Abstract:
 Despite the recognition that network brokerage is beneficial for
 entrepreneurial ventures, little is known about its antecedents. This
 study examines how participation in industry events (e.g. conferences)
 relates to entrepreneurs' brokerage positions in informal industry
 networks and how these positions, in turn, impact new venture performance.
 Using a unique dataset of 45 events and subsequent network relations among
 entrepreneurs from 90 firms in the open source software industry, results
 indicate that: (1) entrepreneurs who participated in heterogeneous events
 or who bridged between events with few common participants were more
 likely to be brokers; (2) the relationship between event bridging and
 brokerage was stronger for entrepreneurs with broader prior career
 experiences; and (3) network brokerage mediated the event
 participation-performance link. It appears that events may limit
 structural opportunities for brokerage and that individual differences
 matter for exploiting these opportunities. Overall, this study increases
 understanding of how and when particular networking behaviours are
 beneficial for entrepreneurs. Copyright (c) 2010 The Author. Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: The Missing Link Between the Theory and Empirics of Path Dependence: Conceptual Clarification, Testability Issue, and Methodological Implications 
Abstract:
 Path dependence is a central construct in organizational research, used to
 describe a mechanism that connects the past and the future in an abstract
 way. However, across institutional, technology, and strategy literatures,
 it remains unclear why path dependence sometimes occurs and sometimes not,
 why it sometimes lead to inefficient outcomes and sometimes not, how it
 differs from mere increasing returns, and how scholars can empirically
 support their claims on path dependence. Hence, path dependence is not yet
 a theory since it does not causally relate identified variables in a
 systematized manner. Instead, the existing literature tends to conflate
 path dependence as a process (i.e. history unfolding in a self-reinforcing
 manner) and as an outcome (i.e. a persisting state of the world with
 specific properties, called 'lock-in'). This paper contributes
 theoretically and methodologically to tackling these issues by: (1)
 providing a formal definition of path dependence that disentangles process
 and outcome, and identifies the necessary conditions for path dependence;
 (2) distinguishing clearly between path dependence and other 'history
 matters' kinds of mechanisms; and (3) specifying the missing link between
 theoretical and empirical path dependence. In particular, we suggest
 moving away from historical case studies of supposedly path-dependent
 processes to focus on more controlled research designs such as
 simulations, experiments, and counterfactual investigation. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Path Dependence or Path Creation? 
Abstract:
 We discuss the assumptions that underlie path dependence, as defined by
 Vergne and Durand, and then provide the outlines of an alternative
 perspective which we label as path creation. Path creation entertains a
 notion of agency that is distributed and emergent through relational
 processes that constitute phenomena. Viewed from this perspective,
 'initial conditions' are not given, 'contingencies' are emergent contexts
 for action, 'self-reinforcing mechanisms' are strategically manipulated,
 and 'lock-in' is but a temporary stabilization of paths in-the-making. We
 develop these points using a narrative approach and highlight the
 theoretical and methodological implications of our perspective. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.
