Title: Guest Editors' Introduction 
Abstract:
 There are already manifold interactions between business history and
 management studies but, to date, they have tended to be more particular
 and patchy than general and systematic. In this introduction we summarize
 the arguments that scholars from business history, management studies and
 social science have made for closer contact between these fields which
 emphasize the benefits to be gained both for theoretical and historical
 research on business. We highlight how the articles published in this
 Special Issue show the wide variety of intellectual purposes, approaches,
 and benefits that closer engagement between business history and
 management theories might entail. Yet, concerns have also been raised
 about the value of a closer alliance between business history and
 management studies and we suggest that they are worthy of further
 consideration and discussion. To that end, we propose a more deliberate
 conversation about what it is we do as historians and theorists of
 business and what we seek to accomplish. Such a discussion would help us
 not only to better understand the limits to fruitful integration but also
 how to work together more productively in the collaborations that seem
 most worthwhile. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Postcolonial Transitions in Africa: Decolonization in West Africa and Present Day South Africa 
Abstract:
 Black Economic Empowerment is a highly debated issue in contemporary South
 Africa. Yet few South Africans realize that they are following a
 postcolonial trajectory already experienced by other countries. This paper
 presents a case study of British firms during decolonization in Ghana and
 Nigeria in the 1950s and 1960s, which saw a parallel development in
 business and society to that which occurred in South Africa in the 1990s
 and 2000s. Despite fundamental differences between these states, all have
 had to empower a majority of black citizens who had previously suffered
 discrimination on the basis of race. The paper employs concepts from
 social capital theory to show that the process of postcolonial transition
 in African economies has been more politically and socially disruptive
 than empowerment in Western countries. Historical research contributes to
 our understanding of the nature of institutional shocks in emerging
 economies. Copyright (c) 2010 The Author. Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Agency, Institutional Change, and Continuity: The Case of the Finnish Civil War 
Abstract:
 The purpose of this paper is to study the role of individual agency in the
 process of institutional change. We conducted a historical study to
 explore the motivations and activities of two prominent individuals in
 business and politics before, during, and after the Finnish Civil War. Our
 most important finding is that the improvised actions of individuals with
 complex interests were causally related to long-term institutional
 changes. Specifically, our study contributes to theory development in the
 field of institutional analysis by showing how individual actors can be a
 mechanism for both institutional continuity and change. On the practical
 side, our account can help managers understand the power of improvised
 activities in the face of ambiguity and uncertainty, especially if there
 is the possibility of acting in concert. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Enhancing Industry Association Theory: A Comparative Business History Contribution 
Abstract:
 Our comparative business historical examination of industry associations
 aims to enrich the under-theorized study of this distinctive type of
 meta-organization. We compare two New Zealand industry associations
 operating in the same supply chain but with differing degrees of
 associative capacity and types of external architecture. Our analysis of
 these associations builds on two strands of theory that rarely communicate
 with each other: New Institutional Economics (NIE) and
 Organizational-Institutional Theory (OIT). We demonstrate how NIE
 describes the structural potentialities for associational strength, while
 OIT addresses the relational context within associations. In turn, NIE's
 examination of external influences reinforces OIT suggestions that
 associations which are rich in social capital can become developmental in
 orientation. Our historical analysis supplies fresh theoretical insights
 into industry associations, thereby addressing conceptual issues of
 interest to management scholars who study bridging-type organizations. On
 this basis, we argue that business history and organization studies
 complement each other. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Chandler's Living History: "The Visible Hand" of Vertical Integration in Nineteenth Century America Viewed Under a Twenty-First Century Transaction Costs Economics Lens 
Abstract:
 Alfred Chandler's recent passing is cause to review and celebrate his many
 contributions to business history. It also presents an opportunity to
 highlight links between his rich historical analyses concerning
 organizational and industrial innovation and contemporary management
 studies of the firm and industrial organization. We illustrate this point
 by applying transaction costs theory to several case studies from his 1977
 masterwork narrating the emergence of vertically-integrated firms in
 nineteenth-century America, "The Visible Hand". Vertical integration,
 organizational control, and innovation in manufacturing at McCormick
 Harvester and Singer Sewing Machines, and in transportation and
 distribution at Swift and United Fruit reflect managerial responses to
 classic transaction costs considerations including commercial
 relationships requiring the creation of specialized equipment and
 knowledge. Transaction costs analysis provides complementary historical
 insight on organizational innovation at these and other firms in the
 nineteenth century, and suggests when and where we might expect vertical
 integration strategies in emerging industries of the twenty-first century. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Technological Discontinuities and Competitive Advantage: A Historical Perspective on Formula 1 Motor Racing 1950-2006 
Abstract:
 This paper considers the interplay between technological discontinuities
 and competitive performance. Much of the work on technological
 discontinuities has focused on macro levels of analysis such as industries
 and technologies rather than specific firms. This study uses a historical
 perspective on Formula 1 motor racing to explore the dynamics between firm
 level performance and technological discontinuities over a 57 year period.
 The study supports the findings of previous research that incumbent firms
 are often unable to adapt to the impact of exogenous shocks. However the
 study also reveals situations where a relatively small number of firms are
 able to sustain their competitive superiority through a number of
 successive discontinuities. I suggest that, in addition to dynamic
 capabilities, these firms possess sustaining capabilities - munificent
 resource configurations which extend the time available for firms to adapt
 to technological changes - thereby allowing them to remain competitive
 across discontinuities. Copyright (c) 2010 The Author. Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.
