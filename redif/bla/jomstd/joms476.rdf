Title: Relative CEO Underpayment and CEO Behaviour Towards R&D Spending 
Abstract:
 Arguments based on labour market theory suggest that there may be CEO
 behavioural issues related to pay deviations from the labour market rate
 for CEO pay; however, few studies examine this phenomenon. This study
 attempts to address such behavioural issues by examining the influence of
 relative CEO underpayment on reductions in R&D spending, the differences
 in this relationship between firms in high R&D intensive versus low R&D
 intensive industries, and the moderating affect of ownership structure on
 the CEO underpayment and R&D spending relationship. Results suggest that
 relative CEO underpayment is associated with reductions in R&D spending in
 low R&D intensive industries and increases in R&D spending in high R&D
 intensive industries. Also, greater relative CEO underpayment leads to
 greater reductions in R&D spending in manager-controlled organizations as
 compared to owner-controlled organizations. This study provides evidence
 that pay deviations may, in fact, affect certain CEO behaviours,
 specifically relating to innovation. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Adopting Proactive Environmental Strategy: The Influence of Stakeholders and Firm Size 
Abstract:
 While smaller firms are less likely to undertake as many environmental
 practices as larger firms, extant literature suggests that smaller firms
 may be more responsive to stakeholder pressures. This paper contributes to
 the development of stakeholder theory by deriving a size moderated
 stakeholder model and applying it to a firm's adoption of proactive
 environmental practices. The empirical results show that smaller firms are
 more responsive to value-chain, internal, and regulatory stakeholder
 pressures. These findings suggest that researchers evaluating
 organizations and the natural environment should be cautious about
 associating stakeholder pressures directly with firms' environmental
 strategies. Rather, the relationship between stakeholder pressures and
 environmental strategy tends to vary with size. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Nascent Entrepreneurs and Venture Emergence: Opportunity Confidence, Human Capital, and Early Planning 
Abstract:
 Nascent entrepreneurs continuously evaluate the merits of the
 opportunities they pursue and so can abandon those that lack promise and
 persist with those that remain attractive. This paper articulates this
 evolving judgment about the opportunity as the nascent entrepreneur's
 opportunity confidence. It situates this construct in the context of the
 nascent entrepreneur's human capital and early planning actions in respect
 to the pursued opportunity, and in respect to the emergence of the nascent
 venture. Analyses of PSED data show that opportunity confidence positively
 affects venture emergence and that, through it, entrepreneurial experience
 and early planning have only indirect effects on venture emergence. In
 contrast, industry experience has a direct, positive effect on venture
 emergence. These results provide some novel insights into the nascent
 entrepreneurial process as well as into the role of human capital and
 early planning in that process. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Acquisitions and Real Options: The Greenfield Alternative 
Abstract:
 Although acquisitions are a popular way to enter new markets, empirical
 evidence tends to indicate few benefits accrue to acquiring firms. This
 might be the case because firms use acquisitions when they should be
 employing an alternative mode of expansion. Applying real options theory
 to this issue, we suggest that greenfield start-up ventures provide a real
 option alternative to acquisitions for firms establishing new
 international subsidiary units. To test this notion we examine a sample of
 Western European firms entering the emerging economies of Eastern Europe.
 The evidence suggests that acquisitions are a good choice only when firms
 enter markets containing low demand uncertainty and when these firms
 possess acquisition-based strategic flexibility. Overall, our analysis
 indicates that greenfield ventures appear to provide firms with a real
 option when making the acquisition decision. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: A Multi-Dimensional Framework of Organizational Innovation: A Systematic Review of the Literature 
Abstract:
 This paper consolidates the state of academic research on "innovation".
 Based on a systematic review of literature published over the past 27
 years, we synthesize various research perspectives into a comprehensive
 multi-dimensional framework of organizational innovation - linking
 leadership, innovation as a process, and innovation as an outcome. We also
 suggest measures of determinants of organizational innovation and present
 implications for both research and managerial practice. Copyright (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Performance Implications of Ties to the Government and SOEs: A Political Embeddedness Perspective 
Abstract:
 In many countries governments not only regulate business activities, but
 also become involved in the corporate governance of individual firms
 through ownership and board ties. While existing studies usually focus
 either on benefits of political connections or on costs of government
 influence, a political embeddedness perspective helps us consider both
 advantages and constraints associated with ties to the government. In
 particular, firms with direct ties to the government will experience
 significant costs associated with government officials' involvement in the
 corporate governance process. In contrast, firms with ties to state-owned
 enterprises (SOEs) are connected to the government indirectly and thus,
 while getting access to state-owned resources, avoid costs associated with
 the government's interventions. This study compares the performance
 consequences of board and ownership ties to the government with the
 consequences of board and ownership ties to SOEs. I find that ties to SOEs
 are associated with higher profitability, while no significant differences
 are discovered for firms with direct ties to the government. Copyright (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Critical Discourse Analysis in Organizational Studies: Towards an Integrationist Methodology 
Abstract:
 We engage with Leitch and Palmer's (2010) analysis of Critical Discourse
 Analytical (CDA) scholarship in organizational and management studies, in
 order to argue that, whereas they rightly point to the need for further
 reflexivity in the field, their recommendation for a strict methodological
 protocol in CDA studies may be reproducing some of the problems they
 identify in their analysis. We put forward an alternative,
 relational-dialectic conception of discourse that defends an
 integrationist orientation to research methodology, privileging
 trans-disciplinarity over rigour. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Analysing Texts in Context: Current Practices and New Protocols for Critical Discourse Analysis in Organization Studies 
Abstract:
 Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) in organization studies would be
 strengthened by an increased focus on a central CDA tenet that texts
 should be analysed in context. Context has, for the most part, been
 afforded a taken-for-granted status that is misplaced because of the
 diverse ways in which it may be defined and applied. These generally
 unacknowledged differences relate to whether context is treated as space,
 time, practice, change, or frame. The result is a confusing array of
 studies claiming some degree of CDA status without core agreement - or
 acknowledgement of disagreements - about what is meant by context or how
 it should be linked to texts. To remedy this situation we identify in this
 Point article nine methodological protocols related to conceptual
 definitions, data selection, and data analysis which we argue benefit the
 consistency and rigour with which CDA in organization studies is applied.
 Use of these protocols may also serve as criteria against which the rigour
 of CDA research papers may be assessed. Copyright (c) 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Partner Selection Decisions in Interfirm Collaborations: The Paradox of Relational Embeddedness 
Abstract:
 By combining insights from relational network theory and agency theory we
 identify the boundary conditions to the embeddedness approach to partner
 selection decisions in interfirm collaborations. Employing a longitudinal
 dataset comprising the investment syndicates for the population of UK
 management buyouts between 1993 and 2003, we find that relational
 embeddedness is less important for selecting partners when agency risks
 are low, allowing firms to expand their networks. Furthermore,
 reputational capital may act as a partial substitute for relational
 embeddedness, again permitting firms to expand their networks. Our
 findings enhance understanding of the boundary conditions associated with
 the relational network approach to partner selections and network
 behaviour. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Membership Matters: On the Value of Being Embedded in Customer Networks 
Abstract:
 Learning about customers and their contexts is vital to firm strategy. We
 examine how firms can learn by participating in their customers' networks.
 Specifically, we explain how a bank can increase the value that it creates
 for customers by being embedded in the networks in which the customers are
 embedded. We argue that knowledge pertinent to a particular customer is
 available in the network of affiliated, inter-related customers, and that
 being structurally embedded in this network can help banks overcome
 information asymmetries. We use hierarchical linear modelling to test the
 argument that a bank's structural embeddedness in its customers' network
 positively affects the bank's ability to offer favourable credit terms. We
 find that not only does such structural embeddedness affect credit terms,
 but it also moderates the effects of previously examined relational
 embeddedness on credit terms. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: The Dynamic Influence of Social Capital on the International Growth of New Ventures 
Abstract:
 This paper explores the origin, evolution, and appropriation of social
 capital by new ventures seeking international growth. Using longitudinal
 case studies in the software industry, we model the dynamic influence of
 social capital on new venture internationalization. We theorize that new
 ventures of founders from a globally-connected environment, such as with
 return migration or MNC experience, have higher stocks of initial social
 capital than others. We provide a nuanced analysis of the dynamic
 processes involved in the evolution of social capital, and highlight the
 mechanisms of decay and replenishment over time. Network learning plays a
 critical role in new ventures' ability to realize the potential
 contribution of social capital to international growth. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: From National Service to Global Player: Transforming the Organizational Logic of a Public Broadcaster 
Abstract:
 We present organizational logics as a meso-level construct that lies
 between institutional theory's field-level logics and the sense-making
 activities of individual agents in organizations. We argue that an
 institutional logic can be operationalized empirically using the concept
 of a discourse - that is, a coherent symbolic system articulating what
 constitutes legitimate, reasonable, and effective conduct in, around, and
 by organizations. An organization may, moreover, be simultaneously exposed
 to several institutional logics that make up its broader ideational
 environment. Taking these three observations together enables us to
 consider an organizational logic as a spatially and temporally localized
 configuration of diverse discourses. We go on to show how organizational
 logics were transformed in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation between
 1953 and 1999 by examining the changing discourses that appeared in the
 Corporation's annual reports. We argue that these discourses were modified
 through three main forms of discursive agency: (1) undertaking acts of
 ironic accommodation between competing discourses; (2) building chains of
 equivalence between the potentially contradictory discourses; and (3)
 reconciling new and old discourses through pragmatic acts of 'bricolage'.
 We found that, using these forms of discursive agency, a powerful
 coalition of actors was able to transform the dominant organizational
 logic of the ABC from one where the Corporation's initial mission was to
 serve national interests through public service to one that was ultimately
 focused on participating in a globalized media market. Finally, we note
 that discursive resources could be used as the basis for resistance by
 less powerful agents, although further research is necessary to determine
 exactly how more powerful and less powerful agents interact around the
 establishment of an organizational logic. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.
