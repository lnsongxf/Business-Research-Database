Title: Modelling the Joint Impact of the CEO and the TMT on Organizational Ambidexterity 
Abstract:
 While researchers continue to debate how firms might attain ambidexterity,
 recent research demonstrates that top management teams (TMTs) play a
 pivotal role. We enrich this line of inquiry by specifying a model that
 blends the effect of the CEO and the TMT on ambidexterity. Specifically,
 given the importance of networking and building social capital to the
 access of timely, valuable, and diverse information, we first envision
 that the CEO's network extensiveness will positively impact ambidexterity.
 Next, we argue that this impact will be bolstered when the CEO-TMT
 interactional interface, including communication richness, functional
 complementarity, and power decentralization, enable the entire TMT to
 process disparate information demands essential to attaining
 ambidexterity. We test and find general support for our model using
 multi-source survey data from 122 small- to medium-sized enterprises
 (SMEs). Copyright (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: The Power of Knowledge: Learning from 'Learning by Knowledge-Intensive Firm' 
Abstract:
 This article reviews and discusses the contribution of William Starbuck's
 'Learning by Knowledge-Intensive Firms'. Apart from situating Starbuck's
 article in its historical context and contemporary debates it is argued
 that the concept of esoteric knowledge and the focus on persuasion
 provides untapped potential for enhancing our understanding of knowledge
 work and knowledge-intensive firms. In conclusion, Starbuck's argument is
 used as input for a reconceptualization of the relationship between power,
 knowledge work, and knowledge-intensive firms. Copyright (c) 2010 The Author. Journal of Management Studies (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: What Makes a Paper Influential and Frequently Cited? 
Abstract:
 Social trends that raised the value of esoteric expertise, stimulated the
 creation of knowledge-intensive firms and so created an opportunity to
 study some organizations that academics had overlooked. A lack of
 presuppositions, a useful research method, and thoughtful experts in these
 firms helped to uncover some surprising behaviours. The resulting paper
 attracted citations and may have stimulated research about knowledge as a
 business resource and a managerial challenge. However, the topic continues
 to pose questions for further research. Copyright (c) 2010 The Author. Journal of Management Studies (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: A Property Rights Perspective on Venture Capital Investment Decisions 
Abstract:
 To understand how ownership differences influence specific types of
 strategic decisions, we examine the investment decisions of venture
 capital (VC) firms, for which a variety of property rights arrangements
 exist. We describe how VC firms are characterized by important differences
 in how and to whom various property rights are allocated. On this basis,
 we develop a series of hypotheses regarding differences in the range and
 types of investment opportunities pursued by private, corporate, and bank
 affiliated VC firms. Evaluating our hypotheses using data on investments
 carried out by 3557 firms, we find that these types of firm perform
 distinct roles in the ecology of VC financing. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal of Management Studies (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: HRM Practices, Organizational Citizenship Behaviour, and Performance: A Multi-Level Analysis 
Abstract:
 We examine the relationship between HRM practices, conceptualized at the
 workplace level, and individual employee attitudes and behaviour. We focus
 on two possible explanations for the relationship: social exchange and job
 influence/employee discretion. Findings from a study of employees in
 North-East England suggest that there is a positive impact of HRM
 practices on organizational citizenship behaviour, through an effect on
 perceived job influence/discretion. There was no such effect for perceived
 organizational support. These findings provide support for a job influence
 and opportunity explanation of HRM effects on employee attitudes and
 behaviour. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal of Management Studies (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Can Two Wrongs Make a Right? State Ownership and Debt in a Transition Economy 
Abstract:
 Existing literature suggests that both state ownership and debt have
 detrimental performance consequences in transition economies.
 Paradoxically, however, we contend that the confluence of these two
 conditions may not be harmful. By considering the interactions between the
 governance properties of state ownership and debt, interpreted in light of
 the institutional context of China (i.e. the interplay between local
 governments, managers, and central banks), we argue that state ownership
 and debt can potentially offset each other's detrimental effects. We test
 our hypotheses with a sample of over 1300 Chinese firms that were listed
 on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock exchanges between 2003 and 2005.
 Results of the tests confirm that while debt and state ownership each have
 a negative impact on firm performance when used in isolation, their
 interaction has a positive impact on firm performance. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal of Management Studies (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Top Management Team Advice Seeking and Exploratory Innovation: The Moderating Role of TMT Heterogeneity 
Abstract:
 Research on strategic decision making has considered advice-seeking
 behaviour as an important top management team attribute that influences
 organizational outcomes. Yet, our understanding about how top management
 teams utilize advice to modify current strategies and pursue exploratory
 innovation is still unclear. To uncover the importance of advice seeking,
 we delineate between external and internal advice seeking and investigate
 their impact on exploratory innovation. We also argue that top management
 team heterogeneity moderates the impact of advice seeking on exploratory
 innovation. Findings indicated that both external and internal advice
 seeking are important determinants of a firm's exploratory innovation. In
 addition, we observed that top management team heterogeneity facilitates
 firms to act upon internal advice by combining different perspectives and
 developing new products and services. Interestingly, heterogeneous top
 management teams appeared to be less effective to leverage external advice
 and pursue exploratory innovation. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal of Management Studies (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: A Critical Examination of the Relationship between Emotional Intelligence and Transformational Leadership 
Abstract:
 The buoyant research interest in the constructs emotional intelligence
 (EI) and transformational leadership (TFL) is a testament to the crucial
 role of emotional skills at work. EI is often described as an antecedent
 of TFL, and several empirical studies report a positive relationship
 between these variables. On closer inspection, however, there may be
 methodological factors, such as common method variance, that potentially
 undermine the validity of findings. Using a multi-rater assessment
 (N&thinsp;&equals;&thinsp;227), this study sought to overcome the problem
 of method variance, whilst at the same time evaluate its potential
 presence by comparing same-source and non-same-source data. Findings
 suggest that, when using a strong methodological design, no relationship
 between EI and TFL is found. Thus, these findings renew the demand for
 scientific rigour in the design of studies to enhance their validity. The
 theoretical ramifications of this study are such that management scholars
 need to re-conceptualize the relationship between EI and TFL. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal of Management Studies (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Appraising Performance across Borders: An Empirical Examination of the Purposes and Practices of Performance Appraisal in a Multi-Country Context 
Abstract:
 This study empirically investigated culture's consequences on the major
 purposes and practices of performance appraisal using a sample
 (n&thinsp;&equals;&thinsp;1749) drawn from the banking industry in seven
 countries across Europe, Asia, and North America. We found that the
 effects and predictive capability of assertiveness, uncertainty avoidance,
 in-group collectivism, and power distance should not be overstated nor are
 they straightforward. Organizations must be cognizant of the potential
 influence that a range of other organizational, institutional, and
 economic factors may wield on appraisal. These findings hold significant
 implications for the theoretical underpinnings of appraisal, a management
 tool largely rooted in US equity, expectancy, and procedural justice
 values and traditions. They also offer important lessons for practice. Not
 only is the transferability of appraisal and its operationalization
 affected by interactions with divergent cultures and contextual settings,
 but new hybrid appraisal architectures are emerging that necessitate
 further research. Copyright (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.
