Title: Ownership as a Form of Corporate Governance 
Abstract:
 Firm ownership is an increasingly influential form of corporate
 governance. Although firms might be owned by different types of owners,
 most studies examine owner influence on a particular firm outcome in
 isolation. This study synthesizes research from multiple disciplines on
 different types of owners and offers a unifying framework of governance
 through ownership. Using this framework, we describe the motivations of
 various types of owners, the tactics owners use to affect firms in which
 they are invested, and the dominant firm outcomes these owners seek to
 influence. We note how heightened managerial awareness of heterogeneous
 owner interests increases owner influence on firm-level outcomes. We also
 provide a roadmap for future study and offer research questions about
 where scholars might turn their attention to better understand the role of
 owners in directing firm actions. Our study draws attention to emerging
 forms of ownership, such as hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds, and
 highlights the changing (and often competing) interests of shareholders
 and how this impacts theories of governance. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal of Management Studies (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Institutional Investors and Institutional Environment: A Comparative Analysis and Review 
Abstract:
 We provide a review of the literature surrounding institutional investor
 classifications, and we extend this research by examining the
 aforementioned classification systems and relate this to the three
 predominant financial systems (market-based, family-centred, and
 bank-centred systems). After integrating this literature we propose that
 future research can contribute to the corporate governance field in three
 main ways: through improved measurement of the central constructs, through
 more complex research designs (through moderated and/or longitudinal
 relationships), and through asking new types of questions. We suggest
 several questions and approaches for future research on institutional
 investors and their interrelationship with country financial systems. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal of Management Studies (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Make, Buy or Ally? Theoretical Perspectives on Knowledge Process Outsourcing through Alliances 
Abstract:
 Outsourcing knowledge and innovation activities offer cost savings and
 superior performance, but can also put a firm's unique resources and
 capabilities at risk. Characterizations of outsourcing as a make-or-buy
 decision do not fit well with decisions on knowledge process outsourcing
 (KPO). KPO is a make-or-ally decision, as firms seek a governance
 structure that will both protect and leverage their strategic knowledge
 assets, with the final decision often coming down to a choice between
 different alliance forms. Our new conceptualization provides an integrated
 perspective on resource integration and transaction specificity in the
 knowledge governance decision. The model illustrates the dynamics and
 learning involved in knowledge outsourcing by identifying two distinct
 paths to KPO alliances. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal of Management Studies (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Reconceptualizing the Firm in a World of Outsourcing and Offshoring: The Organizational and Geographical Relocation of High-Value Company Functions 
Abstract:
 In the largest sense, global strategy amounts to (1) the optimal
 disaggregation or slicing of the firm's value chain into as many
 constituent pieces as organizationally and economically feasible, followed
 by (2) decisions as how each slice should be allocated geographically
 ('offshoring') and organizationally ('outsourcing'). Offshoring and
 outsourcing are treated as strategies that need to be "simultaneously"
 analysed, where just 'core' segments of the value chain are retained
 in-house, while others are optimally dispersed geographically, as well as
 dispersed over allies and contractors. This amounts to a reconsideration
 of the nature of the firm that captures the dynamic changes in global
 configuration and a reconsideration of what constitutes 'core' activities
 that need to be retained internally. The article proposes a new research
 agenda that searches for each firm's optimal degree of disaggregation and
 global dispersion given that further scattering of value chain activities
 entail benefits as well as increased complexity and costs. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal of Management Studies (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Balancing Internal and External Knowledge Acquisition: The Gains and Pains from R&D Outsourcing 
Abstract:
 The outsourcing of research and development (R&D) activities has
 frequently been characterized as an important instrument to acquire
 external technological knowledge that is subsequently integrated into a
 firm's own knowledge base. However, in this paper we argue that these
 'gains' from R&D outsourcing need to be balanced against the 'pains' that
 stem from a dilution of firm-specific resources, the deterioration of
 integrative capabilities and the high demands on management attention.
 Based on a panel dataset of innovating firms in Germany, we find evidence
 for an inverse U-shaped relationship between R&D outsourcing and
 innovation performance. This relationship is positively moderated by the
 extent to which firms engage in internal R&D and by the breadth of formal
 R&D collaborations: both serve as an instrument to increase the
 effectiveness of R&D outsourcing. Copyright (c) 2010 ZEW Centre for European Economic Research. Journal of Management Studies (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: The Strategic Nexus of Offshoring and Outsourcing Decisions 
Abstract:
 One important effect of the increasing integration of the world economy is
 the rising importance of possibilities to offshore and outsource
 value-creating activities. In many industries, firms are able to
 disaggregate their value chains into smaller parts. This process allows
 for a less path-dependent approach to the firm's ideal location profile
 (through offshoring and relocation) and control strategies (through
 outsourcing). This article argues that optimal decisions regarding
 individual processes recognize the linkages of these processes with the
 firm's entire value chain. The article explores the magnitude, sequence,
 and dynamics of interdependent decisions regarding the location and
 control of various parts of the value chain. By using case illustrations
 from the mobile handset and financial services industries, this article
 provides a novel perspective on the disintegration, mobility, and
 reintegration of value chain activities in a global context. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal of Management Studies (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Factors Determining Offshore Location Choice for R&D Projects: A Comparative Study of Developed and Emerging Regions 
Abstract:
 This paper examines empirically the determinants of offshore location
 choice between country clusters. Based on a dataset of 1722 R&D projects
 by MNEs located in developed and emerging countries, we examine the impact
 of home and host country, industry, and firm level variables on choice of
 location. We draw on the extended OLI paradigm to develop our hypotheses.
 Using the EU15 as a base group, a multinomial logit model is estimated
 between the regions of USA&Canada, Eastern Europe&Russia, emerging
 countries of Asia, and India&China. At the regional level, findings show
 that the R&D wage difference and knowledge infrastructure difference
 between home and host countries, the science and engineering talent pool
 size, and political risk level of host countries are important determining
 factors. At the firm level, experience of overseas R&D projects and prior
 experience of research in the host country are found to be important
 location determinants. A distinguishing feature of the paper is that we
 examine regions in relation to a base region, and then further examine the
 impact of a marginal change in independent variables on the likelihood of
 the choice of a region for new offshore R&D projects. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal of Management Studies (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Title: Strategic Orientations, Knowledge Acquisition, and Firm Performance: The Perspective of the Vendor in Cross-Border Outsourcing 
Abstract:
 From the perspective of the vendors in emerging countries (VECs), this
 article investigates how the vendor firms in China respond to cross-border
 outsourcing trends differently by examining the different effects of
 entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and market orientation (MO), as well as
 their interaction, on local vendors' acquisition of knowledge from foreign
 outsourcers in cross-border outsourcing. We find that the knowledge
 acquisition of the vendors positively affects firm performance. Thus, the
 vendors need to correctly choose their strategic orientation to improve
 the knowledge acquisitions. Our results show the EO of the vendors has a
 positive effect on the knowledge acquisition, but the relationship between
 MO and the knowledge acquisition is an inverted U-shape. Further, the
 interactive effect between EO and MO on the knowledge acquisition is
 positive. All these findings extend the literature in organizational
 learning and cross-border outsourcing, and suggest that VECs should not
 only correctly choose their strategic orientation, but also pay more
 attention to the orientation interaction in acquiring knowledge from their
 partners through cross-border outsourcing so that they can more
 efficiently improve their performance. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal of Management Studies (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.
