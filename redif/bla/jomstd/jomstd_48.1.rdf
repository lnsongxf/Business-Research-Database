Title: A Tale of Passion: Linking Job Passion and Cognitive Engagement to Employee Work Performance
File-URL: http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/j.1467-6486.2009.00878.x
Abstract: 
 We propose a model of job passion that links two types of passion,
 harmonious and obsessive passion, to employees' work performance, via the
 mediating mechanism of cognitive engagement (comprising attention and
 absorption). Results from a survey conducted with 509 employees from an
 insurance firm indicate that employees with harmonious passion performed
 better at work, and that this relationship was mediated primarily by
 cognitive absorption, that is, the intensity of focus and immersion
 experienced by the employees when working. However, even though obsessive
 passion was negatively related to cognitive attention (i.e. the amount of
 cognitive resources spent thinking about work), it did not have a
 significant relationship to work performance overall. We identify and
 discuss research and practical implications for job passion and
 performance management.

Title: Organic and Acquisitive Growth: Re‐examining, Testing and Extending Penrose's Growth Theory
File-URL: http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/j.1467-6486.2009.00879.x
Abstract: 
 Edith Penrose's theory of firm growth postulates that a firm's current
 growth rate will be influenced by the adjustment costs of, and changes to
 a firm's productive opportunity set arising from, previous growth.
 Although she explicitly considered the effect of previous organic growth
 on current organic growth, she was largely silent about the effect of
 previous acquisitive growth. In this paper we extend Penrose's work to
 examine how previous rates of organic and acquisitive growth influence
 current organic growth. Employing a panel of Swedish firms over a 10-year
 period, our results suggest the following. First, previous organic growth
 acts as a constraint on current organic growth. Second, previous
 acquisitive growth has a positive effect on current organic growth. We
 conclude that organic growth and acquisitive growth constitute two
 distinct strategic options facing the firm, which have a differential
 impact on the future organic growth of the firm.

Title: Assessing Cumulative Evidence within ‘Macro’ Research: Why Meta‐Analysis Should be Preferred Over Vote Counting
File-URL: http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/j.1467-6486.2009.00899.x
Abstract: 
 Understanding the conclusions a body of evidence offers involves
 accumulating findings. Two recent articles used vote counting to assess
 the evidence related to important macro theories: transaction cost theory
 and resource-based theory. Each concluded that its focal theory is not
 well supported. In contrast, recent meta‐analyses of the same theories
 concluded that both are strongly supported. We explain why macro
 researchers should trust the findings of meta‐analyses but not those of
 vote counts. A direct implication is that researchers interested in
 advancing transaction cost and resource‐based theories need to build upon
 the meta‐analytic evidence. A broader implication is that, as the
 preferred method for accumulating evidence, meta‐analysis can be a
 catalyst for the re‐evaluation of established theories and the development
 of new theory.

Title: Governance Mechanisms for the Promotion of Social Capital for Knowledge Transfer in Multinational Corporations
File-URL: http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/j.1467-6486.2009.00910.x
Abstract: 
 The aim of this paper is to extend social capital approaches to knowledge
 transfer by identifying governance mechanisms that managers can deploy to
 promote the development of social capital. In order to achieve this
 objective, insights from the micro-level, knowledge governance approach
 are combined with theory on the determinants of social capital. Three
 governance mechanisms are identified: market‐based mechanisms,
 hierarchical mechanisms, and social mechanisms. The findings, based on
 data from two Danish MNCs, indicate that although the use of social
 governance mechanisms promotes positive assessment of social capital,
 hierarchical governance mechanisms constrain its development. The
 application of market‐based governance mechanisms has no significant
 effect. In addition, the findings provide evidence that social capital has
 a positive impact on knowledge transfer.

Title: Top Management Team Functional Diversity and Firm Performance: The Moderating Role of CEO Characteristics
File-URL: http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00932.x
Abstract: 
 Past research indicates that the effect of TMT functional diversity on
 firm performance is equivocal. We address this issue by focusing on the
 integrative role of the CEO, postulating that the CEO's expertise and
 background characteristics affect the TMT functional diversity–firm
 performance relationship, because of their impact on the exchange and
 integration of distributed knowledge within the TMT. Using a dataset of 33
 Dutch and Belgian Information Technology firms we investigate the
 moderating role of three sets of CEO characteristics (functional
 background, status as founder, and shared experience with the other TMT
 members) on the relationship between TMT functional diversity and firm
 performance. Our results reveal that CEO and TMT characteristics do
 interact in realizing the potential advantages of distributed TMT
 functional expertise.

Title: Effects of Anonymous Whistle‐Blowing and Perceived Reputation Threats on Investigations of Whistle‐Blowing Allegations by Audit Committee Members
File-URL: http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00934.x
Abstract: 
 A total of 83 experienced audit committee members participated in an
 experiment in which they evaluated the credibility of and allocated
 investigative resources towards a whistle-blowing allegation of financial
 reporting malfeasance by corporate executive officers. We manipulated
 whether the whistle‐blowing allegation was made through anonymous or
 non‐anonymous channels and whether the allegation posed a relatively high
 or low threat to the personal reputation of the audit committee member who
 was charged with investigating the allegation. Results indicate that the
 participating audit committee members attributed lower credibility and
 allocated fewer investigatory resources when the whistle‐blowing report
 was received through an anonymous versus non‐anonymous channel, and when
 the allegation posed a relatively high versus low level of reputation
 threat. While the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 requires audit committees of
 publicly traded firms to provide an anonymous whistle‐blowing channel to
 employees, our findings suggest disturbing unintended consequences of such
 regulation; specifically, audit committee members might fail to
 sufficiently investigate whistle‐blowing allegations received through
 anonymous whistle‐blowing channels, particularly if the allegation poses a
 personal reputation threat.

Title: Virtual Design, Problem Framing, and Innovation: An Empirical Study in the Automotive Industry
File-URL: http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00939.x
Abstract: 
 This paper studies how problem framing by research and development groups,
 in particular the extent of problem decomposition, impacts knowledge
 replication processes conducted through the use of virtual simulation
 tools (VSTs). It presents the results of a comparative study of two
 research and development groups working on the design of hybrid propulsion
 systems. The research contributes to the literature on strategy and
 innovation in four ways. First, we identify three organizational and
 strategic factors affecting the problem framing decision. Second, we
 analyse the impact of problem framing on the use of VSTs and the related
 effect on knowledge replication processes. Third, we show the emergence of
 a new VST-driven knowledge replication process, i.e. functional
 replication. Fourth, we explain how VST‐driven knowledge replication
 processes can attenuate the dangers related to the adoption of modular
 design strategies and address the replication vs. imitation dilemma.

Title: Ethnography, Reality, and Truth: The Vital Need for Studies of ‘How Things Work’ in Organizations and Management
File-URL: http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00979.x
Abstract: 
 There is considerable potential for ethnography to play a larger and more
 mainstream role in organization and management studies. Ethnography is not
 a research method. It is a way of writing about and analysing social life
 which has roots in both the sciences and the humanities. Whilst it
 prioritizes close and intensive observation in the gathering of
 information and insights, it may additionally and potentially use any of
 the full range of other research methods. A powerful rationale for ‘good’
 ethnographic work is offered by Pragmatist Realist principles of truth,
 reality, and relevance-to‐practice. Research based on these principles
 investigates the realities of ‘how things work’ in organizations. In doing
 this, it rigorously grounds and contextualizes the activities which the
 researcher observes and the accounts which they receive from
 organizational members. To do this well, researchers must avoid being
 diverted from the analysis of organizational patterns and managerial
 processes by researchers trying to ‘get into the heads’ of organizational
 members in order to capture their subjective experiences. Various moves
 can be identified which would encourage and enable more people to work
 ethnographically and to produce research which is inherently critical and
 is unfettered by attachment to any narrow specialist method, concept or
 ‘perspective’.

Title: Ethnography as Work: Some Rules of Engagement
File-URL: http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00980.x
Abstract: 
 Ethnography is both a methodological approach to and an analytic
 perspective on social research. It has a long history and pedigree in
 organization and management studies and well beyond. Perhaps the most
 distinctive features of ethnography are its pragmatic orientations and its
 written products. As a way of responding to Tony Watson's essay, I look at
 three constitutive (and overlapping) tasks – fieldwork, headwork, and
 textwork – as a way to sketch out a few craft-like rules for ‘how things
 work’ within ethnographic circles. This is an enlargement of Tony's
 argument rather than a challenge. I conclude however with remarks on two
 areas (i.e. the native's point of view and the peripheral position of
 ethnography) where Tony and I seem to differ.
